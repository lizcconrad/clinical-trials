  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The progressive rising of multimorbidity, which has been always considered the hallmark of
      clinical complexity (CC), has made management of the &quot;complex&quot; patient one of the most
      topical and challenging issues in medicine. However, patient-related factors (multimorbidity,
      age, frailty, disease severity) pertain only to the biological complexity, while CC is the
      result of the dynamic interaction between biological complexity and a number of other
      coexisting factors (socio-economic, cultural, behavioural, environmental). Starting from
      these premises, the investigators designed a five-year observational prospective longitudinal
      study that aims to validate and compare a CC score system on a large cohort of patients
      (n=1000) admitted in internal medicine wards. Clinicians, biostatisticians and
      epidemiologists will cooperate into the project. A questionnaire that encompasses the main
      biological and extra-biological factors was designed (Clinical Complexity Index, CCI) by a
      multiprofessional consensus. This questionnaire will be administered by the investigators to
      the patients and validated. Consecutive patients will be enrolled every other week for two
      years and followed-up for 5 years. The primary endpoint will be the validation of the CCI.
      Thereafter, the investigators will evaluate the correlation between the CCI and the length of
      stay of the index hospitalization, assuming that a higher CCI score is associated with longer
      length of stay. The secondary endpoints will be the demonstration of the association between
      higher CCI score and more health resources utilization (i.e., evaluating occurrence of
      hospital readmissions, number of accesses to the emergency room, visits at the outpatient
      clinic, different drugs prescribed and hospital reimbursement according to the local
      diagnosis-related group [DRG] system) along with worse prognosis (mortality at 1 and 5
      years).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Clinical Complexity Index (CCI) that will be validated is made of 25 different variables,
      divided into 5 domains (biological, socioeconomic, behavioral, environmental, cultural). All
      variables were dichotomised and were coded -1 (absence of the variable) and +1 (presence of
      the variable). For each variable, the answer &quot;yes&quot; increases the degree of complexity. See
      Citations for further details.

      Here is the CCI that will be used in the study:

      BIOLOGICAL DOMAIN Age &gt; 75 years yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Intake ≥ 5 medications yes☐ +1 no☐ -1
      Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) &gt; 3 and/or CIRS severity &gt;3 yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 ↑ frailty
      (Edmonton Frail Scale &gt; 5) yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      ↓ mobilization (Barthel&lt;60) yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      SOCIO-ECONOMIC DOMAIN Living alone yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Income &lt; 1000 €/month yes☐ +1 no☐ -1
      Unemployment/precarious work yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Dependent/disabled family member yes☐ +1 no☐ -1
      Need for a caregiver yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      BEHAVIOURAL DOMAIN Inadequate adherence to medications yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Active smoking of at
      least 4 cigarettes/day yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Alcohol (&gt;3 Alcohol Units/day) and/or drug abuse yes☐
      +1 no☐ -1 Inappropriate diet yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Cognitive impairment (Short Blessed Test &gt; 9)
      yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      ENVIRONMENTAL DOMAIN Institutionalization yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Difficult access to healthcare yes☐
      +1 no☐ -1 Presence of home architectural barriers yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Occupational exposure to
      toxins yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Air pollution yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      CULTURAL DOMAIN Schooling &lt; 8 years yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Insufficient access to information yes☐ +1
      no☐ -1 Lack of adherence to health screening programs yes☐ +1 no☐ -1 Language barriers yes☐
      +1 no☐ -1 Perceived discrimination yes☐ +1 no☐ -1

      The investigators will administer the CCI to all patients admitted to the wards (Internal
      Medicine and Subacute ward), according the study protocol. All the enrolled patients will be
      followed-up with a phone call after after discharge (at 4-8-12 months) for collecting the
      following data: occurrence of hospital readmission within 1 month after discharge; the number
      of readmissions; the number of accesses to the emergency room (ER); the number of visits at
      the outpatient clinic; the number of different drugs prescribed; mortality. Mortality will
      also be assessed once a year for 5 years.

    <description>Validation of the Clinical Complexity Index (CCI) proposed in the project (see first Citation and Study Description for further details). This index should measure patients' clinical complexity, including biological, socioeconomic, cultural, behavioral, and envirnomental domains. The total score range is -25 to +25 (-5 to +5 per each domain). The investigators expect that a higher value is associated with a worse outcome (higher clinical complexity).</description>
