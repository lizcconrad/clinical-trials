  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the accuracy of the novel SAIL
      technique compared to the classic intercristal line technique in estimating the L4-L5
      interspace for labor epidural or spinal anesthesia placement. The investigators hypothesize
      that the SAIL technique will be more accurate in successfully locating the L4-L5 interspace
      in pregnant women than the classic intercristal line technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard technique aiming at identifying the L4-L5 intervertebral space as a
      reference point before performing a neuraxial block relies on the correct clinical estimation
      of the intercristal line. The classic intercristal line technique uses an imaginary line that
      intersects the iliac crests to determine a safe puncture level to access. In pregnant women,
      the classic technique fails to identify the safe puncture level 40 % of the time.

      The newly proposed Sacral Anatomical Interspace Landmark (SAIL) technique consists of using
      the sacral bone to determine a safe puncture level to access.

      Lumbar ultrasound will determine the accuracy of each clinical technique in identifying the
      L4-L5 interspace (target).

    <masking_description>The estimation marks from each technique (two total) will be on the back of the patient (one on the left flank, one on the right flank), therefore the patient does not know where the marks are. Additionally, each mark will be covered with a taped on gauze pad to conceal it so that the two investigators are blinded to each others assessment. The ultrasound clinician will be masked to the two estimations. The marks will still remain covered while the interspace is determined by the third assessor using lumbar ultrasound.</masking_description>

    <intervention_name>Classic Intercristal Line Technique</intervention_name>
    <description>Researcher will use the classic technique to estimate the L4-L5 interspace. The classic technique begins by palpating both the right and left posterior iliac crests and following the imaginary line that intersects each (intercristal line) with the non-dominant hand to the spine where it is estimated to intersect the L4 spinous process or L4-L5 interspace. A marker pen will mark an &quot;X&quot; lateral to the estimation, opposite side from the estimation of the other technique.</description>

    <description>Researcher will use the novel technique to estimate the L4-L5 interspace. The SAIL technique begins by palpating the sacrum and the researcher sliding the non-dominant hand up the dorsal surface of the sacrum to the first interspace (L5-S1) and then up one more interspace to estimate the L4-L5 interspace. A marker pen will mark an &quot;X&quot; lateral to the estimation, opposite side from the estimation of the other technique.</description>
