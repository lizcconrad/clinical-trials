      STUDY SUMMARY

      Study Duration: Accrual will take place over the course of 16 months. Patients will be
      treated until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression (expected on average for 6 months)
      and then followed for one year thereafter.

      Objectives: Phase I: To determine the the recommended phase II dose of eribulin in
      combination with Durvalumab

      This study will evaluate the recommended Phase 2 combination dose (RP2D) of eribulin with
      durvalumab. If two or more out of 6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at
      dose level I or II, the dose level below that level will be considered the RP2D. If all 3
      patients enter dose level-I and experience DLT, the study will be terminated. If the highest
      level has been reached and &lt; 33% of patients have experienced DLT, that will be considered
      the RP2D.

    <time_frame>42 days</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT is defined as a ≥ Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related adverse event (using NCI CTCAE Version 4.03) that occurs during the DLT evaluation period. Toxicity that is clearly and directly related to the primary disease or to another etiology is excluded from this definition.</description>

    <measure>Number of Adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events associated with eribulin when administered in combination with durvalumab will be described according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) by system organ classes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate (ORR) is measured as the proportion of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response (CR, PR) according to Immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (irRECIST) criteria. irCR, complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable lesions. Lymph nodes must decrease to &lt; 10 mm in short axis. Confirmation of response is not mandatory. irPR, decrease of ≥ 30% in TMTB relative to baseline, non-target lesions are irNN, and no unequivocal progression of new non-measurable lesions.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is measured from the start of first treatment until death due to any cause. Patients without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date last known to be alive.</description>
