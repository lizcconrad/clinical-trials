      The primary objective of this Expanded Access Program is to provide idebenone as a treatment
      for eligible participants with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy before it is commercially
      available in the United States (U.S.) for the indication of DMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of DMD (severe dystrophinopathy) and clinical features consistent
             of typical DMD at diagnosis (i.e., documented delayed motor skills and muscle weakness
             by age 5 years) and who in the opinion of the Treating physician would benefit from
             treatment with idebenone. DMD should be confirmed by mutation analysis in the
             dystrophin gene or by substantially reduced levels of dystrophin protein (i.e., absent
             or &lt;5% of normal) on Western blot or immunostaining.

          -  Minimum 10 years old at Prescreening.

          -  PEF or FVC â‰¤80% and &gt;25% of predicted value based on most recent assessment noted in
             the patient's medical record and subsequently confirmed at the Enrollment Visit.

          -  Able to understand program requirements and swallow program medication.

          -  Signed and dated Informed Consent Form (to be obtained at the Enrollment Visit from
             patient or parent/legal guardian (if applicable) prior to performing any
             program-specific procedures and dispensing idebenone to the patient).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible for and able to participate in an ongoing clinical trial of idebenone.

          -  Is at high-risk of a fatal outcome from lung infection and/or advanced cardiomyopathy
             in the opinion of the Treating physician.

          -  Known moderate or severe impairment of hepatic function or severe impairment of renal
             function.

          -  Prior or ongoing medical condition or laboratory abnormality which in the Treating
             physician's opinion may put the patient at significant risk or may interfere
             significantly with the patient's participation in the program.

          -  Abuse of drugs or alcohol, which in Treating physician's opinion would interfere with
             the compliance to treatment.

          -  Known individual hypersensitivity to idebenone or to any of the ingredients/excipients
             of the program medication.
