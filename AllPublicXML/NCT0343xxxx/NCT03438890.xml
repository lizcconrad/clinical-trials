  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare three popular methods of minimizing or reducing
      laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF) by heating lens using warm saline, applying anti-fog agent to
      lens, and rubbing lens with chlorhexidine in laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The physiology behind laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF) is well understood based on meticulous
      experiments outlining the role of temperature and humidity. Despite many efforts, including
      uses of warm saline, various anti-fog agents, chlorhexidine, betadine, and rubbing the lens
      on serosal surfaces, to reduce LLF, there remains no consensus as to which method is superior
      to prevent LLF. Furthermore, most previous studies were experimental trials conducted in a
      simulation model or a non-human in vivo model or an expert's commentary based on their
      clinical experiences , and there was no randomized controlled trial focusing LLF in human
      model. Therefore, this randomized trial aimed to compare three popular methods of minimizing
      or reducing LLF by heating lens using warm saline, applying anti-fog agent to lens, and
      rubbing lens with chlorhexidine in laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In subjects allocated to the warm saline group, a thermos flask, which was filled with heated sterile water, was used. A 1000 ml bottle of sterile water was heated to 60 ˚C in a stove for an hour at minimum. Just before introducing into the abdominal cavity, the laparoscope was placed into the thermos flask for 30 seconds at minimum . After each incidence of laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF), the scope was briefly inserted into the thermos flask about 10 seconds, and was then wrapped gauze around the lens before abdominal reinsertion.</description>

    <description>In the anti-fog agent group, Ultra-Stop TM (Sigmaphrarm, Vienna, Austria), which is a commercial anti-fogging solution containing alcohol, surfactant, and water for medical optical devices, was used. Wiping the lens with gauze soaked in Ultra-Stop TM and allowing the surfactant to act for 5 seconds, the laparoscope was introduced into the abdominal cavity. After each laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF), the scope was removed from the abdomen and cleaned using the same corresponding method.</description>

    <description>In the chlorhexidine group, the lens was wiped with gauze soaked in 4% chlorhexidine detergent solution (Firson, Cheonan, Korea) for 5 seconds before introducing into the abdominal cavity, and chlorhexidine was reapplied on the lens at the occurrence of laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF).</description>

    <description>In the control group, the lens was not wiped gauze or applied any solution before use of the laparoscope. When occurred the event of each laparoscopic lens fogging (LLF) that splatter of irrigation fluid, blood, and body fluids affected visual clearance, the laparoscopic lens was manually rubbed with clean gauze by a scrub nurse.</description>
