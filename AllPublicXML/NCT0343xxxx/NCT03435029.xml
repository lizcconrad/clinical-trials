  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of a comprehensive cognitive
      remediation program (REHACOP) in the non demented elderly, obtaining improvements in
      cognition and functional skills. It was a longitudinal randomized controlled trial with three
      assessments: basal, post-treatment, and 12-month follow-up.

      Recruitment and enrollment were conducted between September 2012 and November 2016. All
      participants underwent a clinical interview and an extensive neuropsychological battery.
      Patients were randomized in an experimental and a control group. The groups were formed by a
      maximum of eight participants run by an experienced therapist. The experimental group
      received cognitive remediation for 3 months, 3 times per week 60 minutes per session. The
      control group consisted of occupational group activities (reading the newspaper, drawing,
      singing or doing crafts) with the same frequency as the experimental group. Post-treatment
      assessment was carried out within the first week after completing the intervention. Finally,
      longitudinal follow-up at 12 months with neuropsychological assessments will be performed.

      Objective: To examine the efficacy of a comprehensive cognitive training program (REHACOP) to
      improve cognition, clinical symptoms and functional disability for the elderly.

           measure the cognitive reserve and includes questions about education/culture, working
           activity, leisure and hobbies, physical activities and social activities. Maximum score
           of 26 points with higher scores indicating greater cognitive reserve.

      Cognitive status was tested by the following tests:

        -  Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) determine cognitive status in five categories
           (orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language). Maximum
           score of 20 points with higher scores indicating greater performance.

        -  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) determine cognitive status in nine categories
           (visuospatial, executive functioning, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction,
           delayed recall and orientation). Maximum score of 30 points with higher scores
           indicating greater performance.

      Neurocognitive status was tested by the following tests. Some measures were adjusted so that
      higher scores indicated better cognitive performance. All raw scores were converted to
      z-scores. The z-scores were pooled into composite.

        -  The Brief Test of Attention (BTA) consists of two parallel forms, numbers and letters,
           in which the same 10 sequences of random digits and characters were auditory presented
           at the rate of one stimulus per second. Maximum score of 20 points, 10 points per
           parallel form. Higher scores indicate greater performance in attention.

        -  Digit Span Test (WAIS-III). Forward Digits is composed with sixteen series of numbers
           which have to be repeated in the same order. Maximum score of 16 points with higher
           scores indicating greater performance. Backward Digits includes sixteen series of
           numbers have to be repeated backwards. Maximum score of 14 points with higher scores

           subscales (everyday productivity, interests, taking initiative, novelty
           seeking/motivation, emotional responses, concern, social life, and self-awareness).
           These subscales are summed into a total score with a possible range from -36 to 36
           points. Lower scores indicate a higher degree of apathy.

        -  Fatigue: Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is composed by 20 items divided into 5
           subscales (general index, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, lack of motivation, lack of
           activity). Higher scores indicate greater fatigue (range from 0 to 140 points).

      Quality of life was calculated through the following test. All raw scores were converted to
      z-scores.

        -  Life Satisfaction: Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). This scale is composed by 5
           items. Higher scores indicate greater live satisfaction (range from 0 to 35 points).

      Subjective complains were calculated through the following test. All raw scores were
      converted to z-scores.

        -  Subjective complains were assessed by Subjective Questionnaire on Cognitive and
           Functional Complains of the patient and caregivers. These questionnaires are composed by
           40 items each one of them. Higher scores indicate greater subjective complains (range
           from 0 to 120 points).

             -  Description of the intervention

      REHACOP is a comprehensive cognitive remediation program structured in cognitive domains and
      three levels of difficulty. It is theoretically based on strategies of cognitive
      rehabilitation (restoration, compensation and optimization). REHACOP uses mainly a bottom-up
      approach in such a way that it begins with the simplest cognitive domains and ends with the
      most complex domains and top-down strategies to help with generalization of abilities in
      daily life. It contains more than 300 paper and pencil tasks, hierarchically structured in 4
      modules of cognition (attention and concentration, learning and memory, language and
      executive functioning), 3 modules of functionality (social cognition, social skills and
      activities of daily living) and a module of psychoeducation. In this study we used a modified
      version of REHACOP for the elderly. The REHACOP group received cognitive remediation sessions
      3 times per week for 3 months 60 minutes per session. The remediation sessions were performed
      in the actual homes for the elderly. The groups were made up of a maximum of 8 participants.
      In particular, the rehabilitation of the REHACOP group consisted of 39 sessions divided into:
      attention and concentration unit (sustained, selective, alternating, and divided attention) 4
      weeks; learning and memory unit (verbal and visual memory and learning strategies) 3 weeks;
      language (verbal fluency, syntax, grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension) 3 weeks; executive
      functioning (objectives planning and attainment, verbal reasoning, categorization, and
      conceptualization) and processing speed were trained transversely during the sessions. This
      study did not apply the remaining modules (social cognition, social skills, daily living
      activities and psychoeducation).
