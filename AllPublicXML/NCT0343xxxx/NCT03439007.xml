    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out which of the variables related to fluid
      responsiveness (e. g., perfusion index [PI], pleth variability index [PVI], pulse oximetry
      plethysmographic variance [Î”POP]) can best predict hypotension during induction of
      anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      Propofol is a widely used intravenous agent for induction of anesthesia in children aged 3
      years and more. A well-known adverse effect of propofol is hypotension, which can be properly
      dealt with hydration and/or administration of inotropics and vasopressors. However, severe
      hypotension during anesthetic induction may not be immediately cured if anesthesiologist
      should concentrate on ventilation of the patient. Since pediatric patients have smaller
      reservoir for oxygen supply and perfusion to various organs of the body, delayed handling of
      severe hypotension may result in irreversible damage to the vital organs.

      Hypotension during anesthesia is caused, though not entirely, by dehydration. There are a
      variety of non-invasive variables that are related to the severity of dehydration, but which
      of the variables can best predict anesthesia-induced hypotension in pediatric patients. In
      this study, we will measure the preoperative values of non-invasive variables related to
      fluid status, and find out which of them are most closely related to the occurrence of
      hypotension during anesthesia induction.
