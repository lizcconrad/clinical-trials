    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority, multi-center, randomized, controlled, single-blind, two-way
      crossover efficacy and safety study in subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The study
      involves two daytime clinical research center (CRC) visits with random assignment to receive
      G-Pen™ glucagon 1 mg during one period and Lilly Glucagon 1 mg during the other. Each daytime
      visit is preceded by an overnight stay in the CRC. In the morning of the inpatient study
      visit, the subject is brought into a state of hypoglycemia through IV administration of
      regular insulin diluted in normal saline. After a hypoglycemic state with plasma glucose &lt; 50
      mg/dL is verified, the subject is administered a dose of G-Pen or Lilly Glucagon via
      subcutaneous injection. Plasma glucose levels are monitored for up to 180 minutes
      post-dosing, with a value of &gt;70.0 mg/dL within 30 minutes of glucagon administration
      indicating a positive response. After 3 hours, the subject is given a meal and discharged
      when medically stable. After a wash-out period of 7 to 28 days, subjects return to the CRC,
      and the procedure are repeated with each subject crossed over to the other treatment. A
      follow-up visit as a safety check is conducted 2-7 days following administration of the final
      dose of study drug.
