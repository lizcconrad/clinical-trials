    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well osimertinib works in treating participants with stage
      I-IIIA Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) -mutant non-small cell lung cancer before
      surgery. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking mutant EGFR signaling in
      cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of osimertinib as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with surgically
      resectable EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of osimertinib given as neoadjuvant therapy in early stage
      EGFR-mutant NSCLC participants.

      II. To evaluate whether neoadjuvant osimertinib treatment increases the frequency of tumors
      that are unresectable due to adverse events or disease progression.

      III. To evaluate secondary measures of clinical efficacy in early stage EGFR-mutant NSCLC
      patients treated with osimertinib induction therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate long-term measures of efficacy in patients treated with osimertinib
      neoadjuvant therapy.

      II. To explore tissue and cell-free biomarkers that may be predictive of response or primary
      resistance to osimertinib neoadjuvant therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients then undergo surgical resection of their cancer.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.

                    -  Women under 50 years old will be considered postmenopausal if they have been
                       amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                       treatments and with luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone

               -  Unacceptable Contraception Methods The following methods are considered not to be
                  highly effective and are therefore not acceptable contraceptive methods:

                    -  Triphasic combined oral contraceptives
