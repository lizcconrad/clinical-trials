  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) in Phase 1 of the study and to provide a preliminary
      evaluation of the clinical activity of TAK-079 monotherapy in participants with r/r MM in
      Phase 2a of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-079. TAK-079 is being tested to treat
      people who have r/r MM. This study will assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of TAK-079 monotherapy and will provide a preliminary
      assessment of its activity against MM. The study is designed to consist of 2 phases: Phase 1
      and Phase 2a.

      The study will enroll approximately 42 participants. The study population of Phase 1 will
      consist of approximately 24 participants. Participants in Phase 1 will be assigned to TAK-079
      and dose-escalation will range from 45 mg to 1800 mg.

      In Phase 1, participants will receive premedications 1 to 3 hours prior to the administration
      of TAK-079 on each dosing day, as follows:

        -  Dexamethasone 20 mg

        -  Acetaminophen 650 to 1000 mg

        -  Diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg

        -  Montelukast 10 mg

      The study population of Phase 2a will consist of approximately 18 participants. Dose and
      premedications for Phase 2a will be based upon review of the available safety, efficacy,
      pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data from the preceding cohorts of Phase 1.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 48 months (4 years). In Phase 1, participants who stop treatment
      for any other reason other than PD will continue to have progression-free survival (PFS)
      follow-up at the site every 4 weeks from the last dose of study drug up to 12 months or until
      PD, death, loss to follow-up, consent withdrawal or study termination. Participants will be
      followed 30 days after last dose of study drug or until the start of subsequent alternative
      anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first, for a follow up assessment.
