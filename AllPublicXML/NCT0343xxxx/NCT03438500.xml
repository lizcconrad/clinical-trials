    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility of Cardiac Shock Wave Treatment in
      patients with anginal chest pain and evidence of abnormal myocardial perfusion under stress
      in the absence of significant stenoses of the epicardial coronary arteries.

      This is a mono-center, prospective, single arm, pilot study designed to assess the
      feasibility of the &quot;Cardiac Shock Wave Treatment&quot; in patients with anginal chest pain and
      evidence of abnormal myocardial perfusion under stress in the absence of significant stenoses
      of the epicardial coronary arteries.

      A total of 10 subjects will be enrolled in the study. All enrolled study subjects will be
      assessed for clinical follow-up at the following intervals: 5 and 14 weeks post CSWT
      procedure.
