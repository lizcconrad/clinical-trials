    <textblock>
      A single-center, prospective, non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the truSculpt
      Radiofrequency Device for non-invasive fat reduction in abdominal tissue for up to 14
      subjects. Measurement will be histological evaluation of tissue for selective fat necrosis,
      with sparing of the dermis and epidermis, following truSculpt treatment vs. untreated
      contralateral control.
