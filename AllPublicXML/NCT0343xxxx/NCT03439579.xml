  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to test a remotely delivered, standalone behavioral weight loss
      intervention designed to help adults initiate the important dietary, physical activity (PA)
      and behavioral changes necessary to achieve weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Weight Management Center currently offers a remotely delivered (smart phone, tablet,
      computer) program to assist patients with maintaining weight losses already achieved, which
      includes multi-channel self-monitoring and asynchronous individually recorded feedback from
      clinical staff. The goal of the presently proposed project is to build on this existing
      maintenance-focused program to create a remotely delivered, standalone behavioral weight loss
      intervention designed to help participants initiate the important dietary, physical activity
      (PA) and behavioral changes necessary to achieve weight loss. We recently developed the Home
      Weight Loss (HWL) program by repackaging existing clinical educational materials as
      instructional lifestyle change modules to be delivered remotely for participant weight loss

      The aim of the proposed project are to pilot test the effects of the HWL program among a
      sample of overweight and obese adults (N=30). The digital platform currently used in the
      maintenance program will be used for the HWL program

    <description>use of the Eating Behavior Inventory (EBI). This is a validated 26-item scale assessing eating and weight control behaviors. Subjects indicate agreement with statements with reponse options ranging in values from 1 (never or hardly ever) to 5 (always or almost). Higher values are indicative of those most associated with weight loss (e.g., self-monitoring caloric intake) and are therefore associated with better weight loss outcomes following behavioral weight management intervention.</description>

Higher scores indicate less favorable outcomes, as higher scores indicate increased patient susceptibility to food in the environment.</description>
