  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose a pilot clinical trial lasting 12 weeks of digoxin in patients with hypoxic
      response-related erythrocytosis. The complete blood count, safety, symptoms of headache and
      lack of energy, echocardiogram, physical performance, and plasma products blood cell
      expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1-regulated genes are the outcome variables. The
      enrolled patients will receive standard of care at the provider's and institutional
      preference. The patients will be studied at baseline, at two and four weeks and then at
      four-week intervals during treatment with digoxin.

      (c) Criteria for patient selection and for exclusion of patients and estimate of number of
      patients to be studied.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Diagnosis of congenital polycythemia due to an up-regulated hypoxic response, such as
           Chuvash polycythemia, other VHL mutations, EGLN1 (PHD2) mutations and EPAS1 (HIF-2Î±)
           gain-of-function mutations.

        2. Age of 18 years or older

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. End stage renal disease

        2. History of hypersensitivity, arrhythmia or severe gastrointestinal side effects related
           to digoxin therapy.

        3. First or second-degree AV block.

        4. Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome.

        5. Heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function: restrictive
           cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, amyloid heart disease, acute cor pulmonale,
           idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.

      Number of patients to be studied: 25

      (d) Design of the study. This is a phase 1 study in which all subjects will receive
      open-label digoxin. Comparisons will be made of the longitudinal observations made during
      therapy with digoxin over 12 weeks compared to the baseline measurements, medical history and
      health related quality of life.

      (e) Digoxin dosage and duration of individual patient exposure to the drug.

      Dose of digoxin. Study subjects will be given a standard dose of digoxin by mouth daily for
      12 weeks and will be evaluated at 4-week intervals. The initial dose will be selected based
      on the normogram in the figure below, with the goal of achieving a serum digoxin
      concentration of 0.8-2.0 ng/ml.1 A similar nomogram method to dose digoxin can be used to
      achieve a target level 0.5-0.9 ng/ml,2 a dose range recommended for heart failure patients.3
      However, we wish to maximize the inhibition of HIF-1 in congenital polycythemia patients
      without heart failure, and therefore a level of 0.8-2 ng/ml is acceptable and reasonable.

      Serum digoxin concentration. Serum digoxin levels will be performed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks.
      The digoxin trough serum concentrations will be obtained immediately prior to administration
      of the daily dose. The target trough serum digoxin concentration will be 0.8 to 2.0 ng/ml.
      The dose will be decreased according to a linear relationship between the digoxin dose and
      the trough levels if the serum concentration is &gt;0.2 ng/ml and it will be increased if the
      concentration is less than 0.8 ng/ml and there are no signs of toxicity.

      Monitoring for digoxin toxicity. The digoxin serum concentration will be measured sooner if
      subjects report possible digoxin toxicity such as new onset of anorexia, nausea, vomiting,
      confusion, or palpitations.

      Potential drug interactions. Additional serum digoxin levels will be obtained if potentially
      interacting drugs are initiated. Drugs that increase digoxin levels include
      potassium-depleting diuretics, calcium, quinidine, verapamil, amiodarone, propafenone,
      indomethacin, itraconazole, alprazolam, spironolactone, erythromycin, clarithromycin, other
      macrolide antibiotics, tetracycline, propantheline and diphenoxylate. Drugs that decrease
      digoxin levels include antacids, kaolin-pectin, sulfasalazine, neomycin, cholestyramine,
      certain anticancer drugs, metoclopramide, rifampin and thyroid.

      Laboratory investigations

      Plasma and serum measurements of the products of HIF-regulated genes:

      We will perform ELISA to measure plasma or serum levels of HIF-responsive proteins including
      but not limited to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble VEGF receptor 1
      (sVEGF-R1), endothelin-1, and erythropoietin.

      qRT PCR of HIF-regulated genes: The effect of digoxin on HIF-regulated gene expression will
      be profiled separately for platelets, granulocytes and reticulocytes. Expression levels of
      the HIF-regulated genes and endogenous control genes will be measured by qRT PCR, with
      baseline, 2 weeks and 12 weeks samples obtained after initiation of digoxin therapy.

      Statistical analysis

        1. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, NT-proBNP, weight, BMI, SBP, DBP, MAP,
           pulse pressure, pulse rate and oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry will be
           compared at baseline and weeks 4, 8 and 12 using repeated measures ANOVA.

        2. TRV, TPG, 6MW distance, phlebotomy requirements and plasma concentrations of the
           products of HIF-regulated genes will be compared between baseline and 12 weeks with the
           paired t test.

        3. Transcriptome. HIF-regulated gene expression levels will be normalized against each
           endogenous control for each cell type and relative gene expression levels at 2 and 12
           weeks will be assessed by comparing to baseline with paired t-test. Normalized gene
           expression levels across time will be analyzed using multilevel modeling, including
           growth curve modeling, to assess the expression changes over time, with age and gender
           being controlled.

           (g) Clinical procedures, laboratory tests, and other measures to monitor the effects of
           the drug in human subjects and to minimize risk.

           Clinical procedures and laboratory tests. The clinical procedures and laboratory tests
           are summarized in Table 1.

           Data Safety and Monitoring Board. Investigators Gordeuk and Prchal will serve as the
           Data and Safety Monitoring Board. They will have weekly teleconferences to review the
           safety reports of each subject involved in the study.

           Interim Analysis. There will be a formal interim analysis of the results at the end of
           each year of the study. The project manager/data coordinator and the biostatistician
           will work together to provide a comprehensive report for the DSMB.

           Adverse events. Patients will be monitored for potential side effects and toxicity of
           digoxin. Investigators should refer to the Safety Information section of the current
           Prescribing Information for digoxin for the expected side effects of digoxin. As with
           any agent, there is always the potential for unexpected adverse events (AEs).
           Therapeutic monitoring will be performed in a manner consistent with the local clinical
           standard of care. All concomitant medications will be recorded. Patients will be
           carefully monitored for AEs. This monitoring also includes clinical laboratory tests.
           Adverse events will be assessed in terms of their seriousness, intensity, and
           relationship to the study drug. AEs will be collected from the time of enrollment until
           the study visit at 30Â±2 days following discontinuation of the study drug.
