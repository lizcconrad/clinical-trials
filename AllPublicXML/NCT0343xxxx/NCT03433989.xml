    <textblock>
      In France The prevalence of Pregnancy Loss after 12 weeks of gestation is around 3%. This
      situation is probably associated to a risk of post-traumatic stress disorder.

      As a part of the medical staff midwives are often confronted with this situation, however
      they can have difficulties to identify short and long term effects of a post-traumatic stress
      disorders.

      The purpose of the present study is to estimate and analyze the prevalence of short-term (1
      month) post-traumatic stress disorder in women with pregnancy loss after 12 weeks of
      gestation.The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder will be tracked using the Impact of
      Event Scale-revisited and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaires.The
      diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder will also be clinically confirmed by a
      psychiatrist during a specific consultation.
