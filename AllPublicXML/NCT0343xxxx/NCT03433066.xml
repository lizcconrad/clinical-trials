    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to clinically and radiographically evaluate the efficacy of advanced
      platelet-rich fibrin (A-PRF) when used with biphasic alloplast in the management of intrabony
      defects in patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biphasic alloplasts have been successfully used in management of intrabony defects. Advanced
      platelet-rich fibrin is believed to contain higher amount of growth factors and white blood
      cells than the well known PRF. Although there are some studies on the use of PRF in the
      treatment of intrabony defects, to date none of them evaluate the effect of the A-PRF.
      Therefore, a randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare the healing of
      intrabony defects treated with A-PRF/biphasic alloplast combination and to those obtained
      with biphasic alloplast mixed with saline. Using a parallel arm design, 22 intrabony defects
      were randomly treated with either biphasic alloplast mixed with saline (control group) or
      with A-PRF/ biphasic alloplast combination (test group). The following clinical parameters
      were recorded at baseline, three and six months postoperatively : plaque index (PI), modified
      gingival index (MGI), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), while these
      radiographic measurements were recorded at baseline and six months postoperatively: bone fill
      and bone density.
