      Stereo-Re-Pro aims to provide further evidence of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) as a
      supplementary non-invasive curative treatment for local recurrence following radiotherapy.

      The objective of the first part of the trial (Phase I) is to select the recommended dose for
      salvage SBRT (either 5 x 6 Gy, 6 x 6 Gy, or 5 x 5 Gy) based on dose-limiting toxicity
      observed during the 18 weeks following the initiation of salvage-SBRT. Particular attention
      will be paid to the quality of life and tolerance of the treatment.

      The objective of the second part of the trial (phase II) is to estimate the efficacy of the
      salvage-SBRT in terms of biochemical relapse-free survival rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no standard local treatment exists for patients with an intraprostatic recurrence
      after radiotherapy. A number of treatments options exist including: radical prostatectomy,
      brachytherapy, HIFU, cryotherapy, and stereotactic radiotherapy. These treatments are
      associated with a variety of genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities and complications.
      In recent years, stereotactic radiotherapy has been used to treat localized prostate cancer
      in the primary setting but also as a salvage treatment after failure of radiotherapy. The
      initial results of these studies are promising, with respect to survival and tolerance, but
      further studies are required to confirm these initial results.

      The objective of STEREO-RE-PRO is to prospectively evaluate salvage SBRT for intraprostatic
      recurrent prostate cancer after primary external radiotherapy. This study will select
      patients for whom there is no standard local treatment.

      After inclusion and non-inclusion criteria have been verified and the patient has consented,
      the site will register the screening and organize the baseline visit with the placement of
      fiducial markers within two months before the planned start of SBRT.

      Once the fiducial placement has been performed and all eligibility criteria fully reviewed,
      the site will register the patient's participation so that the bio-statistician allocates the
      dose of SBRT. The dose will be allocated upon a model-based estimates provided by the
      statistical team and confirmed by the trial steering committee. Five or six fractions, at a
      level of 5 or 6 Gy per session (either 5 x 6 Gy, 6 x 6 Gy, or 5 x 5 Gy), will be delivered
      over a maximum of 12 days to provide a total dose of 25 to 36 Gy. During the treatment phase
      of the study, no study specific visits are scheduled and the patients will be followed as per
      standard of care.

      A follow-up visit is planned at 6, 10, 18 weeks from the start of SBRT for safety evaluation.
      Subsequent follow-up visits are planned at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months after the start
      of radiotherapy. Thereafter, yearly follow-up visits at 48, 60, and 72 months after starting
      SBRT will be planned after the initial 3-year follow-up period. M72 visit corresponds to the
      end of study visit.
