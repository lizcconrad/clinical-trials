    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1b study of CMP-001 administered IT and
      subcutaneously (SC) in combination with atezolizumab with or without low-level radiation
      therapy in subjects with advanced NSCLC. Each part of the study will follow a Simon 2-stage
      Optimal Design approach by enrolling 12 subjects in Stage 1 and continuing with enrollment of
      23 additional subjects in Stage 2 only if there are at least 2 out of 12 responders (complete
      and partial responders based on RECIST v1.1 criteria) in Stage 1.

      A safety run-in of 5 subjects treated with CMP-001 in combination with atezolizumab will be
      conducted in Part A only. After a 30 day dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period, the
      study will be conducted in two parts, run sequentially: Part A) Study of CMP-001 administered
      in combination with atezolizumab and; Part B) Study of CMP-001 administered in combination
      with atezolizumab preceded by low dose radiation therapy.

      If an acceptable safety profile is maintained, Part B of the study will commence after
      enrollment in Part A has ended, independent of the Part A response rate.

      Number of Subjects (planned):

      Part A

      A total of 5 subjects treated with at least one dose of CMP-001 and atezolizumab will be
      evaluated in the safety run-in period. Upon successful completion of the safety run-in
      period, an additional 7 subjects will be enrolled. If an acceptable safety profile is
      established and at least 2 responders out of 12 evaluable subjects are seen in Part A Stage
      1, the study will enroll an additional 23 evaluable subjects in Part A Stage 2.

      A maximum of 35 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Part A.

      Part B

      A total of 12 subjects will be enrolled in Part B Stage 1. If at least 2 responders out of
      the 12 evaluable subjects are seen in Part B Stage 1, the study will enroll an additional 23
      evaluable subjects in Part B Stage 2. If an acceptable safety profile is established and at
      least 2 responders out of 12 evaluable subjects are seen in Part B Stage 1, the study will
      enroll an additional 23 evaluable subjects in Part B Stage 2. A maximum of 35 evaluable
      subjects will be enrolled in Part B.

      Total enrollment for the study (Parts A and B) will not exceed 70 subjects.

      Schedule Dosage and mode of administration:

      This study will evaluate two routes of administration of CMP-001 in combination with
      atezolizumab, with and without low-level radiation therapy.

        -  Part A: CMP-001 will be administered SC once a week for 2 weeks (W1D1 &amp; W2D1), then IT
           once a week for 3 weeks (W3D1, W4D1, &amp; W5D1), followed by dosing every 3 weeks
           thereafter until discontinuation of treatment. The route of administration (i.e. IT or
           SC) for CMP-001 beyond Week 5 will be determined by the accessibility of the tumor(s).

        -  Part B: CMP-001 will be administered SC once a week for 2 weeks (W1D1 &amp; W2D1), then IT
           once a week for 3 weeks (W3D1, W4D1, &amp; W5D1), followed by dosing every 3 weeks
           thereafter until discontinuation of treatment. The route of administration (i.e. IT or
           SC) for CMP-001 beyond Week 5 will be determined by the accessibility of the tumor. Part
           B will include low-level radiation therapy.

      The CMP-001 dose for both routes of administration (SC/IT) will be up to 5 mg.

      Atezolizumab will be administered per the approved label at a schedule of every 3 weeks
      starting at week 2.

      Duration of Treatment:

      Subjects will continue treatment with CMP-001 in combination with atezolizumab as long as
      they do not experience unacceptable toxicities in the opinion of the Investigator and the
      Investigator believes continued treatment is in the subject's best interest.

    <description>Part A of the study will evaluate the safety and preliminary signs of efficacy for the combination of CMP-001 and atezolizumab. The combination of CMP-001 and atezolizumab has not been previously evaluated so Part A of the study will commence with a safety run in of 5 subjects treated with the combination treatment. After the first 5 subjects have passed a safety DLT observation period of 30 days and upon approval from the Safety Review Committee (SRC), Part A of the study will continue with enrollment of an additional 7 subjects to complete Part A Stage 1. If an acceptable safety profile is established and at least 2 responders out of 12 evaluable subjects are seen in Part A Stage 1, the study will enroll an additional 23 evaluable subjects in Part A Stage 2. A maximum of 35 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Part A.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Part B will evaluate the addition of low-level radiation therapy to the combination of CMP-001 and atezolizumab. Radiation therapy will consist of a dose of 20Gy delivered in 5 fractions (using either photons or protons). The radiation will be delivered to target lesion(s) (either a metastatic lymph node or a metastatic lesion), which will later be injected by CMP-001. Radiation will be delivered over the course of 5 consecutive days, prior to the first IT CMP-001 injection.
Part B will follow the same Simon-2 stage optimal design approach as Part A by enrolling 12 subjects in Part B Stage 1 and continuing with enrollment of 23 additional subjects in Part B Stage 2 only if an acceptable safety profile is established and there are at least 2 out of 12 responders in Part B Stage 1. There will be no safety run in for Part B of the study. A maximum of 35 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Part B.</description>

               5. 14 days for prior PD-1 therapy.

          3. Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV).

          4. Developed autoimmune disorders of Grade 4 while on prior immunotherapy. Subjects who
             developed autoimmune disorders, of Grade ≤ 3 may enroll if the disorder has resolved
             to Grade ≤1 and the subject has been off systemic steroids at doses &gt;10 mg/day, for
             the treatment of the autoimmune disorder, for at least 2 weeks.

          5. Require systemic pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids greater than the equivalent of
             10 mg/day prednisone; topical, ophthalmologic and inhalational steroids are permitted.
             Subjects who have a history of adrenal insufficiency and are receiving greater than 10
             mg/day prednisone may be eligible but only after Sponsor consultations. Subjects who
             are currently receiving steroids at a dose of ≤ 10 mg/day do not need to discontinue
             steroids prior to enrollment

          6. Active (i.e., symptomatic or progressing) CNS metastases. Subjects with CNS metastases
             are eligible for the trial if:

               1. The metastases have been treated by surgery and/or radiotherapy.

               2. The subject is off corticosteroids of &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent.

               3. The subject is neurologically stable for at least 2 weeks prior to Screening.

               4. Brain MRI completed within 6 weeks of Screening.

          7. Any concurrent uncontrolled illness, including mental illness or substance abuse,
             which in the opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject unable to cooperate
             or participate in the trial.

          8. Severe uncontrolled cardiac disease within 6 months of study entry, including but not
             limited to uncontrolled hypertension; unstable angina; myocardial infarction (MI) or
             cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

          9. Requires prohibited treatment (i.e., non-protocol specified anticancer
             pharmacotherapy, surgery or conventional radiotherapy for treatment of malignant
             tumor). Limited field single dose radiotherapy for pain palliation would be allowed.

         10. Women of childbearing potential who are unable or unwilling to use an acceptable
             method of contraception.

         11. Requires continuous anti-coagulation or anti-platelet therapy that cannot be safely
             interrupted to allow for IT injection and/or history of coagulopathy.

         12. History of another malignancy except for:

               1. Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease &gt; 5
                  years prior to the start of CMP-001 dosing on W1D1 and of low potential risk for
                  recurrence.

               2. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease.

               3. Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease (e.g. cervical
                  cancer in situ).

               4. Other concurrent low-grade malignancies such as CLL (Rai 0) may be considered
                  after discussion and permission from Sponsor
