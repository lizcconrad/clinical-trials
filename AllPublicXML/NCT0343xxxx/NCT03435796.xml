  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study for the long-term follow-up (LTFU) of safety and efficacy for all
      pediatric and adult subjects exposed to Gene-modified (GM) T cell therapy participating in a
      previous Celgene sponsored or Celgene alliance partner sponsored study.

      Subjects who received at least one GM T cell infusion, will be asked to roll-over to this
      LTFU protocol upon either premature discontinuation from, or completion of the prior parent
      treatment protocol.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects participating in this study will be followed from time of roll-over from the parent
      GM T protocol until 15 years after the last GMT infusion, withdrawal of consent, lost to
      follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first. Both local and central laboratory evaluations
      and safety assessments will be conducted during this trial. In addition, pediatric subjects
      will be monitored for growth, development and sexual maturity.

      Stage 5 per Tanner Staging Criteria must be reached prior to study discontinuation.

    <description>Subjects will be followed for 15 years from the last GM T cells infusion until withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first. Annual safety assessments will be conducted every 6 months during the first 5 years from the date of last GM T cell infusion. Laboratory evaluations and safety assessments will be conducted during this period. After 5 years, subjects will continue to be followed yearly. During the trial, pediatric subjects will be monitored for growth, development and sexual maturity. Stage 5 per Tanner Staging Criteria must be reached prior to study discontinuation.</description>
