      Background:

      New ways to study the brain as people move include near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and
      electroencephalography (EEG). NIRS uses laser light shone through the scalp to look at blood
      flow in the brain which increases with movement. EEG records electrical activity in the
      brain. Little is known about brain activity while children learn new motor skills.
      Researchers want to learn more about how small children with and without cerebral palsy use
      their brain to control their body. This may help them find new ways to help children move
      better.

      Objectives:

      To learn more about how infants and young children with and without cerebral palsy use their
      brain to move their arms and legs.

      Eligibility:

      Children ages 3 months - 5 years with and without cerebral palsy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Physical exam

        -  Questions for the parents about the child s health

      Participants will have at least 1 study session. Some may have up to 34 (all optional).

      In the sessions, participants will do motor tasks along with some or all of the following:

        -  Light sensors placed on the scalp, held there with a cap or Velcro straps.

        -  Small metal disks placed on the scalp with a cap or straps, with gel between them.

        -  Motion capture recording. Balls attached to the arms and legs by stickers, straps, or a
           garment are tracked by infrared and video cameras.

      Motor tasks include reaching, clapping, kicking, and standing.

      Participants may be placed in a toy or device that uses a motor to move their limbs.

      Participants head size, hair, and skin will be assessed.

      Parents will answer questions about their child s typical movements.

      OBJECTIVE

      Portable neural imaging during functional tasks is now possible utilizing noninvasive
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) which identifies areas of brain activity by measuring blood
      flow dynamics and electroencephalography (EEG) which measures electrical activity on the
      cortical surface. Use of these technologies for studying movement is rapidly increasing;
      however, investigations in children and those with brain injuries such as cerebral palsy are
      still in the early stages with few reports in the literature. The objectives of this protocol
      are to systematically compare cortical activation patterns during specified sensorimotor
      tasks in healthy infants and young children to those with cerebral palsy, examine
      developmental changes in brain activation patterns that underlie the emergence of early
      functional or dysfunctional motor control and explore the neural and biomechanical effects of
      different devices that make movement easier for infants and toddlers with cerebral palsy. The
      results are expected to increase knowledge of brain activation patterns across tasks and
      groups with and without brain injuries and to suggest potential mechanisms or strategies for
      future clinical intervention trials.

      STUDY POPULATION

      The group with cerebral palsy will consist of up to 100 children ages 3 months up to 5 years
      of age. The control group will consist of 50 healthy volunteers within the same age range.

      DESIGN

      This is an observational study that will include cross-sectional and longitudinal data
      collection. NIRS and/or EEG responses, and kinematic and/or electromyography (EMG) recordings
      will be collected on all participants during the performance of self-initiated motor tasks.
      Additionally, we will evaluate brain and motor responses to devices that aim to make movement
      easier for infants and children with motor disabilities who may have difficulty initiating or
      performing these movements without assistance.

      OUTCOME MEASURES

      Primary outcomes are the magnitude, extent and location of brain activity recorded by NIRS
      and/or EEG within tasks across subject groups. We will also quantify changes in brain
      activation across ages (cross-sectional) and time (longitudinal).

      Secondary outcomes include motion and EMG data to help interpret task and group differences
      and measures of motor abilities. The same outcome measures will be compared across ages to
      examine the development of cortical activation patterns and motor abilities and how these
      change over time and across groups.
