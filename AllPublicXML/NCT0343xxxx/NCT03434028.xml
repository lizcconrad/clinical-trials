      Multicenter, prospective, phase 3 randomized non-blinded interventional trial of fluid
      treatment strategies in the first 24 hours for patients with sepsis-induced hypotension. The
      aim of the study is to determine the impact of a restrictive fluids strategy (vasopressors
      first followed by rescue fluids) as compared to a liberal fluid strategy (fluids first
      followed by rescue vasopressors) on 90-day in-hospital mortality in patients with
      sepsis-induced hypotension.

    <textblock>
      Primary Hypothesis: Restrictive (vs liberal) fluid treatment strategy during the first 24
      hours of resuscitation for sepsis-induced hypotension will reduce 90-day in-hospital
      mortality.

        1. We will emphasize early screening and protocol initiation, and enroll a maximum of 2320
           patients with suspected sepsis-induced hypotension.

             -  All patients will receive at least 1 liter of fluids prior to meeting study
                inclusion criteria (and no more than 3 liters prior to randomization).

             -  Patients will be enrolled within 4 hours of meeting study inclusion criteria

             -  Any type of isotonic crystalloid (normal saline, ringers lactate, or a balanced
                solution such as plasmalyte) is permitted.

        2. Restrictive Fluids (Early Vasopressors) Group

             -  Norepinephrine will be used as preferred vasopressor and titrated to achieve mean
                arterial pressure (MAP) between 65 mmHg and 75 mmHg

             -  &quot;Rescue fluids&quot; may be administered as 500ml boluses if predefined rescue criteria
                are met

        3. Liberal Fluids (Fluids First) Group

             -  Additional 2 liter intravenous fluid bolus upon enrollment

             -  Administer 500ml fluid boluses for fluid triggers until 5 liters administered or
                development of clinical signs of acute volume overload develop

             -  &quot;Rescue vasopressors&quot; may be administered after 5 liters of fluid, for development
                of acute volume overload, or if other predefined rescue criteria are met

Patients on chronic renal replacement therapy will not be eligible for this endpoint determination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SOFA score</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate the SOFA score upon enrollment and at 72 hours using clinically available data. If a value is not available at baseline, it will be assumed to be normal. At the 72 hours assessment, if a value is missing then we will carry forward the closet previously known value. If a patient is intubated or heavily sedated at either 0 or 72 hours, the GCS will be omitted when calculating the change in score. If a patient was on renal replacement therapy prior to presentation, then the renal dysfunction component to the SOFA score will be omitted as well.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Development of ARDS</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after randomization</time_frame>
