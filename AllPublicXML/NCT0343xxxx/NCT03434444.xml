  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rates of cesarean deliveries (CD) and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) are on the rise, with
      failed induction and augmentation of labor as major contributing factors. Oxytocin is
      commonly used for labor induction, as well as during the third stage of labor to minimize the
      risk of primary PPH. At delivery, it is imperative that the uterus responds effectively to
      parenteral oxytocin. Poor response to oxytocin following delivery is commonly due to
      prolonged labor with oxytocin augmentation that is known to &quot;desensitize&quot; the myometrium.
      Despite the option of several second line uterotonic agents, none of them are as effective as
      oxytocin in controlling PPH. Given that poor uterine muscle contraction is the root cause of
      both failed induction or augmentation (leading to a CD in labor) and uterine atony (leading
      to PPH), there is an urgent and clinically important need to investigate novel methods to
      enhance oxytocin-induced myometrial contractions.

      Propranolol, a beta adrenergic receptor agonist, has the potential to improve myometrial
      contractions by virtue of its ability to inhibit catecholamine production. The investigators
      plan to investigate the effects of propranolol in both naive and desensitized myometrium, in
      order to better understand its potential role in improving labor induction and reducing the
      risk of PPH following oxytocin exposure during labor.

      The investigators hypothesize that propranolol is likely to potentiate the action of oxytocin
      upon human myometrium, to ultimately help improve the success of labor induction/augmentation
      and treatment of PPH.

  <detailed_description>

      Myometrial samples will be used to investigate the effect of propranolol on uterine
      contractions when exposed to high and low doses of oxytocin (to simulate PPH treatment and
      labor induction respectively).

      The tissue will also be frozen at the end of the experiment, and Western blotting will be
      used to investigate the effect of propranolol on the expression patterns and cellular
      distribution of the oxytocin receptor and beta-adrenergic receptor and their signaling
      pathways in desensitized myometrium.
