    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the best-tolerated dose and safety of sorafenib combined
      with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab, in treating participants with hepatocellular
      carcinoma (primary liver cancer) that cannot be removed by surgery. Sorafenib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immune
      checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, may help the immune system inhibit the cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation and expansion study of sorafenib in combination with
      nivolumab.

      DOSE-ESCALATION (Part 1): Between 3-12 patients will be enrolled in Part 1. Participants
      receive sorafenib 400 mg orally (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and
      nivolumab 240 mg intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      DOSE EXPANSION (Part 2): New participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      LEAD-IN ARM I: Participants receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15, and
      sorafenib PO beginning on day 15 of course 1, then on days 1-28 of subsequent courses.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      LEAD-IN ARM II: Participants receive sorafenib PO on days 1-28, and nivolumab IV over 30
      minutes beginning on day 15 of course 1, then on days 1 and 15 of subsequent courses. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 and 100 days, then
      every 3 months for up to 2 years.
