      Background and Rationale:

      Cerebrovascular disease is always ranked at the top causes of death and most of hospitalized
      acute stroke patients have ischemic stroke [1].

      Although the mortality rate of acute ischemic stroke is less than that of hemorrhagic stroke
      [1], it still results in patient disabilities and complications that often lead to
      significant costs to individuals, families, and society.

      Traditional treatment for acute ischemic stroke includes thrombolytic therapy by injecting
      tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) within three hours after onset of symptoms [2],
      antiplatelets and/or anticoagulant agents administered within the first 48 hours. Clinically,
      the narrow time window of thrombolytic therapy and coexisting contraindications limit the use
      of t-PA [2]. Thus, searching for an effective supplemental treatment for acute ischemic
      stroke is imperative.

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is valuable in treating acute carbon monoxide poisoning
      [3,4], air or gas embolism [5], facilitating wound healing [6] and has been used as an
      adjuvant treatment for many neurological disorders that need further study as concussion [7]
      , stroke [8,9], cerebral palsy [ 10],traumatic brain injury [ 11], cerebral air embolism
      [12], Autism [13] and multiple sclerosis [14].

      Indications of hyperbaric oxygen therapy recommended by undersea and hyperbaric medical
      society (UHMS) [15] are 1.air or gas embolism [5], 2.carbon monoxide poisoning [3,4],
      3.clostridial myositis and myonecrosis [16], 4.crush injury, compartment syndrome and other
      acute traumatic ischemias [17], 5.decompression sickness [18], 6.arterial insufficiencies
      [19], 7.severe anemia [20], 8.intracranial abscess [21], 9.necrotizing soft tissue infections
      [22],10. refractory osteomyelitis [23], 11.delayed radiation injury [24], 12.compromised
      grafts and flaps [25], 13.acute thermal burn injury [26] and 14.idiopathic sudden
      sensorineural hearing loss [27].

      Known mechanisms of HBOT-induced neuroprotection include enhancing neuronal viability via
      increased tissue oxygen delivery to the area of diminished blood flow, reducing brain edema,
      and improving metabolism after ischemia [28,29]. Furthermore, a recent study performed on a
      rat suggested that upregulation of the expression of glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF)
      and nerve growth factor (NGF) might underlie the effect of HBOT [30].

      The effectiveness of use of Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in human ischemic stroke is still
      controversial that need further evaluation.

      Study Methods:

      Study Population A 60 adult (aged &gt;18 years) patients were included with a diagnosis of acute
      thromboembolic ischemic stroke within 48 hours after onset, according to clinical picture and
      imaging findings by brain computed tomography (CT) without evidence of hemorrhage, upon
      admission to the hospital and no patient received thrombolytic therapy.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Group one, HBOT group (n = 30): thirty adult patients with acute ischemic stroke will receive
      conventional medical treatment ( as antiplatelet but not thrombolytic therapy) with 10
      sessions of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) within 3-5 days after the onset of
      stroke .

      Compared with Group two, control group(n = 30): thirty adult patients with acute ischemic
      stroke will receive conventional medical treatment alone.

      The baseline clinical characteristics were similar in both groups.

      Exclusion criteria:

        -  Patient with cerebral hemorrhage

        -  Patient received thrombolytic therapy

        -  Emphysema with carbon dioxide retention

        -  Pneumothorax

        -  Seizure disorder

        -  Uncontrolled high fever

      Demographic Characteristics:

      Adults more than 18 years, Any gender. All patients upon admission to the hospital will
      provide:

      Complete history taking:Age, Gender, Smoking, Alcohol consumption, Past history: diabetes
      mellitus , hypertension , Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Epilepsy or cardiovascular
      disease.

      Neurological assessment use NIHSS score Blood tests:Complete blood count , Coagulation
      profile, Fasting blood sugar., Renal function test (Urea and creatinine).

      CT brain

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The national institute of health stroke score (NIHSS) is a 15 item neurologic examination that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. (Maximum score of 42) &quot;Mild&quot; disease was defined as score of 0-14, &quot;moderate&quot; as 15-28, and &quot;severe&quot; as 29-42.
As pretreatment evaluation, all patients will be evaluated by national institute of health stroke score within 48 hours after admission.
As posttreatment evaluation, patients in the hyperbaric oxygen therapy group were evaluated by national institute of health stroke score after 10 sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
The control group was evaluated with national institute of health stroke score 10 days after stroke onset.
One month after treatment, all patients were evaluated again using the national institute of health stroke score.</description>
