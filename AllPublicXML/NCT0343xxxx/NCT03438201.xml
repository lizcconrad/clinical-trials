  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized Controlled Trial . The purpose of this study is to assess the hypothesis
      that whether a high protein diet combined with a physical activity protocol in surgical
      cancer patients admitted to the ICU in the post operative period is associated with better
      physical function at the hospital discharge as well as a better quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical cancer patients will be categorized by their nutritional risk using a specific
      screening toll. During the hospital stay some measurements will be done. Such as resting
      energy expenditure (REE) before and after surgery; physical function evaluation; strength and
      quality of life.

      The proposed intervention is a post operative diet with a different amount of protein (diet
      with a standard amount of protein and a diet with high amount of protein) associated to an
      institutional protocol of physical activity.

    <description>Measurement of quality of life using the Euro-Qol 5D-5L index. EQ-5D-5L index includes five questions concerning mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. A summary utility index value can be computed from subject's response to these five questions. Values range from -0.594 (worst possible health score) to 0 (death) to 1.000 (best health).</description>
