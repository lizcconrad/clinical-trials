  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-management of chronic illness can be highly demanding and people need to mobilize their
      personal strengths in order to live well with their condition. A mobile application was
      designed in collaboration with people with chronic illness and health care providers with the
      aims to support awareness of patients' strengths and patient-provider dialogues that include
      strengths. The aim of the present study is to evaluate with mixed methods the perceived
      usefulness and usability of the application and potential effects of the application on
      patients and patient-health care provider communication on strengths.

      In this pre-post design pilot study participants will be recruited from two settings:1)
      self-management courses and 2) an outpatient rehabilitation unit for people with rheumatic
      diseases. In setting 1, before using the application participants will be asked to report
      their strengths in a written format. After using the mobile application to reflect on their
      strengths the participants will be interviewed about their experience of using the
      application and on the task of reflecting on their strengths. They will also be asked to fill
      out a questionnaire on perceived usefulness and user-friendliness. Before and after using the
      application the participants fill out questionnaires on emotions (Positive and Negative
      Affective Scale) and self-efficacy (The Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale). In setting 2,
      participants will be asked to use the application to reflect on their strengths and to use
      the summary of their strengths (from the the application) in a consultation with one of their
      care provider at the unit. The consultation will be audio-taped and analysed with a
      qualitative approach. As in setting 1, participants will also be asked to fill out a
      questionnaire on perceived usefulness and user-friendliness of the application. Before and
      after the consultation the participants fill out questionnaires on emotions (Positive and
      Negative Affective Scale) and self-efficacy (The Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale). The patients
      and health care providers will be interviewed about the experience of using the application
      and the summary of strengths in the consultation. All interviews will be audio-taped and
      analyzed with a qualitative approach. Descriptive analysis will be applied for quantitative
      data.

    <description>This scale measures positive and negative affect with two subscales (positive affect and negative affect). Positive affect subscale scores can range from 10-50, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect. Negative affect subscale scores can range from 10-50, with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>

    <description>This scale measures self-efficacy with two subscales with 5 response options. The &quot;pain&quot; subscale has 5 items and a score range from 0 to 20. The &quot;other symptoms&quot; subscale has 6 items and a score range from 0 to 24. Higher scores equal higher levels of self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Setting 1: Participants recruited from a self-management course are asked to use (single time) a mobile application to support reflection of personal strengths. The participant borrows an Ipad and uses the application to 1) reflect and identify their strengths by reviewing a list of examples, 2) define personal goals, and 3) link strengths to goals.
Setting 2: Participants recruited from an outpatient rehabilitation unit are asked to use the mobile application prior to a single consultation with their health care provider. The summary of strengths from the application is used in the consultation.</description>
