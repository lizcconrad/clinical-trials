      The half-life of the parathyroid hormone is about 4min, blood pth test is use in operation to
      confirm that parathyroid tumor is removed. but the blood pth test is time consuming and
      unpractical in most of hospital. this study will compare the application of rapid PTH test
      paper in operation of hyperparathyroidism.PTH test were measured in operation in different
      way. it will test at the time of preoperation, 15 minutes after surgery, 1 hour after surgery
      and 24 hours after surgery. thus evaluate the reliability and accuracy of PTH test paper in
      evaluating the Miami principles with the linear relation of blood PTH and the PTH test paper
      method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperparathyroidism is a clinically common disease. At present, the gold standard for
      determining whether the operation is successful is based on the Miami principle. That means
      The PTH hormone decreased to 30% of the baseline level after 15min after the tumor was
      removed. However, due to the differences in PTH monitoring conditions in various hospitals,
      many hospitals cannot perform rapid PTH monitoring in the operation. Therefore many doctors
      choose rapid freezing pathology to confirm the lesion., This also led to the inability to
      evaluate PTH in the presence of multiple lesions,and resulting in the need for reoperations.

        We use the characteristics of short half-life of the parathyroid hormone and try to
        evaluate it by PTH strip semi-quantitative method. PTH, blood calcium and PTH test were
        measured at pre-operation, 15 minutes after surgery, 1 hour after surgery and 24 hours
        after surgery. To evaluate the reliability and accuracy of PTH strip in evaluating the
        Miami principles with the linear relation of blood PTH and the test paper method.
