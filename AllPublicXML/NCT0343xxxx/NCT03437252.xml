  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are suffering from COPD had a decreased level of physical activity which is
      consequentially related to another acute exacerbation event. In this study, we selected
      patients from those who were admitted for acute exacerbation of COPD, evaluated physical
      activity by accelerometer (wearable multisensory armband devices) to find out the correlation
      between physical activity in COPD acute exacerbation patients.
