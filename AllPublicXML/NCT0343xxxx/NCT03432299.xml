  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective clinical trial with regard to efficacy and safety of
      radiofrequency ablation of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For treatment of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) will
      be performed with the supine position and neck extended under ultrasonogrphic guidance.
      Before RFA, local anesthesia will be performed. RFA system including radiofrequency generator
      (VIVA RF system, STARmed, Goyang-si, Korea) and internally cooled electrode (18G with
      0.5cm-1cm active tip, star RF electrode, STARmed, Goyang-si, Korea) will be used. With regard
      to RFA procedure, moving shot technique and hydrodissection, if indicated, will be used.
      After RFA, follow-up will be performed using ultrasonography, serum thyroid function test,
      and questionnaire for quality of life by face-to-face interview at 2 months, 6, 12, 18, 24
      months during the first 2 years after RFA, and yearly afterwards.
