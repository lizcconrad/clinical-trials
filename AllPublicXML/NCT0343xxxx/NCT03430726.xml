  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In adults, probiotics have been shown to have no effect on the microbial composition and the
      beneficial effects are only transient. However, the gut microbiota of young children is less
      stable and more impressionable. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of probiotics
      on the developing microbiota in early life and to determine whether a young child's
      microbiota may be less resilient to probiotic-induced changes and possibly resulting in
      longer lasting probiotic effects compared to adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that have been associated with health benefits. However,
      probiotic effects have not been shown to persist beyond discontinuation of use in adults. The
      intake of probiotics during the critical window of gut microbiota development in young
      children, however, may allow for a longer duration of persistence of probiotic bacteria and
      more stable changes in microbial composition possibly resulting in stable engraftment of the
      probiotic strains. This study aims is to examine the effect of a 14-day course of a
      commercially available probiotic yogurt drink on the composition, diversity, and changes in
      immune biomarkers (e.g. human beta-defensin-2 and calprotectin) of the gut microbiota of
      healthy children. As well, to assess whether the probiotic strains persists after
      discontinuation of intake and whether engraftment occurs. By understanding the impact of
      probiotics on the gut microbiota, we will better understand the mechanism by which probiotics
      exert their beneficial effects. This may help guide probiotic selection based on the
      potential short- and long-term effects on the commensal microbiota.
