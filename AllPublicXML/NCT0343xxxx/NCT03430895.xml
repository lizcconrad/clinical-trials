      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years at time of informed consent

          -  Body weight &gt; 30 kg

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed small cell carcinoma, squamous cell
             carcinoma or adenocarcinoma (confirmed at MSKCC) of the bladder, ureter, urethra,
             urachus, or renal pelvis. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are
             required to have a predominant squamous or adenocarcinoma component as reviewed by the
             pathologist at MSKCC. However, if any element of small cell or neuroendocrine
             differentiation is present, the patients will be classified as small
             cell/neuroendocrine.

          -  Confirmation of availability of sufficient tissue from a prior surgery for correlative
             studies is required prior to enrollment. Patients must have representative non-TCC or
             the urothelial tract FFPE archival tumor specimens (tumor blocks or 30 unstained
             slides; preference for tumor blocks). These samples may be submitted between the time
             of consent and the start of treatment. Patients with &lt; 30 slides may be enrolled after
             discussion with the principal or co-principal investigators.

          -  Clinical evidence of metastatic (T4b, any N; any T, N2-3; M1) disease.

          -  Life expectancy of 12 weeks of greater based on assessment by the treating
             investigator.

          -  Evidence of measurable disease by RECIST 1.1.

          -  Patients with small cell carcinoma must have progressed after at least one prior
             systemic therapy. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma may be
             previously untreated or have progressed after prior systemic therapy. Chemotherapy
             administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radio-sensitizer WILL be
             counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen. NOTE: There is no maximum number of prior
             treatments allowed.

          -  Patients with brain metastases are allowed onto the study as long as patients have
             completed their treatment for brain metastasis, no longer require corticosteroids, and
             are asymptomatic. Subjects with neurological symptoms should undergo a head CT scan or
             brain MRI to exclude brain metastasis, at the discretion of the treating physician.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.

          -  Adequate normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L (&gt; 1000 per mm^3)

                  institutional ULN in patients with Gilbert‟s syndrome)

               -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x institutional ULN unless liver metastases are
                  present, in which case it must be ≤ 5 x ULN

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula
                  (Cockcroft and Gault 1976) or by 24-hour urine collection for determination of
                  creatinine clearance:

        Males:

        Creatinine CL (mL/min)

        = Weight (kg) x (140 - Age) . 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)

               -  Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test
                  for female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if
                  they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause.
                  The following age-specific requirements apply:

                    -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                       amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal
                       treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating
                       hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent
                       surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).

                    -  Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been
                       amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous
                       hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1
                       year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago,
                       or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral
                       salpingectomy or hysterectomy).

               -  Female patients of reproductive potential and non-sterilized males who are
                  sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must be willing
                  to adhere to the following restrictions:

                    -  Females of reproductive potential who are sexually active with a
                       non-sterilized male partner must agree to use at least 1 highly effective
                       method of contraception (Table 3) from the time of screening until 180 days
                       after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90
                       days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Cessation of birth
                       control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.
                       Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not
                       acceptable methods of birth control. It is strongly recommended that
                       non-sterilized male partners of a female patient must use male condom plus
                       spermicide throughout this period. Not engaging in sexual activity for the
                       total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is an
                       acceptable practice.

                    -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of
                       childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening
                       through 180 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab +
                       tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after receipt of the final dose
                       of durvalumab monotherapy. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the
                       withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Not engaging
                       in sexual activity is an acceptable practice. Male patients should refrain
                       from sperm donation throughout this period. It is strongly recommended that
                       female partners (of childbearing potential) of male patients to also use a
                       highly effective method of contraception throughout this period.

                    -  Highly effective methods of contraception, defined as one that results in a
                       low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and
                       correctly.

               -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the

             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written
