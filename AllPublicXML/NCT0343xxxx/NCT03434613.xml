  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the therapeutic effect of ezetimibe on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the
      effect of rosuvastatin 5mg monotherapy and rosuvastatin 5mg / ezetimibe 10mg combination
      therapy n patients with hyperlipidemia and fatty liver will be compared and analyzed.

      This study included a total of 70 patients (35 per subgroup) for randomized controlled trials
      with prospective, open label, randomized, single-institution clinical trials.

      The drug will be maintained for a total of six months. The primary endpoint is the difference
      of liver fat change measured by MRI-PDFF in colocalized regions of interest within nine liver
      segments between two groups.

             mg / dL or more if there are two or more major risk factors C. High-risk patients with
             carotid stenosis&gt; 50%, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and diabetes mellitus had LDL-C&gt; 70
