  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effects of using an intra-oral camera (IOC) during supportive periodontal
      therapy, and oral hygiene mobile text messages (SMS) between appointments on clinical,
      behavioral and psychological parameters of patients with gingivitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental hygiene behaviours are of paramount importance for controlling gingival health. There
      is evidence on the use of IOC and of text messages in boosting motivation, sustainability and
      clinical efficacy of dental hygiene behaviors. Orchestrating these two technologies is
      expected to create a coaction effect which could improve behavior change interventions, but
      the effectiveness of such strategy needs to be inspected.

    <description>Dental appointment, one hour and included activities that are normally part of a SPT (Suportive Periodontal Treatment) consultation, as well as specific behavior change techniques, such as the use of reinforcement, goal-setting and feedback considered crucial to the accomplishment of long term behavior change. Moreover, special attention was given to patient communication and words such as 'cleaning' and 'hygiene' were replaced by therapeutic synonyms (e.g. inflamed areas and controlling the inflammation) in order to focus patients´ attention on the varied facets of oral health care and increase their perception of the treatment needs. In this group, the device SOPROCARE® by Acteon and Text Messages were not used.</description>
