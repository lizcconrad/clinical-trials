  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an italian multicenter study to determine whether maintenance treatment with
      Lenalidomide-based regimen significantly increases the rate of molecular remission in
      patients achieving at least a VGPR after therapy with new drugs combination. No changing in
      the planned therapy will be made according to MRD results. A total of 70 patients with newly
      diagnosed MM who are 18 years of age or older and who meet all of the eligibility criteria
      may be enrolled in this study.

      Potential study subjects will sign an informed consent prior undergoing any study related
      procedure. Patients enrolled in this study will receive Lenalidomide-based regimen as
      maintenance therapy according to their previous decided therapeutic schedule. All consecutive
      patients treated with Lenalidomide-based regimen as maintenance therapy and with inclusion
      criteria will be asked to participate to this study.

      No additional drugs will be administrated for this study whose aim is to monitor the MRD on
      bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood of patients during maintenance therapy with
      Lenalidomide-based regimen.

      Patients entering the study will signed an informed consent and will undergo bone marrow
      aspiration and peripheral blood examination. On both these two tissues the MRD analysis
      reaching for myeloma cells.

      During the treatment period, all patients will attend study center visits every 4 weeks,
      until development of confirmed Progressive Disease (PD). During this visits the patients will
      undergo physical evaluation and routine blood control will be performed to monitor response
      to therapy and side effects.

      When a patient develops a PD requiring the beginning of a new treatment, the patient
      interrupts the MRD monitoring but will be followed for survival every 2 months via telephone
      or office visit.

      MRD determination will be performed using the tumor specific IgH rearrangement through allele
      specific real time PCR (ASO PCR). This technique is sensitive enough to detect one myeloma
      cells out of 105-106 normal cells and allows to perform quantitative evaluation too. This
      method for molecular MRD determination has already been published and in our laboratory has
      already been used for MRD analysis in MM. 2720 Thermal cyclers (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,
      California, USA) and the AbiPrism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, California, USA) will
      be employed to analyze MRD using qualitative and quantitative PCR approach. Both nested
      qualitative and real time quantitative PCR will be employed in this study.

          -  Patient has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any
             study-related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that
             consent may be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to their future
             medical care.

          -  Patient has HBV, HCV and HIV negative test.

          -  Patients must have normal ECG and NYHA ≤ 2; an evaluation of ejection fraction by ECHO
             or MUGA is optional

          -  Patients must be informed on acute and late toxicity of Lenalidomide treatment and
             must sign an informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious medical condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities,
             which places the subject at an unacceptable risk if he or she participates in this
             study or confounds the experimental ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Achieving of a PR or less before starting maintenance therapy

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. A serum β-hCG pregnancy test must be performed at the
             Screening visit, for female patients of child-bearing potential. If the test is
             positive, the patient must be excluded from the study. Confirmation that the patient
             is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum or urinary pregnancy test with
             the result obtained 1 day prior to the Baseline visit (or the day of the visit if
             results are available before drug delivery). A pregnancy test is not required for
             naturally post-menopausal women (who have not had menses at any time in the preceding
             24 consecutive months) or surgically sterilised women (hysterectomy, bilateral
             ovariectomy, bilateral salpingectomy).
