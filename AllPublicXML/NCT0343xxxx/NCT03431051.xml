  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine if instituting a Healthy Beverage Initiative (HBI) at
      hospitals influences health and wellness of employees over a 12 month period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To examine whether HBI is associated with decreased adiposity over a 12-month time period, in
      comparison to individuals identically assessed but not exposed to a HBI. Specifically, do
      those exposed to the HBI decrease in measures of adiposity, BMI, and sugar sweetened beverage
      (SSB) intake? Do they decrease more in those measures as compared to those not exposed to the
      HBI?
