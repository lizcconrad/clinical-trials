  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placenta Previa is defined as a placenta implanted in the lower segment of the uterus,
      presenting ahead of the leading pole of the fetus (over or near the internal os). The
      prevalence of placenta previa has been estimated to be approximately 0.5% of all pregnancies,
      and this increase correlates to the elevated cesarean section rate . In Egypt, the prevalence
      of placenta previa is around 1.3% in Sohag Governorate and 1.5% in Aswan region according to.

      Although various studies have tried to address risk factors associated with Placenta Previa
      development, the etiology of placenta previa still remains obscure. Several risk actors have
      been identified as strong contributors to placenta previa development. It is also a
      significant contributor to severe postpartum hemorrhage.Risk factors include; history of
      previous cesarean section, advanced maternal age, history of previous abortions, high parity
      and substance abuse during pregnancy (cigarette smoking), placental size (multiple
      pregnancy), endometrial damage (previous dilatation and curettage), uterine scars and
      pathology (previous myomectomy or endometritis), placental pathology (marginal cord
      insertions and succenturiate lobes), previous placental Previa, and curiously.
