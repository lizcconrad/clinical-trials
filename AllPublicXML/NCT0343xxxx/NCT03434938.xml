      Background: Rehabilitation pathways are crucial to reduce stroke-related disability.
      Motivational Interviewing (MI), a centred-person intervention aimed to empower and motivate
      the patient, could be a resource to improve rehabilitation and its outcomes for older stroke
      survivors.

      Objective: The IMAGINE project aims to assess the impact of MI associated to standard
      geriatric rehabilitation, on 30 days functional improvement measured by the Functional
      Independence Measure (FIM), compared to standard geriatric rehabilitation alone, in patients
      admitted to geriatric rehabilitation after a stroke. Secondary objectives will be to assess
      the impact on physical activity and performance, self-efficacy, sense of coherence, safety,
      cost-utility and participants' experience, plus functional status at 3 months.

      Methods: Multicenter randomized clinical trial in three geriatric rehabilitation departments.
      Older adults after mild-moderate stroke without previous dementia, post-stroke severe
      cognitive impairment or delirium at admission, severe previous disability, aphasia or
      terminal conditions will be randomized into the control or the intervention group (136 per
      group, total N = 272). The control group will receive written information about the benefits
      of exercising, besides standard rehabilitation. The intervention group, in addition, will
      receive 4 sessions of MI by trained nurses. A shared tailored plan based on patients' goals,
      needs, preferences and capabilities will be agreed. Besides the FIM, in-hospital physical
      activity will be measured through accelerometers (activPAL) and secondary outcomes using
      internationally validated scales. As a complex intervention, a process evaluation and
      cost-utility assessments will be performed too.

      Results: Final results are expected by end of 2020. Implications: This project aims to
      achieve impacts on functional status, disability and physical performance and behavioral
      (increasing physical activity) and psychological implications (on general self-efficacy and
      sense of coherence) through a non-pharmacological and likely accessible, acceptable and
      scalable intervention. Efficiency and value, based on costs/quality adjusted life years, will
      be assessed. Moreover, a reduction in post-stroke disability would have social benefits also
      for families and would reduce health and social care costs. In brief, advances will be in
      terms of a better rehabilitation process.

    <textblock>
      IMAGINE project aims to investigate the effect of adding an adapted MI approach to the usual
      geriatric rehabilitation to motivate and empower stroke patients to participate in their own
      rehabilitation plan and thus, to increase their physical activity and engagement in self-care
      and other activities. The main aim is to finally improve patients' physical and global
      function and, in turn, to reduce dependency. As mentioned, there is evidence-base around MI
      in rehabilitation, which covers functional, clinical and efficiency aspects. It is expected
      that IMAGINE project will add a relevant contribution for the implementation of this
      intervention in older adults with post-stroke residual disability and dependency needing
      rehabilitation. Accordingly, this study should inform practice and policy on how to move
      forward towards shared decision making and shared responsibilities in a vulnerable population
      such as older adults with a recent stroke.

    <intervention_model_description>MI intervention will be associated to standard geriatric rehabilitation. MI will be structured in 4 sessions (within 72 hours from admission, within next 6 days after first MI session, at 1 week from the second session and pre-discharge), with the goals of reducing disability obtaining patients' collaboration, creating a shared tailored plan which would complement the individual approach established by the multidisciplinary team as part of routine geriatric rehabilitation unit, and reinforcing engagement and adherence at 3 months.
Standard rehabilitation and control includes a multidisciplinary and individualized treatment plan based on comprehensive geriatric and specific rehabilitation assessments.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>After inclusion in the study and obtaining informed consent, participants will be randomized to intervention or control group in a concealed allocation manner. Centralized randomization will be conducted through a block randomization procedure, with random-varying block size, stratified by participating centre. Participants will be randomized after the baseline assessment, guaranteeing the blinded assessment. The 30 days and 3 months assessments will be conducted by an assessor blinded to participants' group allocation, who will ask the participants not to disclose their group allocation. Afterwards, the assessor will record whether he/she was made aware of the participant allocation.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Functional Independence Measure (FIM).</measure>
    <time_frame>At admission (within 72 hours), 30 days, and at 3 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM is used to track functional evolution during in-hospital rehabilitation process. FIM is comprised of 18 items, grouped into 2 subscales: 1) motor and 2) cognition. The motor subscale includes: Eating, grooming, bathing, dressing (upper body), dressing (lower body), toileting, bladder management, bowel management, transfers (bed/chair/wheelchair), transfers (toilet), transfers (bath/shower), walk/wheelchair, stairs. The cognition subscale includes: Comprehension, expression, social interaction, problem solving, memory. The total score for the FIM instrument (the sum of the motor and cognition subscale scores) will be a value between 18 and 126. The higher the score, the more independent the patient is in performing the task associated with that item.</description>
