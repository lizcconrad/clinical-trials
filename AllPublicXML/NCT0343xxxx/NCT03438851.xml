  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms resulting from mild/moderate trauma to the brain are as varied as the individuals
      who sustain them. The currently held belief is that the majority of healing and functional
      recovery occurs within the first two years post injury. A large proportion of individuals who
      sustain mild/moderate brain injuries (mTBIs) do not fully recover, and continue to experience
      symptoms well beyond two years post injury. Cognitive rehabilitation programs have been shown
      to be somewhat effective in helping mTBI patients regain some functionality in these
      executive domains.

      The purpose of the current study is to use an objective assessment of brain function to track
      changes during either a full-time or part-time holistic cognitive rehabilitation program,
      specifically the Watson Centre for Brain Health (WCBH) program. The NeuroCatch Platform™ test
      will be used to assess brain functioning before, during and after 3 months in the WCBH
      program. The NeuroCatch Platform™ test uses electroencephalography (EEG) to measure
      event-related potential (ERP) signals produced by the brain, in response to an auditory
      stimulus. Three brain processes are examined with this test: Auditory sensation (ERP marker
      is the N100), Basic attention (ERP marker is the P300), and Cognitive processing (ERP marker
      is the N400).

Participants in the full-time program will be asked to complete 4 experimental sessions with the NeuroCatch PlatformTM over the course of 3 months (i.e. one session/ month); whereas, participants in the part-time program will be asked to complete 3 scans over 3 months (i.e. one session/1.5 months).</intervention_model_description>
