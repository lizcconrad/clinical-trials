  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinician directed prophylactic swallowing therapy will improve immediate (four weeks +/- two
      weeks) and short-term (26 weeks +/- four weeks) post-treatment swallowing function and
      quality of life versus patient directed home exercises.

      The purpose of this prospective, interventional, pilot investigation is to determine whether
      clinician directed swallowing therapy will improve patient swallowing function outcomes and
      quality of life in the immediate and short-term basis compared to patients receiving standard
      of care patient directed independent home swallowing therapy. Patient compliance with home
      exercises programs is reportedly inconsistent. Patients may experience changes in their
      physical functioning and overall well-being that may impact their ability to follow-through
      with independent home therapy. Clinician directed swallowing therapy allows for ongoing
      assessment of changes that may warrant modifying the therapy program in terms of intensity of
      exercises and/or expectations. This facilitates individualizing the patient's therapy plan to
      maximize their function and ability to achieve goals. It is anticipated that individualizing
      swallowing therapy through weekly session will result in improved swallowing function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, two-arm, 1:1 randomized, prospective, interventional, pilot study to
      determine whether clinician directed swallowing therapy will improve patient swallowing
      function outcomes when compared to patient-directed home-based swallowing therapy.

      The investigators anticipate at least 40 subjects will need to be enrolled/consented in order
      to obtain the accrual goal of 15 evaluable subjects for each group for a total of 30
      participants.

      All subjects in each group will receive a face-to-face education session with a speech
      pathologist to review a recommended program of swallowing exercises prior to initiation of
      chemoradiation at their baseline (pre-treatment evaluation session).

    <description>The immediate effect (four weeks, +/- two weeks post-treatment) of clinician-directed prophylactic swallowing therapy versus patient-directed home swallowing therapy on swallowing function during definitive chemoradiation, as measured by improvement on the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS).
