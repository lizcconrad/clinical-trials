  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this work is to perform hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe MRI in human subjects
      undergoing thoracic radiation therapy (RT), both before, during and following RT. HP 129Xe MR
      images will be analysed to provide maps of ventilation (V), perfusion (Q), apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC) and gas exchange. These results will be combined to yield a new measure of
      RILI, (i.e. dose volume histograms; DVHV/Q) and compared with conventional dose volume
      histograms (DVH), pulmonary function tests (PFTs), quality of life (QOL) questionnaire and CT
      measurements for assessment of RILI at each time point. The aim is to development a novel
      method for early and more sensitive method of detecting RILI before irreversible lung damage
      happens.

      Briefly, at the beginning of an approximate three hour study visit, the qualified
      investigator (QI) / delegate will explain the study procedure to the participants and the
      participants will have an opportunity to ask questions regarding the study procedure.
      Following the explanation of the study, written informed consent will be collected. During
      the study visit, participants will undergo: 1) brief medical history and clinical
      examination, 2) full pulmonary function tests, 3) proton MRI, 4) HP 129Xe MRI. Qualified
      research team members will perform a clinical examination on the participant to record their
      vital statistics like age, gender, height, weight, heart rate, respiratory rate, oral
      temperature and blood pressure. The QI/delegate, during a brief conversation with the
      participant, will collect relevant medical history from the participant to make sure the
      participant meets all the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. The QI will also make
      sure that the participant understands the study procedure and is willing to participate in
      the study. At each study visit at SickKids, the QI or delegate will also administer the QOL
      questionnaire to the participant. Based on the clinical examination results, medical history
      and the pulmonary function test results, the QI/delegate will determine if all the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria are met to proceed with the MRI part of the study visit.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:a) Patients 18 years of age or older; b) Diagnosis of locally advanced
        lung/esophageal/laryngeal or other type of cancer requiring radical intent RT to the thorax
        (with or without concurrent chemotherapy), consisting of 1.8 - 2 Gy daily fractions
        delivered over 5 - 6 weeks; c) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or
        1; d) Preserved lung function as determined by a forced expiratory volume in 1 second
        (FEV1) &gt; 70% to exclude patients with existing respiratory disorders (e.g. COPD, asthma
        etc.)

        Exclusion Criteria:a) Planned anti-cancer surgery after radical RT; b) Chronic use of
        corticosteroids; c) Any previous RT to the thorax; d) History of ataxia telangiectasia or
        other known conditions that may increase radio-sensitivity; e) Planned for other anticancer
        therapy apart from RT or concurrent chemotherapy/RT f) Currently pregnant or lactating; g)
        Psychiatric or addictive disorders that would preclude obtaining informed consent or
        adherence to protocol; h) Inability to travel to obtain MRI scans; i) Any contraindications
        to MRI including but not limited to severe claustrophobia, implanted devices, aneurysm
        clips, neurostimulators (patients will be prescreened prior to registration).
