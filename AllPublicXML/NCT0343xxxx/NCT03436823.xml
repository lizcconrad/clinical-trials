  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation - R.TMS - is currently part of the treatment for
      depressive illness. This non-invasive technique is designed to stimulate certain areas of the
      cerebral cortex involved in this pathology. FDA approved this treatment in routine for
      depressive illness. R.TMS still remains in assessment. Due to the heterogeneity of methods
      and the weakness of the cohorts therapeutic superiority can not concluded .

      Stimulation parameters remain numerous even if a consensus is beginning to emerge. The
      therapeutic target is the left dorso - lateral prefrontal cortex. The lack of efficacy is
      probably due of the inaccuracy. The empirically location of the target does not take into
      account the inter-individual anatomical differences. The neuronavigation is becoming
      widespread in routine clinical practice.

      The referent nurse stays with the patient all along the rTMS sessions. His role is to set up
      treatment, to ensure the safety and the well-being of the patient. An rTMS session is an
      average of 30 minutes and is a very special moment to create a specific therapeutic
      relationship.

      No study was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic relationship. The assumption is made that
      rTMS with a semi - structured interview provides a qualitative and quantitative clinical
      response greater than a semi - structured rTMS without this nursing care. The investigators
      therefore propose to patients not receiving a semi-structured interview to listen to music
      with eyes closed.

    <time_frame>day 44</time_frame>
    <description>The ratings should be based on a clinical interview moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms to more detailed ones which allow a precise rating of severity. The rater must decide whether the rating lies on the defined scale steps (0, 2, 4, 6) or between them (1, 3, 5). It is important to remember that it is only rare occasions that a depressed patient is encountered who cannot be rated on the items in the scale. If definite answers cannot be elicited from the patients, all relevant clues as well as information from other sources should be used as a basis for the rating in line with customary clinical practice.</description>
