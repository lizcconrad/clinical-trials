      This study measures circulating, misfolded ATTR oligomers in asymptomatic ATTRm amyloidosis
      genetic carriers longitudinally over five years.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in genetic testing have allowed for pathogenic mutation identification in
      family members of affected individuals prior to onset of symptoms. While the presence of
      mutation and the corresponding TTR kinetic stability have been directly linked to disease
      development, the molecular drivers of tissue specific degeneration have not been defined. We
      hypothesize that soluble misfolded TTR oligomer species may be circulating within the blood
      of these patients possibly years prior to amyloid deposition and could serve as an early
      biomarker and/or driver for disease development. In this line, The Scripps Research Institute
      has developed a peptide-based probe that specifically labels and integrates into misfolded
      TTR oligomers allowing the relative circulating concentration in the bloodstream to be
      determined. Longitudinal monitoring of untreated, asymptomatic TTR amyloid genetic carriers
      utilizing the Scripps probe is likely to provide novel insight into early disease
      progression. We also plan to utilize the Scripps probe to monitor disease progression in TTR
      amyloid genetic carriers currently undergoing treatment by observing how treatments affect
      the circulating misfolded TTR oligomers. Through enhanced understanding of early disease
      progression and treatment efficacy, our hope is to limit amyloid accumulation in cardiac and
      nerve tissue and delay the development of the invariably fatal TTR amyloid
      cardiomyopathy/neuropathy.

    <description>1.) To evaluate the relative amount of misfolded ATTR oligomers in asymptomatic ATTR amyloid genetic carriers and correlate their levels with clinical symptoms and outcomes.
Determine if misfolded ATTR oligomers are elevated compared to healthy control data obtained by Scripps during probe development
Describe the levels longitudinally
Determine if treatment with ATTR-specific medications (examples: diflunisal, doxycycline, ursodiol, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), green tea extract, curcumin, tafamidis, inotersen, patisiran) lead to reduction in the probe levels in those with elevated levels at baseline</description>
