    <textblock>
      The Nutritarian Women's Health Study (NWHS) is a long-term hybrid
      effectiveness-implementation study on the effect of the Nutritarian Diet on the occurrence,
      recurrence, and progression of chronic diseases (including all forms of cancer and
      cardiometabolic risk factors).

    <textblock>
      The Nutritional Research Foundation, in conjunction with Northern Arizona University, is
      conducting a long-term health study for women ages 18 and older. This study will address the
      effects of a nutrient dense, plant-rich diet on the long-term risks of cancer and other
      chronic diseases.

      Participants enroll in a 30-day training module which outlines the benefits of a
      nutrient-dense, plant-rich diet. At the conclusion of those videos and written modules, they
      take a short quiz to assess their knowledge and they can enroll in the full study.

      All participation is online with ongoing modules on nutrition and lifestyle. There is a
      comprehensive health history and lifestyle index to be completed. Nutrition questionnaires
      will be administered an average of every 3-6 months; PHQ-9 &amp; PSQI questionnaires an average
      of every 12 months; serum cardiometabolic measures and liquid biopsies an average of every 18
      months.
