  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Berberine from medicinal plants has therapeutic activities against multiple chronic diseases.
      But its absorption rate is very low. The objective of this study is to test if adding TPGS (a
      water-soluble form of vitamin E) as an emulsifier enhance the absorption of berberine in
      human.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Berberine is widely used as an herbal medicine and many health benefits. These
      well-documented in the literature including lowering blood lipids and glucose, having
      anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity, preventing and delaying neurodegenerative diseases
      (Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington disease) and preventing obesity. However, the absorption
      rate of berberine is very low. The study team believes adding TPGS, a water-soluble form of
      vitamin E, as an emulsifier enhance the absorption of berberine in human.

      The bioavailability of berberine is extremely low. Only 0.5% of orally ingested berberine are
      absorbed in small intestine and about 0.36% can enter the systemic circulation. About 56% of
      ingested berberine was not absorbed and additional 43.5% is lost due to metabolism in small
      intestine.

      Vitamin E TPGS is a food additive approved by FDA. It has the potential to increase the
      absorption of drugs and dietary supplements. TPGS is an effective inhibitor of
      P-glycoproteins that are responsible for decreased absorption rate of many drugs including
      berberine. TPGS has the potential be a safe and effective adsorption enhancer for berberine
      and other bioactive botanicals.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To determine whether TPGS emulsification increase the bioavailability of orally ingested
           berberine in human volunteers by increasing its plasma concentration time curve (AUC),
           peak concentration (Cmax), and elimination half time (T1/2).

        2. To determine whether TPGS emulsification alter phase I metabolism, phase II metabolism,
           or metabolism by gut microbiota for orally ingested berberine in human

      The hypothesis of this research is that TPGS emulsification enhances the bioavailability of
      orally ingested berberine in human by altering it metabolism and pharmacokinetic profiles.

      Advertisement will be in the form of flyers. Contact information of investigators will be
      included in the flyer. All participants will be received written and oral information
      regarding the natural and potential risks of the study. The informed consent form will be
      given to the participants to get consent in a private room 7 days before the study.

      Experiment process: Participants will be advised to avoid berberine, vitamin E TGCS
      supplements and foods, excessive amount of alcohol from the beginning of 7-day run in period
      to the end of the study.

      Participants will receive two treatments (A: TPGS emulsified berberine soft gel and B:
      berberine reference powder in hard shell capsules) using a randomized crossover design.
      Treatment A and B provide an equal amount of berberine at 800 mg dose.

      Twelve healthy subjects will be randomly assigned into two groups with five in each group.
      Participants will come to the clinical nutrition lab with self-collected overnight spot urine
      samples to the clinical nutrition lab at FSHN after an overnight 8-10 hour fast with no
      alcohol consumption. A trained and certified phlebotomist will be hired to draw blood. A
      catcher will be implanted in the participants forearm for blood draw. After a baseline blood
      sample is taken, six participants in group A will receive at two capsules of TPGS emulsified
      berberine in soft gel (2x400mg) and six subjects in group B will receive two capsules of the
      berberine reference powder (2x400mg) in hard shell capsules. Additional blood samples will be
      drawn at 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3h, 4 h, 8 h, 10 h and 12 h for analysis of plasma concentrations
      of berberine and berberrubine. In addition, the participants will collect all urine samples
      in a gallon size plastic container during 12 h after the initial dose. A standard breakfast
      of plain bagel with cream cheese will be given to each participant between 0.5 h and 1 h
      blood draw. After 4 h blood draw, subjects will be given an identical meal for lunch.
      Immediately after collection, blood samples will be centrifuged and plasma will be stored at
      -80 degrees C until analysis. The urine samples will be stored at -80 degrees C until
      analysis. After a 7-day washout period, the process will be repeated with each group
      switching over to the other treatment, that is, the group that received treatment A will take
      treatment B and the group that received treatment B will take treatment A.

      Berberine and dihydroberberine in blood exist in nonconjugate free form. A major metabolite
      berberrubine exists in free form and phase II metabolites including sulfates and glucuronide.
      In order to analyze berberrubine in all forms, a portion of plasma or urine will be treated
      with Î²-glucuronidase from Helix pomatia to hydrolyze its sulfate/glucuronides. Berberine and
      berberrubine will be extracted from plasma or urine with or without enzyme treatment using
      solvent or solid phase extraction. The compounds' concentration will be determined using
      HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the plasma concentration
      time curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), time at peak concentration (Tmax), and
      elimination half time (T1/2) will be calculated for berberines, free berberrubine, and total
      berberrubine. Relative absorption will be expressed as the ratio of calculated AUC's.
