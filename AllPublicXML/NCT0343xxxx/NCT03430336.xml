      This study assesses whether an electronic medication management support system improves
      quality, safety, and cost-effectiveness of the drug therapy in adult patients with
      polypharmacy at fifteen (T1) months from baseline compared to usual care.

      Title:

      Application of an electronic medication management support system.

      Objectives:

      The aim of the study is to assess the effectiveness of an electronic medication management
      support system on hospitalization and death, its cost-effectiveness and its effects on the
      quality and safety of prescribing in patients with polypharmacy.

      Methods:

      A parallel, cluster-randomised controlled trial will be conducted in about 1,080 general
      practices located in the Westphalia-Region (Germany), which care for adult patients covered
      by BARMER health insurance. Per group, 17,200 clustered-randomized patients (about 32
      patients per practice) will be included, if they take ≥ 5 long-term prescriptions (at least 2
      consecutive quarters).

      In the intervention group, family physicians will use an user-initiated clinical decision
      support system (CDSS) which provides drug-therapy relevant information (e.g. on diagnoses and
      treatments) and alerts in case of drug-drug, drug-disease and drug-age interactions. Based on
      that information, the family physician systematically assesses the appropriateness of
      patient's medication and optimizes it. Patients receive an updated medication plan in their
      mother's language, if needed.

      In the control group, patients continue to receive usual care where there is no access to the
      CDSS.

      The primary outcome is the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and all-cause hospital
      admissions after 15 months. The outcome measures will be based on secondary data (i.e. claims
      data). Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at patient level. The primary analysis
      will be performed adhering to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the appropriateness of prescriptions</measure>
    <time_frame>observation period of 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the appropriateness of prescriptions: to ascertain whether the complex intervention improves the appropriateness of prescriptions (high-risk prescriptions) in patients with polypharmacy, at T1 minus T0 (T1-T0), measured as the absolute difference in number of inappropriate prescriptions per patient before and after the intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>observation period of 15 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Cost Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>observation period of 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is expressed as the ratio of the difference in overall costs between the control and the intervention group and the difference in effects between both groups.</description>

    <description>External computerized decision support system (CDSS: RpDoc® eMMa Software, RpDoc® Solutions GmbH, Saarbruecken) provides drug-therapy relevant information about participating patients with polypharmacy on demand to the general practitioners (GPs) such as data about diagnoses and treatments. The information is based on claims data gathered from all health care professionals involved in the care of the patient (e.g. specialized physicians, other GPs, psychotherapists as well as data about hospital stays and prescription data from pharmacies).</description>
