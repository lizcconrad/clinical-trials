      Prospective, one-arm, baseline-controlled pilot study for the evaluation of the VelaShape III
      combined with UltraShape Power treatment for non-invasive circumference reduction to the
      thighs.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will receive 3 bi-weekly treatments to the thighs at 2-week intervals, with
      the VelaShape III and UltraShape Power devices according to the study protocol.

      Each subject will return for 3 follow up visits: four weeks (4wk FU), 8 weeks (8wk FU) and 12
      weeks (12wk FU) after the last treatment (Tx.3), for total expected study duration of 16
      weeks.

    <description>The VelaShape III, the newest generation VelaShape, is a device based on the CE-cleared VelaShape II and FDA-cleared Transcend device (K120510). All devices combine controlled infrared (IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies with vacuum. The VelaShape III device is indicated for relief of minor muscle aches and pain, relief of muscle spasm, temporary improvement of local blood circulation, temporary reduction in the appearance of cellulite, and for temporary reduction of thighs and abdomen circumference.
The VelaShape III device has 150W RF energy.</description>

    <description>The newest generation UltraShape device, UltraShape Power, includes a small transducer (U-Sculpt Power), and is FDA-cleared (K170370) for lipolysis (breakdown of fat) to provide a non-invasive approach to achieve a desired aesthetic effect. It is intended for non-invasive reduction in abdominal circumference and fat reduction in the flanks and thighs.</description>
