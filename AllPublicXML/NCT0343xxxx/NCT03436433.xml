  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to assess the need for seizure prophylaxis in the perioperative
      period for patients undergoing craniotomy for suspected diagnosis of new, recurrent or
      transformed glioma (WHO grade I-IV). This will be determined by observing the impact of
      Lacosamide (LCM), Levetiracetam (LEV), or no anti-epileptic drug (AED) on whether visits to
      the emergency department (ED) or hospital re-admissions occur within 30 days after
      craniotomy. A secondary endpoint will evaluate the safety and tolerability of LCM and LEV.
      Exploratory endpoints will evaluate admission duration for the craniotomy, number of
      post-operative provider communications (telephone, email, and additional clinic encounters,
      etc.), and patient risk factors associated with post-operative seizure.

      The protocol will assess the need for AED prophylaxis during the post-operative period in
      patients undergoing craniotomy for a suspected diagnosis of glioma (WHO grade I-IV). Patients
      (n=116) will be consented and randomized at their pre-operative assessment, either at their
      pre-operative clinic visit or in the ED, if that is the time of their initial presentation
      prior to surgery. There will be three arms to the study - patients will be randomized to LCM,
      LEV, or control (no AED). Randomization will be stratified by suspected grade (LGG vs HGG).
      The AED can be initiated anytime within 48 hours before a craniotomy incision.

      Doses will be either LCM 100mg twice a day (BID) (Arm A), LEV 1000mg BID (Arm B), or no AED
      (Arm C). If a patient is randomized to Arm C and undergoes tumor mapping, the patient is
      allowed to receive one dose of AED in the operating room. If a patient is randomized to Arm A
      or Arm B and takes the morning dose of their AED, they do not need an intra-operative dose of
      AED. If a patient has a seizure during the post-operative period, AEDs will be adjusted at
      the discretion of the treating physician. However, if a patient has intolerable side effects,
      patients will be changed to a different dose of the same medicine before consideration of
      another AED [i.e., BID to four times a day (QID) dosing if patient experiences diplopia on
      LCM].

      Patients with high-grade tumors (newly-diagnosed or transformed) will be treated with
      standard radiation and temozolomide therapy per the Stupp protocol 25,70. For these patients,
      an AED taper will be initiated at the first clinic visit after completion of radiation. For
      patients with a low-grade tumor or recurrent disease of any grade, an AED taper will be
      initiated at the first scheduled post-operative visit, approximately 6-10 weeks after the
      operation. LCM will be tapered by 100mg a week one week at a time. LEV will be tapered
      500-1000mg one week at a time.
