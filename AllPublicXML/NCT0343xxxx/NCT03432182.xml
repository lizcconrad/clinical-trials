  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is a key factor for normal brain development of the newborn. However, it is poorly
      studied and little is known about its characterization, especially in premature infants. Body
      movements during sleep are easy to evaluate but studies on their relationship to normal sleep
      states are scarce and limited. This project aims to characterize body movements during sleep,
      assessed by electroencephalography, in very premature infants. Then, a correlation between
      body movements, sleep organization and neurodevelopmental outcome will be evaluated at 3
      years of age.
