    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in three phases:

      The first phase involved creation of a Spanish adaptation of the Melodic Intonation therapy;
      the second phase consisted of a pilot non-randomized intervention study to analyse its
      feasibility for use with 4 Spanish patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia; the third
      phase consisted of a pilot randomised, crossover, intervention pilot trial in a different set
      of patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia (N=20)

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients diagnosed with nonfluent aphasia due to unilateral stroke in the left hemisphere
        without neuroimaging evidence of lesions in the right hemisphere who fulfilled the
        following criteria:

          -  The time elapsed since the stroke exceeded 6 months.

          -  Patient had received a standard program of conventional speech therapy after stroke.

          -  Persistent nonfluent aphasia with the following characteristics:

               -  Severely restricted language, which might be limited to meaningless stereotypy;
                  unlike that observed in verbal tasks, the patient might produce some real and
                  relevant words when singing familiar songs.

               -  Poor repetition, even for single words.

               -  Moderately preserved language comprehension.

               -  The nonstereotyped language was produced with a slurring of speech.

               -  The total score for the repetition did not exceed the 70th percentile in the
                  Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. The score was obtained from the average
                  score in three areas: repetition of words and repetition of phrases; listening
                  comprehension exceeding the 15th percentile of Boston Diagnostic Aphasia
                  Examination; and from the average score obtained in three areas: word
                  comprehension, commands and complex ideational material.

          -  The patient was motivated, emotionally stable and had good attention.

          -  Signed informed consent was provided.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with a history of a previous stroke other than the index event or with any
             clinical condition (e.g., short life expectancy, coexisting disease) or other
             characteristics that precluded appropriate follow-up in the study

          -  patients participating in any therapeutic intervention clinical trials evaluating
             poststroke recovery

          -  use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with patient evaluation.
