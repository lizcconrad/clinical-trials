      Smartphone apps may be useful to guide and support individuals in self-management strategies.
      Primary dysmenorrhea is a very common problem for women. With a randomized, pragmatic study
      the investigators aim to evaluate whether a smartphone app for women with menstrual pain is
      effective in reducing menstrual pain in 18-34-year-old women with primary dysmenorrhea. For
      this the investigators compare the complete smartphone app with two control versions of this
      app. The complete app provides evidence-based self-care information and instructions for
      self-acupressure in menstrual pain, the control intervention I includes self-care
      information, but no instructions for self-acupressure, and control intervention II includes
      instructions for self-acupressure, but no self-care information. The investigators aim to
      observe 594 women with primary dysmenorrhea over 12 menstruation cycles. The primary outcome
      is the mean pain intensity on the days with pain during the 6th menstruation after
      randomization using a numerical rating scale (NRS; 0=no pain; 10=strongest pain imaginable).
      Women are eligible when they suffer from primary dysmenorrhea, are between 18 and 34 years
      old, not pregnant and do not plan to be pregnant within the next 12 months.

    <description>The acupressure feature offers detailed written and multimedia descriptions of an acupressure used for menstrual pain. Three acupressure points are described, which should be massaged bilaterally twice a day up to five times a day on the 5 days before menstruation and during menstruation. Each point should be massaged for 2 minutes. A timer for the acupressure and notifications from the app which can be deactivated remind women of surveys and acupressure.</description>
