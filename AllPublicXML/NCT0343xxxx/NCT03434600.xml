  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparison of two unicompartmental knee arthroplasties (UKA), to see if Sigma UKA performs
      equally good as the Oxford UKA. The study focuses on how well the arthroplasty is fixated to
      the bone and on the difference in wear of the plastic insert. Finally, the functional outcome
      after surgery is compared between the two arthroplasties.

      Hypothesis:

      H1: The Sigma UKA has an equal migration pattern compared to the Oxford UKA with a follow up
      of two years - that is, no significant difference in migration between 1-2 years follow-up.

      H2: The Oxford and Sigma UKA's have comparable polyethylene wear with a follow up of 5 years.

      H3: The Oxford and Sigma UKA's have comparable patient perceived outcome measures (PROM) and
      leg extension power (LEP) postoperative.
