    <textblock>
      Randomized, open-label, 3-way crossover study

      Up to 66 healthy, adult male and female subjects will be enrolled.

      All subjects will receive Corplex Donepezil TDS patches applied to 3 different locations on
      each subject (back, buttock, and leg) during 3 different, consecutive treatment periods. For
      each subject, the location of product administration during each treatment period will be
      randomized.

      During each treatment period, all subjects will receive a once-weekly 10 mg TDS, target dose
      10 mg donepezil/day, applied for 7 days (1 week) on either the back, buttock, or leg in
      accordance with the randomized treatment location for that treatment period.

      Blood samples for donepezil PK will be collected pre-dose until the end of each treatment
      period. The PK sample collection time points are as follows:

      Week 1: Pre-TDS application prior to 0 hour and post-TDS application at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48,
      60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132, 144, and 156 hours.

      Week 2: Pre-Week 1 TDS removal at 168 hours, and post-TDS removal at up to 528 hours

      Adhesion and skin irritation will be monitored throughout TDS treatments. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study by adverse event reporting, repeated clinical and laboratory
      evaluations.
