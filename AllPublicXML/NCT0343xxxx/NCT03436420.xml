  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label, Phase 2, proof of concept study to test
      preliminary efficacy and safety of gemcabene in children with established nonalcoholic fatty
      liver disease (NAFLD) incompletely treated by lifestyle changes. The hypothesis of the study
      is that 300 mg of gemcabene once a day for 12 weeks will reduce ALT, hepatic steatosis,
      dyslipidemia and down regulate de novo lipogenesis in children with NAFLD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has quickly become the most common liver disease in
      children in the US and is rising worldwide. While the true prevalence and incidence are not
      known, estimates have placed prevalence in the US as high as 7 million children. The
      prevalence varies greatly across race and ethnic groups with Hispanic, Asian and White
      children having increased rates compared to African American children. Lifestyle changes are
      the first line treatment, but many children fail to respond to these. Pharmaceutical
      treatments are needed for children that cure NAFLD and ideally also benefit the systemic
      features (dyslipidemia, insulin sensitivity, BMI). Gemcabene calcium (Gemcabene) is a
      promising therapeutic that may benefit pediatric NAFLD and early phase trials are needed to
      support further development for this indication. It has several mechanisms of action
      including enhancing the clearance of VLDL and blocking the production of hepatic triglyceride
      and cholesterol synthesis. Gemcabene was previously tested in adults for treatment of
      dyslipidemia and has extensive safety data.

      In this study, 40 children ages 12-17 years with histologically confirmed NAFLD or MRI based
      diagnosis and elevated ALT will receive 300 mg of gemcabene per day for 12 weeks. Study
      visits will occur at screening, baseline, week 2, week 6 and week 12. A follow up phone call
      will occur one month after the child stops taking the study medication.
