  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effectiveness of a Finnish Tulppa outpatient rehabilitation
      program. Tulppa is a group-based secondary prevention program for patients with vascular
      diseases. The program is developed by the Finnish Heart Association. The intervention is
      implemented at the local primary health care centers in 12 health districts in Finland.

      A longitudinal controlled study is used to investigate the effects of the intervention on
      participants' level of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. lipids, blood pressure, body mass
      index), functional capacity (e.g. 6 minute walk test), life style as well as psychosocial
      factors (e.g. smoking, diet, physical activity, health-related quality of life and
      depression). The data will be collected at baseline (i.e. before the intervention), and 6 and
      12 months after the intervention started.

      The participants (n = 300) are patients diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The study
      group (n = 150) is recruited from participants of Tulppa rehabilitation in two health care
      districts (Pirkanmaa and Southern Karelia). The control group (n = 150) is recruited from two
      health care districts (Turku and Hyvinkää) that do not provide Tulppa rehabilitation.

    <measure>Health related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes between baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health related quality of life is assessed with the finnish version of RAND-36-Item Health Survey (36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument - SF-36; Aalto, Aro &amp; Teperi, 1999). The RAND-36 is a generic health-related survey consisting of 36 items with eight sub-scales: 1. general health, 2. bodily pain, 3. physical functioning, 4. role limitations/physical, 5. role limitations/emotional, 6. vitality, 7. mental health, and 8. social functioning. The total score is a sum of the eight subscales and the range is 0 - 100. Higher scores on the scale indicate a better quality of life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified North Karelia CVD risk score</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes between baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The limit values to calculate the CVD risk score were originally developed during the North Karelia project (Puska et al., 2009) and were further elaborated by Ketola (2001). The modified CVD risk score consists of six risk factors:
Body mass index (BMI)
Smoking
Physical inactivity
Systolic blood pressure
Diastolic blood pressure
Total cholesterol. The total score of the index is a sum of the 6 risk factors and the range is 0-16, the cut-off point indicating high risk of CVD is 4.5. Higher scores on the scale indicate a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. Subscore outcomes of the CVD risk score are defined as secondary outcome measures below.</description>

    <time_frame>Changes between baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be measured using The finnish Depression Scale DEPS (Salokangas, R. K., Poutanen, O &amp; Stengard, E.,1995). 10 items, the items are rated from 0 to 3 (0 = not at all... ...3 = very much) and the range of the total score is 0-30. Higher scores on the scale indicate a higher probability of depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes between baseline, 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be assessed with the state-anxiety sub-scale of the Endler Multidimensional Anxiety Scales (EMAS-State) (Endler, N. S., Parker, J. D. A., Bagby, R. M., &amp; Cox, B. J., 1991). The State-anxiety sub-scale consists of 20 items evaluated on a five-point Likert scale (score range 20-100). EMAS-State assesses two components of state-anxiety : a cognitive worry component and an autonomic-emotional component. Both components consist of ten items. In this study the 10 items of a cognitive worry component is used. Higher scores indicate a higher level of cognitive worry.</description>

    <measure>Family support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months and twelve months</time_frame>
    <description>Partner support will be measured with a Finnish 12-item Family Support (FS) scale (Julkunen &amp; Greenglass, 1989; Gustavsson-Lilius M., Julkunen J., &amp; Hietanen P., 2007). The items are rated using a five-step Likert scale (1 = completely disagree… 5 = completely agree) and the range of the total score is 12 - 60. The sum-score of the scale reflects the respondents' perceived degree of emotional and instrumental support received from other family members. Higher scores on the scale indicates higher amount of perceived support from the family.</description>
