  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal aims at evaluating an inspiratory muscle training (IMT) method not previously
      tested in COPD called the Test of Incremental Respiratory Endurance (TIRE). As a training
      method, TIRE promises to provide further benefits over standard IMT because it allows the
      user to adjust training loads as progress is made, adjusts the training based on day-to-day
      variations commonly noted in COPD, and provides a graphic representation of the inspiratory
      effort throughout all inspiration with real-time biofeedback in order to &quot;coach&quot; the user in
      performing the exercises. The TIRE device can also be used as an assessment tool, not only to
      measure the commonly used measure of inspiratory muscle strength Maximal Inspiratory Pressure
      (MIP), but also measuring the MIP variation generated throughout a maximal sustained
      inspiration. In this way, TIRE integrates MIP over the inspiratory duration (ID), providing a
      novel derivative measure called the sustained maximal inspiratory pressure or SMIP, that is
      likely a better surrogate of inspiratory muscle performance in COPD based upon preliminary
      data. The main goal of this trial is to fully evaluate the utility of TIRE as an IMT method
      in veterans with COPD. The investigators hypothesize that as a stand-alone therapy, TIRE
      training is superior to standard IMT in improving inspiratory muscle strength and endurance
      and in improving COPD-related clinical outcomes.

    <description>SMIP is obtained from a maximal sustained inspiratory effort performed through the TIRE method using the PrO2 device. SMIP is documented in pressure time units (PTU) and represents the area under the curve generated from the start to the end of inspiration, from residual volume to total lung capacity.</description>

    <measure>Fat Free Mass Index (FFMI)</measure>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The TIRE IMT group will receive a tablet with the TIRE software installed and a PrO2® device through which they will train. Training consists of six levels (A-F) with six inspirations at each level for a total of 36 breaths. Recovery times between breaths range from 40 to 5 seconds as the subject advances each level. TIRE data will be stored in the tablet for subsequent interrogation and data retrieval.</description>

    <description>The Standard IMT group will receive a Threshold® Inspiratory Muscle Trainer. This device incorporates a flow-independent one-way valve to ensure consistent resistance and features an adjustable specific pressure setting to be set based on MIP values of each subject. Subjects will be instructed to perform up to 36 breaths daily. To compare with TIRE training, we will ask participants to perform this within a 30-minute session.</description>
