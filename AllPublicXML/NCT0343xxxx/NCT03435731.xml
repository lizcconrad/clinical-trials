  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered the gold standard therapy for
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, CPAP users sometimes experience pressure-related
      discomfort. It is thought that lower CPAP pressure may increase comfort and lead to greater
      treatment adherence.

      Mandibular advancement splint (MAS) therapy has been shown to be the preferred OSA treatment
      option among patients. However, MAS therapy is only partially effective in some OSA patients,
      especially in severe cases.

      It is thought that a combination of MAS and PAP therapy may benefit patients in which MAS
      alone is only partially effective. Using MAS and PAP at the same time is called &quot;Dual
      Therapy&quot;. Dual Therapy may allow a lower CPAP pressure to be applied, which may increase
      patient comfort and therefore increase treatment adherence and overall effectiveness.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of 1 month of Dual Therapy in 30 OSA patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective clinical trial assessing the effect of 1-month of dual therapy on
      patients with varying baseline OSA severity (mild to severe) who have been previously fully
      titrated to both PAP and MAS.

      This study will be conducted at 2 research centers; the Faculty of Dentistry, University of
      British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver and at the Faculty of Dentistry, Université de Montréal
      (UdM), Montréal.

      The research team will access participants' records to confirm eligibility for dual therapy.
      The clinical research coordinator will contact eligible patients via phone to ask if they are
      interested in taking part in the study. Eligible patients will also be asked if they are
      interested in taking part in the study during routine clinic visits. Where possible, patients
      will not be approached by their primary caregiver regarding participation in this study, to
      ensure patients do not feel pressurized into participating. Choosing not to take part in the
      study will not affect the participants' quality of care. If a patient is interested in taking
      part in the study they will be invited to review and sign the informed consent form.

      Consenting participants will be asked to use both MAS and PAP (dual therapy) together for a
      period of 1 month. During the first week of the dual therapy, PAP pressure will be adjusted
      automatically for a 1-week period, after which the pressure will be set remotely by the
      Respiratory Therapist at the 90th percentile.

      With permission, the research team will access the Sleep Apnea Dental Clinic records to
      collect data relating to previous treatment with MAS and PAP monotherapies. Data collected
      includes: PAP pressure, treatment adherence, subjective treatment assessment, Epworth
      Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaires (FOSQ), weight, blood
      pressure and oximetry data.

      At the end of the 1-month, a subjective and objective assessment will be conducted.
      Subjective data will be collected using a short questionnaire that will be completed by the
      participants pertaining to their experience with the dual therapy in addition to completing a
      short term medical/treatment update form. Participants' weight and blood pressure will also
      be reassessed. Objective adherence will be analyzed via data obtained from the PAP modem and
      from DentiTrac® smart chips embedded in the MAS. OSA-related quality of life will be
      reassessed using ESS and FOSQ questionnaires.

    <description>Evaluation of OSA specific fatigue using Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire. ESS measures daytime sleepiness via 8 questions that ask about daytime sleepiness during common everyday conditions. The potential range of scores for any questions is from 0 to 3. Higher values represent worse outcomes. Their are no subscales for ESS. The answers to the questions are all summed up. Total score ranges between 0 and 24. A score above 10 indicates daytime sleepiness with higher scores indicating more sleepiness.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (from previous treatment) and 1 month after commencing Dual Therapy treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>FOSQ-10 measures functional status and difficulty in performing everyday activities via 10 questions. The range of scores for any question is from 1 to 4. There is also a 0 score option for participants who do not engage in a particular activity for other reasons, in which case the question will be excluded. There are 5 subscales that measure: general productivity, activity level, vigilance, social outcomes, and intimacy and sexual relationships. To obtain the total score, a mean-weighted item score is computed for those subscales with more than one item. To calculate a mean-weighted item score calculate the mean of the answered items with responses &gt; 1 for each subscale. The total score is then derived by calculating the mean of the subscale scores and multiplying that mean by five. Total score ranges between 5 and 20. Higher scores indicate better functional status.</description>
