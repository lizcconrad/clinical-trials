      This study will examine the effect of LASER photobiomodulation therapy on pain and opioid
      pain medication weaning on patients who are undergoing opioid pain medication weaning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if treatment with LASER
      photobiomodulation therapy reduces pain and facilitates opioid pain medication (OPM)
      reduction (weaning). The subject group includes patients with chronic pain who are undergoing
      OPM weaning and are candidates for LASER photobiomodulation therapy. This is a prospective
      interventional study using a double-blind 4-period crossover design to assess the efficacy of
      HIGH POWER LASER photobiomodulation therapy compared to sham (LOW POWER LASER) therapy in
      reducing pain and improving compliance with OPM weaning.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective interventional study using a double-blind 4-period crossover design to assess the efficacy of LASER Photobiomodulation therapy compared to sham (LOW POWER LASER) therapy in reducing pain and improving compliance with OPM weaning. LASER photobiomodulation treatments or sham treatments will be provided three times a week using standardized protocols. Crossover will occur every 3 weeks with weekly data collection occurring at the end of each week allowing for washout and to minimize the carryover effects of active treatment. Data collection will consist of LASER and sham treatments, prescribed pain medication dosage and quantity, subjective pain questionnaires, and urine samples. Cognitive and memory screening will occur every 3 weeks at the end of each period prior to crossover.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Compliance with Medical Opioid Use Reduction Protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Prescriptions for pain medications will be provided each week. Each successive prescription will have a decreasing quantity of tablets consistent with an agreed upon taper rate. Taper rates will be roughly based upon the recommendations of the CDC (10% per week). Subjects will have the option of postponing the taper by one week as often as every other week. If a subject was to exercise every option available to them to delay taper, then the weaning process would take twice as long and the rate of taper would be cut in half.
The study will compare the number of missed medication tapers, and the taper rates of patients in the HIGH POWER LASER treatment periods to those in the LOW LEVEL LASER THERAPY treatment periods.</description>

    <description>Treatment, either LASER (arm A) or LOW LEVEL LASER (arm B) will be provided 3 (not less than 2) days a week for three weeks at which time crossover into the alternate arm occurs (BABA to ABAB or ABAB to BABA).
ABAB initial period is active treatment - LASER.
Active Treatment:
LASER light is delivered to the skin and deeper tissues affected by pain using either a wand or glass roller ball. Ten to 25 Watts of LASER energy is delivered to the painful regions for 8 to 16 minutes depending on the size of the area treated and other factors such as skin pigmentation.</description>

LOW LEVEL LASER &quot;treatment&quot;:
Low level LASER is provided in a similar fashion using LASER power levels (1 Watt) that produce warmth only at superficial skin levels.</description>
