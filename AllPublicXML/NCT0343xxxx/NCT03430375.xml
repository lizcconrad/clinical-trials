  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To examine the safety of the use of two wheelchair cushions for healthy individuals
      with intact sensation and individuals post stroke and spinal cord injury with impaired
      sensation. The new Ease Alternating Pressure wheelchair cushion will be compared to a static
      air cushion to examine interface pressure and skin responses in the areas of the buttock and
      posterior thighs when subjects sit without moving (static condition) and during upper
      extremity reaching activities (active condition). In addition, comfort, ease of transfer, and
      postural stability will be monitored while sitting on both cushions under both static and
      active conditions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty healthy adults (age range = 20 - 85 years) with intact buttock and bilateral posterior
      thigh sensation and intact skin integrity will be recruited. Twenty additional individuals
      (ages 20 - 85 years) with a history of stroke (n=10) and spinal cord injury (n=10) with
      documented sensory impairment, but intact skin integrity in the area of the buttock and
      posterior thighs will also be recruited. Individuals post-stroke will likely have impaired
      sensation on one side of their buttock &amp; leg; whereas, individuals post-spinal cord injury
      will likely have impaired sensation bilaterally in the buttock and posterior thigh areas. The
      goal is to recruit equal numbers of males and females with a variety of body builds (height,
      weight, and body mass index) across the age range in both groups.

      Procedures: In one 2 1/2 hour session, participants will a) sit still on [static condition]
      and b) perform the dynamic task of reaching in multiple directions [active condition] on the
      Ease alternating pressure cushion and on one static air cushion [randomized for order] for an
      estimated duration of one hour (32 minutes x two cushions) so that pressure mapping
      comparisons between cushions can be made. &quot;The motion of the Ease cushions regularly shifts
      those points of pressure [every 3 minutes], and allows fresh blood to flow where the pressure
      has been lifted.&quot; Pressure mapping will capture the pressure amount, duration, and
      distribution of pressure between the skin of the buttock and posterior thighs and the
      wheelchair cushion surface. Documentation of the skin response (skin becomes pink, red, or
      blanches), and the participant's subjective opinions of comfort, ease of transfer, and
      postural stability will occur.

    <intervention_model_description>Each of 3 populations or groups (healthy adults, participants post-stroke, participants with spinal cord injury) will sit on two wheelchair cushions (alternating air cushion, static air cushion) under two conditions including static sitting (#1 static condition) and while performing upper extremity reaching (#2 active condition) while monitoring interface pressure between the cushion and buttock/posterior thighs.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants, care providers if present, and investigators who are the outcomes assessors will all be aware of which cushion that the participant is sitting on, the participants' diagnoses or if healthy, the static and active conditions described above, and outcome measures results; therefore, no masking is taking place.</masking_description>

    <description>The participants in all three populations or groups (healthy adults, adults with stroke, and adults with spinal cord injury) will first sit on the alternating air wheelchair cushion for 32 minutes and then the static air cushion for 32 minutes under two conditions (static: sitting without intentional moving) and (active: reaching with their upper extremity) while pressure mapping and skin responses are recorded. The Ease alternating air wheelchair cushion inflates/deflates which shifts the points of pressure [every 3 minutes] and allows fresh blood to flow where the pressure has been lifted.
