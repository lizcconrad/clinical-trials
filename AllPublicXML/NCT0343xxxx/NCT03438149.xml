  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is independently associated with cardiovascular diseases,
      including myocardial infarction and stroke. OSA may promote atherosclerosis risk factors such
      as hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia and may have direct proatherogenic effects on the
      vascular wall. A growing number of studies have recently focused on the role of
      microparticles (MPs) in the atherogenic process. Case-control studies have shown that
      platelet-, endothelial- and leukocyte-derived MP levels are increased in OSA and that
      leukocyte-derived MP are released during the night in OSA. Furthermore, experimental evidence
      shows that MPs from OSA patients induce endothelial dysfunction.

      The objective of this prospective study is to evaluate the impact of increased levels of
      leukocyte derived MPs on the cardiovascular outcomes in patients with prevalent
      cardiovascular diseases investigated for OSA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MPs are small plasma membrane vesicles that can be released by a variety of vascular or blood
      cells and that contain membrane and cytosolic elements. Case-control studies have shown that
      platelet-, endothelial- and leukocyte-derived MP levels are increased in OSA. Experimental
      evidence shows that MPs from OSA patients induce endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and
      vascular hyperreactivity when injected to mice.

      The impact of increased levels of MPs on the cardiovascular prognosis in OSA patient with
      prevalent cardiovascular diseases in unknown.
