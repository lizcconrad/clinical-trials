  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization recommends regular surveillance of antimalarial efficacy to
      monitor the performance of different drugs. The Tanzanian National Malaria Control Programme
      (NMCP) in collaboration with its partners have been implementing therapeutic efficacy studies
      (TES) to monitor the performance of different antimalarials in the country. Most of the
      studies conducted in recent years focused on artemether-lumefantrine which is the first line
      antimalarial for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Mainland Tanzania. However, data
      on the performance of other artemisinin based combination therapy (ACTs) is urgently needed
      to support timely review and changes of treatment guidelines in case of drug resistance to
      current regimen. This study was undertaken in the same NMCP framework to assess the efficacy
      and safety of alternative ACTs used or with potential use in Tanzania. The study assessed the
      efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)
      for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania. The study was undertaken at two NMCP
      sentinel sites of Kibaha and Ujiji from July to December 2017.
