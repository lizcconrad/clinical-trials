  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of delivering
      cognitive training over mTurk. Subjects will be randomized to a 1) inhibitory control
      training condition, 2) working memory training condition, or 3) control training condition.
      Recent studies have also demonstrated the feasibility and potential efficacy of delivering
      brief normative feedback to reduce alcohol consumption through mTurk. In these brief
      interventions, subjects are provided information about their drinking compared to their same
      age and gendered peers. Approximately half of the subjects in each cognitive training group
      will receive normative feedback to evaluate effects on alcohol consumption and possible
      interactions with cognitive training. This study will focus on alcohol use given the ease and
      clinical acceptance of alcohol use self-report as a primary outcome.

    <intervention_model_description>An Internet survey hosted by Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics: Online Survey Software will be used in this protocol. Cognitive tasks will be coded using PsyToolKit, an open-source tool for programming and running cognitive-psychological experiments and surveys online (Stoet, 2017). A mixed-model design will be used such that subjects are randomly assigned to one of three cognitive training conditions and two information feedback conditions (i.e., between-subjects variables). The same subjects will be sampled at each time point in the study (i.e., repeated/longitudinal variables).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>A battery of working memory tasks will be used during the intervention period. These tasks were selected from previous research evaluating working memory training in substance use disorder (Bickel et al., 2011b; Houben et al., 2011b). Tasks will include visuospatial working memory task, digit span task, letter span task, and the n-back task.

Subjects assigned to not receive normative feedback will receive feedback on time spent doing a non-alcohol related activity as an attention/informational control (e.g., time spent watching television; LaBrie et al., 2013).</description>
