      A Single arm, Multicenter, International Trial of Tisotumab Vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) in
      Previously Treated, Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of tisotumab
      vedotin in patients with previously treated, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.
      Tisotumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting tissue factor (TF), a protein
      aberrantly expressed in a wide number of tumors including cervical cancer. Preliminary safety
      and efficacy data observed in a cohort of previously treated cervical cancer patients suggest
      a positive benefit risk profile for this population of high unmet need.
