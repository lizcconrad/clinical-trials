      In this study the investigators wish to investigate whether a short duration High-intensity
      Interval Training(HIT) is superior to a moderate activity training modus with regards to
      improving weight-loss, Blood pressure and sleep quality in severely obese children and
      adolescents also receiving a multidisciplinary treatment regime.

    <textblock>
      Prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents are rapidly rising
      worldwide. Despite the alarming situation, great confusion of how to tackle obesity persists
      for two main reasons: the condition is much more complex than initially thought, and many
      aspects regarding pathophysiology remain unrevealed, leading to an insufficient understanding
      of the disorder. Childhood obesity is, strongly associated with numerous disorders e.g.
      hypertension, insuline resistance, sleep apnea, depression and many more.

      High intensity Interval Training has proven beneficial in treating obesity and comorbidities
      in adults. The investigators wish to investigate whether twelve weeks of High-intensity
      Interval Training(HIT) twice a week is superior to a moderate activity training modus for
      same period of time with regards to improving weight loss, blood pressure and sleep quality,
      in severely obese children and adolescents also receiving a multidisciplinary treatment
      regime. Participants are severely obese children and adolescents referred to the outpatient
      Clinic for treatment of obesity. Participants are randomizid to either moderate training or
      HIIT. Antropometric measures, blood pressure and sleep quality as measured by sensewear
      armbands, are done at baseline, after the twelve weeks of training and again one year after
      inclusion. Participants are monitored with pulse monitors during training sessions to
      register if training goals are obtained.
