  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death in industrialized countries. Among them,
      atherosclerosis has the highest prevalence and constitutes a common pathological pathway
      responsible for the majority of cases of chronic ischemic heart disease, acute myocardial
      infarction, heart failure and cerebrovascular disease. Classic studies have confirmed
      well-established etiopathogenic factors of atherosclerosis based on genetic and immunological
      components and environmental modifying agents such as diet and exercise. But in addition,
      recent experimental studies have shown that dysbiosis (alteration of the microbiota) may be
      an additional factor that participates in the onset and progression of atherosclerosis. The
      objective of this study is to identify the potential interactions between changes in the
      microbiota, changes in the immune status, and the instability and progression of
      atherosclerosis.

      The study will prospectively study two groups of patients with diabetes mellitus: 1) patients
      with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and 2) age and sex matched
      patients with chronic stable documented atherosclerosis. The study will focus on diabetic
      patients, since it is the population in which the incidence of atherosclerosis is higher and
      the systemic inflammatory response is more aggressive.

      Immune cell populations and immune-related metabolites will be characterized, the genetic
      profile of the main known functional variants will be determined, and the oral,
      gastrointestinal, and blood microbiota will be compared in both groups in a transversal
      observational design.

      In addition, in the NSTE-ACS group, 1-year clinical and angiographic follow-up will be
      performed with functional assessment and intravascular imaging and the degree of remodelling
      of the atherosclerotic plaque will be correlated with the evolution of the microbiota and
      immune response in a longitudinal design.

    <description>In patients who have been successfully revascularized the artery responsible for AMI and also present an intermediate lesion (40-80%) in another coronary territory, the clinical care protocol of the Cardiology Service stipulates the need for a physiological assessment with guidance of pressure (FFR).
The thickness of the fibrous cap shall be measured using optical coherence tomography.
In addition to the FFR measurement, a complete physiological assessment with a Doppler-pressure guide. This will allow the procedure to be performed without additional risk to the patient. The physiological study will include the analysis of endothelium-dependent vascular function and endothelium-independent vascular function.</description>
