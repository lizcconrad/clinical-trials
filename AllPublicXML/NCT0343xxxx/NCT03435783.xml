  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this research is to use both qualitative and quantitative data to
      inform the development of a technology-based intervention for heavy drinking and sexual risk
      behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM) who are seeking free HIV testing.
      Investigators will be conducting a randomized-controlled pilot test of the intervention among
      MSM seeking HIV testing in community-based settings to explore its potential impact on
      alcohol and HIV-related behavioral outcomes. This research will ultimately produce a
      combined, theory-based, and technology- delivered intervention for heavy drinking and sex
      risk that is fully portable and has been preliminarily tested for efficacy in community
      settings where high-risk MSM engage with prevention services.
