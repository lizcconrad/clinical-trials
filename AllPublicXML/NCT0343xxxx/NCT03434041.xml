  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of switching adult participants with
      treatment-resistant depression (TRD) from a prior antidepressant treatment (to which they
      have not responded) to flexibly dosed intranasal esketamine (56 milligram [mg] or 84 mg) plus
      a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with switching to a newly initiated oral
      antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo, in improving depressive symptoms.
      Efficacy will be assessed by the change from baseline in the Montgomery Asberg Depression
      Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from Day 1 (before randomization) to the end of the 4-week
      double-blind treatment phase.

    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Double-Blind Treatment Phase (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, sleep, appetite, concentration, lassitude, inability to feel (interest level), pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts.</description>

    <description>Onset of Clinical Response is defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent (%) improvement in MADRS total score by the day after taking the first dose [that is, Day 2] of double blind intranasal medication, that is sustained through the end of the 4-week double-blind treatment phase. The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.

    <description>The SDS is a participant-reported outcome measure and is a 5-item questionnaire which has been widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability. The first three items assess disruption of (1) work/school, (2) social life, and (3) family life/home responsibilities using a 0-10 rating scale. The score for the first three items are summed to create a total score of 0-30 where a higher score indicates greater impairment.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants in remission (defined as MADRS total score less than or equal to [&lt;=]12) will be reported. The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition.

    <description>Percentage of participants with sustained remission (defined as MADRS total score &lt;=12) will be reported. The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60.

    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Double-Blind Treatment Phase (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S evaluates the severity of psychopathology on a scale of 0 to 7. Considering total clinical experience, a participant is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating according to: 0=not assessed; 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill participants. Higher score indicates worsening. The CGI-S permits a global evaluation of the participant's condition at a given time.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Double-blind Treatment Phase (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a participant-reported brief and validated measure of overall anxiety. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0=not at all; 1=several days; 2=more than half the days; 3=nearly every day). Item responses are summed to yield a total score (range of 0 to 21), with higher scores indicating more anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and End of Double-blind Treatment Phase (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome, primarily designed for self-completion by respondents. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises following 5 dimensions: Mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each of 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems (Level 1: no problem, Level 2: slight problems, Level 3: moderate problems, Level 4: severe problems, and Level 5: extreme problems). The participant selects an answer for each of 5 dimensions considering response that best matches his or her health &quot;today&quot;. The descriptive system can be represented as a health state.</description>

             MDD (if single-episode MDD, the duration must be greater than or equal to [&gt;=] 2
             years), without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by
             the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (mental status questionnaire) (MINI)

          -  At the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, participant must have
             had non-response (less than or equal to [&lt;=] 25 percent [%] improvement) to &gt;=1 but
             &lt;=5 (if current episode is greater than (&gt;) 2 years or not definable, upper limit is
             applicable to only the last 2 years) oral antidepressant treatments in the current
             episode of depression, assessed using the Massachusetts General Hospital -
             Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGH-ATRQ) and confirmed by documented
             records (for example, medical/ pharmacy/prescription records or letter from a treating
             physician). In addition, the participant is taking a different oral antidepressant
             treatment (on the MGH-ATRQ) for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the minimum
             therapeutic dose

          -  The participant's current major depressive episode, depression symptom severity (Week
             1 Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score &gt;=28 required), and
             antidepressant treatment response in the current depressive episode, must be confirmed
             using a Site Independent Qualification Assessment

          -  Participant must be medically stable on the basis of physical examination, medical
             history, vital signs (including blood pressure), pulse oximetry, and 12-lead

             there are any abnormalities that are not specified in the inclusion and exclusion
             criteria, they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study population.
             This determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and
             initialed or signed by the investigator

          -  Participant must be medically stable on the basis of clinical laboratory tests
             performed in the screening/prospective observational phase. If the results of the
             serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference
             ranges, the participant may be included only if the investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be
             appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This determination must be
             recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed or signed by the

                  MGH-ATRQ), or

               3. An adequate course of treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the
                  current major depressive episode, defined as at least 7 treatments with

             suicidal behavior within the past year prior to the start of the screening/prospective
