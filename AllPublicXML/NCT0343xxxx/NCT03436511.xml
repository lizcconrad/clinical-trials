  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is designed to more specifically describe the burden of the disease
      and the use of healthcare resources of subjects with eosinophilic COPD that may be eligible
      in the future for a biologic treatment. Subjects who attend a routine follow-up visit and
      fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria defined provide a signed informed consent will be
      invited by the investigator to participate in this study. Subjects will be recruited in
      hospital Pulmonology Services across Spain. It is planned to include approximately 20
      centers. To select the final participating centers, a feasibility study has been carried out
      in approximately 50 potential participating centers. It has been estimated that each
      investigator will include 18 subjects during the 4-month inclusion period. Total 354 subjects
      will be required: 250 subjects with an eosinophil level &gt;=150 cells per microliter and 104
      subjects with an eosinophil level &lt;150 cells per microliter. The study inclusion period will
      be 4 months (expected to be from November 2017 to March 2018) and the retrospective data
      collection period will be 12 months prior to the inclusion visit.

          -  Subjects of both sexes aged &gt;=40 years.

          -  Subjects with a COPD diagnosis confirmed with a post-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory
             Volume in 1 second/Forced Vital capacity &lt;70% recorded at any time in the medical

             recorded in this period, the one closest to the inclusion visit determined in the
             stable phase should be selected; if it is not available, the record closest to the
             inclusion visit will be selected, even if it has been determined during an
             exacerbation. If no records are available, the subject will be invited to perform the
             test at the inclusion visit.

          -  Subjects currently exposed to inhaled triple maintenance therapy, defined as at least
             one overlapping prescription of an ICS with a LABA and with a LAMA in 2 or 3 inhaler

          -  Subjects who have experienced &gt;=2 moderate exacerbations or &gt;=1 severe exacerbation in
             the 12 months prior to the inclusion visit. Moderate exacerbation is defined as an

             inclusion visit.

          -  Subjects treated with oral corticosteroids continuously during the 12 months prior to
             the inclusion visit.

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of Churg-Strauss disease, hypereosinophilic syndrome,
             allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis or other conditions that result in increased
             eosinophil levels independently of COPD.

          -  Subjects with oncologic disease undergoing treatment or with advanced oncologic
             disease (without possibility of remission), terminal subjects and/or subjects
             receiving palliative care.

          -  Cognitively impaired subjects who are not able to understand or complete the informed
             consent and HRQoL questionnaires.

          -  Subjects who have participated in an interventional clinical trial during the 12
             months prior to the inclusion visit.
