  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of LJPC-501 infusion on mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) or reduction in sum norepinephrine (NE) equivalent dosing, at Hour 2 after the
      start of LJPC-501, in pediatric patients who remain hypotensive despite receiving fluid
      therapy and vasopressor therapy. In addition, this study will evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of LJPC-501 in pediatric patients, the change in MAP over 24 hours after the
      start of LJPC-501, the change in serum lactate concentrations, and the change in Pediatric
      Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) scores.
