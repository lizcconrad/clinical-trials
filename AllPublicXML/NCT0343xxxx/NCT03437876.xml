  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a common infectious disease affecting up to 2 billion people
      worldwide. Around 650 thousand people died of liver failure, cirrhosis and primary liver
      cancer caused by chronic hepatitis B every year. 3%-5% compensatory liver cirrhosis develop
      to decompensated cirrhosis and suffer from series symptoms such as fatigue, edema, portal
      hypertension, splenomegaly, hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and so
      on. Chronic hepatitis B is closely related to the imbalance of intestinal microbiota, and the
      intestinal microbiota of patients is significantly different from healthy people. The
      response of patients to hepatitis B virus can be influenced by reconstructing intestinal
      flora, while Intestinal microbiota transplantation(IMT) is a significant method to achieve
      it. In a previous study using IMT to treat HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B patients
      combined with antiviral therapy, 80% of them has reached HBeAg clearance. The investigators
      propose a randomized trial of IMT in patients with HBV induced cirrhosis. Patients will be
      randomized to either control group or IMT group over a 12 months period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A group of 60 patients with HBV induced cirrhosis will be recruited for study, which involved
      a 4 times IMT with gastroduodenoscopy and the time interval is generally 2 weeks.
      Participants can keep taking their present treatment. All participants will be assessed at
      baseline, after 3 months, 6 months, 12 months from baseline in order to evaluate the possible
      changes in:

      (1)Imaging changes: Color Doppler ultrasound of portal vein, CT/MRI, Fibroscan score of liver
      fibrosis and steatosis, Grading of varicosity under gastroscopy(GI); (2)Basic information and
      symptoms; (3)Biochemical indexes: Liver function, four items of liver fiber, lipid
      metabolism, blood routine, coagulation function, blood ammonia, inflammation, oxidative
      stress, urine routine; sugar metabolism indicators (blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin,
      insulin level and insulin resistance level).

      (4) Changes of gut microbiota: The changes of gut microbiota will be assessed by
      High-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA) on baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after
      treatment samples to assess changes associated with IMT.

    <description>Doppler ultrasonography is medical ultrasonography that employs the Doppler effect to generate imaging of the movement of tissues and body fluids (usually blood), and their relative velocity to the probe. By calculating the frequency shift of a particular sample volume, for example flow in an artery or a jet of blood flow over a heart valve, its speed and direction can be determined and visualized. Color Doppler is the presentation of the velocity by color scale. Color Doppler images are generally combined with grayscale (B-mode) images to display duplex ultrasonography images, allowing for simultaneous visualization of the anatomy of the area. This is particularly useful in cardiovascular studies (sonography of the vascular system and heart) and essential in many areas such as determining reverse blood flow in the liver vasculature in portal hypertension.</description>

    <description>A CT scan, also known as computed tomography scan, makes use of computer-processed combinations of many X-ray measurements taken from different angles to produce cross-sectional (tomographic) images (virtual &quot;slices&quot;) of specific areas of a scanned object, allowing the user to see inside the object without cutting. Other terms include computed axial tomography (CAT scan) and computer aided tomography.</description>

    <description>Hepatobiliary MR is used to detect and characterize lesions of the liver, pancreas, and bile ducts. Focal or diffuse disorders of the liver may be evaluated using diffusion-weighted, opposed-phase imaging, and dynamic contrast enhancement sequences. Extracellular contrast agents are used widely in liver MRI and newer hepatobiliary contrast agents also provide the opportunity to perform functional biliary imaging.</description>
