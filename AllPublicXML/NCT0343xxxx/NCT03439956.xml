  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most important downsides of endoscopic surgery is the need to remove surgical
      specimens of different sizes through very small incisions. This step should ensure the
      complete retrieval of the surgical specimen with concomitant preservation of its integrity
      (if possible) in order to avoid intraabdominal contamination of potentially infected or
      malignant tissues. Possibilities for specimen extraction during laparoscopy include
      minilaparotomy, enlargement of an ancillary port, transumbilical extraction, and transvaginal
      extraction through posterior colpotomy.

      Although recent evidence has already suggested that transvaginal extraction through posterior
      colpotomy is a safe and feasible option, to date there are no published data about obstetric
      outcomes after this procedure.

      For this reason, the current study aims to evaluate obstetric outcomes between women that
      underwent transvaginal specimen extraction through posterior colpotomy and women who did not.
