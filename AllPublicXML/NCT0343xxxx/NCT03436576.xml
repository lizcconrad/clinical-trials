  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of autologous serum 20% and autologous
      serum 50% for the treatment of Severe Dry Eye Syndrome
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the difference between autologous serum 20% vs 50%, in terms of improvement of
      symptoms, improvement of ocular surface parameters and acceptable tolerability in patients
      with severe dry eye syndrome.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI Score test was created to establish severity of the dry eye according to its symptomatology.
It consists of 12 questions which have 5 answer options each, giving a score of 0-4 each answer. The total score is calculated with the sum of the scores of each answer multiplied by 25 and divided by the number of questions answered. The total score goes on the scale between 0 and 50.
The higher the score, the greater the severity. Score &lt;13 are considered normal. Between 13-22 it is classified within moderate dry eye Scores greater than 23 are considered severe dry eye</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Tear Break Up Time (TBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 1 month, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TBUT is based on the time of tear rupture after the instillation of fluorescein.
The shorter the time of rupture, the greater the tear dysfunction</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Oxford Staining score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 1 month, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Oxford scale is based on the amount of ocular surface (cornea and conjunctiva) that is stained with lysine or green fluorescein. The severity of the staining points is classified into 6 stages (0-5) from absent to marked epithelial damage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Schirmer I</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 1 month, 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a tear production test. The Schirmer I test is performed without anesthesia. Two thin strips of filter paper (Whatman 5mm x 35mm) are placed on the bottom of the lower conjunctival sac at the junction of the middle third and the outer third to prevent injury to the cornea. It is recommended to ask the subject to keep their eyes closed to limit the effect of blinking. The strips are kept positioned for 5 minutes and then they are removed and the amount that was moistened is read, in mm.
The lower the value, the greater the deficit of tear production</description>
