  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prognostic assessment after preoperative systemic therapy (PST) plays a vital role in breast
      cancer patients. The clinical-pathologic staging system incorporating estrogen receptor
      (ER)-negative disease and nuclear grade 3 tumor pathology (CPS+EG staging system) can
      effectively predict prognosis after PST. The Neo-Bioscore has been developed by the
      incorporation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status into the CPS+EG
      staging system. But in a real world in China, the both staging systems had limits because of
      trastuzumab administration varied a lot in China from the United States. This retrospective
      study will validate CPS+EG and Neo-Bioscore system and explored a modified Neo-Bioscore
      system in multiple centers.
