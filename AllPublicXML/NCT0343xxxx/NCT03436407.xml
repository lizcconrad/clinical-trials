  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the significant preventive efforts to reduce HIV infections in the past decades, the
      incidence in MSM has plateaued at a higher level after the turn of the millennium. In 2015 a
      reduction in newly diagnosed HIV cases was reported for the first time. Early detection of
      HIV and treatment as prevention may have played a positive role in reducing HIV transmission,
      however, numbers increased again in 2016. Over 90% of HIV positive MSM in Norway are treated
      and virologically suppressed and thereby considered not infectious.

      Since the early days of the HIV epidemic, changes in sexual behaviour and increased use of
      condoms have been advocated and the only tools available to prevent HIV transmission. Later,
      frequent testing and treatment of STIs (including HIV) have been added to the preventive
      measures available. Still, this does not seem to be sufficient for all MSM. The use of PrEP
      is therefore likely an important supplement to prevent HIV infections in MSM at high risk for
      HIV acquisition.

      The main objective of this study is to monitor the impact of PrEP on the subject's
      psychological and sexual health. It is also important to monitor the adherence to PrEP,
      development of drug resistance (in the case of undetected HIV infection at initiation of
      PrEP), frequency of other STIs, changes in sexual behaviour, recreational drug use and
      quality of life. PrEP has proven to be effective in reducing the sexual acquisition of HIV,
      however this requires that the medication is taken as prescribed, whilst the subject is
      exposed to high risk of infection.

      This study is designed to evaluated implementation of PrEP treatment as a part of the general
      HIV preventive program in Norway. The target groups are mainly MSM and transgender persons at
      high risk of HIV infection, as well as other subjects at risk of HIV infection due to their
      sexual practices.

      Objectives include assessment of the following:

        1. Assess the impact of PrEP on the sexual and psychological health of PrEP users Incidence
           of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in PrEP users compared to those not taking
           PrEP

        2. Assessment of drug compliance

        3. Incidence of HIV seroconversion despite PrEP

        4. Frequency and development of drug resistance in subjects who HIV-seroconvert (if any)

Subjects diagnosed with HIV within last 12 months in general clinical practice and referred to the outpatient clinic at the Dept. of Infectious Diseases, OUS. (details in protocol 3.3.2)

        Individuals attending the clinic for PrEP assessment are either referred from other health
        care providers or referred by themselves (self-referral).

        Those who have commenced PrEP elsewhere (abroad, purchased themselves, another provider)
        and attend for &quot;PrEP follow-up&quot; either at Olafiaklinikken or a corresponding venerological
        clinic/study site in Norway, may also be included in the study.

        Newly diagnosed HIV positive individuals referred to the out-patient clinic of the Dept. of
        Infectious Diseases, OUS, will be invited to participate as controls. They will be
        presented with the same consent form and questionnaire on sexual and psychological health
        prior to the HIV diagnosis.
