  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with schizophrenia show disturbances in the perception of time. Among these
      alterations are the perturbations of the temporal order judgment. They are characterized by
      the fact that, as opposed to the general population, people with schizophrenia require a
      longer time interval between two successive stimuli to estimate which of the two events
      appeared first. If these alterations are now well documented, their consequences remain
      little explored. Among these consequences could however appear distortions of the judgment of
      causality (likely to underlie certain delusional interpretations) as well as a distressing
      experience of loss of the continuity of the lived experience (that could contribute to the
      alterations basic of self-awareness).

      The objective of our work lies in the study of the links between temporal sequencing,
      subjective perception of time and causality.

      To carry out this work, the investigators will rely on an experimental paradigm (derived from
      Michotte's paradigm) which makes it possible to explore the links between temporal sequencing
      and perception of causality, validated in the normal subject. subjective consequences of
      these alterations will be explored using a phenomenological-inspired clinical scale (EAWE
      time-scale items)

    <intervention_model_description>This study consists in:
evaluate the links (correlation) between perception of temporal sequencing and perception of causality using an adapted experimental paradigm (Michotte paradigm) and to compare performance between healthy subjects and controls
investigate the existence of a correlation between these alterations and the peculiarities of the subjective experience of time (EAWE scale) in the group of subjects with schizophrenia
The measures that will be realized are:
Performances of patients and controls on temporal task
Subjective alterations of time perception in patients with an adapted scale (EAWE)

    <description>Examination of Anomalous World Experience (EAWE ) scale:investigate the existence of a correlation between these alterations and the peculiarities of the subjective experience of time The E.A.W.E. consists of 6 dimensions (relation to space / relation to time / relation to others / language / atmospheric experience / existential orientation).The second domain only will be explored in our study Each item is both detailed, on a scale of 0 to 2 (0 for absent, 1 for present but with doubt, 2 for present, no doubt). The overall score of the sub-time scale thus ranges between 0 and 78.</description>
