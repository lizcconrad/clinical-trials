    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to explore the effect of functional movement control for patients who
      have stage II or III degenerative knee joint disease and also physical inactive. Half of
      patients will receive aerobic exercise and functional movement control training in
      combination, while the other will simply receive aerobic exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity, which is a common phenomenon among patients with degenerative knee joint
      disease has been proved a predictor of increased symptoms and poor general health. However,
      changing the lifestyle of people with this disease who is physical inactive is still a
      problem which has not been solved. Knee pain may act as barrier to engage in physical
      activity and can influence patient's movement performance.

      The different effectiveness between the aerobic exercise and functional movement control
      training.

      Aerobic exercise has been proved could improve knee pain for the patients with degenerative
      knee joint disease.

      The functional movement control training could improve knee alignment during walking and
      other functional activities to increase patient's movement awareness.
