      Design and Outcomes This research study is designed as open-label, sequential dose-escalating
      clinical trial. There will be two phases of enrollment.

      In the first phase, pediatric dengue patients with body weight greater than 30 kg will be
      recruited. The first six volunteers will be administered with 400 μg/kg every 24 hours for a
      total of three times. The last six volunteers will be administered with 600 μg/kg every 24
      hours for a total of three times.

      In the second phase, pediatric dengue patients with body weight between 15 to 30 kg will be
      recruited. Similar to the first phase, the first six and the last six volunteers will be
      administered with 400 μg/kg and 600 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of three times,
      respectively.

      A total of 24 volunteers will be recruited from Faculty of Medicine Siriraj hospitals

      The research team has planned to conduct three interim analyses for safety and one final
      report. The interim analyses will be conducted as follows:

        1. First interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with
           body weight &gt;30 kg receiving ivermectin 400 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of three
           times (i.e. the sixth volunteer).

        2. Second interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with
           body weight &gt;30 kg receiving ivermectin 600 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of three
           times (i.e. the twelfth volunteer).

        3. Third interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with
           body weight 15 to 30 kg receiving ivermectin 400 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of
           three times (i.e. the twelfth volunteer).

      The results of each interim analyses will be submitted to DSMB to determine whether the study
      is safe to be conducted in the next group of volunteers. Additionally, the results of interim
      analyses and the safety assessments from DSMB will be submitted to all ECs
