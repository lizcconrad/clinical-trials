  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study of the molecular features of postmenopausal
      women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) HER2-negative advanced breast cancer on first-line
      treatment with ribociclib and letrozole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this local, multicenter study is to investigate genetic and gene
      expression alterations in tumor prior to and following progression on ribociclib and thus
      identify patterns of mutations, how they evolve, and their association with CDK4/6 inhibition
      and outcomes such as sustained response or early progression. The study also aims to evaluate
      pharmacogenomics and its association with adverse events (frequency and severity), drug-drug
      interactions and clinical outcomes.

      Finally, the study will also generate additional long-term safety and efficacy data in this
      specific Italian population.

        neo/adjuvant therapy included letrozole or anastrozole, the disease-free interval must be
