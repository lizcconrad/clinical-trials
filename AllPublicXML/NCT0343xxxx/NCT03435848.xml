  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assesses the benefit, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      BST-236 in patients with newly-diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) who are not eligible
      for standard induction chemotherapy due to advanced age or comorbidities. The Complete
      Remission (CR) rate following treatment with BST-236 will be compared to the CR rate reported
      in historical data in a similar population.

    <textblock>
      BST-236 is a cytarabine pro drug designed to release cytarabine inside the target cells with
      reduced systemic exposure to free cytarabine. As such, BST-236 may enable delivery of high
      doses of cytarabine to medically-unfit or older adults who otherwise cannot be treated with
      standard cytarabine therapy. This study aims to validate this hypothesis.

      The study is an open-label, single arm, single agent, multi-center study in adults with newly
      diagnosed AML who are unfit for standard therapy. The patients will receive up to 4 courses
      of six-days treatment with intravenous BST-236; 1 or 2 induction courses followed by 1 to 2
      consolidation courses. The study participation will be 52 weeks including treatment and
      follow-up periods. An additional 1 year post study follow-up for the evaluation of survival
      is optional.
