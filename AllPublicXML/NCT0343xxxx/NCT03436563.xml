  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving M7824 to
      patients with colorectal cancer. Researchers also want to learn if the study drug can help to
      control the disease.

      This is an investigational study. M7824 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is
      currently being used for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 59 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is about 4 weeks.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive M7824 by vein
      for about 1 hour on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse,
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      If the disease appears to be responding to the study drug after 12 months of treatment, you
      may be able to stop treatment with M7824. Both you and your study doctor will discuss this
      and make this decision. If you stop receiving the study drug, you will continue to take part
      in follow-up (described below). If the tumor grows after you stop taking M7824, you may be
      able to restart treatment.

      Your participation in this study will be over after follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and for
           routine, biomarker, and tumor marker testing. If you can become pregnant, part of this
           sample will be used for a pregnancy test.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn before and after your dose of study drug for
           pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in your body
           at different time points.

        -  During Cycle 2, you will have a core tumor biopsy for biomarker testing.

      On Day 15 of Cycles 1 and 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  Blood (up to 2½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. During Cycle 1, this
           sample will be used for PK testing. During Cycle 2, this sample will be used for tumor
           marker and biomarker testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and for
           routine, biomarker, and tumor marker testing. During Cycle 6 (if you are still receiving
           treatment), this sample will be used for PK testing. If you can become pregnant, part of
           this sample will be used for a pregnancy test.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 3 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 3 and every odd-numbered cycle (Cycles 5, 7, 9, and so on), you will have a
      CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      Every 6 weeks, you will have an EKG.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 7 days after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  If you stopped taking the study drug before Cycle 6, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be
           drawn for PK testing.

      Follow-Up:

      About 28 days after the last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam including a skin exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and for
           routine, biomarker, and tumor marker testing. If you can become pregnant, part of this
           sample will be used for a pregnancy test.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Long-Term Follow Up:

      Every 3 months up to 1 year after follow-up, even if you withdraw from the study, you will be
      called and asked about how you are doing. Each call should last about 5-10 minutes.

             vascular accident / stroke (&lt;6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt;6
             months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (New York Heart
             Association Classification Class &gt;II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia.

         15. Clinically relevant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease) and / or
             uncontrolled medical conditions, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might
             impair the subject's tolerance or ability to participate in the trial.

         16. Vaccine administration within 4 weeks of M7824 administration. Vaccination with live
