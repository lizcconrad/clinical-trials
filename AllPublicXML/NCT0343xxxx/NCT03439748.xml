  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Affect, or the tendency to experience a given emotion, often is subdivided into two domains.
      Positive affect is the tendency to experience positive emotions, such as happiness,
      excitement, elation, and enthusiasm. Negative affect is the tendency to experience negative
      emotions, such as anger, resentment, sadness, anxiety, and fear. Humans exhibit a range of
      emotions that span across positive and negative affect domains with some individuals
      experiencing more of one type of affect than another. Recent research and developing theories
      have suggested that mental health disorders can be conceptualized as the tendency for an
      individual to fall into one or more extremes on these categories. Therefore, treatments
      should not be based on targeting a conglomeration of symptoms (as we have been doing for the
      past century) but rather they should be treating the underlying dysregulation (e.g., high or
      low positive and negative affect).

      In an effort to address this gap, the current study plans to recruit participants for a
      treatment trial consisting of two psychotherapies: (a) positive affect treatment (PAT), and
      (b) negative affect treatment (NAT). The overarching goals of this project are to evaluate
      the efficacy of PAT and to identify whether aspects of positive or negative affect moderate
      (i.e., effect) the degree of response to these treatments.

      Participants will be randomized to either a 15-week positive (PAT) or negative affect
      treatment (NAT). Participants will also complete three laboratory visits (before treatment,
      after treatment, and at 6-month follow-up) to examine potential moderators of treatment.
      These laboratory based assessments will included measures of the positive and negative affect
      system such as behavioral and psychophysiological responses to reward, fear conditioning and
      extinction, recovery from distress, and positive and negative imagery as well as diagnostic
      interviews.

      Anhedonia, or loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities, is characteristic of
      depression, some types of anxiety, as well as substance abuse and schizophrenia. Anhedonia is
      a predictor of poor long-term outcomes, including suicide, and poor treatment response.
      Extant psychological and pharmacological treatments are relatively ineffective for anhedonia.
      Thus, there is an unmet therapeutic need for this high-risk symptom. Recent advances in
      affective neuroscience have elucidated processes that may underlie anhedonia and should be
      targeted in therapy. Specifically, anhedonia is associated with deficits in the appetitive
      reward system, including (1) reward approach-motivation, (2) initial responsiveness to reward
      attainment, and (3) learning of reward. We have developed a novel transdiagnostic
      psychosocial treatment for anhedonia, Positive Affect Treatment (PAT), designed to improve
      deficits in reward sensitivity. The goal of the current study is to compare this new
      treatment, PAT, to traditional cognitive behavioral therapy designed to reduce negative
      affect, called Negative Affect Treatment (NAT), in individuals with depression or anxiety.
