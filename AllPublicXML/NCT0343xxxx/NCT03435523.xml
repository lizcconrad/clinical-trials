      -  Question: Ventilatory strategy to counterbalance the effect of one lung ventilation
           during thoracic surgery.

        -  Findings: the open lung approach improved oxygenation and lung compliance, reducing
           respiratory system driving pressure and transpulmonary driving pressure.

        -  Meaning: patients undergoing thoracic surgery during one lung ventilation may benefit of
           an open lung approach strategy to avoid ventilator lung injury.

      Background: During thoracic surgery in lateral decubitus, one lung ventilation (OLV) may
      impair respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. The investigators tested a strategy based on
      an open lung approach (OLA) consisting in lung recruitment immediately followed by a
      decremental positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration to the best respiratory system
      compliance (CRS) and separately quantified the elastic properties of the lung and the chest
      wall. The investigators hypothesis was that this approach would improve gas exchange and
      increase lung compliance (CL).

      Methods: In thirteen patients undergoing upper left lobectomy the investigators studied lung
      and chest wall mechanics, transpulmonary pressure (PL), respiratory system and transpulmonary
      driving pressure (ΔPRS and ΔPL), gas exchange and hemodynamics at two time-points (a) during
      OLV at zero end-expiratory pressure (OLVpre-OLA) and (b) after the application of the
      open-lung strategy (OLVpost-OLA).

    <description>the ventilator was switched to pressure-control ventilation with a driving pressure of 20 cmH2O. After a 3 min equilibration, PEEP was applied in steps of 5,10,15 and 20 cmH2O every five respiratory breaths; subsequently, after setting a driving pressure of 15 cmH2O, PEEP was stepwise reduced, starting from 15 cmH2O, by 2 cmH2O every 2 minutes. The recruiting pressure of 20/20 was applied for six breaths. During the decremental PEEP trial, CRS was measured at every step. The PEEP level corresponding to highest CRS during the decremental trial was identified as the &quot;best PEEP&quot;. Subsequently, the lungs were recruited again and the &quot;best&quot; PEEP was applied.</description>
