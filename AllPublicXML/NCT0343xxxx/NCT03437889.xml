  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m2, who receive epidural
      analgesia/anesthesia for childbirth will have epidural catheter placement per our standard
      procedure, which includes using the gravity flow technique to confirm that the tip (aperture)
      of the epidural needle is indeed located within the epidural space. The study procedure will
      be to use a cold stimulus (ice) to assess the subjects for hypesthesia the dermatomes of the
      lower abdomen between 10 and 30 minutes after the epidural catheter is inserted. Hypesthesia
      to cold will be taken a sign of successful lumbar epidural block.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify the reliability of the gravity flow technique to
      accurately validate the position of the epidural needle tip when performing lumbar epidural
      analgesia/anesthesia for childbirth (vaginal and cesarean delivery) in women with a BMI
      greater than 30 kg/m2.
