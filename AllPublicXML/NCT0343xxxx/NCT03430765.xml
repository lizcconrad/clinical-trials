  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing treatment as usual
      (TAU) to treatment as usual plus a brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention
      (TAU + ACT) with mastectomy and lumpectomy patients identified as at-risk for developing
      persistent post-operative pain. The ACT intervention is a single individual therapy session
      scheduled two weeks following surgery. Potential participants will be recruited from the
      University of Iowa Breast Cancer Clinic. A sample size of n = 30 for each arm will be
      recruited. An attrition rate of 20% is anticipated so the total N to be recruited for the
      study is 72 participants. Study measures will consist of self-report questionnaires and
      medical record data. Data will be collected prior to surgery, one-week after surgery, and 3
      months after surgery.
