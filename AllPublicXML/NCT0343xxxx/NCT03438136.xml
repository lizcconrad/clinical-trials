    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of enrolling and retaining older adults in a 15-week
      intervention that will implement six factors from early childhood experiences: individualized
      scaffolding (having a responsive teacher), forgiving environment (allowing the learner to
      make and learn from mistakes), growth mindset (believing that abilities can develop with
      effort), open-minded learning (exploring new experiences), serious commitment to learning
      (adopting a &quot;learning&quot; lifestyle), and learning multiple skills simultaneously. These six
      factors will be implemented via concurrent classes at the UCR Extension center (OSHER
      Lifelong Learning Institute).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  55 years of age or older

          -  Fluent in English

          -  Have not been diagnosed with a cognitive condition (e.g., Mild Cognitive Impairment,
             Alzheimer's, and Dementia)

          -  Currently not experiencing a mental health disorder (e.g., anxiety, depression,
             Schizophrenia)

          -  Have normal eye vision or corrected-to-normal eye vision

          -  Not proficient in any of the three skills that will be taught during the intervention.
             Proficiency of skills will be determined by participants' self-report of their
             experience with each skill. Only potential participants who self-report having less
             than one or more years of experience with any of the three skills in the past 10 years
             or as having less than 5 years of experience more than 50 years ago will be considered
             as being &quot;unfamiliar&quot; with that skill (or skills) and will be qualified to participate
             in the study.
