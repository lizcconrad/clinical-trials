  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pivotal investigation is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      Cutera enlighten multi-wavelength 532 nm and 1064 nm Nd:YAG picosecond pulse duration laser
      and an investigational micro-lens array (MLA) handpiece attachment for improvement of
      moderate to severe acne scars.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, pivotal study in approximately 15 male or
      female subjects, age 18 to 65 years who desire laser treatment for the improvement of
      moderate to severe acne scars. Subjects will receive up to 6 laser treatments, spaced 6 weeks
      (± 2 weeks) apart with the Cutera enlighten laser with the Micro-Lens Array handpiece
      attachment. Subjects may undergo a 2mm punch biopsy before, immediately after and up to 72
      hours after treatment. Subjects will be contacted by phone 7 days (± 2 days) after their
      first treatment for follow-up. Subjects will return to the site after all study treatments
      have been delivered for two follow-up visits: 6 and 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) following their
      final study treatment and may receive a biopsy per Investigator discretion either at one of
      these visits or 3 months post initial treatment.
