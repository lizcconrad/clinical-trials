  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sophisticated language of science can be a barrier to Science, Technology, Engineering,
      and Math (STEM) learning, especially for children who have specific language impairment
      (SLI). The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to test vocabulary and grammar
      interventions embedded in a small-group inquiry-based science instruction for their potential
      to ameliorate language deficits that impede science learning. Participants will be 54
      kindergartners with SLI. Proximal and distal probes will reveal their mastery of taught and
      generalized language and science concepts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators focus on a subset of at-risk students who find the language
      of science to be a barrier to the learning of science. These are the nearly 3 million
      children in the U.S. who have a learning disability called specific language impairment
      (SLI). Children with SLI present with deficits in spoken grammar and vocabulary and they are
      3.9 to 8.1 times more likely to have reading deficits than children in the general
      population.

      Specific Aim #1: To determine whether science-relevant language intervention enhances the
      learning of science concepts in young children who have SLI.

      Specific Aim #2: To determine whether science-relevant language intervention facilitates
      generalization of science concepts and practices in young children who have SLI.

      Fifty-four 4-to-7-year-olds who have not yet begun 1st grade, who are monolingual speakers of
      English, and who have SLI will participate. The investigators will adopt a Randomized
      Controlled Trial design, randomly assigning participants into three intervention conditions:
      science + phonological awareness practice (the control arm), science + vocabulary supports,
      and science + grammar supports, followed by a brief withdrawal phase in which all three
      groups receive science only instruction. Pre- and post-measures will reveal the extent of
      learning in each condition and comparisons between conditions will reveal whether the grammar
      and vocabulary supports improved learning.

      The hypothesis is that the language and learning of science are integrally related.
      Therefore, the investigators will use evidenced-based language interventions to improve the
      children's science-relevant language skills, with the prediction that this will cascade into
      changes in the acquisition of science concepts and practices:

        1. Children in the science + language intervention conditions will show greater gains in
           taught science concepts across the 4-week intervention period than children in the
           control arm.

        2. The benefit of the science + language interventions will remain after the language
           supports are withdrawn, that is, children in the science + language intervention
           conditions will show greater gains in taught science concepts during the withdrawal week
           than children in the control arm.

        3. Children in the science + language intervention conditions will show greater gains from
           pretest to posttest on measures of generalized science concepts and practice than
           children in the control arm.

        4. Children who demonstrate the greatest improvement in the use of the language targets
           will also demonstrate the greatest improvements in taught concepts, generalized
           concepts, and generalized practice knowledge.

        5. Children will benefit from language supports directed at vocabulary as well as those
           directed at grammar, but these supports may differently benefit the science learning
           process.

      The first step is to document that the language supported interventions resulted in improved
      language abilities by comparing performance on probes of grammar and vocabulary at posttest
      to pretest performance. The expectations are significant changes in vocabulary knowledge for
      the vocabulary intervention condition as compared to the other two conditions, and
      significant changes in use of complement clauses for the grammar intervention condition as
      compared to the other two conditions. The next step is to test the predictions associated
      with the specific aims via a series of binomial mixed models. Mixed models are appropriate
      for designs with unbalanced cell sizes due to missing data (due to non-response and dropout).
      There will be one model for targeted science concept outcomes with condition (control arm,
      science + vocabulary, science + grammar) and time (5 assessments administered at the end of
      each week of science instruction) as independent variables (Predictions 1 and 2). There will
      also be one model each for generalized concepts and generalized practice outcomes with
      condition (control arm, science + vocabulary, science + grammar) and time (pretest and
      posttest) as independent variables (Prediction 3). Within-subject correlation will be
      accounted for with random subject effects. Additional random effects will be determined by
      selecting the model with the best model fit (lowest AIC value). In each of the three models,
      it is further expected that amount of improvement in grammar and vocabulary are moderators
      between the outcome and the other factors (Prediction 4). To assess this prediction,
      performance on the language tests will be included as covariates. The expectation is that
      performance on the language probes after instruction will be a significant predictor of
      science learning, and that including performance on the language probes as a covariate will
      eliminate the effect of condition because language performance will be the main factor
      predicting science performance. These models also allow comparison of the effectiveness of
      the grammar- and vocabulary-supported conditions (Prediction 5).

    <description>The outcome relevant to aim 1 will be measured with 20-item, proximal concept assessments at the end of each science unit (1 per week of intervention and 1 per the withdrawal week). These will be adapted from the FOSS I-check probes (e.g., Item 1: What is in the night sky? Stars? Sun? Moon?). From these, an accuracy score will result. The investigators will be able to determine whether the children learn more of the target science concepts in the language-supported conditions than in the control arm. Comparison of the performance on these assessments administered during the final week of the intervention and the withdrawal week will allow determination of whether any improved access to the curriculum remains after the language supports are withdrawn.</description>

    <description>In all conditions, science is taught via the Full Option Science System Next Generation Edition (FOSS, 2015, https://www.fossweb.com/) curriculum that involves 1) Prediction, 2) Experiment, 3) Journal/Reflection, and 4) dialogic reading centered around a given theme such as plant life. In the control condition, six phoneme identifications and five rhymes will be incorporated into this curriculum. While these activities are likely to improve the children's awareness of the sounds of the language (a foundational skill for learning to read), they are not likely to improve their access to the science being taught. Therefore, this intervention constitutes a placebo.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Science + Grammar Intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the science + grammar condition, focused stimulation, an intervention commonly used to target expressive language, will be used to treat complement clauses during the FOSS activities. The approach is incidental, rather than explicit. The active ingredients are models and recasts of the target structure. Recasts occur when an examiner responds to a child's naturally occurring utterance by expanding or extending the child's utterance to include a target grammatical structure. Scripted FOSS lessons will be created to support fidelity of intervention and provision of recasts and/or models at an average rate of one per minute, an accepted therapeutic dose.</description>

The children receive a cumulative exposure of 20-28 times per word (5-7 times per each of four lessons) and 4-12 chances to produce the word (1-3 chances per each of four lessons).</description>
