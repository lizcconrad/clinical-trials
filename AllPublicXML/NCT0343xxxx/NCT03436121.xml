  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposal, the investigators will determine if a single dose of intravenous (IV)
      ketamine (in combination with midazolam) reduces pain severity, depressive symptoms and need
      for opiate analgesics both in the ED and in the acute recovery period after ED discharge. The
      investigators will compare the ketamine arm to an active placebo-controlled arm (with
      midazolam).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 120 medically stable adult patients who present to two
      Emergency Departments with a chief complaint of acute pain.

      The investigators will randomly assign subjects using a blocked randomization schedule to
      either: 1) a single dose of IV ketamine (0.3 mg.kg) + midazolam, or 2) placebo + midazolam.
      ED providers and patients will be blind to treatment allocation.

      All participants will complete measures of pain and mood scores every 30 minutes, and the
      investigators will record any analgesics administered in the ED until discharge. At 7-days
      and 14-days post- discharge, the investigators will measure summary reports of pain severity,
      mood, and analgesic medication used.

    <intervention_name>Ketamine</intervention_name>
    <description>Ketamine is a medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for anesthesia, sedation, and post-surgical pain treatment. It is not approved for emergency patients complaining of pain but is often used &quot;off-label.&quot; Ketamine may be useful for acute pain management and in treatment of depressed mood. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single low dose of ketamine can relieve pain and reduce negative mood for 2 weeks after emergency department (ED) treatment.</description>

    <description>In this study, all patients will also receive midazolam. Midazolam is a sedative that typically makes people feel relaxed and is intended to increase comfort with ketamine and reduce anxiety.</description>
