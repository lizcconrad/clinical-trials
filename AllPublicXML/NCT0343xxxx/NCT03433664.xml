  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect effect of ablative fractional CO2 laser (AFCO2L) on burns
      scar appearance and dermal architecture at 6 weeks and up to 3-years post-treatment. Half of
      the scar will receive AFCO2L and half the scar will receive standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ablative fractional CO2 laser (AFCO2L) is emerging as a promising scar treatment for burns
      patients. Fractionated delivery of CO2 laser treatment leaved columns of undamaged skin to
      quickly re-epithelialize and has reduced the previously higher risk profile of unfractionated
      ablative laser delivery in terms of permanent pigmentation changes, higher rates of infection
      and scarring. The exact mechanisms of CO2 laser action are still unclear, but likely involve
      a combination of macroscopic ablative fenestration, microscopic thermal collagen alteration
      and molecular profile alterations.

      Use of AFCO2L for scar management is increasing amongst burn clinicians; consensus opinion
      and several large series have demonstrated safe and effective result, however robust
      randomised controlled evidence for the efficacy of CO2 laser on burns scarring is still
      lacking.

    <intervention_model_description>Scar area (10x10cm square) randomly assigned a square vector 'map' which split the scar into a control and treatment half along one of 4 vectors: vertical, horizontal, and along both diagonals. The envelope revealing the vector map and treatment zones was opened by the treating laser clinician immediately prior to the first treatment. The same treating clinician performed all laser treatments to minimise inter-user variability.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks post final treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Vancouver Scar Scale requires an assessor to rate the patient's scars in 4 domains, each assigning a score to the scar for different qualities (pliability, height, vascularity and pigmentation) from 0 to 4 in pliability and height; and 0 to 3 in vascularity and pigmentation, where 0 is a 'normal' score as close to normal skin as possible and a score of 3 or 4 would indicate a poor outcome, dissimilar to normal skin. The minimum total score is 0 (very good scar) and maximum score is 14 (very bad scar)</description>

    <description>Patient element of the POSAS scale (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale) version 2.0. The scale asks the patient to rate their scars in 6 domains, each assigning a score to the scar for different qualities (pain, itch, colour, stiffness, thickness irregularity and overall opinion) from 1 to 10, where 1 is a very good score and 10 is a very poor score. The minimum total score is 7 (very good scar) and maximum score is 70 (very bad scar)</description>

    <description>Each treatment half of the scar received three standardised CO2 laser treatments using the DeepFX setting hand piece (Ultrapulse, Lumenis), performed under general anaesthetic at 4-6 week intervals. All treatments consisted of a single pass of 300Hz, 5% density and 50mJ energy with minimal overlapping. Post-operatively all laser treatment and control zones had emollient applied and silicone dressings which were removed at 48 hours. Further emollient was applied twice daily for 2 weeks to all areas of the scar. Standard care scar management (including silicone, massage and pressure garments) was directed by burn occupational therapists and was continued for all areas of scar.</description>
