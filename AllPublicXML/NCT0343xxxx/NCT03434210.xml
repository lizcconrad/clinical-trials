  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 49 weeks open-label randomized controlled study. Patients with schizophrenia and
      violence risk will be enrolled in the study. A community-based long-acting
      antipsychotics-treated management model will be applied to the experimental group, which
      means that professional psychiatrists will provide guidance to primary-level mental health
      workers on the psychotic treatment, and monthly-injected long-acting antipsychotic,
      paliperidone palmitate, will be used in the schizophrenia treatment. Subjects in control
      group will be treated and cared as usual.

      This is a 49 weeks open-label,cluster randomized controlled study. Patients with
      schizophrenia and violence risk under the government supervision will be enrolled in the
      study. A community-based long-acting antipsychotics-treated management model will be applied
      to the experimental group, which means that professional psychiatrists will provide guidance
      to primary-level mental health workers on the psychotic treatment, and monthly-injected
      long-acting antipsychotic, paliperidone palmitate, will be used in the schizophrenia
      treatment. The subjects in experimental group will be injected with 150mg eq and 100mg eq
      paliperidone palmitate in the deltoid at the 1st and 8th day, and afterwards a flexible dose
      of paliperidone palmitate from 75 to 150mg eq will be administrated monthly per clinical
      judgement. For subjects who did not take risperidone, paliperidone extended release tablets,
      risperidone microspheres or paliperidone palmitate for injection previously, subjects should
      take oral paliperidone or risperidone sustained release tablets in the screening phase to
      perform ultra-sensitive test (the minimum dose of risperidone 1 mg/day and the minimum dose
      of sustained-release tablets paliperidone 3 mg/day, at least orally three days). Only
      subjects who were judged by the treating physician as tolerance to the drug could
      usepaliperidone palmitate .Suggest previous antipsychotics could be withdrawn within 4 weeks
      after first paliperidone palmitate administration , but will follow doctors' clinical
      judgement. The study protocol does not limit other medication or treatment measures except
      the injectable paliperidone palmitate. Other medication or treatment measures should be
      decided by doctors' clinical judgement and align with patients and caregivers.Subjects in
      control group will be treated and cared as usual.
