        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and Female subjects with total body weight between 50.0 and 100.0 kilograms(kg)
             (inclusive) and body mass index (BMI) between 19.0 and 36.0 kg per meter square
             (inclusive) at the time of the screening examination

          -  For subjects with impaired renal function: Subjects must have an eGFR according to the
             Modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation of less than 90 mL per minute at
             screening and the possibility of stratification to one of the groups and a stable
             renal function as defined by either: if the time interval between screening and dosing
             is greater than 10 days, two eGFR with the second estimate within 20% of prior value
             or historical records of stable function over the past 3 months if within 20
             percentage of screening value and within 10 days of dosing

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of respiratory, gastrointestinal (including bariatric or other
             gastric surgeries, or other conditions that may affect drug absorption) hepatic
             (including hepatorenal syndrome), hematological, lymphatic, neurological (including
             seizures), cardiovascular (including ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart
             failure), psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, immunological, dermatological,
             connective tissue diseases or disorders that may affect the safety of the subject.

          -  Clinical history of any autoimmune disorder

          -  Prior history of cholecystectomy or splenectomy, and any clinically relevant surgery
             within 6 months prior to Screening, which might interfere with the objectives of the
             study or the study procedures

          -  History of any malignancy except superficial basal cell carcinoma treated for curative
             intent may be allowed
