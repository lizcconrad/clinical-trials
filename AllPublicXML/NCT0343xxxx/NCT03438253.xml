  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Penile engorgement during intraoperative period is of rare occurrence however when do
      happens, leads to difficulty in performing and even cancellation of elective urogenital
      surgery. The mechanism behind intraoperative penile engorgement is complex and involves
      various factors. One common myth is that penile engorgement occurs only during spinal
      anaesthesia and not in general anaesthesia. In this study we intend to report the incidence
      and management of intraoperative penile engorgement in pediatric patients undergoing
      urogenital operations under spinal anesthesia with/without sedation over a period of one
      year. The pathophysiology and role of common contributing factors leading to intraoperative
      penile engorgement are also discussed.
