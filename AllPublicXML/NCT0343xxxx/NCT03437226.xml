      Repetitive levosimendan infusions for patients with advanced chronic heart failure (LeoDOR) A
      randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study with parallel group design.

      Mortality and rehospitalisation rates are high in the vulnerable phase following heart
      failure hospitalisation. Previous studies suggest that these events can be reduced by repeat
      infusions of levosimendan in patients with advanced heart failure.

         16. Participation in a clinical trial with any experimental treatment within 30 days prior
             to screening or previous participation in the present study

         17. Administration of levosimendan within 14 days prior the study drug initiation, the
             first study drug application has to be postponed for at least 14 days after the end of
             this premedication

         18. Suspected non-compliance
