  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients at Sentara RMH Hahn Cancer Center who are treated with accelerated
      partial breast irradiation will be monitored over a period of 10 years. From this group of
      patients, local and regional recurrence rates will be determined. Patients in the registry
      will also take part in assessments of cosmesis and quality of life.

      Studies have shown that giving radiation therapy to the breast after lumpectomy helps keep
      cancer from coming back in the breast. The purpose of this study is to see if partial breast
      irradiation (PBI) at SRMH Hahn Cancer Center is as good as partial breast irradiation
      performed in other centers in the United States in keeping cancer from coming back in the
      breast. Whole breast irradiation (WBI) is a standard treatment after a lumpectomy. WBI is
      radiation therapy given 5 days a week for 5 to 7 weeks to the whole breast. PBI is a new
      method of delivering radiation only to the area of the breast where the cancer was removed.
      PBI is given 2 times a day for 5 days. PBI may be given over a period of 5 to 10 days. This
      newer treatment is currently being compared with WBI in a randomized trial. Thus far,
      patients at low risk for cancer recurrence who have been treated with PBI have had excellent
      outcomes at 5 years post-treatment, but we will not know for sure if PBI is as good as WBI
      until the results of the randomized trial are available. However, PBI is commonly being
      offered outside of clinical trials in many community hospitals throughout the country. As
      radiation oncologists at Sentara RMH Hahn Cancer Center, we wanted to offer patients in our
      community the same opportunity to have this treatment, but also wanted to ensure close
      follow-up of all patients treated with this method, to be sure our results are similar to
      those of patients reported in our professional literature. There are two different methods of
      PBI that are being used at SRMH Hahn Cancer Center: Balloon brachytherapy and 3-D conformal
      external beam irradiation. This study will learn about the good and bad effects of radiation
      therapy. The study also will learn about the feelings women have about how their breast looks
      after surgery and radiation therapy.

    <description>The balloon brachytherapy catheter method uses one tube with a small balloon on the end placed where the tumor had been. The balloon is filled with salt water so it fits this space. The end of the tube will extend from the side of the breast and will be connected to a special machine for treatments. The RT dose is delivered by a radioactive seed that travels through the tube into the center of the balloon. The seed will be removed at the end of each treatment. The tube and the balloon filled with salt water will stay in the breast until the 10 RT treatments are done. The radiation oncologist will decide if this type of treatment is most appropriate for the patient. The treatment will be given 2 times a day, about 6 hours apart, on 5 days. Each treatment lasts for 10-15 minutes.</description>

          -  The patient must begin treatment within 9 weeks following the last surgery for breast
             cancer (lumpectomy, re-excision of margins, or axillary staging procedure).

             performed on the primary tumor prior to enrollment.

          -  The target lumpectomy cavity must be clearly delineated and the ratio of target
             lumpectomy cavity/whole breast reference volume must be &lt;/= 25% based on the
             postoperative CT scan.

          -  Patients are eligible if, based on the postoperative CT scan, PBI is judged to be
             technically deliverable by either 3D conformal radiation therapy or balloon

             physician to be low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are
             eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous

          -  Synchronous bilateral invasive or non-invasive breast cancer.

          -  History of invasive breast cancer or DCIS in the ipsilateral breast (Patients with a
             history of LCIS treated by surgery alone are eligible).

          -  Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are less than 2 mm at
             pathologic evaluation. (if surgical margins are rendered free of disease by
