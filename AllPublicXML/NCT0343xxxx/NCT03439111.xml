  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lycium chinense fruit (LCF) is widely distributed in East Asia that has been used
      traditionally for anti-aging purposes. This study was performed to examine the effects of LCF
      on attention and cognitive function in healthy young people. An 11-week, double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was conducted.

      The Computerized Neurocognitive function Test (CNT), the Korean version of the
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Rating Scale-IV (K-ADHD-RS-IV), the Clinical
      Global Impression (CGI) rating scale, the Frankfurt Attention Inventory (FAIR), and
      resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) were conducted before and after the experiment.
