  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether a combination of two research-proven programs,
      a responsive caregiving parenting program and a teacher training program, will have an effect
      on infants' and toddlers' language, cognitive, social-emotional, and self-regulation skills.
      The interventions are designed to specifically target parent use of a responsive, stimulating
      caregiving style in the home in combination with teacher instructional practices and the use
      of a responsive interactive style in the classroom.

    <measure>Change in teacher behavior as assessed by the The Quality of Caregiver-Child Interactions for Infant and Toddlers (Q-CCIIT) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scales: Support for Social Emotional Development (ratings range from 1 to 7 with higher values indicate better outcome), Support for Language and Literacy (ratings range from 1 to 7 with higher values indicate better outcome), Support for Cognitive Development (ratings range from 1 to 7 with higher values indicate better outcome), Areas of Concern (ratings range from 1 to 3 with higher values indicate worse outcome)</description>

    <measure>Change in parent behavior as assessed by coding of videotaped parent-child interactions during toy play in the home</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The parent-child dyad will be provided with a set of age-appropriate toys to use during a 15 minute period where parents are asked to play with their children in &quot;typical ways&quot; with a few constraints (e.g., television must be off). Specific variables in each of the four responsiveness components (i.e., support of children's signals and interests, contingent responsiveness, rich language input, warm sensitivity) will be coded from the activity using a previously developed coding system for videotaped parent-child interactions.</description>

    <description>Parent and child will be asked to engage in a 5 minute shared reading activity using books provided to family. Specific variables in each of the four responsiveness components (i.e., support of children's signals and interests, contingent responsiveness, rich language input, warm sensitivity) will be coded from the activity using a previously developed coding system for videotaped parent-child interactions.</description>

    <measure>Change in child self-regulation as assessed by a delay task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>A delay task will be administered to children 24 months and older. In the &quot;Gift/Waiting for the Bow&quot; paradigm the child is left alone for 3 minutes with the gift while the examiner gets a bow (actually, the experimenter will turn his/her back and engage in other activities) and is told not to touch or open the gift; latencies to touching and opening are recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in child self-regulation as assessed by a slowing down motor task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>A slowing down motor task will be administered to children 18 months and older. In the &quot;Walk the Line&quot; task, the child walks as slowly as possible down a 6 foot tape line on the floor to their parent; times for a baseline trial (child walk to parent as they normally would) and two slow trials are recorded live. This measure taps early inhibitory control, particularly the ability to modulate a response to context.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in child self-regulation as assessed by a suppressing/initiating a response task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>A suppressing/initiating a response task will be administered to children 22 months and older. In the &quot;Tower&quot; task the child and the experimenter build a tower together out of big, foam blocks. The experimenter explains to the child what it means to &quot;take turns.&quot; The experimenter then deliberately waits for the child to indicate that the experimenter may have a turn. This task also taps early inhibitory control, particularly the ability to inhibit a desired response (to place the block oneself), in favor of a more socially desirable response (give the experimenter a turn).</description>

Parents will begin their 11 week (infant) or 14 week (toddler) parenting program in October and complete it by April. There will be monthly Parent Meetings related to the content they are learning online. Post-assessments will occur in late April and May. Each weekly online parent session will take approximately 30 minutes to complete with a 40 - 60 minute weekly remote coach call.</description>

Teachers will complete the 20 online sessions weekly, except for planned center closings due to holidays or agency-related events. The three in-person trainings will occur before Session 1 and after Sessions 8 and 14. Each weekly online teacher session will take approximately one-hour for a teacher to complete with a 30 minute weekly remote coach call. Each in-person teacher training will be 6-hours in duration.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Given that the target population includes EHS agencies, low-income children speaking
             English and/or Spanish will be eligible for participation.

          -  In some cases, children with mild delays (e.g., receiving speech therapy services) can
             participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with significant developmental disabilities (e.g., intellectual disabilities,
             significant sensory impairments, and children diagnosed with moderately severe forms
             of Autism Spectrum Disorders) will not be consented for assessments as the
             interventions are not specialized to meet the needs of these children.

          -  Children primarily speaking a language other than Spanish or English will be excluded
             due to the fact that appropriate assessment procedures are lacking.

          -  In terms of exclusionary criteria for teachers, those that are participating in other
             research studies, or who have recently completed other similar studies, will not be
             recruited.
