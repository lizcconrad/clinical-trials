  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More and more people are surviving after receiving life support for respiratory failure in
      the intensive care unit, but these patients often experience problems with depression and
      physical functioning that lead to reduced quality of life. There is a lack of treatment for
      these patients, with past research suggesting that treatment may be more successful if mental
      and physical health are addressed at the same time. This research evaluates whether a therapy
      delivered via telephone and home visits, combining treatment for depression and physical
      rehabilitation, is feasible and might help patients recover.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A growing number of Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) survivors are burdened by depressive
      symptoms and physical impairments that last for years after intensive care unit discharge.
      Notably, depressive symptoms are independently associated with subsequent development of new
      impairments in physical functioning. There is a lack of treatment options to address these
      impairments in ARF survivors, with past research suggesting combining treatment for mental
      and physical health might be more successful.

      Therefore, this study is designed to evaluate:

        1. The feasibility (primary outcome) of participant recruitment and retention in a pilot
           randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an intervention combining Behavioral Activation (an
           evidence-based psychological treatment for depression) and physical rehabilitation
           delivered via telephone and 2 home visits over 12-weeks versus a &quot;usual care&quot; control
           group.

        2. The efficacy (secondary outcome) of this Behavioral Activation-Rehabilitation
           intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and improve physical functioning.

        3. Modifiable psychosocial risk factors for depressive symptoms in ARF survivors and the
           association between the intervention and these modifiable factors.

    <description>Participants will first receive a home visit from a physical therapist (PT) who will evaluate home safety and establish/verify the participant's exercise prescription. Within 1 week, an occupational therapist (OT) will visit the home to: 1) explain the purpose of behavioral activation (BA); 2) help the participant identify long-term recovery goals regarding &quot;valued activities&quot;; and 3) then, using the principles of BA, identify short-term goals for the next week and an action plan. The OT will then call the participant weekly (weeks 2-5) to review the status of the prior week's goals and use BA to set new goals for the upcoming week. The PT and OT will repeat home visits at week 6 to assess the participant's progress, and the OT will conduct phone calls every 2 weeks for weeks 8-12.</description>
