  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In adult kidney transplant recipients a therapy-responder and non-responder phenotype by
      antibody mediated rejection will be precisely defined according to clinical and histological
      characteristics such as creatinine, proteinuria and Banff-classification. Twenty-five
      patients will be selected each in the therapy-responder and non-responder group. Their stored
      Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) biopsies will be (re)-classified according to the
      most recent Banff classification. Using Nanostring Technology the gene transcription of
      therapy-responders versus non-responders will be analyzed and compared to serological and
      clinical parameters.

        All ABMR cases in patients who received a kidney transplant between 01.01.2008 - 31.12.2016
        will be pre-screened. As an approximate number of 90 kidney transplantations are performed
        per year at the University Hospital of ZÃ¼rich, a total of approximately 810 patients will
        be available for analysis. Yet, according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria we estimate
        roughly 50 patients to be finally recruited for analysis. Since we estimate a consent rate
        of about 50%, we will roughly contact 100 patients. A subset of 25 responders and 25
        non-responders according to the clinical course will be identified for further analysis
