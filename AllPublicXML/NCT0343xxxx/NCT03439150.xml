    <textblock>
      In acute myocardial infarction, early restoration of blood flow to the jeopardized myocardium
      is of paramount importance to limit infarct size and to improve long term outcome. Primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the treatment of choice in these patients.
      Despite achievement of adequate epicardial coronary artery reperfusion in many patients,
      transient or persistent myocardial microvascular dysfunction is often present, also referred
      to as the no-reflow phenomenon. This microvascular dysfunction and the time course during
      which it recovers, is most likely also related to long term outcome.

      If microvascular reperfusion is still limited immediately after myocardial infarction but
      recovers quickly in the days thereafter, this might be beneficial for long term prognosis.

      Several treatments have been suggested to limit microvascular injury and to improve
      microvascular reperfusion in the acute phase of myocardial infarction (such as intra-aortic
      balloon pumping, glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitors, adenosine, verapamil, nitroglycerine,
      cyclosporine, or gap-junction-inhibitors), but it has been difficult to assess the effect of
      such treatment due to the simple fact that no methodology has been available for quantitative
      assessment of the microcirculation of the heart.

      Assessment of microvascular perfusion and function has been very difficult so far and has
      been hampered by a number of methodological and technical shortcomings. Measurement of
      absolute blood flow in the infarcted area and true quantitative calculation of absolute
      resistance in acute myocardial infarction, has been introduced in the last years using a
      technique with thermodilution and continuous infusion of small amounts of saline. This
      technique offers the possibility to study the course of microvascular (dys)function after
      acute myocardial infarction with potentially important implications for treatment at
      follow-up. Technical performance of such measurements was difficult so far because of a
      complex instrumentation and the necessity of additional administration of intravenous
      adenosine. In the last 2 years, this technique has been largely simplified by the
      introduction of a new multipurpose monorail infusion catheter (RayFlow ®, Hexacath, Paris)
      and the observation that saline infusion of 15-20 ml/min in itself already ensures maximum
      coronary hyperemia. Finally, easy to handle software has been developed for online
      interpretation of such measurements. Consequently, measurement of absolute blood flow and
      myocardial resistance has become easy to perform now and the complete measurements only take
      a few minutes in addition to a regular PPCI or Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) measurement. The
      measurements are absolutely safe, reproducible, only a small amount of saline (100 ml at room
      temperature) is needed, no additional medication is necessary, the patient doesn't experience
      any discomfort of the measurement and the measurements can be repeated multiple times within
      minutes.

      Therefore, a window is opened for further examination and quantitative assessment of the
      microcirculation of the heart. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate changes in
      myocardial resistance over time in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) patients, both
      in the early stage and the subacute phase. Furthermore, the course of such changes and
      recovery of the microcirculation will be correlated to long-term outcome as assessed by
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements and final infarct size. It is hypothesized that
      patients can be divided into 3 groups:

      A. Patients with an (almost) normal resistance and flow immediately after PPCI B. Patients
      with still elevated resistance and decreased flow immediately after PPCI, but (partial)
      recovery in the next days C. Patients with elevated resistance and decreased flow immediately
      after PPCI which do not recover at all.

      The investigators would like to evaluate changes in microvascular resistance of the infarcted
      area in the first hour after ST-elevation myocardial infarction and during the recovery
      period (&lt;5 days). Classify patients according to recovery of microvascular resistance and
      relate the (recovery of) microvascular resistance to outcome and preservation of left
      ventricular function (with MRI, echo and clinical follow-up at 1 year).
