      50 menopausal women with the diagnosis of hot flushes were randomized to 1 of 2 groups

      Group (A):

      It consists of 25 women who practiced treadmill exercise program for 30 minutes at 60% to 70%
      of maximum heart rate. The treatment sessions will be repeated 3 times per week for 12 weeks.

      Group (B):

      It consists of 25 women who received diet modification contains soy products (phytoestrogen)
      such as soy milk and soy beans every day for 12 weeks only.
