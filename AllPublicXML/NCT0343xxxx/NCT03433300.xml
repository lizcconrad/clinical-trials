  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High-quality, empirical evidence to guide prosthetic rehabilitation following amputation
      ensures that Service members, Veterans, and civilians who experience limb loss have the
      potential to receive the highest quality care, regain mobility, return to gainful employment,
      and reintegrate into their communities. However, evidence to inform prosthetic care during
      the crucial post-amputation period is extremely limited. The proposed research will address
      this gap in knowledge by evaluating functional and patient-centered health outcomes
      associated with use of two distinct prosthetic knee technologies in early rehabilitation
      following transfemoral amputation. This novel, comparative effectiveness research aligns with
      the Prosthetic Outcomes Research Award (PORA) focus area of understanding the management of
      patient rehabilitation strategies throughout the rehabilitation process following
      neuromuscular injury.

      The long-term goals of this project are to optimize early rehabilitation processes and
      associated outcomes for Service members, Veterans, and civilians with lower limb amputation.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for different prosthetic knee
      technologies to promote function, health, and quality of life following amputation. A pilot
      randomized controlled trial will be conducted to compare falls, step activity, balance
      confidence, mobility, health-related quality of life, and community integration of people
      with recent transfemoral amputation in two prosthetic knee conditions: a microprocessor knee
      (MPK) with control of stance phase and a non-microprocessor knee (NMPK) that is appropriate
      for people in early rehabilitation.

    <description>The name of this tool is the Amputee Mobility Predictor (AMPPro) and it was developed by Robert Gailey, PhD, PT (https://www.sralab.org/rehabilitation-measures/amputee-mobility-predictor-0). The AMPPro assesses performance-based mobility for people who use prosthetic limbs. Example items include standing balance, ability to vary cadence, and ability to step over an obstacle.</description>

    <measure>Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and monthly for 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) measures the construct of balance confidence. The 16-item ABC survey asks respondents to rate their confidence in performing a variety of activities without becoming unstable (e.g., walking in the home, walking on a ramp, walking in crowds). Response options range from &quot;no confidence&quot; to &quot;completely confident&quot; when performing the activity. The revised scale proposed by Sakakibara (2011) will be used to calculate a total balance confidence score; scores for participants will range from 0 (low balance confidence) to 4 (high balance confidence).</description>
