  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the
      combination of TAK-228, carboplatin, and paclitaxel that can be given to patients with
      advanced cancer. The safety of the drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. TAK-228 is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      TAK-228 is currently being used for research purposes only. Carboplatin and paclitaxel are
      both FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of various cancers. The
      combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is frequently used in clinical practice. The
      combination of these drugs with TAK-228 to treat advanced cancer is considered
      investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 50 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will be
      assigned to a dose level of TAK-228, carboplatin, and paclitaxel based on when participant
      joins this study. Up to 6 dose levels of TAK-228, carboplatin, and paclitaxel will be tested.
      Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants
      will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive higher doses than the group
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest
      tolerable dose of the combination of TAK-228, carboplatin, and paclitaxel is found.

      After the highest tolerable doses are found, up to an additional 14 participants will be
      enrolled to receive the carboplatin, paclitaxel, and TAK-228 at the highest tolerable doses.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 21 days.

      Participant will take TAK-228 by mouth at about the same time each day on Days 2-4, 9-11, and
      16-18 of Cycles 1-6. Participant will take TAK-228 on Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond.

      Participant should swallow the dose whole with a full cup of water (about 8 ounces) on an
      empty stomach. Participant should not eat or drink anything for 2 hours before and 1 hour
      after participant's TAK-228 dose. Participant should take it at home except on the days when
      participant has a study visit.

      If participant misses a dose of TAK-228, and it has been less than 12 hours since
      participant's scheduled dose, participant can take the dose as soon as participant remembers.
      If more than 12 hours has passed since missing a dose at the normal time, participant should
      not take the dose. Participant should wait and take participant's next dose as scheduled.

      Participant will be asked to keep a study drug diary and document when participant takes
      participant's doses. Participant should bring this diary with participant to all clinic
      visits.

      Participant will receive carboplatin by vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-6.

      Participant will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles
      1-6.

      Participant may be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects.
      Participant may ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their
      risks.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Participant may continue taking carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to 6 cycles. Participant
      may continue taking TAK-228 for as long as the doctor thinks it is in participant's best
      interest. Participant will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study
      directions.

      Participation on the study will be over when participant has completed the follow-up visit.

      Study Visits:

      At every study visit, participant will be asked about participant's health, any other drugs
      participant is taking, and if participant has had any side effects. Participant must fast for
      at least 8 hours before each visit.

      On Day 1 of every cycle:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests. Part of this
           blood sample will be used to check participant's glucose levels.

        -  Participant will have an EKG (Cycle 1 only). After Cycle 1, participant will have this
           performed whenever the doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1 and then every 3 cycles after that (Cycle 4, 7, 10, and so on) blood
           (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for tumor marker testing.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. If the
           test is positive, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to confirm participant is
           pregnant.

      On Day 8 and 15 of Cycles 1-6:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check participant's
           glucose levels.

      Every 2 cycles, participant will have a CT and/or MRI scan to check the status of the
      disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, they will be performed more often.

      At-Home Glucose Monitoring:

      Participant will be asked to monitor participant's glucose levels at home. The study staff
      will give participant a glucose monitor (called a glucometer) and teach participant how and
      when to use it. Participant will continue to monitor participant's glucose levels at home
      until participant's end-of-study visit. Participant will bring the glucometer with
      participant to each study visit so the study staff can collect the results of the testing.

      The study team will tell participant what an abnormal level is and when to contact the study
      doctor/study staff.

      Participant will need to return the glucometer to the study staff at the end of the study.

      End-of-Study Visits:

      On the last day that participant receives study drugs and again about 30 days after
      participant's last dose of study drugs:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests, to check participant's
           glucose levels, and to test for diabetes.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have a CT and/or MRI scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  On the last day participant takes the study drugs, participant will have an EKG and
           ECHO.

        -  On the last day participant takes the study drugs, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be
           drawn for tumor marker testing.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test. If the
           test is positive, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to confirm participant is
           pregnant.

      If participant has side effects at the end-of-study visit and the doctor thinks it is needed,
      participant will continue to come into the clinic to have the above tests/procedures repeated
      until the side effects go away.
