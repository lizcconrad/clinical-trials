  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether a standardized extract of Withania somnifera will reduce psychopathology
      scores (PANSS total score) in persons with schizophrenia. A secondary aim is to determine
      whether WSE reduces measures of positive and negative symptoms (PANSS subscales) and stress
      scores on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).

    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. To assess a patient using PANSS, an approximately 45-minute clinical interview is conducted. The patient is rated from 1 to 7 on 30 different symptoms based on the interview as well as reports of family members or primary care hospital workers. A patient cannot score lower than 30 for the total PANSS score. Scores are often given separately for the positive items, negative items, and general psychopathology.</description>

             grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, hostility and unusual thought content)
             scoring ≥ 4, or one of these items scoring ≥ 5, on a scale ranging from 1 = absent to
