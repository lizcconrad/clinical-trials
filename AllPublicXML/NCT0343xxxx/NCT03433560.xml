  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate real-world safety and efficacy of
      pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) administered as secondary prophylaxis in Korean female patients with
      breast cancer receiving chemotherapy regimens recently covered under national health
      insurance. This is a prospective, observational, open-label trial with a target enrollment of
      1400 subjects.

      Primary endpoint The primary aim of this study is to determine the incidence of febrile
      neutropenia.

      Secondary endpoint Major secondary endpoint include a) Incidence of bone pain, b) All adverse
      events, c) Percentage of patients with RDI (relative dose intensity) ≥ 85%
