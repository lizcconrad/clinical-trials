  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to investigate if lipofilling with its adipose derived stem
      cells (ADSC) could be a new, less invasive but equally or more effective therapeutic option
      for women with vestibulodynia than vestibulectomy. The investigators expect the study to be
      successful because of the anti-inflammatory effects of the ADSC and its effectiveness
      -although not thoroughly studied- in some neuropathic pain disorder like pudendal neuralgia
      or post mastectomy pain syndrome.

      Method: A controlled intervention study: one group receiving golden standard therapy
      'vestibulectomy' and one group receiving vestibular lipofilling.

    <description>Very light pressure along specific points in the area of the vulvar vestibule and where there is tenderness, asking the patient to characterize the tenderness on a scale of 0-10, whether it's no pain or exquisite pain and then plotting that on a diagram. Most physicians will find that in women with vestibulitis, the tenderness is most pronounced just below the hymenal margin and around the orifices of the so-called &quot;Bartholin&quot; gland ducts.</description>
