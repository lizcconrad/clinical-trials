      BACKGROUND:

      Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS) are frequent in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD).
      Clinical expressions, postulated pathophysiological mechanisms and responsiveness to
      antiparkinson medication represent differences between IPD and secondary Parkinsonism (SP).

      OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate NMS expressions in IPD, SP and a control group.

      METHODS:

      Diagnosis of SP was supported by comorbidity, radiological findings, type of onset, onset
      rate and progression, exposures for neuroleptics, and responsiveness to pharmacological
      antiparkinson therapy.

      The participants were consecutively recruited at two outdoor patient clinics. The Well-Being
      Map™ for evaluation. These were completed by the participants at one point before visit. The
      controls consisted of non-Parkinsonian individuals, matched by age and gender.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A graded check list presented in The Parkinson´s Well-BeingMap is used in the registration of self reported frequencies and self experienced strength of Motor and Non- Motor Symptoms in two different forms of parkinsonism and in a group of healthy controls.The experienced magnitude of suffering is visualized in a spider diagram reflecting the strength of each item on an ordinal scale from 0 to four.
Primary outcome measure is to compare reported frequencies between groups.</description>
