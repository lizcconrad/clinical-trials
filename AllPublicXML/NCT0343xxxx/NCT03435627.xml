             activities are any procedure related to recording of data according to the protocol).

          -  The decision to initiate treatment with commercially available Norditropin® has been
             made by the patient/Legally Acceptable Representative (LAR) and the treating physician

          -  For naïve patients; short stature due to Noonan syndrome diagnosed by the physician
             and a decision to initiate treatment with Norditropin® has been made by the
             patient/parent and the physician. At study sites, all patients will be registered
             consecutively from the first patient after approval date (consecutively registered
             system).

          -  Male or female, 3 years old or over, bone age: less than 17 years old for male / less

          -  In case of naïve patients; patients who have received growth hormone (GH) products for
             treatment of indication other than short stature due to Noonan syndrome before
             approval date of Noonan indication.
