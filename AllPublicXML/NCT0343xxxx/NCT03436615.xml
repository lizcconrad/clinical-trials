  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled ascending dose
      study to be conducted in up to approximately 192 or 256 non-immunocompromised subjects with
      molluscum contagiosum. Subjects who satisfy entry criteria will be randomized 3:1 to
      ascending, sequential dose cohorts of SB206. The highest tolerated dose will also be run in a
      cohort once daily. Approximately 64 subjects will be randomized to each cohort. Subjects will
      be treated once daily, twice daily or three times a week for up to 12 weeks. After 30
      subjects randomized in a cohort have completed 2 weeks of treatment, the Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the available unblinded safety and tolerability data. The
      DSMB will determine if the data supports escalating to the next highest dose for the next
      cohort or if the data shows the dose is not tolerable decreasing to the next lower dose or
      frequency for the next cohort.
