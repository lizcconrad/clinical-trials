  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to investigate how low intensity cycling exercise (1.5W/kg,
      for 6 minutes) influences cerebral functions, such as: Cerebral blood flow, oxygenation, and
      other physiological variables in different normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will bike at 1W/kg for 6 minutes at different simulated altitude level in the
      hypobaric chamber at the FAI in Dübendorf. Concentration performance also will be measured to
      better understand how hypobaric and hypoxia conditions may affect physiological responses,
      cerebral and cognitive functions.
