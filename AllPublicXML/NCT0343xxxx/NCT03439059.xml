  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the nation's fastest growing demographic being adults over 65, one in every three
      seniors is estimated to die from Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The strong correlation between AD
      and age, combined with the exponential growth of this demographic, highlights the need for
      non-pharmaceutical treatment/prevention strategies. Research has established a relationship
      between moderate to vigorous physical activity (PA) and improved cognitive functioning.
      However, there is insufficient evidence to support this relationship at the lower end of the
      PA spectrum. Assisted living facilities (ALF) are an easy target for reducing SB, as many
      individuals in these facilities have various functional limitations and therefore cannot meet
      the recommended PA guidelines. Older adults are also the most sedentary population, with
      results showing over 8.5+ hours daily spent in SB. ALF typically provide meals, laundry
      services as well as housekeeping duties, leaving the residents very susceptible to large
      amounts of SB. The primary purpose of my study is investigating how reducing sedentary
      behaviour (SB) in ALF will affect Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive scores among
      65-85-year-olds with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. I will also investigate its
      effects on physical functioning with the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), quality of life with the
      Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey, and sleep with the Mpow IP68 tracker. Participants will
      be prompted to take a 10-minute light intensity PA break at three different time points
      throughout the day, reallocating SB to any task equating to over 1.5 metabolic equivalents.
      Positive findings may encourage ALF to implement policies and procedures regarding SB.

      Dementia is the leading cause of dependence and disability worldwide. With the nation's
      fastest growing demographic being adults over 65, the Lewy Body Dementia Association states
      that the current cost puts it higher than either heart disease or cancer; as the financial
      burden was estimated at $818 billion in 2015. Functional limitations such as a slower gait,
      muscle weakness (ex. grip strength), unintentional weight loss and self-reported exhaustion
      adds pressure on healthcare services. Older adults transitioning into assisted living
      facilities (ALF) will need assistance with activities of daily living; as this population is
      the most sedentary. Although exercise interventions show positive effects for the management
      of chronic diseases, as well as cognition and physical functioning, the Canadian Health
      Measures Survey reported that only 13% of older adults 60- 79 years old were meeting the
      physical activity (PA) guidelines set out by the World Health Organization. That said,
      research has yet to establish what benefits may come from the lower end of the PA spectrum;
      and there are no current guidelines for how long older adults should be sedentary. Research
      shows that large amounts of sedentary behaviour (SB) leads to an increased risk of all-cause
      mortality, independent from not meeting the PA guidelines (Ekelund et al., 2016). SB is
      defined as any waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure less than or equal to
      1.5 metabolic equivalents while in a sitting or reclining posture. Alzheimer's Disease (AD)
      is the most common form of Dementia, accounting for 60-80% of cases; and Mild Cognitive
      Impairment (MCI) is generally used to refer to the transitional zone between normal cognitive
      functioning and clinically probable AD. With no current cure for AD, the need for effective
      non-pharmaceutical treatments are imperative.

      The purpose of my study will be to investigate the effect of reducing SB on Alzheimer's
      Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive (ADAS-cog) scores among 65-75-year-olds with moderate
      cognitive impairment. Also, examine their changes in physical functioning and their quality
      of life. I hypothesize that the decline in ADAS-cog scores will be slower and physical scores
      as well as quality of life (QoL) scores will improve in the intervention group vs controls.

      A 6-week clustered randomized control trail involving an ALF in London, Ontario will be
      conducted. The intervention group will be prompted to take a 10-minute light intensity PA
      break three times throughout the day. The PA will be any task equating to over 1.5 metabolic
      equivalents and will be recorded in a simplified diary. Eligible subjects will undergo the
      following tests at baseline: 1) the Mini Mental State Examination and 2) the Community
      Healthy Activities Program for Seniors survey. The following test will be done at baseline as
      well as at the end of the 6-week intervention: 1) Timed Up and Go test (TUG) for physical
      functioning; 2) ADAS-cog for cognitive functioning; and 3) the Short Form- 36 Health Survey
      to assess QoL. Both groups will wear an activity tracker bracelet monitoring heart rate,
      steps, sleep and calories burned throughout the study.

      Research at the bottom end of the PA spectrum is crucial, as residents in ALF have various
      functional limitations; and many cannot meet the current PA guidelines. If improvements are
      shown from my study, this could contribute to the design of a policy that can be implemented
      into all ALF; lessening the burden on the health care system and loved ones.
