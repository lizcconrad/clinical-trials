  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a life-long neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
      qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal social interactions and patterns of communication,
      and by a restricted, stereotyped, repetitive repertoire of interests and activities. The use
      of medications in adolescents and young adults with ASD is extremely common. However, few
      data address the effectiveness and harms of medications specifically in this population.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine with
      dexmedetomidine in children with ASD.

      The use of medications in adolescents and young adults with ASD is extremely common. few data
      address the effectiveness and harms of medications specifically in this population. A
      previous study reported the first case study demonstrating clinical improvement in mood and
      eye fixation scores from intranasal ketamine treatment in a &quot;complicated&quot; subject with autism
      spectrum disorderHowever,The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of
      intranasal ketamine with dexmedetomidine in children with ASD.

    <description>ABC is a scale used for nonadaptive behaviors created to screen and indicate the probability of a diagnosis of autism. The questionnaire approaches 57 atypical behaviors related to five areas: sensorial, relational, use of body and objects, and social skills.

    <measure>Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks, 4 weeks,12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CARS assesses the child on a scale from 1 to 4 in each of 15 dimensions or symptoms (including the ability to relate to people, emotional response, imitation, body use, object use, listening response, fear or nervousness, verbal communication, nonverbal communication, activity level, level and reliability of intellectual response, adaptation to changes, visual response, taste, smell and touch responses and general impressions). A total score of at least 30 strongly suggests the presence of autism. Children who score between 30 and 36 have mild-to-moderate autism while those with scores between 37 and 60 have severe autism.
