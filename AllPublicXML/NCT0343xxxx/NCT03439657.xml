  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals' HZ
      vaccine when its first dose is co-administered with a pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate
      vaccine (Prevenar13) in adults aged ≥50 YOA, as compared to the control group where the two
      HZ/su doses are administered subsequent to Prevenar13.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following the initial approval of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals' HZ/su vaccine, the
      protocol was amended to indicate that the trademark is Shingrix. In addition, the term
      &quot;candidate&quot; vaccine has been replaced by &quot;study&quot; vaccine throughout the protocol.

             from disease or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccines.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F. The preferred location for

               -  Subjects with a minor illness without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of
                  the investigator.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting
             3 months before the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the
