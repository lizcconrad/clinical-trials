    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label study of CPI-613 in combination with gemcitabine and
      nab-paclitaxel for patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer never
      treated with systemic chemotherapy.

      The primary specific aim of the study is to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      CPI-613 when given in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel for patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          3. First line treatment for patients diagnosed with metastatic disease

          4. First line treatment for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who have not
             been treated with systemic therapies. Prior treatment with chemoradiation is allowed
             if 4 or more weeks have passed from completion of chemo-radiotherapy.

          5. Expected survival &gt; 3 months.

          6. Women of child-bearing potential must use accepted contraceptive methods (abstinence,
             intrauterine device, oral contraceptive, or double barrier device) during the study,
             and must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to
             treatment initiation.

          7. Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study, unless
             documentation of infertility exists.

          8. Laboratory values ≤2 weeks must be:

             A. Adequate hematologic (platelet count ≥ 100,000 cells/mm^3 or ≥ 100 bil/L; absolute
             neutrophil count [ANC] ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 or ≥1.5 bil/L; and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL or ≥ 90
             g/L).

             B. Adequate hepatic function (aspartate aminotransferase [AST/SGOT] ≤ 3x upper normal
             limit [UNL], alanine aminotransferase [ALT/SGPT] ≤ 3x UNL (≤ 5x UNL if liver
             metastases present), Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN C. Adequate renal function (serum
             creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL or 177 μmol/L). D. Adequate coagulation (International
             Normalized Ratio or INR must be ≤ 1.5), unless the patient receives anticoagulation
             treatment in which case the INR should be within the therapeutic level, not higher
             than 3.5 E. Albumin &gt; 2.5 g/dL

          9. No evidence of active infection and no serious infection within the past month.

         10. Mentally competent, ability to understand and willingness to sign the informed consent
             form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             carcinoma

          2. Known cerebral metastases, central nervous system (CNS), or epidural tumor

          3. Prior treatment with any systemic chemotherapy for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas or for stage III (locally advanced) adenocarcinoma

          4. Presence of clinically significant abdominal ascites

          5. Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their cancer,
             or any other investigational agent for any indication within the past 2 weeks prior to
             initiation of CPI-613 treatment.

          6. Serious medical illness that would potentially increase patients' risk for toxicity.

          7. Any active uncontrolled bleeding, and any patients with a bleeding diathesis (e.g.,
             active peptic ulcer disease).

          8. Pregnant women, or women of child-bearing potential not using reliable means of
             contraception (because the teratogenic potential of CPI-613 is unknown).

          9. Lactating females.

         10. Fertile men unwilling to practice contraceptive methods during the study period.

         11. Life expectancy less than 3 months.

         15. Patients with a history of myocardial infarction that is &lt;3 months prior to
             registration.

             prior to initiation of CPI-613 treatment. Steroid use for contrast induced allergy or
             other supportive care indication is allowed

         19. Requirement for immediate palliative treatment of any kind including surgery.

         20. Any other malignancy within last 3 years

         21. History of interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary
             hypersensitivity pneumonitis
