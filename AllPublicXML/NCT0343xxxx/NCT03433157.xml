      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the clinical performance of Stainless
      Stain Crowns Placed Using the Hall Technique and Traditional Technique

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stainless Stain Crowns (SSCs) will be placed on two primary molar teeth with proximal caries,
      in a split mouth design. 200 patients will be included in the study. The teeth will be
      randomized into two groups according to the technique.

      Group 1: SSCs that will be placed using Traditional Technique Group 2: SSCs that will be
      placed using Hall Technique The cooperation of the child during the procedure will be
      assessed with Frankl scale. The crowns will be evaluated at baseline and 1., 6., 12., 18.,
      24. months. Radiographical evaluations will be at 6.,12. and 24. months. The data will be
      analysed statistically using chi square test and Log-Rank test and the Kaplan-Meier survival
      method will be used to estimate survival percentages.

    <description>Assessment of SSCs placed with two different techniques on primary molar teeth. The cooperation of children will be assessed with Frankl Scale (1:definitely negative, 2:negative, 3:positive, 4:definitely positive).
Evaluation criteria will be;
spontaneous pain (absent/present);
tenderness to percussion/palpation (absent/present);
mobility (no mobility/ 1mm/ 2mm/ 3mm mobility)
swelling (absent/present);
fistula (absent/present)
periapical/interradicular radiolucency (absent/present);
widened periodontal ligament (absent/present);
loss of lamina dura (absent/present);
internal/external root resorption (absent/present)
the marginal adaptation of each crown: good when the margins were sealed / poor when the margins were open
retention of the crown (absent/ present)
fracture of the crown (absent/ present)
gingival health/gingivitis (absent/ present)
plaque around the crown (absent/ present)</description>
