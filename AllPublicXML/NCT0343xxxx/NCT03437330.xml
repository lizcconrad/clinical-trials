      Empagliflozin effect on glucose toxicity in type 2 diabetes patients - a randomized,
      open-label, controlled, parallel group, exploratory study
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EMPA-REG outcome trial showed that empagliflozin on top of standard therapy for Type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) resulted in superiority in terms of the primary composite
      cardiovascular endpoint (hazard ratio (1) = 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.99; P
      value = 0.04), hospitalization for heart failure (-35%), cardiovascular mortality (-38%) and
      all-cause mortality (-32%, each p &lt; 0.001) (2). This reduction in mortality is not fully
      explained by the reduction in HbA1c, body weight, waist circumference and blood pressure in
      the empagliflozin groups versus the placebo group. Differences in mode of action of
      empagliflozin compared to standard therapy might, thus, help to explain why empagliflozin was
      so efficient in reducing cardiovascular death.

      The aim of the present study is to provide evidence for a reduction of skeletal muscle H2O2
      levels, and consequently improvement in mitochondrial function, and restored methylation
      pattern of key transcription factors in skeletal muscle from patients with T2DM when treated
      with empagliflozin versus insulin glargine as the prototypical medication favoring glucose
      uptake into tissues. It is hypothesized that empagliflozin compared to insulin specifically
      reduces H2O2 concentrations in skeletal muscle of patients with T2DM, because it leads to
      excretion of glucose and lower glucose uptake in skeletal muscle (22), while insulin shifts
      the major part of excess glucose into skeletal muscle cells.
