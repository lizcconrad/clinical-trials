  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gene expression, the transfer of the genetic code into cellular proteins is one of the most
      fundamental processes in living cells. This process is orchestrated by protein-based
      molecular machines, called RNA polymerases that read the DNA sequence to generate messenger
      RNA (mRNA), which is translated by the cellular machinery to make proteins. Our cells have
      evolved elaborate regulation mechanisms to control these molecular machines and a breakdown
      in this regulation leads to diseases such as cancer.

      Recently, molecules called myosins have been discovered in the genetic storage compartment of
      the cell (the nucleus) where they interact with RNA polymerases to regulate protein
      production. This is interesting because myosins are usually found outside the nucleus
      transporting cellular cargo or generating muscle contraction. In breast cancer cells, myosin
      is abundant and interacts with the oestrogen receptor. The majority of breast cancer in the
      UK is oestrogen receptor positive and activation of this receptor is an important factor
      controlling the growth of cancer cells. Oestrogen receptor activation appears to be dependent
      upon myosin and this research project will investigate how myosins are targeted to specific
      genes and how they are themselves regulated. This will greatly enhance our understanding of
      the role of nuclear myosins in oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer and may identify a
      novel therapeutic target for future drug development.

      Purpose and Design The primary aim of this project is to understand the significance of the
      newly discovered interaction between myosin VI (MVI) and the oestrogen receptor in breast
      cancer cells. The study will investigate the types of genes that MVI regulates and whether
      the sites of MVI - oestrogen receptor interactions (nucleus or cytoplasm) are important for
      the expression of oestrogen receptor targets. In breast cancer cells, oestrogen receptors can
      mutate to become permanently activated, leading to unrestrained tumour growth. Investigating
      the role of MVI in this metabolic scenario may reveal a potential therapeutic window for
      hormone refractory oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer.

      In order to answer these questions, the methodology will use combination of experiments on
      established cell lines and patient samples.

      The research proposal is a collaborative effort between Dr Chris Toseland (whose group has
      identified the link between MVI and the oestrogen receptor) at the University of Kent and the
      Breast Surgery, Pathology and Research and Development departments at Maidstone and Tunbridge
      Wells NHS Trust.

      Recruitment Potential patients for recruitment will be identified at the weekly
      multi-disciplinary meeting following a diagnosis of primary breast cancer and a decision to
      proceed with surgery as the first treatment. The actual explanation of the study will take
      place during the first treatment planning consultation with the treating breast surgeon. The
      patient will be given written information about the study as well as a contact number of a
      research nurse/ breast care nurse specialist for them to call if they wish to be included in
      the study. A second clinic appointment will be made with the co-investigator Miss Karina Cox
      to re-discuss the trial and obtain written consent. The consultant surgeon is familiar with
      the process of consent and will determine whether the patient has capacity to give consent
      for the study. We will exclude all patients with a metabolic disorder, significant
      co-morbidities and locally advanced or metastatic disease as well as those with a previous
      history of cancer treatment as the results of the study may be affected by their underlying
      disorder, previous treatment or current medication.

      Confidentiality The study will be conducted within the &quot;Caldicott Principles'. Patients
      enrolled in the study will be given a unique identification number which will used on samples
      sent to The University of Kent for experiments. The clinical co-investigator will maintain a
      secure database of patient identifiable information including demographic and
      clinico-pathological tumour data.

      Conflict of Interest There are no conflicts of interest with this study. Any publications
      relating to this research will be summarised and distributed to participating patients.

      Tissue samples will not be stored indefinitely. All the tissue from the fresh frozen
      specimens will be used for the experiments. The paraffin slides, once analysed, will be
      returned from the University of Kent to Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells Pathology Department.
