  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to observe clinical outcomes of patient-specific knee arthroplasty in
      patients with osteoarthritis of the medial condyle.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient-specific Bodycad Unicompartmental Knee System will be implanted on patients with
      knee osteoarthritis of the medial condyle. The study's hypothesis is that personalized shape
      and fit of patient-specific knee replacement prosthesis will provide a greater stability and
      a more natural knee motion in addition to a faster recovery when compared to traditional knee
      replacement systems. This study is designed to provide a five-years follow-up clinical data
      on safety and effectiveness of the device.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Medial unicompartmental knee osteoarthritic disease diagnosed on the basis of the
             American College of Rheumatology criterion with radiographic confirmation (Kellgren-
             Lawrence grade 3 or higher, on a scale of 0 to 4, with higher numbers indicating more
             severe signs of osteoarthritis); or isolated medial compartment post-traumatic
             arthritis supported by long film (x-ray);

          2. Between the ages of at least 45 years and 65 years (inclusive) at the time of
             enrollment;

          3. Stable health as judged by the Investigator;

          4. Willingness to adhere to the protocol requirements as evidenced by the informed
             consent form duly read, signed and dated by the subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of active or latent infection in the knee;

          2. Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis or avascular necrosis;

          3. Presence of moderate patellofemoral osteoarthritic disease or patellofemoral
             maltracking;

          4. Anterior or posterior translational, varus or valgus ligamentous knee instability
             and/or deformity;

          9. Skeletal immaturity;

         10. Obesity: BMI above 35

         11. Risk of exposing the prosthesis to overload by the practice of contact or high impact

             other general body pain conditions, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             interfere with the conduct of the study;

             prosthesis or other postoperative complications;

         15. Subjects, in the opinion of the Investigator, who are unlikely to comply with the
             protocol (e.g. active alcoholism, drug dependency or psychotic state, unable or
             unwilling to adhere to study visit schedule);

         16. Pregnant or nursing female subjects; or female subjects planning on becoming pregnant
