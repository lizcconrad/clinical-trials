  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand the effect of nutritional ketosis on CNS
      oxygen toxicity in undersea divers. The investigators hope this will provide a starting point
      to develop methods for improving the safety of Navy divers, warfighters and submariners.

      Participants in the study will undergo a physical exam and testing as well as training on
      cognitive testing software as part of the screening process. Eligible subjects will be
      assigned a normal diet or a ketogenic diet (a diet high in fat/protein and low in
      carbohydrates) for three days before testing. Subjects will be immersed in water to the
      shoulders, inside a hyperbaric (high pressure) chamber while breathing 100% oxygen at
      increased atmospheric pressure, and doing cycling exercise. Testing on the cognitive
      software, as well as blood sampling and physical monitoring will be done while in the
      chamber. All tests and procedures will be completed again at least one week later with the
      diet not assigned for the first session.
