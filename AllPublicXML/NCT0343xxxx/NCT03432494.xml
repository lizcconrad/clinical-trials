      Background:

      TAVR is a common therapy for people with heart problems as a better option than surgery. It
      stands for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. It is usually done by inserting a catheter
      (thin tube) through a groin artery. But this isn t safe for everyone. Researchers developed a
      new technique called transcaval access. The catheter is placed in the artery deep in the body
      by crossing through the wall of a deep vein. The connection between that vein and the aorta
      is closed with a new metallic device they are testing. This is called a transcaval closure
      device (TCD).

      Objective:

      To test the safety and early feasibility of closure of transcaval aortic access sites using
      the TCD after TAVR.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 21 and older undergoing TAVR for whom the procedure cannot be performed safely by
      the standard artery approach

      Design:

      Participants will be assessed by heart experts including cardiologists and surgeons.

      Participants will have TAVR by the transcaval approach. A small catheter will be passed
      between the largest vein in the body and the nearby largest artery (aorta), inside the
      abdomen. Through this catheter, the TAVR will be implanted in the usual way.

      After, doctors will implant the TCD by catheter to close the hole made in the aorta.

      Participants will be X-rayed. A dye will be injected to view the TCD device.

      Participants will get standard TAVR care afterwards. They will have physical exams, blood
      tests, and scans.

      Participants will have a follow-up scan within 1 month and after 12 months.

      Participants will have follow-up visits and phone calls 6 and 12 months after the procedure.

      Transcaval access to the abdominal aorta from the neighboring inferior vena cava (IVC)
      enables transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients not eligible for femoral
      artery access. Currently the procedure is performed using devices, off-label, designed and
      marketed to close holes inside the heart and great vessels, manufactured by Abbott St Jude
      (Amplatzer Duct Occluder and Amplatzer Muscular VSD Occluder). Because these Amplatzer
      occluders are not designed to close transcaval access sites, they may not completely prevent
      bleeding.

      This is an early feasibility study (EFS) evaluation of a purpose-built closure device for
      transcaval access. The device, the Transcaval closure device (TCD) will be evaluated for
      safety and performance to close transcaval access sites in patients ineligible for femoral
      artery access for TAVR.
