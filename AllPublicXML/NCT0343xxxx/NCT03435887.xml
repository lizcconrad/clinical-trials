      Innovative strategies to expedite HIV diagnosis among exposed infants, including at-birth
      testing and two portable point-of-care (POC) diagnostic systems, will be evaluated from an
      implementation framework. The programmatic impact of these tools on early infant diagnosis
      (EID) will be measured in comparison with parallel standard of care (SOC) HIV DNA PCR testing
      initiated at 6 weeks of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Testing HIV-exposed infants by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing at 6 weeks is often
      not early enough to mitigate the substantial mortality peak that occurs around 2-3 months of
      age. Initial testing at birth would foster more rapid identification of infants with
      intrauterine (IU) infection and speed up the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for
      HIV-positive infants. Consequently, Kenya introduced new early infant diagnosis guidelines
      recommending at-birth (0-2 weeks) virologic testing in addition to the SOC tests at 6 weeks
      (6 - &lt;24 weeks), 6 months and 12 months. POC testing performed in the clinic setting can
      potentially further reduce the time to diagnosis. Investigators will pilot test the
      implementation, performance, and cost-effectiveness of two POC test systems (Xpert HIV-1
      Qual, Alere q HIV-1/2 Detect) in samples from neonates (at-birth test) and older infants
      (6-week test) in four government hospitals in Kenya.

      In the formative phase of the study, interviews will be conducted with parents, providers and
      community members regarding benefits and concerns about the implementation of at-birth and
      POC testing. Interviews with parents (pregnant women living with HIV and their partners if
      available) will focus on the impact for the child and family. Interviews with providers who
      would carry out POC testing at each site (maternity nurses, mentor mothers, hospital
      laboratory staff) will highlight issues of training, logistics and implementation. Interviews
      with community members (parents of HIV-exposed infants, community health workers, community
      leaders) in surrounding communities will elicit attitudes and suggestions regarding the
      potential for POC HIV testing in hard to access communities. Investigators will develop a
      codebook with typical exemplars for each theme, calculating the frequency and distribution of
      themes within the larger topic areas. The study team will rapidly review themes to inform the
      POC pilot.

      In the clinical phase the investigators will pilot at-birth and POC infant testing strategies
      in four hospitals. Sites will be randomized to pilot Xpert HIV-1 Qual (n=2) or Alere q
      HIV-1/2 Detect (n=2), both targeting the at-birth and 6-week testing points. A second blood
      sample will be collected at each time point to be tested by SOC laboratory-based HIV DNA PCR,
      which will correspond with the Kenya government's 2016 guidelines that recommend adding an
      at-birth test to the EID schedule. At-birth samples will ideally be collected within 24 hours
      of delivery and results communicated to the mother with counseling prior to discharge from
      maternity. The expected due dates of exposed infant will be tracked to encourage mothers who
      deliver outside the hospital to return for infant testing within two weeks postnatal. Infants
      enrolled in this pilot will be tracked until HIV results at birth and 6 weeks postnatal have
      been provided by POC and standard PCR, or until ART is initiated for HIV-positive infants.
      Investigators will assess user uptake, age at notification of HIV test results, age of ART
      initiation among HIV+ infants, POC machine performance, costs, and user experiences
      (providers will participate in a monthly focus group to discuss challenges and solutions) to
      inform the feasibility and optimal implementation of Kenya's 2016 at-birth test
      recommendation and of the mobile POC test systems for the improvement of EID outcomes.
