  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the blocking of [18F]-JNJ-64413739 uptake in the
      brain at the time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) and at 24 hours postdose of
      JNJ-55308942 following a single dose of JNJ-55308942; and to model the exposure/receptor
      interaction of JNJ-55308942.

    <description>Participants will first undergo a baseline positron emission tomography (PET)/ magnetic resonance (MR) scan with [18F]-JNJ-64413739 on Day 1. In Period 1 (on Day 2) and Period 2 (on Day 1), participants will receive oral dose of JNJ-55308942 (maximum dose 120 milligram [mg]). After approximately 4 hours of JNJ-55308942 dosing, participants will receive an intravenous (IV) injection of [18F]-JNJ-64413739, followed by a PET/MR scan. Doses will be selected based on the principal investigator's discretion. A wash-out period of at least 7 days will be maintained between the 2 doses of JNJ-55308942.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) inclusive
             (BMI = weight/height^2)

          -  Is willing to allow the investigators to place an arterial catheter in the radial
             artery, is assessed via physical examination (Allen Test) to be a good candidate for
             arterial catheter placement and should not be allergic to local anesthetics for
             catheter placement

          -  During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as
             approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose of study drug participants must
             agree not to donate sperm. If a participant is sexually active with a woman he should
             agree to the following: (a) If it concerns a woman of childbearing potential and the
             participant has not had a vasectomy, the participant must agree to use a condom and
             make sure his female partner is using a highly effective method of birth control
             during the study and for a minimum of 90 days after the last dose of study drug. (b)
             If it concerns a woman of nonchild bearing potential, who is pregnant or has been
             sterilized and the participant has not had a vasectomy, the participant must agree to
             use a condom for the given period. (c) If the participant has had a vasectomy, he
             should agree to use a condom when being sexually active with a woman of child bearing
             potential. Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local
             regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating
             in clinical studies

          -  Participants must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they
             understand the purpose of, and procedures required for the study and are willing to
             participate in the study and comply with the study procedures and restrictions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exposed to greater than (&gt;) 1 millisievert (mSv) of ionizing radiation participating
             as a participant in research studies in the 12 months before the start of this study

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry or
             urinalysis at screening. It is expected that laboratory values will generally be
             within the normal range for the laboratory, though minor deviations, which are not
             considered to be of clinical significance to the Principal Investigator, are
             acceptable

          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical and neurological examination, vital signs or
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening or admission

          -  History of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)
             cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, coagulation abnormalities, or other
             conditions that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant and preclude
             their ability to participate in study procedures. Participants with a history
             significant liver or renal disease, or difficulty in urination, which could affect the
             metabolism and elimination of the radiotracer or radiometabolites should be excluded.
             Participants with a history of epilepsy or fits or unexplained black-outs or loss of
             consciousness should also be excluded

          -  Participant has a QT corrected according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval of
             &gt;450 millisecond (msec) at Screening or prior to &quot;baseline&quot; on Day 1, or has a history
             of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (example, heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)
