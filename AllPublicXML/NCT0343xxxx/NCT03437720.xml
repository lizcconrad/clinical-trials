  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the dose response relationship of SAR425899 compared to placebo on resolution
      of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with no worsening of fibrosis in diabetic and
      non-diabetic patients with histopathologically-confirmed NASH.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the effect of SAR425899 on overall non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
           activity score (NAS), individual components of NAS (steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning,
           and lobular inflammation), and fibrosis score.

        -  To assess to the effect of SAR425899 on MRI-PDFF (Magnetic Resonance Imaging-determined
           Proton Density Fat Fraction) derived parameters (total liver fat, liver volume, and
           fractional liver fat content).

        -  To assess the effect of SAR425889 on body weight and waist/hip circumference ratio.

        -  To assess SAR425899 pharmacokinetics.

        -  To assess safety and tolerability of SAR425899.
