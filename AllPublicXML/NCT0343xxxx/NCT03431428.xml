  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is evaluate the effect of two different surgical treatment on lower
      rectal cancer after almost clinical complete response(almost-cCR). All almost clinical
      complete response(almost-cCRs) were entered into two groups randomly. The estimated sample
      size of the minimal operation group was 221, and 221 in the Mile's group. Three years'
      progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS) were compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with low rectal cancer were treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and two cycles of
      XELOX at the interval. All almost-cCRs after neoadjuvant treatment were randomly divided into
      minimal operation group or Mile's group. All cCRs were treated with &quot;watch and wait&quot;.
      Patients after local recurrence were randomly divided into minimal operation group or Mile's
      group. If pathological result was pathological staging 3 after neoadjuvant therapy（ypT3） in
      minimal operation group or local postoperative recurrence occurred, patients need supplement
      of abdominoperineal resection (APR). With 3 years follow-up，the main research goals are 3
      years of progression-free survival(PFS) and overall survival(OS). Secondary endpoints are
      side effects of chemotherapy, assessment of quality of life, surgical complications, adverse
      prognostic factors and so on.
