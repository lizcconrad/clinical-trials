    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a single oral administration
      of a Lu AA21004 20 mg tablet in comparison with two of Lu AA21004 10 mg tablets in Japanese
      healthy adult participants.

      The drug being tested in this study is called Lu AA21004. Lu AA21004 is being tested in
      Japanese healthy adult participants. This study will look at the bioequivalence of a single
      oral administration of a Lu AA21004 20 mg tablet in comparison with two of Lu AA21004 10 mg
      tablets in Japanese healthy adult participants.

      The study will enroll 28 (14 for each sequence) healthy participants. In case bioequivalence
      cannot be demonstrated with the number of participants initially planned, an add-on
      participant study may be conducted (as a maximum 28 participants additionally). Participants
      will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment
      groups.

        -  Treatment Group A: Lu AA21004 20 mg (one 20 mg tablet) in Period 1 + Lu AA21004 20 mg
           (two 10 mg tablets) in Period 2

        -  Treatment Group B: Lu AA21004 20 mg (two 10 mg tablets) in Period 1 + Lu AA21004 20 mg
           (one 20 mg tablet) in Period 2

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 25 days. Participants will make two visits to the clinic and be
      hospitalized for ten days in total.
