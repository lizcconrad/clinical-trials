  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Latino children experience higher rates of obesity compared to non-Hispanic white children,
      especially in low-income communities. Optimal feeding strategies in early life, avoidance of
      screen time and longer sleep duration may lower the risk of obesity. Family financial
      hardship is also associated with short- and long-term health risks, including behavioral and
      mental health problems, and toxic stress which contributes to elevated risk of common chronic
      conditions over the life course. This proposal aims to pilot test two interventions to
      promote optimal health outcomes in Latino infants. Study participants will meet with a health
      educator after well child visits at 2-weeks, 2-, 4-, 6-, 9- and 12-months. Half of the
      parents will receive education on obesity prevention. The other half will receive financial
      education and case management using an established financial coaching approach. Parents will
      also receive text messages that reinforce educational content. The objective of this study is
      to determine the acceptability and feasibility of offering these interventions in the
      well-child setting. Study investigators also seek to determine the preliminary efficacy of
      these interventions on infant and parent health outcomes including dietary intake, screen
      time, sleep duration, health related quality of life and financial stress.

    <description>Assessed by the PROMIS-10. The Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Global Short Form 10 (PROMIS-10) is a ten-item scale measuring health related quality of life with subscales for physical and mental health. Raw overall total PROMIS-10 scale scores range from 10-50, with sub-scale T-scores that range from 16-67 for physical health and 21-68 for mental health. For all PROMIS-10 total raw and sub-scale scores, higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Financial Well-Being Scale. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Financial Well Being Questionnaire (Short Form, CFPB Financial Well Being Questionnaire SF) is a five item scale measuring individual financial well-being. The CFPB Financial Well Being Questionnaire has a range of 0-20 raw score, based on a 5-point Likert scale for each item, with one item (item 4) reverse coded and summed with responses for the remaining items to arrive at the raw score. The raw score is converted to a reference financial well-being score.Higher scores indicate greater financial well-being.</description>
