  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip arthroscopy is performed frequently and the postoperative course often involves moderate
      to severe pain. There remains no definitive perioperative pain regimen that has been proven
      to be effective and safe for this ambulatory procedure. Some institutions perform peripheral
      nerve blocks either preoperatively or postoperatively as a rescue block. All of these PNBs
      lead to quadriceps weakness which may impede earlier mobilization and physical therapy. While
      some case reports exist, there have not been any studies evaluating the QLB for hip
      arthroscopy patients. As previously mentioned, the technique is easy to perform,
      well-tolerated by patients, and avoids side effects such as hypotension, urinary retention,
      or the quadriceps weakness associated with lumbar plexus blockade.
