  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study is designed to provide high level of evidence supporting
      superiority of robot assisted (RA) versus open (O) radical cystectomy (RC). The primary
      endpoint is a 50% reduction of transfusion rate, several perioperative outcomes potentially
      linked to a reduced invasiveness are considered as secondary endpoints. Investigators
      hypothesis is that the reduced invasiveness of RARC might turn into a higher adherence to
      enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols (early bowel recovery, reduced need for
      painkillers and insertion of nasogastric tube) and consequently to shorter hospital stay and
      to faster return to daily activities. These data will be taken into account in a matched cost
      analysis between arms. Secondary aims include a between arm matched comparison of
      perioperative complications, oncologic outcomes (2-yr disease free survival is an accepted
      surrogate of long term oncologic effectiveness of RC) and functional outcomes (daytime and
      nighttime continence).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite encouraging data deriving from colorectal surgery, evidences in favor to ERAS
      protocols following RARC are poor. Moreover, according to a recent survey of surgeons with a
      specialist interest in RC, the adherence to ERAS protocols is &lt;20% [1].

      Retrospective and preliminary data from the robotic consortium have supported oncologic
      effectiveness of RARC; however in the only prospective randomized trial comparing RARC and
      ORC urinary diversions were performed extracorporeally, potentially impairing the benefits of
      minimally invasive surgery [2].

      Robot assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) has the aim of providing adequate cancer control
      while minimizing invasiveness of open radical cystectomy (ORC). The primary end-point of this
      trial is to demonstrate a reduction of perioperative transfusion rate in RARC arm by 50%
      compared to ORC arm.

      ERAS protocols may significantly contribute to shortening length of hospital stay, a key
      outcome in this clinical setting of patients receiving RC, being the mean length of hospital
      stay around 14 days in Italy. Investigators' hypothesis is that the reduced invasiveness of
      RARC might contribute to an increased adoption of ERAS protocols (reduced need for
      reinsertion of nasogastric tube, shorter time to first flatus, to mobilization, to regular
      diet and finally shorter duration of hospital stay).

      Assessment of oncologic outcomes of RARC, although not the primary endpoint of the present
      study, is certainly an outcome of interest. The expected duration of enrollment (18 mo)
      should provide 2-yr oncologic outcomes for about 66% of patients. Two-year recurrence free
      survival has been reported as a valid surrogate marker of long term oncologic survival after
      RC.

      Specific Aim 1:To demonstrate superiority of RARC versus ORC in terms of 50% reduction of
      perioperative transfusion rates.

      Specific Aim 2:

      To evaluate invasiveness of both surgical approaches by assessing the adherence to ERAS
      protocols in both and the incidence of perioperative and 30-d, 90d, 180d complications,
      readmission rates (30d, 90d). Cost analysis will assess the potential impact of shorter
      hospital stay on overall costs of robotic procedures.

      Specific Aim 3:

      To assess quality of life at 6-mo, 12-mo and 24-mo follow-up evaluation and to perform a
      matched comparison of oncologic and functional outcomes between two arms.

    <description>ORC and orthotopic ileal neobladder is performed as previously described. A separate package PLND is performed as in open as in robotic surgery. RARC is performed replicating open surgical procedure.
The orthotopic ileal neobladder model used is the 'vescica ileale padovana' as previously described. An ileal segment, approximately 42 cm long, is chosen at a minimum distance of 20cm far from ileo-cecal valve. A latero-lateral ileal anastomosis is performed with staplers to restore bowel continuity.
For ileal conduit, a 20cm ileal segment (approximately 20 cm long) at a minimum distance of 20 cm from ileo-cecal valve is isolated and transected with staplers. Bowel continuity is restored as previously described. The ileal loop on its distal edge is extracted through abdomen wall at the previously identified stoma point and fixed to abdomen fascia. The ureters are spatulated and a latero-lateral anastomosis according to Wallace 1 technique is performed.</description>
