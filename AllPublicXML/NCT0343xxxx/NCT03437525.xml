  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of contemporary diabetes care offers new hope for long and satisfying lives
      of those with the disease, but also provides increased challenges for integration across the
      many dimensions of care (varied medications in addition to insulin, specialty services, diet,
      physical activity, stress management, etc.) and across the many who contribute to care
      (specialists, primary care providers, nurses, dietitians and patient educators, family
      members, friends, worksites). The Shanghai Integration Model (SIM) has made great strides to
      integrating specialty/hospital care with primary/community care. The addition of peer support
      can enhance patient engagement within that integrated care. Peer support can also integrate
      care with the daily behaviors and patterns that optimal diabetes management requires and with
      the family members and others in individuals' daily lives who can support diabetes
      management.

      The &quot;Insulin Peer Support&quot; project is a sub-project of &quot;Peer Support in Diabetes Care&quot;, with
      special focus on appropriate insulin use in the community, to help overcome barriers in
      insulin treatment and improve treatment compliance. This project will develop a peer support
      model for diabetes management in Chinese patients undergoing insulin treatment and evaluate
      its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial of 10 CHCs in Shanghai.

      The project is a collaboration among the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong
      University, the Shanghai Diabetes Institute,the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and
      Family Planning, the Shanghai Centers for Disease Control, and, at the University of North
      Carolina-Chapel Hill, Peers for Progress, widely recognized for its leadership in promoting
      peer support in health care and prevention.

    <measure>Change from Baseline General Quality of Life at 6 and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>6-item EQ-5D, a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. The respondents are asked to choose one of the statements which best describes their health status on the surveyed day. Rated level can be coded as a number 1, 2, or 3, which indicates having no problems for 1, having some problems for 2, and having extreme problems for 3. As a result, a person's health status can be defined by a 5-digit number, ranging from 11111 (having no problems in all dimensions) to 33333 (having extreme problems in all dimensions). Item 6 is the visual analogue scale, in which respondents are asked to mark their health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100, where 0 corresponds to &quot;the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and 100 corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>4-item Diabetes Distress Scale, an abbreviated version of the 17-item Diabetes Distress Scale. The respondents are asked to respond to which degree each of the items has bothered them in the past month on a 6-point scale (1-6), where 1 is not a brother and 6 is very bothersome. Scores are summed and divided by 4 to calculate the mean. Mean scores of 3 or higher (moderate distress) are considered worthy of clinical attention.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Depression at 6 and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the PHQ-9 minus the last question on suicidal thoughts. The PHQ is a standard instrument used in primary care settings to screen for the presence and severity of depression. The respondents are asked how often they have been bothered by each of the 8 items in the past 2 weeks on a 4 point scale (0-3), where 0 is &quot;not all&quot; and 3 is &quot;nearly every day&quot;. The scores for each item are summed to produce a total score between 0 and 24 points. A total score of 0 to 4 represents no significant depressive symptoms. A total score of 5 to 9 represents mild depressive symptoms; 10 to 14, moderate; 15 to 19, moderately severe; and 20 to 24, severe.</description>

    <measure>Change in Healthcare Utilization at 6 and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Novel 6-item questionnaire that assesses patterns of healthcare and program utilization. Item 1 asks respondents the last time they saw a community health center doctor or nurse for their diabetes. Possible responses are &quot;Within the last 2 weeks&quot;, &quot;Within the last month&quot;, &quot;Within the last 2 months&quot;, &quot;Between 2-4 months ago&quot;, and &quot;More than 4 months ago&quot;. Items 2-6 ask respondents to recall how many times they accessed healthcare services (peer support, primary care, outpatient hospital care, overnight hospital stays) in the past 3 months. Possible responses are &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1-2&quot;, &quot;3-5&quot;, and &quot;5+&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline Insulin Attitudes at 6 and 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>13-item Chinese Attitudes to Starting Insulin Questionnaire (Ch-ASIQ). Four subscales consisting of 'Self-image and stigmatization' (3 items); 'Factors promoting self-efficacy (5 items); 'Fear of pain or needles' (3 items); and 'Time and family support' (2 items). Responses are scored using a 4-point Likert scale (Totally disagree = 1, Totally Agree = 4). Individual scale scores are calculated by summing the item responses. For the subscales 'Factors promoting self-efficacy' and 'Time and family support', higher scores indicate more positive attitudes towards the use of insulin. For the subscales 'Self-image and stigmatization' and 'Fear of pain or needles' a higher score indicates a more negative attitude towards insulin initiation. The weighted sum of all four scale scores, converting two positively coded scales to negatively coded scales, calculates the overall score with higher scores indicating more negative attitude to starting insulin.</description>

    <description>The intervention involves monthly education/support groups co-led by a CHC doctor / nurse and peer coaches. These meetings will begin with a general discussion about participants' previous month, what they had been doing, any special events etc. Meetings will devote time to identifying goals and specific plans for reaching them, rehearsal and/or discussion of specific behaviors to execute plans and ways in which the group members can be helpful to each other. This will be organized around a Diabetes Action Plan. Peer coaches will provide education and support for insulin therapy to help reduce barriers around insulin use. Peer coaches will also organize activities to promote healthy lifestyles, such as walking groups, to promote informal contacts among peer supporters and participants.</description>
