  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone samples from infected diabetic feet will be collected and tests will be performed for
      the diagnosis of causative bacteria. Samples will be processed by PCR multiplex tests and
      usual cultures for identification of causative bacteria and sensitivity to antibiotics.
      Results obtained by the two methods will be compared in terms of quickness and similarity of
      germ identification. Usual care strategy will not be modified since results of PCR multiplex
      tests will not be transmitted to the physicians before the results of usual cultures.

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the quickness of identification of bacteria causing bone
      infection in the feet of patients with diabetes from bone samples obtained by biopsies
      performed in usaual care practice.

      Bone biopsies will be performed in patients diagnosed for osteomyelitis from clinical,
      biological and MRI signs. Bone samples will be collected in Ultra-TurraxÂ® tubes in the
      operating theater before being transferred to the department of bacteriology. Time of
      registration at the bacteriology lab will be considered as Time 0 (T0).

      Samples will be processed simultaneously using the usual culture method and by PCR Multiplex
      tests.

      The time of identification of causative bacteria for bone infection (time 1, T1) and the time
      of identification of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics (time 2, T2) by the two different
      methods will be recorded.

      Identified germs and their sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics according to the two methods
      will be compared.

      If the results are similar, the time that could be gained for the prescription of specific
      antibiotics from PCR multiplex tests' results will be computed in comparison to the
      prescription performed from the results of usual cultures.
