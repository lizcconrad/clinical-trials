  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke and other causes of central nervous system damage can result in debilitating loss of
      motor control that is often more pronounced in one limb than the other. Using or attempting
      to use the affected limb during activities of daily living, despite considerable difficulty,
      stimulates neuroplasticity and motor function recovery. The investigators are conducting a
      clinical study to test the efficacy of wrist-worn sensors that encourage affected limb use
      during activities of daily living.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke at least 3 months prior to study enrollment

          -  Mild-to-moderate upper-limb motor impairments (as measured by a score between 21 and
             45 on the arm section of the Fugl-Meyer scale).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cognitive impairments that would significantly interfere with their ability to follow
             instructions (as measured by a score lower than 23 on the Mini Mental State
             Examination scale)

          -  Severe attention deficits or hemispatial neglect (as measured by the Conjunction
             Search test and the Line Bisection test);

          -  Severe range-of-motion limitations (as measured via physical examination) or severe
             spasticity (as measured using the Modified Ashworth scale) that would prevent safe
             performance of home-based exercises;

          -  Proprioceptive deficits that impair their ability to process feedback (as measured
             using the Monofilament test and the Developmental Test of Visual Perception in its
             version for adults).
