  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip surgery in children is painful and the optimal modality for managing post-operative pain
      has not been established. This prospective randomized controlled trail compares lumbar plexus
      catheter (LPC), lumbar epidural catheter (LEC) and continuous patient-controlled analgesia
      with intravenous morphine (PCA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1 in 1,000 children born in the US have hip dislocation and 10 in 1,000 have
      hip subluxation requiring surgical intervention. Pain after major hip surgery in children is
      severe, yet there is no agreement on the most effective method for pain control.
      Post-operative pain modalities including lumbar epidural catheters (LEC), lumbar plexus
      catheters (LPC) and intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) have been described.
      IV-PCA has historically been the standard of care in spite of its numerous associated side
      effects. Regional anesthesia modalities have gained popularity because of superior pain
      control with lower opioid requirements.

      In this study, the investigators describe the first prospective randomized controlled trial
      comparing lumbar plexus catheter to alternatives for post-operative pain management in
      children after major hip surgery. The investigators hypothesized that LPC would be as safe
      and efficacious as LEC and IV-PCA with the added advantage of a decreased length of stay. The
      investigators primary aim was to compare hospital length of stay. Secondary aim was to
      compare pain scores, opioid consumption and opioid-related side effects.

    <description>The FLACC (Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) pain intensity rating scale was used to assess post operative pain by the patient's nurse in either the PACU or the floor. The FLACC is a validated behavior pain assessment scale for use in non-verbal patients unable to provide reports of pain. Each of the 5 assessments are given a score from 0-2 for a total pain scale range from 0 to 10.</description>

    <description>The Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) was used to assess post operative pain by the patient's nurse in either the PACU or the floor. The Faces Pain Scale - Revised is a validated visual scale of 6 faces that represent different levels of pain (0,2,4,6,8,10). Patients were asked to point to the face that shows how much they hurt for a pain scale range from 0 to 10.</description>

    <description>Children undergoing pediatric hip surgery will have a lumbar plexus catheter placed (with bolus and continuous infusion of ropivacaine) intraoperatively for perioperative pain control.
An intraoperative pain protocol will dictate if the patient will receive IV fentanyl or morphine. Post operative side effects will be controlled with the administration of ondansetron for nausea and vomiting, diphenhydramine for itching, and lorazepam for muscle spasms. Post operative pain control will be managed with PRN morphine and oxycodone as well as scheduled acetaminophen.</description>
