  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many infertility and subfertility issues are treated nowadays with intrauterine
      inseminations. This is a minimally invasive technique that consists in placing sperm into a
      woman's uterus. Inseminations have only a fair success rate despite advances in technology (
      7 % per cycle). The goal of this study is to find an easy intervention that could help with
      success rate. Some studies are showing that the use of Pozzi tenaculum forceps might increase
      rates of pregnancy following intrauterine inseminations. In order to study the impact of this
      intervention, we are conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing the rate of term live
      births after IUI between patients who had their treatment done with a pozzi tenaculum forceps
      and those who had their treatment done without a tenaculum forceps.
