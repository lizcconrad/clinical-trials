  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is aimed to investigate whether oral L-arginine supplementation reduces the
      adverse cardiovascular effects of exposure to traffic-related air pollution among a group of
      non-smoking adults with elevated blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
      L-arginine (L-Arg, a precursor of nitric oxide in human body) supplement to counteract the
      acute cardiovascular effects of exposure to traffic-related air pollution among a group of
      non-smoking adults with elevated blood pressure. A large number of epidemiologic studies have
      provided compelling evidence that exposure to traffic-related air pollution contributes to
      the increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the mechanism of action includes
      vasoconstriction and cardiac ischemia. It is well known that nutritional factors are very
      important determinants of cardiovascular health. However, few studies have explored the joint
      effects of air pollution and nutritional factors on cardiovascular health. Existing data from
      many laboratory studies and small clinical trials suggest that L-Arg has beneficial effects
      on the cardiovascular system by lowering blood pressure and protecting myocardiocytes against
      external stimuli. The study will explore whether L-Arg supplement improves blood pressure
      levels and prevents any potential cardiac ischemia and myocardial injury upon acute exposure
      to traffic-related air pollution among high-risk individuals.

      Dietary intakes, lifestyle habits, use of medication/dietary supplements, blood pressure,
      resting electrocardiogram and plasma parameters will be assessed for potential eligible
      participants at screening visits. After a 5-day L-Arg-free run-in period, 200 eligible
      participants will be assigned to either the interventional group or control group using a
      computerized method with a randomized block design. They will receive over 2 weeks daily
      doses of either L-Arg (9g each day in 3 times) or placebo and undergo a 2-h exposure scenario
      (0900-1100 hours) of walking along a traffic road on the 14th day. Participants will be
      counseled to maintain an isocaloric diet and to abstain from other L-Arg rich foods during
      the study. Concentrations of major traffic-related air pollutants, including particulate
      matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) and black carbon, will be measured
      during the 2-h exposure scenario, and primary and secondary outcome measures including blood
      pressure, ST-segment depression and plasma parameters will be assessed repeatedly at various
      time points (depending on the parameters) around the 2-h exposure scenario.
