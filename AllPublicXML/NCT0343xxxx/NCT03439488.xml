    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JNJ-440 in healthy
      and Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) participants after single and multiple doses; and to evaluate
      the pharmacokinetic (PK) of JNJ-440 in healthy participants and in CHB participants following
      single and multiple dose regimens, administered alone (healthy participants and CHB
      participants).
