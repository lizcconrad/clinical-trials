      INTRODUCTION: Mental practice (MP) and action observation (AO) are characterized as cognitive
      strategies that contribute to motor planning and learning in diverse populations. Individuals
      with Parkinson's Disease (PD) are recent targets, since, with disease progression, they need
      external strategies to aid in motor organization. However, there is still no evidence of the
      efficacy of MP and AO in the gait of PD. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of physical
      practice preceded by MP and AO on gait performance in individuals with Idiopathic PD (IPD).
      METHODS: A controlled, randomized, single-blind clinical trial with 66 individuals with IPD,
      aged between 50 and 75 years, without cognitive deficit and in the moderate phase of the
      disease will be performed. For the inclusion and characterization of the sample, the
      following instruments / equipment will be used: (1) Identification form (sociodemographic,
      clinical and anthropometric aspects); (2) Mini Mental State Examination and Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (cognitive level); (3) Hoehn and Yahr Scale (level of physical
      disability); (4) Revised Movement Imagery Questionnaire (sharpness of the mental image); (5)
      Qualisys Motion Capture SystemsÂ® (gait kinematics); (6) Emotiv Epoc +
      (electroencephalographic activity); (7) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale - UPDRS
      (motor function and activities of daily living); (8) Timed Up and Go Test - TUG Test
      (mobility); and (9) Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - PDQ-39 (quality of life).Participants
      included will be randomly assigned to two groups: experimental (n = 33), who will participate
      in MP + AO and physical gait practice; and control group (n = 33), who will participate only
      in the physical practice of gait. Both groups will be submitted to 12 training sessions (3x /
      week, for 4 weeks) and will be reevaluated 10 minutes, 7 days and 30 days after the last
      training session with respect to items (4), (5), (6) and (8) of the evaluation. Primary
      outcomes will be velocity, stride length and range of motion of the hip and the secondary
      ones will be sharpness of the mental image, electroencephalographic activity and performance
      in the TUG Test. The normality in the data distribution will be verified through the
      Shapiro-Wilk test. The &quot;t&quot; test and the Mann-Whitney test will be used to verify the
      homogeneity of the groups in the baseline. A repeated measures ANOVA will verify the
      interaction between the groups at the moments observed.

    <description>Action observation: is defined as the observation of the motor action, in this study, through a video.
Mental Practice: is defined as motor imagery training with the aim of improving the engine performance. Is the imagination of a motor action without its physical implementation.
Physical Practice: is the execution of the motor action.</description>

    <description>Subjects will see a video of the typical gait and will attempt to analyze the sequence of the gait cycle.
They will imagine themselves walking in the first-person perspective (kinesthetic) using the gait of the non-pathological pattern during 2 minutes.
From the 1st to 4th session, the subjects will perform gait with corrections identified in previously in the video for 2 minutes.
From 5th to 8th session: the subjects will do the protocol already described, however, the imagined gait will be in an environment with obstacles, also for 2 minutes. They will continue with the physical practice of the gait with obstacles.
From 9th to final training session: both mental and physical practice of the dual task gait.</description>

    <description>Subjects will see a video about PD which does not mention physiotherapy treatments related to gait and they will explain their understanding about the theme.
Then, the patients will make the physical gait protocol. Patients will be invited to perform the gait, in flat and firm ground with a length of 60 meters. The execution will be carried out for 10 minutes.
From the 5th to 8th session, the subjects will do the physical practice of the gait with obstacles (which will be: going through 2 cones zigzag, going up and down 1 step, going through a narrow door, going up and down 1 ramp, going over 1 box of shoes, climbing a ramp, going down 1 step) for 2 minutes.
From the 9th to the final training session, the subjects will do physical practice of the dual task gait.</description>
