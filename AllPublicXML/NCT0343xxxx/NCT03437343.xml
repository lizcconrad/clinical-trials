      This study used 3D reconstructions from the EOS biplanar radiographic imaging system to
      perform leg length measurements before and after THA (Total hip arthroplasty) on all included
      THA patients from 2015 to evaluate surgeon performance in restoring lower limb length after
      THA and the relationships between the quality of life, estimated by the HOOS score (Hip
      disability and osteoarthritis outcome score), and the anatomy of the new hip in standing
      position.

      The study was conducted in patients who underwent a total hip arthroplasty in Lariboisiere
      Hospital, Paris, France, during the year 2015.

      This retrospective study used 3D reconstructions from the EOS biplanar radiographic imaging
      system (EOS imaging, Paris, France) to perform leg length measurements before and after THA
      on all included THA patients from 2015 to evaluate surgeon performance in restoring lower
      limb length after THA. Included patients either had hip osteoarthritis or femoral head
      osteonecrosis. Patients were excluded if they were undergoing revision surgery, or had a
      contralateral THA or total knee.

      The performance of the surgeons was judged using the Cumulative Sum control chart (CUSUM)
      method.

      Our objective was to study surgeon performance, measured by their ability to restore the
      initial preoperative length of the operated leg or to equalize the length of the two legs,
      and evaluate the relationships between the quality of life, estimated by the HOOS score, and
      the anatomy of the new hip in standing position using the EOS imaging system.

    <description>The outcome score consists of 40 items assessing 5 subscales. Pain (P) includes 10 items with a total score of 40 points, Symptoms (S) includes 5 items with a total score of 20, Activity limitations daily living (ADL) includes 17 items with a total score of 68 and finally Function in sport and recreation (SP) and hip related quality of life both include 4 items with a total score of 16 each.
To answer the questions, standardized answer options are given with scores from 0 to 4 (no, mild, moderate, severe and extreme).
To interpret the score, the outcome measure is transformed in a worst to best scale from 0 to 100, with 100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms.
To calculate the total HOOS score the subscales need to be summed up, using following formula for all dimension.
100 - [(patient's score of the subscale x 100)/(total score of the subscale)]</description>
