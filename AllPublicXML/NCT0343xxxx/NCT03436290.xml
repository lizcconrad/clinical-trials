  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frequently people diagnosed with cancer experience physical and emotional symptoms during the
      course of their disease. These symptoms can be very distressing to both the patient and the
      family members. The study doctor wants to know if the introduction of a team of clinicians
      that specialize in the lessening of many of these distressing symptoms may improve your
      overall care. This team of clinicians is called the palliative care team and they focus on
      ways to improve your pain and other symptom management (i.e. shortness of breath, fatigue,
      anxiety, etc.) and to assist you and your family in coping with the emotional, social, and
      spiritual issues associated with your diagnosis. The team consists of physicians, advanced
      practice nurses, case managers, and nurses who have been specially trained in the care of
      patients facing serious illness.

      This research study is being done because although many people with cancer receive palliative
      care late in the course of their illness, the study team thinks palliative care may be more
      useful when it is started earlier and in this case before surgery. The main purpose of this
      study is to compare two types of care -usual surgery and cancer care and usual surgery and
      cancer care with comprehensive palliative care services to see which is better for improving
      the experience of patients and families with cancer.

      The Surgery for Cancer with Option of Palliative Care Expert (SCOPE) Trial is an
      investigation that will study the effect of a palliative care implementation during the
      preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative phase for adults undergoing cancer surgery for
      selected gastrointestinal and genitourinary malignancies. SCOPE will be a single-blind,
      single-institution randomized controlled trial of 236 patients. Intervention arm patients
      will receive a preoperative outpatient specialty palliative care consultation from a
      palliative care provider (physician or nurse practitioner) in addition to inpatient and
      outpatient palliative care follow-up postoperatively. Control arm patients will receive usual
      care with palliative care available at the discretion of the primary treatment team
      (currently these patients rarely get palliative care and usually only in the last weeks of
      life). The central hypothesis of the SCOPE Trial is that preoperative, perioperative, and
      postoperative specialty palliative care will improve patient functioning and quality of life
      in patients undergoing resection of selected GI and GU malignancies.

    <measure>Functional status as measured by the FACT-G TOI</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-G has 27 questions using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state, leading to some items being reverse-scored. Questions measure the respondents' health state over the last 7 days in four subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 questions), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 questions), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 questions), and Functional Well-being (FWB, 7 questions). The Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is the sum of the Physical Well-Being and Functional Well-Being subscales. The TOI is an efficient summary index of physical/functional outcomes and is a common endpoint used in clinical trials.</description>
