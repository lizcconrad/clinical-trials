      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the safety of SAR341402 and NovoLog® when used in external insulin pumps in terms
      of the number of patients with infusion set occlusions.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety of SAR341402 and NovoLog® when used in external pumps in terms of
           unexplained hyperglycemia.

        -  To assess the safety of SAR341402 and NovoLog® when used in external pumps in terms of:

             -  Intervals for infusion set changes.

             -  Number of patients with insulin pump for &quot;non-delivery&quot; alarm.

             -  Patient observation of infusion set occlusion.

             -  Adverse events and serious adverse events.

             -  Number of patients with hypoglycemic events (according to ADA Workgroup on
                hypoglycemia).

    <description>Number of patients with unexplained hyperglycemia. Unexplained hyperglycemia is defined as plasma glucose equal or above 300 mg/dL (16.7 mmol/L) whether or not corrected by a bolus through the insulin pump with no apparent material defects, medical, dietary, insulin dosing or pump failure.

             glucose checks per day during screening.

          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range (or defined screening threshold for the
             Investigator site), unless the Investigator considers an abnormality to be clinically
             irrelevant for T1DM patients.

          -  Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥8.5% at screening.

             (Visit 1).

          -  Use of oral glucose-lowering agents or any injectable glucose-lowering agents other
             than insulin during the 3 months before screening visit.

             tests, or vital signs at the time of screening that in the judgment of the
             investigator or any sub investigator would preclude safe completion of the study.

          -  Known history of illegal drug or alcohol abuse within 6 months prior to the time of
             screening.

          -  Use of investigational drug(s) within 3 months or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer,
             prior to the screening visit.

          -  Patients who had previously received SAR341402 in any other clinical trial.

          -  Any contraindication to the use of NovoLog® as defined in the national product labels;
             history of hypersensitivity to NovoLog® or to any of the excipients.

          -  Pregnancy and lactation.

          -  If female, pregnancy (defined as positive β-HCG in blood or in urine), breast-feeding.
