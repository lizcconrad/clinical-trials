  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National data indicate over 650,000 children and adolescents are exposed to physical, sexual,
      or emotional abuse or physical or emotional neglect each year. Moreover, youth with a history
      of childhood maltreatment (CM) are at least twice as likely to develop depression and are at
      substantial risk for nonresponse to current best practice depression interventions (i.e.,
      cognitive behavioral therapy and antidepressants) compared to non-maltreated peers. Research
      suggests that CM increases risk for depression through disruptions in the positive valence
      system, such as reward processing, and Behavioral Activation (BA) may be an alternative
      depression intervention that targets these deficits. This study takes an innovative approach
      integrating neural, behavioral, and novel mobile technologies to measure longitudinal change
      in reward processing as a mechanism of BA intervention response among depressed adolescents
      with a history of CM. Specifically, depressed adolescents with a history of CM will complete
      pre- and post- BA intervention fMRI and behavioral measures of reward processing along with
      daily passive mobile monitoring of physical (steps) and social (amount of texts, calls,
      social media usage) activity to determine 1) how BA targets neural and behavioral reward
      processing and real-world behavioral engagement (Specific Aim 1), and 2) whether change in
      neural and behavioral reward processing predicts intervention response and maintenance
      (Specific Aim 2).

    <time_frame>Symptoms will be measured weekly throughout the study (Weeks 1-12) and at a 3-month follow-up (Week 24). Diagnoses will be measure pre (Week 0), post treatment (Week 12), and at a 3-month follow-up (Week 24).</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 12, and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in feelings of loss of pleasure and interest (i.e., Anhedonia) will be measured via self-report.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Neural Reward Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>MRI scans will occur at Weeks 0 (pre-treatment) and Weeks 12 (post-treatment) of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in reward sensitivity will be measured by the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task completed while undergoing structural and functional MRI. The MID also provides behavioral indicators of reward sensitivity, including reaction time and accuracy to high versus low reward/neutral/loss values.</description>

    <measure>Neural Response to Social Feedback</measure>
    <time_frame>MRI scans will occur at Weeks 0 (pre-treatment) and Weeks 12 (post-treatment) of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>The participants will complete a task in the MRI that measures social anhedonia. Participants will rate photos of peers on level of likeability and will receive either positive (i.e., they found the participant as likeable) or neutral (i.e., the peer has not rated the participant). Structural and functional MRI changes will be examined related to differences in response to positive social feedback.</description>

    <description>The Adolescent Behavioral Activation Program (ABAP) will be used as the BA protocol. ABAP was developed and validated by McCauley, Dimidjian et al. to adapt BA to adolescents. ABAP is a 12-week protocol that utilizes an idiographic approach to foster rewarding experiences, effective problem solving, and goal attainment, and decrease avoidance, barriers to activation, and depressive rumination that may be contributing to depression severity and maintenance.</description>
