      Primary objective:

      *To determine whether treatment with naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray reduces gambling urge
      symptoms in patients with gambling disorder

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To determine the effects of naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray on gambling severity,
           frequency and time, internet use, self-efficacy, quality of life, alcohol consumption,
           depression

        -  To evaluate the safety of naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray in the treatment of
           gambling disorder

    <textblock>
      This is a 12 week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to
      determine the efficacy of naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray in gambling disorder.
      Anticipated number of participants are 126.

      Treatment Group A: Naloxone hydrochloride 40mg/ml nasal spray Naloxone hydrochloride will be
      dosed at 4mg / dose (one spray of 0.1ml of the 40mg/ml formulation into one nostril) up to
      four times daily as needed in response to gambling urges with at least 2 hours between each
      dose (within 24 hours from 6am each day) for 12 weeks.

      Treatment Group B: Placebo nasal spray One spray of 0.1ml of the placebo formulation in one
      nostril up to four times daily as needed in response to gambling urges with at least 2 hours
      between each dose (within 24 hours from 6am each day) for 12 weeks.

      Safety parameters:

      Study Subjects will be asked to report any changes in health via the daily questionnaire.
      This will be reviewed weekly and at each study Visit (including phone calls) and any adverse
      events will be documented in the eCRF. Changes in vital signs and outcome of routine blood
      analyses will be evaluated.

      Adverse events (AEs) will be classified using a coding thesaurus (MedDRA).

      Primary endpoint: Gambling symptoms (G-SAS) from Baseline to week 12. Gambling symptoms
      (G-SAS) from Baseline to week 12.

    <description>The G-SAS is a 12-item self-rated scale designed to assess gambling symptom severity and change during treatment. The G-SAS is not a diagnostic or screening instrument. Each 12-item scale has a score ranging from 0 - 4 (adjective anchors for 0 and 4 vary for each item). All items ask for an average symptom based on the past 7 days. Items 1 - 4 can be used to assess changes in craving symptoms. Total score ranges from 0 - 48: extreme = 41 - 48, severe = 31 - 40, moderate = 21 - 30, mild = 8 - 20.</description>
