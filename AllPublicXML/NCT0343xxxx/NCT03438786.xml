  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesh repair of inguinal hernia is the most common operation performed on general surgical
      patients. Approximately 20 million groin hernioplasties are performed each year worldwide.
      Countless studies have been reported in the medical literature in attempts to improve the
      overall outcomes following hernia operations and, due to this fact, the procedure has evolved
      immensely, especially over the last few decades. Recurrence of inguinal hernia was initially
      a significant problem. Lichtenstein repair (LR), recurrence rate has consistently been
      reported as low as 1-4%[2], a drop from up to 10%. But increased incidence of chronic groin
      pain following LR.

      Transinguinal preperitoneal (TIPP) inguinal hernia repair with soft mesh has been reported as
      a safe anterior approach with a preperitoneal mesh position .

      Theoretically, TIPP repair may be associated with lesser chronic postoperative pain than
      Lichtenstein's technique due to the placement of mesh in the preperitoneal space to avoid
      direct regional nerves dissection and their exposure to bio-reactive synthetic mesh. The
      placement of mesh in this plane without using any suture for fixation and lack of mesh
      exposure to regional nerves was assumed to result in the reduced risk of developing chronic
      groin pain. So aim of our study to prove less hospital stay and complication and cost
      effectiveness for preperitoneal meshplasty

      This study is a prospective randomized study including all Patients with unilateral non
      complicated inguinal hernia who will undergo hernioplasty in surgery department at AUH during
      the period from 3- 2018 to 6- 2020

      Methodology:

      Patients will be classified into two groups according to the surgical procedure performed as
      follows:

        -  Group A: Patients undergoing TIPP hernioplasty

        -  Group B: Patients undergoing lichtnestein's technique hernioplasty

      Sample size:15 patients for each group.

      D) Exclusion criteria:

        1. Patients who were unfit for operation.

        2. Patients with bilateral or recurrent inguinal hernia

        3. Patients aged below 18 years,

        4. Patients undergoing emergency hernia repairs

    <description>patients were catheterised pre-operatively, to prevent any injury to the bladder and aid in preperitoneal dissection. The catheter was removed after 48 hours post-operatively.
Incision of TIPP is same as that of Lichtenstein technique . After dissection of the sac, the transversalis is fascia is incised to enter the preperitoneal space. The preperitoneal space is developed by dissection with index finger. The space extends from rectus muscle medially, arcuate line cranially, a little beyond the anterior superior iliac spine over the psoas muscle laterally and the lilipubic tract caudally. A 15 cm x 15 cm polypropylene mesh, cut into dimension 15 cm x 12 cm, the inferior medial angle of the mesh is trimmed in a semicircular fashion to prevent trauma to the bladder neck. The mesh is placed in the preperitoneal space and anchored to the Cooper's ligament with a single 2-0 interrupted prolene suture</description>
