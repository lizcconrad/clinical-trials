  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective cohort single-center observational study is to determine the
      impact of hyperoxemia on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurrence.

        -  SpO2 will be continuously recorded in order to determine the percentage of time spent
           with hyperoxemia.

        -  Patients with VAP will be prospectively identified.

        -  Patient characteristics and risk factors for VAP will be prospectively collected.

        -  Oxidant stress will be prospectively investigated in study patients: glutathion
           peroxidase (GPX), plasmatic superoxyde dismutase (SOD), total plasmatic antioxidant
           status (SAT) and urinary 8-isoprostanes will be performed at ICU admission, once a week,
           and at VAP occurrence.

      Patients with VAP will be compared with those with no VAP
