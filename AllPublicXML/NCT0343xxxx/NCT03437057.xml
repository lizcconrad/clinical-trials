      Background/Rationale for the study:

      Lithiasis pathology is increasingly common because of the change in our lifestyle and our
      food. Thus, we hold a prevalence for urinary lithiasis 10% in France currently including 13%
      of the male population and 6% of the female population.

      The formation of urinary lithiasis is the result of a complex mechanism involving factors
      anatomical and infectious metabolics. They are classified according to their size, topography
      and composition.

      The treatment of urinary lithiasis has changed dramatically in recent years. The
      recommendations of the French Urology Association (AFU) for the management of kidney stones
      and ureteral of the adult of 2004 give a certain place to the treatment by lithotripsy (ECL).

      The ELC is indicated for the first purpose for lithiasis ureteral or renal lithiasis of less
      than 20 mm, whether or not associated with the setting up of a JJ probe. For kidney stones of
      more than 20 mm or complex or Coralliformes, the lithotripsy can be associated with treatment
      with percutaneous nephrolithotomy. In addition, the ECL is indicated in case of residual
      cholelithiasis 3 months after a first treatment whatsoever.

      It is found, as the main complication of the LEC, a risk of the appearance of Hematomas under
      capsular, peri-renal and intra-parenchymatous. Its prevalence is estimated to be between 6.2%
      and 13% according to studies.

      KARDEGIC 75, antiplatelet (PAA) is the lowest dosage of aspirin in the adult. The AMM of
      KARDEGIC recognises its indication in secondary prevention after a first myocardial or
      cerebral ischemic attack related to atherosclerosis. It entrains a reduction mortality and
      morbidity of cardiovascular causes.

      Kardegic is currently being stopped 5 to 7 days before the LEC. The interest of maintaining
      the KARDEGIC 75 is:

        -  A simplification of the management of patients under KARDEGIC 75 (No modification of
           Treatment to be implemented)

        -  Decreased cardiovascular risk (treatment maintained)

      Main objective:

      Evaluation of the proportion of renal hematoma during the production of Lithotripsy for renal
      lithiasis, on a 15-day scan, in patients under KARDEGIC 75mg not stopped

      Secondary objectives:

      Evaluation of the efficacy of treatment with lithotripsy (Stone free, fragments Minimal
      residuals) Evaluation of the proportion of hematuria macroscopic post lithotripsy in Patients
      under KARDEGIC 75 not stopped. Evaluate the rate of post-LEC complications requiring
      treatment, Analgesic, obstructive pyelonephritis.

      Evaluate post-LEC pain due to hematoma or lithiasis migration Evaluation of the evolution of
      renal function post session of Lithotripsy in the patients under KARDEGIC 75 not stopped.

      Type of Study: Interventional study, prospective, mono centric, single-arm

      Before the ECL:

      Patients will be recruited during the urology consultation prior to the lithotripsy for
      calculations Kidneys (JJ probe in place or not) using an uninjected abdominal-pelvic or
      ultrasound scanner Renal coupled to a AUSP (urinary tree without preparation). ECL is an
      Unbody method that allows the calculation to be fragmented using shock waves Generated by a
      lithotripter. It will be given to them, after explanation of this method by the doctor during
      the Consultation, a AFU information sheet on the LEC explaining its steps, possible
      complications, its follow-up.

      After checking the inclusion and non-inclusion criteria, patients will be programmed to
      lithotripsy extra body without prior stop of KARDEGIC 75.

      At the LEC session:

      Evaluation of blood pressure before the session and at the end. Medical history and treatment
      will be notified in the patient file Verification of blood balance (coagulation, renal
      function) and urinary (BU and ECBU) Evaluation of pain by analog visual scale (AVS) before
      and during the session. Notification of possible symptoms (adverse reactions = AR) in the
      medical file. Prescription of analgesics as well as blood balance and revaluation scanner at
      D15 Taking a post-ECL appointment with the reference urologist at D23 (+-2days)

      After the ECL session: 3-week post-ECL Consultation:

      Pain Assessment (AVS) Evaluation of the effectiveness of the ECL (stone clearance)

      Reading of the scanner performed at D15 in search of a hematoma &quot;(the scanner will also be
      replayed from systematically by the prescriber or a urologist of the service looking for a
      hematoma and the level of efficacy of the ECL + control of the blood balance in search of a
      inflammatory/infectious/anemia/renal function Chronology of the essay:

      Duration of study estimated at: 3 years Start date of study (first patient included): 09/2017
      End Date (end of follow-up of the last patient of the study): 09/2020 Total duration of
      participation in the study for the patient: 5 to 6 weeks The end-of-study date shall be
      transmitted to the competent authority and the MPC within 90 days.

      If the study is to stop prematurely, the information will be transmitted within a period of
      15 days The competent authority and the MPC. Main judgement criterion: Proportion of patients
      with renal hematoma when performing of lithotripsy for renal lithiasis, on a 15-day scanner.

      Number of topics: 300 based on a 4-step sequential plan of Fleming type

      Inclusion criteria:

      Patients over 18 years of age benefiting from the social security scheme Patients with at
      least one renal lithiasis requiring treatment with lithotripsy

      Non-inclusion criteria:

      KARDEGIC 75mg can not be stopped (recent angioplasty...) Coagulation disorder known or
      discovered on the pre-therapeutic balance sheet Associated anticoagulant therapy. Presence of
      another contraindications to the ECL.

      Conduct of the study:

      Study carried out in current practice at the CHU of Clermont Ferrand in the Department of
      Urology.

      The patient will be seen in consultation by the urologist who shall prescribe the Lithotripsy
      sessions, inform the of the session and will provide him with a AFU information sheet
      concerning the stages of the session, and prescribe a blood test to be presented to the
      lithotriptor on the day of the examination. Not additional accommodation to plan. The patient
      will return 3 weeks after the ECL session for his evaluation with the urologist. He will have
      previously completed a blood check and a 15-day scan of the lithotripsy session (instead of
      about 3 weeks usually).

      Benefits and risks of this study:

      Simplify patient management under KARDEGIC 75. Decrease in cardiovascular risk by maintaining
      the KARDEGIC 75. Increase of the risk of post-ECL hematoma
