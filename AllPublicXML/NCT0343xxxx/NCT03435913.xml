  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: The aim of this project is to evaluate how intra-abdominal pressure paired coupled
      with different ventilatory positive end-expiratory pressure levels affects the transpulmonary
      driving pressure during pneumoperiteneum insufflation for laparoscopic surgery.

      Methodology: Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery will be included. The study will
      investigate the relationship between intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and transpulmonary
      driving pressure (TpDp) and the effect of titration of PEEP on their relationship.

      At four different levels of intra-abdominal pressure, the respiratory driving pressure (RDp)
      and TpDp in each subject will be measured in each subject. The same subject will undergo two
      different ventilation strategies. Demographic data (height, weight, body mass index and sex),
      ASA physical status (surgical risk classification of the American Society of Anesthesiology),
      number of previous abdominal surgeries, number of previous pregnancies, and respiratory
      comorbidities will be collected. Respiratory pressures and mechanics will be recorded at each
      level of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during each ventilatory strategy. The variables
      recorded will include: airway pressures (Plateay pressure Pplat, Peak pressure, Ppeak), the
      final esophageal pressure of inspiration and expiration and pulmonary stress index. Mixed
      linear regression will be used to evaluate the relationship between IAP and TpDp by adjusting
      for known confounders and adding individuals as a random factor. The pulmonary distension
      pressure differences will be evaluated with a t test for dependent samples between protective
      and standard strategies. Likewise, an analysis using a mixed linear regression model with the
      pulmonary stress index as a function of the intra-abdominal pressure, the ventilation regime,
      and a specific random intercept term for each subject will be performed.

    <description>TpDp (assessed in centimeters of water, cmH20) as assessed by ventilatory pressure and pleural pressure (recorded by an esophageal probe) is recorded at every intra-abdominal pressure level during pneumoperitoneum insufflation. The primary outcome is the difference between a standard perioperative management (fixed PEEP + 15 mmHg pneumoperitoneum pressure) and matched PEEP to intra-abdominal pressure and 8mmHg intra-abdominal pressure</description>

    <description>TpDp (in cmH20) is recorded at different levels of IAP and with two different PEEP settings (in cmH20; two levels are: fixed at each IAP level, standard group and matched at each IAP level, matched group). The relationship between TpDp and IAP (both treated as continuous variables) at each PEEP level is plotted and a multiadaptive linear regression is fitted.</description>
