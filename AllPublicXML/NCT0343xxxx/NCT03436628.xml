  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) afflicts approximately 154,000 people under the age of 20. Most people
      with T1D are diagnosed at a young age; their parents have to manage their child's condition.
      Eventually, the child must begin to take steps to transition to self-management. During the
      transition from parent to adolescent self-management, difficulties arise because adolescents
      may not be fully aware of, or want, to take responsibility for all the necessary tasks to
      successfully manage their T1D. Though there are other apps on the market to help with
      diabetes care, NONE do what the proposed app will do. The proposed self-management mobile app
      allows for monitoring the patients' T1D by linking their self-management information to their
      parents' cell phone, and thus also helps to bridge communication gaps. Prior research
      suggests that these are critical gaps that must be filled in order for successful transition
      in care to occur, the proposed app will help fill some of these gaps.
