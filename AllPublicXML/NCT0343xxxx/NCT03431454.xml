  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We compared the effectiveness of three active vision therapy approaches for convergence
      insufficiency (CI). Patients with eligible criteria and symptomatic CI were included in a
      prospective study and randomly allocated into three groups. In the home-based vision
      orthoptic therapy (HBVOT) group, patients were trained to do the pencil push-ups procedure 15
      minutes per day, five days a week. In the office-based vision orthoptic therapy (OBVOT)
      group, 60 minutes of orthoptic therapy using a major amblyoscope twice weekly with additional
      home orthoptic therapy was prescribed. For the augmented office-based vision orthoptic
      therapy (AOBVOT) group, orthoptic exercises using three diopter over-minus lenses and a base
      out prism, in addition to major amblyoscope and additional home reinforcement was prescribed
      in the same period of time.
