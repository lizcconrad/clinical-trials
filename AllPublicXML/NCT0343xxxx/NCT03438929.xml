      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate safety and efficiency of Diolase XL
      blended modes for hair removal. The handpieces tested were a blend of 755nm/810nm and
      810nm/1064nm. At least 30 female subjects seeking hair removal treatment will be enrolled.
      Treatment sites will be o groins and axillae. Study design included 3 treatment sessions 4
