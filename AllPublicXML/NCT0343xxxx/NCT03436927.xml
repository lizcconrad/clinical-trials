  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, Multiple
      Sclerosis (MS) is a neurologic problem which the most frequent cause of disability in young
      adults. Fatigue, pain, spasticity, muscle weakness, depression, as well as balance and gait
      disorders are amongst the symptoms of MS. Balance disorders and the falls caused by them are
      the most frequent problems which result in disability of MS patients, with 75% of all
      patients being affected during the course of disease. When considering previous studies
      carried out on physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices in the light of balance disorders
      and other related problems faced by MS patients, it can been that various physiotherapeutic
      approaches are applied with varying follow-up times and in the form of hospital sessions,
      home sessions, or group training. Posture and balance problems in MS patients are tried to be
      solved through long-lasting treatment sessions using traditional methods of physiotherapy,
      where less patient participation is observed. Fatigue, psychological impairment, and
      insufficient motivation are other aspects which influence the success of treatment and which
      need to be addressed in MS patients. In contrast to traditional methods of physiotherapy
      applied in form of long-lasting treatment sessions, technology-supported rehabilitation
      approaches have emerged in recent years. It can be seen that different systems have started
      to be employed in the physiotherapy of many chronic diseases, either alone or in company with
      traditional methods. Even though the clinical use of these systems is becoming widespread,
      there are certain gaps in terms of the systems' impacts, comparative advantages, or cost
      effectiveness. Keeping this in mind, the purpose of this study is to investigate and compare
      the impacts of 'Nintendo Wii Fit' and 'Balance Trainer', as two of the technologic methods
      with therapeutic impact which have started to be used for different diagnosis groups in
      recent years, on the balance and posture parameters of MS patients, with the ultimate aim to
      introduce a whole new point of view to traditional physiotherapy and rehabilitation studies.

    <description>The Berg Balance Scale is a 56-point scale designed to measure balance among older people by the assessment of functional tasks. Its concurrent validity has been established for people with multiple sclerosis. The Berg Balance Scale is a five point ordinal scale and consisting of 14 balance activity. Each activity is scored between 0-4 and higher total scores indicating less impaired balance. 45-56=independent, 21-44=assisted walking, 0-20=dependent.</description>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention were assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's mobility requiring both static and dynamic balance was assessed by Timed up and go test which measures the time taken in seconds to arise from a standard chair, walk 3 m, turn through 180 degrees, walk back, and sit down again. A longer completion time indicates a higher risk of falling.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six Minutes Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention were assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were instructed to walk a 30 m corridor for 6 minutes and the distance completed after 6 minutes (6MWD) was recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and after 8 weeks of intervention were assessed.</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue severity scale is a nine-item, self-administered questionnaire that assesses the fatigue level in daily functions of MS patients. The items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1=strongly disagree and 7=strongly agree. The minimum score=9 and maximum score=63. Higher fatigue severity scale scores indicating greater severity of fatigue.</description>
