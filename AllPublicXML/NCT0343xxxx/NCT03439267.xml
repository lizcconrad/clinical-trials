  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of a proactive
      cardiovascular primary prevention strategy, with or without the use of coronary calcium
      screening, compared to present standard care, in preventing future major adverse cardiac
      events (MACE), including all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or
      any arterial revascularization among a moderate risk population with no present evidence of
      cardiovascular disease.

      This is a randomized, open-label study designed to assess the effectiveness of coronary
      calcium screening. Patients who provide consent, and are eligible, will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive statin treatment based on coronary calcium screening results or standard risk
      assessment results using the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology
      (AHA/ACC)-recommended pooled cohort equation.

      Management of all participants will be done through their primary care physicians/clinicians
      who will receive education and training from the Principal Investigator and/or his delegate
      about the two treatment strategies. The pooled cohort group will be managed following the
      AHA/ACC guidelines for statin initiation and follow-up. The coronary artery calcium (CAC)
      group will undergo coronary artery calcium screening and will receive statin treatment based
      on the proposed CAC cardiovascular (CV) risk algorithm. All subjects will be asked to
      complete the Intermountain Statin Adherence Questionnaire (ISAQ) at 3 months after study
      enrollment (+ 30 days) and then annually thereafter (within + 30 days of the anniversary date
      of enrollment) for five years. All subjects will remain under the usual care of their primary
      care physicians and will be followed by the study team via their electronic health records
      (EHR) for approximately an average of 4 years following enrollment, but until the target
      primary endpoint event rate is met. All subjects will be followed for outcomes and this will
      be completely done by electronic medical records query. Other than the visit to obtain
      agreement for study participation and to perform the CAC screening, there will be no other
      study-specific clinic visits required. Further, there will be no other treatments or
      procedures required for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects 50 to 85 years of age, of any ethnic origin

          2. Ability to understand and provide agreement to study participation, which must be
             obtained prior to initiation of any study procedures

          3. No known history, as documented in the EHR, of coronary artery disease,
             cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, or diabetes mellitus at
             enrollment

          4. Not on treatment with statins at the time of consent

          5. Willing and able to provide access to their EHR until study end

          6. Willing and able to undergo a computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium
             screening test

          7. Current and/or past patients seen at Intermountain facilities and who have accessible
             EHR at the facility(ties) where they are seen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a major co-morbidity that may make it difficult for the subject to complete the
             study (e.g. active on-going cancer; end-stage kidney disease, glomerular filtration
             rate (GFR) &lt; 30, or patients on dialysis; respiratory insufficiency such that the
             patient requires continuous oxygen; systolic heart failure with left ventricular
             ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 40%; severe dementia or other psychiatric illness such that
             the patient cannot provide informed consent; any other comorbidity as assessed by the
             Principal Investigator)

          2. Have a life expectancy of less than 24 months

          3. Any evidence of statin use prior to study participation

          4. Participation in any other clinical trials involving investigational or marketed

          5. Other conditions that in the opinion of the Principal Investigator and/or Co-Principal
             Investigator may increase risk to the subject and/or compromise the quality of the
             clinical trial

          6. The Study Doctor(s) determine(s) that the subject is not eligible for participation in
             this research study

          7. The subject is non-English speaking, and therefore may be unable to fully understand
             the written and spoken instructions that may relate to the proper conduct of the trial
