      This prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in the emergency intensive care
      units (EICU) of the second affiliated hospital Zhejiang university school of medicine, a
      large tertiary university hospital in HangZhou, China.The aim of this randomized study was to
      compare the effectiveness of high-flow nasal cannula with conventional oxygen therapy in ICU
      patients with blunt thoracic injury.
