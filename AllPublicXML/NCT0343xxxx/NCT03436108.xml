  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common and the most heterogeneous endocrine
      disorder in premenopausal women. Its prevalence is estimated from 5 to 10% depending on the
      diagnosis' criteria .

      Apart from signs of hyperandrogenism such as acne, hirsutism and hair loss; women with PCOS
      usually present with menstrual irregularities and fertility problems ..

      Bisphenol A is formed from acetone and phenol, it is used in production of epoxy resin,
      polyster resins and polyvarbonate resins. Epoxy resins are used in plastics, adhesives, and
      structural composites .

      Humans are at the end of the food chain, thus they are exposed to the highest doses of these
      compounds. EDs have been detected in human adipose tissue and biological fluids such as:
      serum, urine, milk and amniotic fluid .

      Additionally, it has been proven that BPA can also directly stimulate androgen synthesis in
      the ovarian theca-interstitial cells. A correlation between increased serum testosterone
      levels observed in women with PCOS with serum BPA concentrations has also been found .
