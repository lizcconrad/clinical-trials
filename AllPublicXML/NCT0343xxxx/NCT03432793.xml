  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the effect of fluvoxamine, itraconazole and smoking on the
      PK disposition of multiple doses TD-9855 in healthy male subjects. The study will also assess
      the relationship between caffeine PK and TD-9855 PK disposition in healthy male smokers and
      non-smokers.
