      The purpose of this study is to identify whether use of virtual reality devices can improve
      the pain management of women in labor and delivery. The investigators will perform a
      randomized controlled trial of patients in labor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

      The purpose of this study is to identify whether use of virtual reality devices can improve
      the pain management of women in labor and delivery. The investigators hypothesize that use of
      virtual reality devices will result in a reduction in pain medication use, in epidural use,
      and prolong the duration of time prior to the patient receiving an epidural.

      The study will be conducted as two parallel randomized controlled trials: one for latent
      labor patients and one for patients in active labor (defined by whether they are &lt; 6 cm or &gt;
      6 cm). Within each phase of labor, there will be 20 in the Virtual Reality arm and 20 in the
      Control arm for a total of 80 patients.

    <measure>Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory</measure>

    <description>The Childbirth Self-Efficacy Inventory (CSEI) is a measure of how well a patient anticipates being able to perform certain tasks in labor such as relaxing their body, keeping calm, or not thinking about the pain. The investigators will ask to what extend they feel virtual reality would be able to influence their ability to do these things. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8502766</description>

    <description>For those patients randomized to VR, the study staff member will explain the use of the Samsung VR goggle set, and thereafter will allow the patient to use the device freely for up to 30 minutes. Intervals of 2-5 minutes is suggested for first-time use, and patients will be to allowed to discontinue it at any time as long as they are not experiencing any discomfort or side effects (dizziness, motion sickness, etc.). The study staff member will be present at all times, and will work with hospital staff as necessary to ensure the patient is receiving appropriate clinical care throughout the duration of the intervention.</description>
