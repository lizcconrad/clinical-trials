  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer represents the fourth cause of death by cancer in western countries. The
      only curative treatment is surgery but this one is possible only in 10 to 15 % of cases. To
      date, there are few biomarkers in circulating blood as prognostic or diagnostic markers in
      pancreatic cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine if the pancreatic tumor
      mobilization during its resection impacts the quantity of circulating tumor DNA in peripheral
      and portal blood.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will analyze if the tumor mobilization increases circulating DNA rate in
      peripheral and portal blood. Moreover, circulating tumor DNA will be measured during 12
      months after surgery in peripheral blood. They will use a gene mutation detection technique
      called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) which is more specific than a simple Polymerase Chain
      Reaction (PCR).
