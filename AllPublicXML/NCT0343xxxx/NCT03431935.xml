  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are living longer with the advent of medical advances
      such as prophylactic penicillin, chronic transfusion, and hydroxyurea. Despite greater
      longevity in SCD, the period following the transition from pediatric to adult care is
      critical; youth aged 18-30 years are at high risk for mortality and have high rates of
      healthcare utilization, leading to high healthcare costs. As such, health care transition
      (HCT) programs have been created to prepare patients for adult-centered care and
      subsequently, improve health outcomes. However, very few programs have been evaluated for
      effectiveness in achieving optimal health outcomes in SCD. This paucity of program evaluation
      is attributed to a lack of identifiable predictors and outcomes.

      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to identify factors and patterns of
      successful HCT. This information will be used to develop approaches to best evaluate HCT
      interventions and identify areas of improvement of HCT programming.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Describe hospital utilization, treatment adherence, and health-related
      quality of life in a cohort of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who will transfer to
      adult care during the study period.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: Examine the associations between various factors and health care
      transition (HCT) outcomes.

      Participants will be asked to complete a set of questions during an outpatient clinic visit
      at St. Jude or Methodist Adult Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center. The questions ask about
      sickle cell disease knowledge and self-management skills, access to care, general adjustment,
      quality of life, and stress. These questions will take about 60 minutes to complete.

      Participants will answer questionnaires on a password protected laptop or tablet using a
      computer program called Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviews (ACASI). The laptop or tablet
      will be kept by the study team. A study team member will be available during this time to
      address any technical issues or answer any questions. Participants will answer one of the
      questionnaires verbally, and the study team member will record responses from the
      questionnaire with paper and pen. Study members will meet five times with each participant
      during regularly-scheduled clinical visits over a two year period.

      Two institutions will collaborate in the proposed project. St. Jude Children's Research
      Hospital (St. Jude) and the Methodist Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center will be the primary
      source of participants. Faculty from the University of Memphis, Department of Psychology,
      will be involved in methodological considerations and analyzing the data.
