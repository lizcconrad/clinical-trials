  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling and
      collecting outcome data on CLBP patients within the Veterans Affairs Community Based
      Rochester Outpatient Center who undergo an 8 week active exercise class with mindfulness
      (yoga) and without mindfulness (stretching class)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will approach all new or existing patients within the chiropractic clinic between
      the ages of 18 and 89 who have low back pain greater than 12 weeks and pain greater than or
      equal to 3, who have no contraindications to active exercise. Patients will be queried as to
      interest and those interested will be consented. The investigators will recruit a total of 20
      patients. Patients will then be randomized to receive either an 8 week active exercise class
      with mindfulness (yoga) or an 8 week active exercise class without mindfulness (stretching
      class). Both groups will have home exercise requirements and will be held accountable through
      the use of a home practice log. Outcomes will include: Pain (PEG), Quality of Life (PROMIS
      Global Health Survey GHS), Self Efficacy (2 Question), Fear Avoidance Belief, Castrophizing
      and Social Engagement. Outcomes will be collected at baseline, and again at the end of the 8
      week intervention. Clinician open ended questionnaire will be given to both study clinicians
      at the end of the trial.

    <description>Patient reported outcome measurement information system has developed a quality of life tool that provides an overall index score for quality of life. This form has recently been validated in comparison to the EuroQual. T-Score distributions are standardized such that a 50 represents the average (mean) for the US general population, and the standard deviation around that mean is 10 points. A high score always represents more of the concept being measured.</description>
