      Title : Evaluation of the efficacy of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) in healing of through and
      through lesions

      Rationale: Bone replacement analogues have been used in the healing after periapical surgery.
      It has been a controversial issue to use bone grafts due to varied outcomes of different
      studies showing both improved outcomes and no difference. Lacunae while using bone grafts is
      their radiopacity which compounds the radiographic incomplete or uncertain healing. Thence we
      will be using platelet rich plasma as bone filling material.

      Aims and Objectives : To evaluate outcome of platelet rich plasma in healing after periapical
      surgery for through an through lesions.

      Setting: Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, PGIDS, Rohtak, Haryana.

      Study Design: Randomized controlled trial

      Time frame: 12-18 months

      Population/participant : Patients of age 16-45 years (male/female) will be enrolled in the
      study with diagnosis of through and through lesions.

      Inclusion criteria:- Patients of age 16 -45 years, -ve response to sensibility test, failed
      previous rct with purulent discharge, recurrent episode of purulent discharge.

      Exclusion Criteria:- Unrestorable tooth, fractured /perforated roots, serious medical
      illness, smokers, pregnant females and lactating mothers, grade 3 mobile teeth, the need for
      antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental care.

      Sample size - a sample size of 30 patients has been calculated with n=15 in each group.

      Methods- Clinically and radiographically diagnosis of lesion, sensibility test by heat, cold,
      EPT, preoperative evaluation by bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, gingival
      marginal position &amp; pocket depth. Surgical procedures will be carried out under operating
      microscope with 8 ร 16 magnification by following standardized treatment methods.

      Outcome Measures- The primary outcome variables observed for the study will be 3,6,9,12
      months clinical and radiographic success rates in terms of resolution of periapical
      radiolucency using the same criteria as preoperatively on the radiograph and alleviation of
      clinical sign and symptoms.

      Statistical Analysis : Intergroup and intra group comparison will be done according to
      distribution of data. Categorical data will be analyzed using chi-square test. Regression
      analysis will be done to observe any association between dependent and independent variables.

      The research process will be carried out in the Department Of Conservative Dentistry and
      Endodontics, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak. Patients with through and
      through periradicular lesions diagnosed radiographically and clinically will be included in
      the study.

      INCLUSION CRITERIA :-

        1. Patients of age 16-45 years with a clinical &amp; radiographic diagnosis of through and
           through periradicular lesion through CBCT.

        2. Negative response to sensibility tests with radiographic evidence of periapical
           radiolucencies.

        3. Failed previous root canal treatment with purulent discharge and radiographic evidence
           of periapical pathology.

        4. Recurrent episode of purulent discharge and adequate final restoration with no clinical
           evidence of coronal leakage.

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA :-

        1. Unrestorable tooth

        2. Fractured /perforated roots

        3. Serious medical illness (uncontrolled/poorly controlled diabetes, unstable or life
           Threatening conditions or requiring antibiotic prophylaxis)

        4. Smokers

        5. Pregnant females and lactating mothers

        6. Grade 3 mobile teeth

      BASELINE PARAMETERS:

      Endodontic evaluation - Pulp sensibility testing will be performed with a combination of heat
      test , cold test and electric pulp test. Teeth not responding to both thermal and electric
      test will be considered non vital.

      Radiographic evaluation - Radiographs with paralleling cone technique will be taken at
      baseline and at subsequent appointments at standardized exposure parameters.

      Clinical Periodontal Evaluation - The following clinical parameters will be evaluated at
      baseline and at subsequent follow up appointments in the test tooth and the contra lateral
      normal tooth in the same patient

        1. Bleeding on probing - The presence or absence of bleeding following pocket probing will
           be recorded at 6 sites per tooth - mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual,
           midlingual, distolingual.

        2. Probing pocket depth (PPD) - Probing depth will be measured as the distance from the
           gingival margin to the base of the clinical pocket. The probing depth measurements will
           be assessed using a calibrated manual periodontal Williams 0 probe. The probe will be
           inserted with a firm, gentle pressure to the bottom of the pocket and maintained
           parallel to the vertical axis of the tooth. Measurements will be noted at 6 sites per
           tooth- mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, distolingual.
           Measurements will be rounded to the nearest whole millimeter.

        3. Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) - Clinical Attachment Level will be measured as the
           distance between the base of the clinical pocket and a fixed point on the crown, the
           cementoenamel junction (CEJ). Measurements will be made at 6 sites per tooth-
           mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, distolingual using
           wiliiams 0 probe. Measurements will be rounded to the nearest whole millimeter. The mean
           CAL over all examined surfaces will be calculated.

        4. Gingival marginal level/position from CEJ will be measured.

      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:

      A total of 30 patients (n=15 in each group) will be included in the study. A power
      calculation that was based on the previous data of different studies suggested ta sample size
      with 15 patients in each group.

      RANDOMIZATION Patients will be randomly allocated by envelope method into two groups. Group
      I=PRP group, group II=Control group (CG).

      SURGICAL TECHNIQUE :

      With the exception of incisions, flap elevation and suturing, all surgical procedures will be
      performed under operating microscope in an operating room under 8x to 16x magnification.

      The full thickness (mucoperiosteal flap) will be reflected under aseptic condition by
      technique-

        1. Preoperative mouth rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash will be used.

        2. Local anaesthesia with lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:80,000 will be achieved.

        3. Buccal intrasulcular incision will be given up to the alveolar crest including one tooth
           mesial to the lesion &amp; one tooth distal to the lesion, using no.15 blade on handle.

        4. Mesial and distal vertical releasing incision will be given.

        5. Full thickness flap will be gently reflected towards the apical area by periosteal
           elevator. The flap will be frequently irrigated with sterile saline to prevent
           dehydration of periosteal surface.

        6. After complete elevation of the flap, debridement (periradicular curettage -enucleation)
           of the bony lesion will be performed. For additional hemostasis during surgery, cotton
           pellets soaked in 0.1% epinephrine will be applied topically as required.

        7. A 2-3mm root tip with a 0ยบ to 10ยบ bevel angle will be sectioned with cylindrical
           surgical carbide burs at high speed with sterile water coolant.

        8. Root end preparations extending 3mm into the canal space along the long axis of the root
           will be made by using a piezoelectric ultrasonic system with double angled Retrotips
           coated with Diamond abrasives.

        9. Isthmuses, fins, and other significant anatomic irregularities will be identified in
           high magnification and will be treated with the ultrasonic instruments. Then the
           resected root surfaces will be stained with methylene blue and will be inspected with
           micromirrors under high magnification of 24x to examine the cleanliness of the root end
           preparation and detect any other overlooked anatomic details.

       10. Root end filling will be done with mineral trioxide aggregrate (MTA). The adaptation of
           the filling material to the canal apical walls will be confirmed with the aid of an
           operating microscope at high magnification.

       11. In control group cases wound site will be closed and sutured with 4-0 silk suture after
           irrigating the defect properly.

       12. In test group cases PRP preparation will be performed by procedure described by okuda et
           al and hirmath et al. before surgery 8.5 ml blood will be drawn by venipuncture of
           anticubital vein and will be collected in 10 ml sterile glass tube coated with
           anticoagulant.

       13. Whole blood will be centrifuged (2400rpm for 10 mins) to separate PRP and platelet poor
           plasma. PRP and PPP will be centrifuged again to separate PRP from PPP.

       14. Fifteen minutes before use of the PRP , the PRP will be rapidly thawed, and a coagulated
           preparation of 0.3 mL of PRP will be obtained by its activation. Within a few minutes,
           the PRP preparation assumed a sticky gel consistency.

           Then PRP will be carried and packed into the defect to the level of defect walls .

       15. Wound will then be closed and sutured the same way as control group.

      PLATELET RICH PLASMA

      Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is the component of blood in which the platelets are concentrated
      in a limited volume of plasma .This autologous plasma is a rich source of growth factors and
      its application is thought to be an effective way of inducing tissue repair and regeneration.

      Numerous studies have shown PRP to be effective at promoting regeneration in both endodontic
      and periodontal defects.

      It was also speculated that, because of its fibrinogen content, PRP reacts with thrombin and
      induces fibrin clot formation, which, in turn, is capable of upregulating collagen synthesis
      in the extracellular matrix and provides a favorable scaffold for cellular migration and
      adhesion.

      POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS:

      The patients will be advised to avoid mouth rinsing, hard and hot food, hot drinks, heavy
      physical work, and tooth brushing during the day of surgery. Ice packs will be provided after
      surgery (10-20 minutes every 1 hour for a total of 3 applications).

      POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW UP:

      Clinical and radiographic examinations will be performed every 3, 6 and 12 months by
      assessing the same parameters as baseline except that PD will not measured until 12 months.
      Routine examination procedure will be used to evaluate any evidence of signs and/or symptoms.

      Radiographs will be taken at 3, 6 and 12th month of follow up. Radiographic healing will be
      assessed by the criteria :

        1. Complete healing

        2. Incomplete healing

        3. Uncertain healing

        4. Unsatisfactory healing

      PROCESSING OF DATA

      Inter and intra observation of data will be analyzed by distribution of data. Categorical
      data will be analyzed by chi square test. Regression analysis will be done to observe any
      association between independent and dependent variables. Interobserver/intraobserver
      reliability with cohen kappa analysis.
