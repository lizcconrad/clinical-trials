  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date there is very little PD and pharmacokinetic (PK) data on the ticagrelor 60 mg bid
      dosing regimen. In particular, there is no prospective PK/PD study on this dosing regimen in
      patients with DM who are known to have impaired response to clopidogrel therapy. Since DM
      patients frequently require elective PCI due to chronic progression of CAD (and not solely
      because of an acute thrombotic complication), and clopidogrel remains the guideline
      recommended P2Y12 inhibiting therapy for these patients, understanding the PD effects of the
      ticagrelor 60 mg bid regimen in this setting is an unmet clinical need. This is also in light
      of the ongoing THEMIS trial which is specifically evaluating the impact of the ticagrelor 60
      mg bid dosing regimen in type 2 DM patients without a prior major CV event.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are characterized by platelet hyperreactivity and
      reduced pharmacodynamic (PD) effects to several oral antiplatelet agents, including
      clopidogrel. In addition to the hyperreactive platelet phenotype, impaired drug metabolism as
      well as increased platelet turnover rates may contributed to impaired clopidogrel-induced
      antiplatelet effects in DM patients. These observations may contribute to the higher ischemic
      event rates, including stent thrombosis, observed in DM patients compared with non-DM
      patients treated with clopidogrel.

      Ticagrelor is characterized by more prompt, potent and predictable antiplatelet effects
      compared with clopidogrel and lower ischemic events in patients with an acute coronary
      syndrome (ACS) on a background of aspirin therapy. In patients who experienced a prior (1-3
      years) myocardial infarction (MI), compared with placebo, ticagrelor 60 mg bid on a
      background of aspirin therapy also reduced long-term ischemic events, with a mortality
      benefit observed in DM patients.

      To date the PD effects of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in DM largely derive from post-hoc
      assessments or in stabilized patients (e.g. &gt;30 days after PCI), and have not been
      prospectively evaluated in the context of elective PCI procedures. Moreover, PD studies with
      the ticagrelor 60 mg bid regimen are limited. Therefore, the aim of this investigation will
      be to compare the PD effects of a ticagrelor 60 mg bid versus clopidogrel 75 mg od MD regimen
      in DM patients without a prior major CV event undergoing elective PCI.
