  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study designed to evaluate the kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution
      and the incidence of acute chronic GVHD after partially matched related donor hematopoietic
      cell transplantation using an αβTCR/CD19+ cell depleted graft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Less than 30% of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) will have an
      HLA-matched sibling donor. There is a high likelihood of being unable to identify a perfect
      HLA matched unrelated donor, and the time to procure the marrow if such a donor is available
      is generally &gt;3 months. An emerging body of literature suggests that related haploidentical
      HCT with innovative graft engineering may provide equal, or possibly superior, outcomes to
      conventional unrelated donors. This protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that HCT
      using an αβT cell / CD19+ B cell depleted graft from partially matched related donors will
      result in rapid, durable hematopoietic engraftment and rapid immune reconstitution with an
      acceptably low risk of severe acute and chronic GVHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient lacks an HLA matched sibling donor and a HLA A- B- C- DR - DQ- matched
             unrelated donor is not identified within 30 days of the first confirmatory typing
             request.

          -  Meets criteria nonhematopoietic organ function according to NCH policy.

          -  If subjects have received a first HCT, they must be eligible for a second HCT if their
             disease has recurred (see Section 3.3.1 for eligible diseases), all other restrictions
             still apply.

             post-menopausal or surgically sterilized).

          -  Subjects must be ≤21 years at the time of consent.

          -  Signed consent by parent/guardian and assent if appropriate for subjects &lt; 18 years of
             age. Signed consent by patient/subject if ≥18 years of age.

        Donor Eligibility:

          -  The donor must be ≥18 years of age at the time of the informed consent conference.

          -  The donor must be a parent or other related donor

          -  The donor will be evaluated according to the current NCH BMT SOP 04 and must meet all
             criteria.

          -  The donor must be able and willing to undergo G-CSF mobilization and stem cell
