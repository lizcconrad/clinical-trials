    <textblock>
      This study evaluates response of abnormal low salivary flow rate to transcutaneous electrical
      nerve stimulation (TENS) in diabetic type 2 patients. Response of saliva monitored for all
      participants receiving only one session of 5-minute extraoral TENS on bilateral parotid
      glands.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is the most significant disorder associated with varied oral manifestation
      ranging from xerostomia (subjective sensation od dry mouth) to serious bacterial and fungal
      infections due to alterations in flow rate of saliva.

      Systemic agents increase rate of stimulated salivary flow but often have unfavourable side
      effects such as profuse sweating, rhinitis, dyspepsia.

      Use of TENS in stimulation of saliva has been studied in the past which showed moderate
      promising results. However, it never became a part of the mainstream therapy of
      hyposalivation.

      It has been postulated that transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) could directly
      stimulate the auriculotemporal nerve, which supplies the parotid gland, whereas it remains
      unclear whether there is also an indirect action (via afferent pathways) onto the salivary
      reflex arch.

      Starting a prevention program as early as possible considering the most practical, cost
      effective and efficient treatments with the best risk-benefit ratio will help to diminish dry
      mouth symptoms and sequelae (intraoral and extraoral complications).

The patients advised to have nothing to eat, drink, chew gum, intake coffee and oral hygiene before the test.
whole resting salivary volume (ml) planned to be performed using low forced spitting technique in graduated test tube before TENS application.
stimulated salivary volume (ml) collected after TENS application is compared to whole resting salivary volume to assess improvement. .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>salivary flow rate</measure>
    <time_frame>After only one session of five-minutes TENS</time_frame>
    <description>It is estimated as follow:
By dividing whole resting salivary volume on five minute collection period , thus whole resting salivary flow rate (ml/minute) is obtained.
Dividing stimulated salivary volume - collected after TENS application - on five minute collection period, thus stimulated salivary flow rate (ml/minute) is obtained.
Assessing improvement is done by comparing stimulated with whole resting salivary flow rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eight-item visual analogue scale xerostomia questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>After only one session of five-minutes TENS</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale is a horizontal line,100 millimeters (mm) in length and anchored by word descriptors at each end.
Items are &quot;Rate the difficulty you experience in swallowing due to dryness&quot;, &quot;Rate the difficulty you experience in speaking due to dryness&quot;,&quot;Rate how much saliva is in your mouth&quot;,&quot;Rate the dryness of your mouth&quot;, &quot;Rate the dryness of your throat&quot;, &quot;Rate the dryness of your lips&quot;, &quot;Rate the dryness of your tongue&quot; ,&quot; Rate the level of your thirst&quot; respectively.
Before and after treatment, the researcher ask each item to the patient.Then, the patient ts asked to mark his response (perception of his current state) for the item by placing a vertical line on the scale of each item.
The researcher determine scale score response of each item by measuring distance in mm.
Decreased post-treatment of visual analogue scale score for each item considered improvement.</description>
