  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, post-market data collection study intended to collect
      data on the short- and long-term safety and performance of the SCP Procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with symptomatic BML(s) of the knee(s) who qualify for a SCP Procedure will be
      invited to participate. This study will enroll up to 250 patients across 10 investigative
      centers in Europe over a period of 12 months. The maximum study duration is expected to be 6
      years.

      Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 1 month, 3, 6, 12-months and annually up to 5
      years post injection; and subjects will be asked questions regarding their pain and
      functioning to further understand long-term outcomes.

      For a subset of approximately 100 consecutive subjects at selected centers, a long standing
      X-ray and MRI at screening and 12 months will be obtained.
