      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of
      intratumoral injections with an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) AntiSense DNA
      (BB-401) in patients with metastatic/recurrent HNSCC.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response (OR) of the injected tumor</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 months (estimated length of the study)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response is defined as Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) as evaluated using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee version 1.1</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Treatment Visit (Week 9) through to study end (up to 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is measured on a subset of subjects who achieve Stable Disease (SD), Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR) at the End of Treatment visit. DCR will be defined as the proportion of these subjects that show absence of disease progression as evaluated using the RECIST v1.1 criteria</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 months (estimated length of study)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS will be defined as the time from first treatment administration to first observation of documented disease progression as evaluated using the RECIST v1.1 criteria</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 20 months (estimated length of study)</time_frame>
    <description>OS will be defined as the time from first treatment administration through to death due to any cause</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DoR)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 months (estimated length of study)</time_frame>
    <description>DoR assessments will be performed on the subset of patients for who a CR, PR, or SD response is achieved. DoR will be measured from the time where the response criteria are first met, until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented, or the date of death due to any cause</description>
