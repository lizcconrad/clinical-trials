  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, multicenter, single arm clinical evaluation
      utilizing the multi-electrode radiofrequency balloon catheter and the multi-electrode
      circular diagnostic catheter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to assess the safety and acute effectiveness
      of the multi-electrode radiofrequency balloon catheter and multi-electrode circular
      diagnostic catheter when used for the isolation of the pulmonary veins in the treatment of
      Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF).
