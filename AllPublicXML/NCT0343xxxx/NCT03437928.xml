  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to address the unmet need of TRD patients by identifying brain
      networks critical for treating depression and to use next generation precision DBS with
      steering capability to engage these targeted networks. The study's goal will be achieved
      through 3 specific aims:

        1. Demonstrate device capability to selectively and predictably engage distinct brain
           networks

        2. Delineate depression-relevant networks and demonstrate behavioral changes with
           network-targeted stimulation

        3. Demonstrate that chronic DBS using steered, individualized targeting is feasible and
           safe for reducing depressive symptoms

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major worldwide burden. Major depression has a
      lifetime prevalence of ~15% across developed countries. Up to a third of patients fail to
      respond adequately to evidence-based treatments, including pharmacological, behavioral, and
      electroconvulsive therapy. The investigators employ an innovative approach, including
      subacute invasive neurophysiological monitoring with which they aim to gain insight into the
      networks underlying depression symptomatology, confirm the ability to predict the effects of
      precision DBS on network activity, and harmonize these insights to implement network-guided
      DBS for TRD.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women (non-pregnant) between ages 21 and 70;

          -  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) diagnosis (assessed by
             Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 Axis I disorders (SCID2)) of a current major
             depressive episode (MDE), recurrent or single episode with first episode before age
             45, secondary to nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder;

          -  Chronic illness with current MDE ≥24 months duration and/or recurrent illness with at
             least a total of 2 lifetime episodes (including current episode &gt;12 months);

          -  Treatment resistance (defined by criteria on the Antidepressant Treatment History Form
             (ATHF)3): Failure (i.e. persistence of the major depressive episode) to respond to a
             minimum of four adequate depression treatments from at least two different treatment
             categories (e.g. SSRI's, serotonin-norepinephrein repute inhibitors (SNRIs), TCA's,
             other antidepressants, lithium-addition, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor
             (MAOI), antidepressant augmentation with an atypical antipsychotic medication), and
             repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS);

          -  Previous trial of Electroconvulsive Therapy4 (ECT) (lifetime): either did not respond,
             relapsed, poorly tolerated or refused. If refused, will discuss reasons and ensure
             subject understands relative risks of ECT versus DBS.

          -  We will try to enrich sample with patients who had previously shown response to ECT
             (or another intervention) that was partial or un-sustained;

          -  A prior trial of ketamine will not be required because it is not FDA approved and
             durable responses have not been demonstrated,5 nevertheless, subjects will be informed
             about this possible off-label option;

          -  Symptom severity for Screening: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 item (HDRS176)
             ≥20;

          -  The HDRS17 must remain greater than or equal to 20 on two separate assessments (at
             initial screening and 1 week before surgery), over a 1-month period;
