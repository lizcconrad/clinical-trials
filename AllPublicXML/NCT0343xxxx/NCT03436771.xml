      This study will provide long-term follow-up for patients who have received treatment with a
      Juno CAR T-cell product in a Juno-sponsored clinical trial. In this study, patients will be
      followed for up to 15 years after their last dose of Juno CAR T cells for evaluation of
      delayed adverse events, presence of persisting CAR T-cell vector sequences, presence of
      replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) or lentivirus (RCL), and survival.
