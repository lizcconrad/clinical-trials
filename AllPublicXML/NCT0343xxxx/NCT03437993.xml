  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suffer from significant
      occupational, academic and social problems, many of which are believed to be a result of
      problems with executive functioning. Executive functioning refers to a group of
      neuro-psychological functions which include sustained attention, working memory, verbal
      fluency, as well as motor and mental processing speed. Individuals with ADHD have been shown
      to have deficits in executive functioning independent of IQ, co-occurring psychiatric
      disorders, gender, and ADHD subtype. &quot;Recollect&quot; is an application (App) based working memory
      training video game where participants conduct 3-different adaptive working memory tasks. In
      each of these tasks participants are presented with a set of stimuli to be remembered while
      playing a simple platform game where they help navigate an astronaut across the screen and
      dodge obstacles. Recollect has been designed for all age groups to an interesting, fun and
      effective brain-training activity. The memory tasks included in the game have been
      independently shown to improve working memory in a manner that transfers to untrained tasks.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of playing Recollect versus Tetris for
      20 minutes per day, 5 days per week over a 4 week period, on executive functioning deficits
      in individuals who have Adult ADHD.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the effects of playing Recollect versus Tetris for 20
      minutes per day, 5 days per week over a 4 week period, on executive functioning deficits in
      individuals who have Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).Consenting
      participants will be screened using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for
      DSM-5 (MINI) to confirm ADHD diagnosis. Participants will be asked to download either
      Recollect or Tetris on their own mobile device. Following a training/orientation session,
      they will be asked to spend 20 minutes per day at least 5 days per week playing Recollect or
      Tetris over a 4 week period. At Week 4, study staff will check the time log on the
      Recollect/Tetris App to confirm how much time was spent playing the game. Participants will
      be asked to complete two ADHD symptom severity scales, as well as App-based neurocognitive
      testing at baseline (Week 0) and endpoint (Week 4).

    <description>It is a validated, clinician-rated scale, measuring executive functioning. The scale includes 75 items that rates patient symptoms on a 3-point Likert scale (1 = behavior is never observed to 3 = behavior is often observed). Scores range from 75 to 225: Higher scores indicate greater impairment in executive functioning.</description>

    <description>Self-report scale evaluating ADHD symptoms. Symptom count scores range from 1 to 27, with higher scores indicating more ADHD symptoms. Total scores range from 27 to 108, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>
