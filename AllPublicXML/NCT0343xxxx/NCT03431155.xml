    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of nursing interventions based on Mishel's
      Uncertainty in Illness Theory on mothers', who have children with cancer, uncertainty,
      hopelessness, coping and compliance. Half of the mothers will receive nursing interventions
      based on Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Theory while the other mother will receive routine
      nursing intervention of hospitals.

    <textblock>
      Cancer defines a group of diseases that arise from the uncontrolled proliferation and spread
      of abnormal cells. The prevalence of cancer before the age of 15 years is 110-150 million.
      Every year, more than 150,000 people in the World are newly diagnosed, and over 10,000
      children in America are diagnosed with cancer for the first time. It is reported that
      2500-3000 new cases of childhood cancer are expected to be seen in our country, Turkey,
      annually.

      Childhood cancer is a major stressor for parents. They are at risk for developing
      psychosocial problems during the course of disease and its long and stressful treatment. And
      uncertainty is one of these problems which they live. Uncertainty arises when &quot;the decision
      maker can not give a definite value to a certain event or situation&quot; or &quot;can not predict the
      accuracy of the results&quot;. Uncertainty refers to the inability to identify, interpret and
      predict the disease-related condition/event. Uncertainty can have positive or negative
      affects to child and family according the meaning and coping of uncertainty for parents.
      Mishel is the first nurse theorist who mentioned uncertainty in illness in the aspect of
      nursing as a theory. In her theory, nursing interventions can help parents to cope with or
      adapt the uncertainty. Nursing interventions should contain the main domains of such as
      communication, education, supporting, being reliable health care professional for parents.

      In this study there will be two groups that are randomly assigned from the mothers' of
      children with cancer whose treatments continue in two university hospital in Konya. Sample
      size for each group calculated according to effect size (medium effect), power (.80), alfa
      error (.05) and it was found 27 mothers for each group. To avoid possible sample problems can
      be seen during to study (such as do not want to continue the stud etc), sample was improved
      %10 and the last sample size for each group was determined 30 mothers. Groups will be
      recruited randomly.

      Experimental group will receive nursing intervention that include education and sharing group
      activity based on Theory. The aim of this intervention is to control/solve the antecedents of
      uncertainty and to affect appraisal of uncertainty in a positive way so mothers can improve
      the coping and adaptation of uncertainty. Control group will receive routine nursing
      intervention that is given normally for hospitals to avoid bias and ethical problems.
      Duration of intervention and collecting data for the study will be 12 weeks.

      Data will be collected using questionnaire and three scales. Scales validation and
      reliability studies were made for Turkish population and they will use to evaluate
      uncertainty, hopelessness, coping and compliance of mothers.

Data will be collected by the assistant investigator who does not know anything about participants of experiment and control group.
Data will be recorded on the computer by the assistant investigator without specifying the experiment and control group.
The experimental and control groups will be codified by the co-investigator.
The analysis of the data encoded by the groups will be done by a statistical expert. Data collectors, statistical analyzes and report writing will be blinded.</masking_description>
