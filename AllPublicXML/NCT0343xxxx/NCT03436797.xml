    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, open-label, study to assess the effects of AK002, given as monthly
      intravenous infusions at up to 3 mg/kg. A total of 48 patients will be enrolled across 2-4
      sites. All patients enrolled in the study will receive 6 monthly infusions of AK002 and will
      then be followed for another 8 weeks.
