  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This long-term follow-up study will continue to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of
      SPK-8011 in males with hemophilia A, who have received a single intravenous administration of
      SPK-8011 in any Spark-sponsored SPK-8011 lead-in study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will follow patients with hemophilia A, who have received a single intravenous
      administration of SPK-8011 in any prior Spark-sponsored SPK-8011 lead-in study. Subjects will
      be followed for up to a total of 5 years post infusion (including the time on the lead-in
      study).
