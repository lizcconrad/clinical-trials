    <textblock>
      In this study, Investigators are going to develop and test a device to apply virtual reality
      simulation to improve and help for teaching and assessment of anesthesia crisis management.

    <textblock>
      Competency based medical education (CBME) is an outcomes-based approach to the design,
      implementation, assessment, and evaluation of medical education. The goals of Competency
      Based Medical Education are to improve patient safety, patient health outcomes, and enhance
      the competence and performance of individuals, groups and teams. Simulation-based training is
      a proven effective method to improve the skills and competency of the student by permit-ting
      repetitive practice before an actual procedure is performed on real patients.

      e Virtual reality simulation has been used successfully to teach technical skills such as
      laparoscopic surgery, carotid stenting, gall bladder surgery, and knee arthroscopy.

      The specific aims of this project are:

        1. Build a multi-user, multi-site virtual reality simulator for anesthesia management and
           team training

        2. Evaluate the simulation as a tool for competency based medical education

        3. Compare the effectiveness of the simulator with mannequin based simulator for competency
           based medical education.

    <description>The primary outcome in performance evaluation is the number of tasks correctly performed during management of the Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity event. Investigators will use the same performance evaluation tool.
The performance evaluation tool will assess the trainee's performance (i.e., medical management of Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity) per performance evaluation tool</description>
