  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, and is
      most commonly caused by poor uterine tone after delivery of the baby and placenta. Currently,
      a lack of early identification of PPH also results in delayed treatment, with an increase in
      morbidity. The investigators propose that 2 non-invasive methods may provide monitoring for
      early and accurate detection of PPH. These methods include shock index (SI) and continuous
      hemoglobin (Hb) monitoring. SI is defined as heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure,
      and can be used as a marker to predict the severity of hypovolemic shock. Continuous Hb
      monitoring can now be done using a non-invasive probe that is placed on the patient's finger.
      It provides real-time Hb values, rather than having to draw blood and wait for a lab test.

      The investigators hypothesize that SI will have a stronger association with postpartum blood
      loss than Hb variation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators believe that trends in patient-specific SI combined with continuous SpHb
      monitoring, will be useful to identify PPH and the immediate need for pharmacotherapy, as
      well as the need for transfusion in obstetric patients undergoing vaginal deliveries. The
      investigators expect shock index to increase and SpHb levels to decrease with increasing
      blood loss after delivery. The compensatory hemodynamic response may start early, however, Hb
      variation may be delayed unless the patient is transfused with crystalloids. Also
      autotransfusion after delivery may influence these measures. It is unknown which one of the
      two indicators, SI or SpHb, has a stronger association with blood loss after vaginal
      delivery.

      It is already established that both SI and SpHb are independent, clinically useful markers
      indicating significant blood loss in elective cesarean delivery and trauma. This study would
      assess their utility in the recognition and management of obstetric hemorrhage following
      normal vaginal delivery, where early recognition and resuscitation reduces the risk of
      progressing to hemorrhagic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation and death.
