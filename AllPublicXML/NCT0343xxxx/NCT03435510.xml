    <textblock>
      The Live Donor Champion Program is a clinical education program offered to patients placed on
      the waitlist for kidney transplantation at the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center.
      The goal of the program is to increase patient knowledge regarding end stage renal disease,
      kidney transplantation, and live kidney donation and to help patients identify potential live
      kidney donors. Patients are encouraged to bring family and friends to participate in the
      program and act as advocates on their behalf. These friends and family members are labeled
      &quot;live donor champions&quot; and work to assist the patient in spreading awareness about end stage
      renal disease, kidney transplantation, and live kidney donation.

      The objectives of this project are to pilot-test and optimize strategies for the
      dissemination of the Live Donor Champion program in the clinical transplant center setting.
      The goals of the study are to develop an implementation protocol for centers who want to
      establish a live donor champion program at their institution.

      Live Donor Champion Concept: Even with adequate education of live donation, many kidney
      transplant candidates still feel ill equipped to ask others to consider donating. Friends and
      family are often eager to help and may not be able to serve as donors themselves, but might
      be able to provide substantial instrumental support. A &quot;Live Donor Champion&quot; (LDC) is a
      friend, family member, or community member who serves as an advocate for the candidate in
      their pursuit of live donation. The Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center has
      developed a six-month program that provides education and advocacy training to waitlist
      candidates and their LDCs. The instrumental support provided by the LDC bridges a critical
      link between education and action. In pilot studies, candidates with an LDC were more likely
      to undergo Live Donor Kidney Transplant (LDKT) than matched controls. Using LDCs to increase
      live donation is a novel approach that has garnered widespread enthusiasm, including support
      from United Network for Organ Sharing.

      Live Donor Champions (LDCs) as Instrumental Support for Transplant Candidates. Approaching
      potential donors is a daunting and overwhelming experience for Kidney Transplant (KT)
      candidates. Current educational programs address the medical aspects of dialysis, KT, and
      donation, but neglect the health communication skills to discuss transplantation and to
      spread awareness through their various social networks. While transplant candidates are
      hesitant to engage others in conversations about End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and live
      donation, friends, family members, or community members are eager to spread awareness and
      provide advocacy for the patient. In pilot studies, this intervention improved knowledge
      regarding LDKT and provided instrumental support to the transplant candidates. Understanding
      what factors are associated with the successful implementation of this program will enable
      its eventual dissemination at transplant centers nationwide ultimately improving nationwide
      education and awareness of LDKT. In order to successfully do so, a scientifically rigorous
      implementation study is necessary.

    <description>The Live Donor Champion program is the sole educational intervention for this trial. LDC consists of 6 monthly sessions of approx. 1 hour each. Each LDC session is led by a transplant physician or clinical coordinator. LDC sessions incorporate formal didactics, active-participant learning, personal stories, moderated group discussions, role-playing, and other skill-building exercises. LDC sessions are as follows: 1) education about ESRD, KT, and LDKT 2) communication skills building 3) Exploring social networks 4) sharing successful donor and recipient stories 5) encouraging candidate self-efficacy 6) Program Recap.</description>
