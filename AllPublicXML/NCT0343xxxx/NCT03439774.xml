      The study will assess the CT-800 and TRK-2P for conformity to ANSI Z80.10-2014 Ophthalmic
      Instruments - Tonometers, to the FDA Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, Tonometer-Premarket
      Notification [510(k)] Submissions, and to the applicable Supplemental Information Sheet. This
      clinical device study will also assess the substantial equivalence of TRK-2P to a predicate
      device in regard to pachymetry.
