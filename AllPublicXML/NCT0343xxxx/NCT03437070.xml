  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine if addition of trabectedin (T) to combination doxorubicin (D)
      and olaratumab (O), is feasible and tolerable with antitumor activity in metastatic or
      recurrent Leiomyosarcomas (LMS) patients who have limited therapeutic options.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a traditional 3+3 phase I trial design to identify the recommended phase II dose
      (RP2D) of Trabectedin [T] that can be used in combination with Doxorubicin [D] and Olaratumab
      [O] for the treatment of patients with advanced stage or recurrent LMS.

      Patients will be treated at an assigned dose level of combination therapy per dose escalation
      design. The initial dose level (1) to be tested is as follows: Olaratumab 15mg/kg followed by
      Doxorubicin 75mg/m2 then Trabectedin 0.5mg/m2 on day 1 over 24 hours. Granulocyte-colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) support will be administered on day 3. Olaratumab will be also
      given on day 8. Planned treatment is every 21-days for 8 cycles of combination Trabectedin,
      Doxorubicin and Olaratumab (TDO).

    <description>Determination of the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Trabectedin [T] to be used in combination with Doxorubicin [D] and Olaratumab [O] for the treatment of patients with metastatic or recurrent LMS. Patients will be treated at one of 4-6 dose levels according to the standard dose escalation/de-escalation scheme. In accordance with this scheme, the RP2D of TDO will be established as the highest dose level tested for which no more than 2 out of 12 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).</description>

    <measure>Toxicity in Study Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 months, from Day 1 up to 44 days after last dose of protocol therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of the safety, tolerability, and toxicity profile of administering TDO in metastatic or recurrent LMS patients, including assessment of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Treatment dose level cohorts will be summarized reporting the number of participants who experience DLT, serious adverse events (SAEs) and grade 3 or higher adverse events (AE). The investigators will assess toxicity using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03.</description>

    <description>Clinical benefit rate (CBR), as defined by best response, (Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD)) will be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1. The clinical benefit rate (CR+PR+SD) will be estimated by the percentage of patients achieving CBR criteria.</description>
