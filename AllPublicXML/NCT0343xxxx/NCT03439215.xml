      This is a phase II study assessing response rate to PF-06463922 in patients with ROS1
      translocation resistant to previous crizotinib therapy. Eligible patients will be treated
      with the study drug until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.
      Disease assessment will be performed every 8 weeks according to RECIST criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PF-06463922 is a novel small-molecule ROS1/ALK inhibitor that was optimized for robust brain
      penetration. The results showed that PF-06463922 is most potent against ROS1 and ALK, with
      selectivity ratios &gt;100-fold for ROS1 over the 204 kinases tested. A recent study has
      investigated the activity of PF-06463922 against the crizotinib-resistant ROS1G2032R mutation
      in both recombinant enzyme and cell-based assays. PF-06463922 effectively inhibited the
      catalytic activity of recombinant ROS1G2032R and the CD74-ROS1G2032R fusion kinase in BaF3
      cells. This effect translated directly into an antiproliferative response. These results,
      together with its exquisite ROS1 potency and ability to suppress the resistant ROS1
      mutations, supports the clinical evaluation of PF-06463922 in ROS1-positive NSCLC, including
      patients who have developed resistance to crizotinib because of the acquired G2032R mutation
      and/or brain metastases.

      This is a phase II study assessing response rate to PF-06463922 in patients with ROS1
      translocation resistant to previous crizotinib therapy. Eligible patients will be treated
      with the study drug until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient refusal.
      Disease assessment will be performed every 8 weeks according to RECIST criteria.
