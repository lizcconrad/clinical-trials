    <textblock>
      This EAP will be open to provide access to treatment with pitolisant while a U.S. New Drug
      Application (NDA) is being prepared and submitted for review for marketing approval. This
      program will be open to adult patients in the U.S. with Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS)
      associated with narcolepsy, with or without cataplexy. Pitolisant will be made available
      through treating physicians participating in the program.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. In the opinion of the treating physician, the patient is capable of understanding and
             complying with protocol and program requirements, oral drug administration and care
             instructions.

          2. The patient or, when applicable, the patient's legally acceptable representative,
             signs and dates a written, ICF and any required privacy authorization prior to the
             initiation of any program procedures.

          3. Men or women, 18 years of age and over.

          4. Patients with a diagnosis of narcolepsy with or without cataplexy according to the
             ICSD-3 criteria.

          5. Patients should be free of prohibited treatments or have discontinued them for at
             least 7 days prior to the start of treatments.

          6. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed
             at the screening visit.

          7. Due to the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives potentially being reduced when
             used with pitolisant, alternative or concomitant barrier methods of contraception are
             required for patients taking hormonal contraceptives (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) when
             taking pitolisant and for at least 21 days after discontinuation of pitolisant
             treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C).

          2. The patient is a woman who is breastfeeding.

          3. The patient has, in the judgment of the treating physician, a history or current
             medical condition that could affect safety or poses an additional risk to the patient
             by their participation in the program.

          4. The patient is at high risk for suicide defined as a suicide attempt within the past
             year, significant risk determined by the investigator interview, or use of the
             Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).

          5. The patient has a history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to pitolisant or
             any inactive ingredient of the formulation.

          6. Current or recent (within one year) history of a substance abuse or dependence
             disorder including alcohol abuse as defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).

          7. Patients with a known history of long QTc syndrome (e.g. syncope or arrhythmia) or any
             significant history of a serious abnormality of the ECG (e.g. recent myocardial
             infarction), or QTc Fridericia higher than 450 ms for male and 470 ms for female
             (electrocardiogram Fridericia's corrected QT interval = QT / 3âˆš RR).

          8. Significant abnormality in the physical examination or clinical laboratory results.

          9. Prior severe adverse reactions to CNS stimulants.

         10. Any patients presenting congenital galactosemia, glucose-galactose malabsorption or
             lactase deficiency due to the presence of lactose in investigational treatments.
