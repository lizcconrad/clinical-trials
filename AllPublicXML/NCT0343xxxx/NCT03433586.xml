      The PAVE study is a parallel trial of the effects of genetic variation in COMT in the
      presence or absence of Aspirin™ (81mg), placebo, and no treatment on platelet function.
      Healthy normal participants (N=90) between the ages of 18 and 40 years will be randomized to
      take daily placebo Aspirin™(81mg), placebo, and no treatment for 10+/- 3 days. Following each
      treatment, participants will have a 2-week washout period before taking the other treatments
      for an additional 10+/- 3 days. Blood samples will be taken at baseline and after each
      treatment for evaluation of platelet adhesion molecule expression and aggregation. Samples
      will also be evaluated for differential gene expression and metabolomic profiles.

      This is a randomized, crossover, double-blinded, placebo and no-treatment controlled study.
      This study is designed to detect the variation in platelet function based on COMT variation
      and how these platelets respond to cancerous cells.

      We expect to enroll 200 healthy participants with the intention of studying 90 participants
      to complete the protocol.

      Individuals aged 18 to 40 years will be eligible to participate in this study if they do not
      have history of fainting/problems related to blood draws, major chronic medical illnesses,
      regular or current treatment of Aspirin™.

      Examine the role of genetic variation in in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) on platelet
      function in a randomized, crossover, double-blinded, placebo and no-treatment controlled
      clinical trial of daily Aspirin™ (81 mg), placebo, and no treatment for 10 ± 3 days. Platelet
      function will be assessed with a platelet aggregometry and by fluorescence-activated cell
      sorting assessment of platelet adhesion molecule GPIIIb/IIIa and p-selectin.
