  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LNP023 in patients with PNH,
      showing signs of active hemolysis despite treatment with SoC (defined as an antibody with
      anti C5 activity).

    <textblock>
      LNP023 is a novel oral small molecular weight compound, that inhibits alternative complement
      pathway (AP). Blockade of the AP with oral LNP023 has the potential to prevent both intra -
      and extravascular hemolysis.

      This study includes a screening period of up to 68 days, a baseline visit, 13 weeks of
      treatment with LNP023 administered in addition to SoC, and an End of Study (EoS) visit 2
      weeks after last LNP023 administration.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LNP023 in patients with PNH,
      showing signs of active hemolysis despite treatment with SoC (defined as an antibody with
      anti C5 activity).

          -  Male and female patients between the age of 18-75 (inclusive) at baseline with a
             diagnosis of PNH based on documented clone size of ≥ 10% by RBCs and/or granulocytes,
