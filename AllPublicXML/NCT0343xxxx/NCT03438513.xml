  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coverage of the caregivers of patients reached of neurodegenerative disease becomes
      essential. The psychic, physical but also social impacts for the caregivers are widely
      documented in the literature just like the stress associated with this role, we speak then
      about &quot;burden of the caregivers&quot;. It seems that the caregivers set up little effective
      strategies of adaptation pulling fatal consequences on their well-being. He was shown in the
      literature, that a level of high stress is going to engender a decrease of mental flexibility
      and so entrainer a rigidity of adaptation.

      To decrease the burden of the caregivers, numerous interventions were proposed. The analysis
      of the literature highlights that these interventions are rarely developed from theoretical
      models pulling(entailing) a stream of techniques proposed to the caregivers but without
      precise objective. The most effective interventions concerning the coverage(care) of the
      burden of the caregivers are the ones which are targeted and structured, those who put the
      helper in active position and who have an effect on the subjective burden. The
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (TCC) would seem particularly effective.

      So, to modify the perception (collection) of the caregivers in front of cognitive,
      behavioral, functional modifications of their close friend(relation), to bring them to
      estimate positively their role and to favor the employment(use) of adaptive strategies turns
      out to be a privileged target of intervention to be used(employed) to improve the well-being
      of the caregivers and so decrease their burden.

      Considering this, an intervention based on the techniques of resolution of problems (TRP)
      could show itself very relevant as specific coverage (care). The works concerning the
      contribution of the TRP and the adaptation generally concerning situations of health showed
      that this type(chap) of intervention facilitated an adapted situational coping, but also
      increased generally the social, academic and professional performances.

      Various searches(researches) also showed that the resolution of problem is associated with
      indicators of adaptation at patients' nursing reached(affected) by Alzheimer's disease.

      So we propose to the family caregivers a coverage(care) based on the therapy of resolution of
      problems taking support on the model of Lazarus's stress and Folkman and according to the
      model stemming from works of D' Zurilla and Nezu.

      We make the hypothesis that this intervention is going to allow a decrease of the burden by
      allowing the caregivers to find a capacity to modulate their strategies to fit at best the
      evolutions of the clinical situation.

      The main objective of our study is to compare the efficiency of a coverage(care) based on the
      Therapy of Resolution of Problems to a group of word and to that proposed at the moment
      within the pole of gerontology in the decrease of the burden of the caregivers of patients
      reached(affected) by neurodegenerative disease in 12 months. Our secondary objectives will
      concern the evolution of the burden in 6 months and the evolution of the strategies of
      coping, the anxious, depressive symptomatology, the quality of life, the mental flexibility
      in 6 and 12 months.

      According to the data of the current literature, we expect a decrease of the psychological
      distress, an increase of the good(property) to be psychological. More specifically, by
      proposing an intervention targeted in particular at the management of the stress, the helper
      is going to acquire fitnesses which will have a long-lasting(sustainable) therapeutic effect.

      By associating techniques of psychoeducation with techniques of management of the stress we
      hope we can propose a type(chap) of intervention suited to the natural caregivers to favor
      the preservation at home.
