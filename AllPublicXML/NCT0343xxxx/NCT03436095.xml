      Based on nutritional support, Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and Levosimendan Bundle
      measures, and making beside checklist of patients with difficult ventilator weaning;
      Implementation of nutritional risk, respiratory function, and cardiac function assessment
      prior to weaning; Regulate the procedure to solve the problem of difficult-weaning patients
      with Non neurogenic disease in ICU. Thereby,improve the success rate of weaning patients, so
      as to shorten the ICU hospitalization time, reduce medical costs, reduce the complications of
      mechanical ventilation, improve the patient's quality of life.

      Older than 16 years of age, ventilator therapy more than 1 weeks, Ventilator parameters meet
      the standard of ventilator removal, repeated more than 3 times SBT not successful, or within
      a short period of time within a week of successful weaning, no other new incentives to need
      ventilator support again, and delayed weaning from ventilator more than 1 months.
