  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the real world effectiveness and safety of
      ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRd) in patients with relapsed
      and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), under conditions of standard medical care. In
      addition, an exploratory study of biomarkers will be conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to treat
      people who have relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) under the conditions of
      standard medical care. This study is a non-interventional (observational), domestic,
      multicenter, prospective study in patients with RRMM. This study will look at the
      effectiveness and safety of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in
      Japanese patients with RRMM as standard medical care. In addition, an exploratory study of
      biomarkers will be conducted in this study.

      The study will enroll approximately 300 patients. All participants will receive Ixazomib +
      Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (IRd) therapy as standard medical care.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time of observational period
      in this study will be 36 months. For each participant, the observation period will be from
      the start of IRd therapy until either 24 months after the enrollment date of the final
      patient to enroll, or until death or withdrawal of consent, whichever is earlier.
