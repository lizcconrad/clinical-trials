  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to determine how effective antibiotics administered prior to
      endoscopic carpal tunnel release surgery are in preventing surgical site infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be randomized to a prophylactic IV antibiotic treatment arm
      (Vancomycin or Cefazolin) or a placebo IV saline solution. Subjects will be monitored
      following surgery for surgical site infections.
