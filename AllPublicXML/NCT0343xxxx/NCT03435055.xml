  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how a commonly used drug, nitrous oxide, acts on
      the brain to reduce pain. Nitrous oxide is commonly used in anesthesiology but there is
      limited knowledge on how this drug affects functional networks in the brain.

      The objective of this study is to identify the network transformations that account for the
      analgesic effects of nitrous oxide. Our hypothesis is that analgesic doses of nitrous oxide
      increase network efficiency and disrupt normal pain processingOur approach is to administer
      subanesthetic nitrous oxide during the acquisition of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance
      imaging) and EEG (electroencephalogram).

    <description>Brain imaging data will be obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data recorded simultaneously with electroencephalogram (EEG) data at baseline and under a sub-anesthetic dose of nitrous oxide. For fMRI we will use both seed-based techniques run primarily with Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software to analyze brain connectivity prior to and during low dose nitrous. Seed-to-whole brain functional connectivity (i.e. correlated; e.g. Fishers-transformed z) will be measured using brain regions previously shown to be involved in pain and sensory processing as seed-regions of interests. A whole brain general linear model will be performed using the seed time course, averaged over a 3 mm radius sphere, as the regressor of interest, to find other brain regions also correlated with the seed region.</description>

    <description>Brain imaging data will be obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data recorded simultaneously with electroencephalogram (EEG) data at rest and during a tonic cuff stimulation. Seed-to-whole brain functional connectivity (i.e. correlated, e.g. Fishers-transformed z) will be measured using brain regions previously shown to be involved in pain and sensory processing as seed-regions of interests. Changes in connectivity (e.g. Fishers-transformed z) will be measured via contrast images that were created between conditions, stimulus minus rest at baseline and during nitrous oxide administration.</description>

    <measure>Tonic stimulus intensity during nitrous oxide</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 50 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will receive a tonic (6 minutes) pressure applied to the lower leg at baseline and under sub-anesthetic dose of nitrous oxide. Following each pressure stimulus, participants will rate the pain intensity of the tonic stimulus (0 =&quot;no pain&quot;, 10= &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;, Visual Analog Scale, e.g pain intensity).</description>
