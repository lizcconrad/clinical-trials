  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, fixed-sequence, microdose study of three Carbon-14 radio
      labeled (14C) triazine compounds WR826647, WR909388, WR909390 designed in accordance with ICH
      Guidance for Industry M3(R2) (ICH 2009). Subjects will be randomized to one of three groups
      to receive 100 mcg WR826647, WR909388, or WR909390 at an exposure no greater than 250 nCi per
      dose, administered both IV (bolus) and PO with a six half-life wash-out period between IV and
      PO administration. Interim analyses will be done at Day 14 following the IV dosing groups in
      order to assess half-lives of the three compounds to ensure the wash-out period between IV
      and PO dosing is at least six half-lives long.

      Pharmacokinetic parameters of the 3 compounds will be calculated from the plasma-time data
      using Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.3 or higher, and descriptive statistics assessed using SAS
      version 9.3 or higher. No statistical significance inferences will be made. An analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) will be performed on the natural logarithm (ln) transformed dose-adjusted
      AUCinf to estimate the bioavailability. The sample size of 6 subjects per group is considered
      adequate to obtain useful data to compute descriptive statistics. Interim analyses will be
      done after the IV dosing groups in order to assess half-lives of the 3 compounds to ensure
      the wash-out period between IV bolus and oral dosing is at least 6 half-lives long.

             drug. (No restrictions are required for a vasectomized male provided his vasectomy has
             been performed 4 months or more prior to first dose/dosing of study drug. A male who
             has been vasectomized less than 4 months prior to study first dose/dosing must follow
             the same restrictions as a non vasectomized male).

             last dose.

          -  Ability to comprehend and willingness to sign informed consent, which includes the
             Authorization for the Release of Health Information document

          -  Willingness to comply with all study procedures including two 24-hour inpatient stays
             at the study clinic and returning to the clinic for scheduled follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to refrain from or anticipate the use of any drugs known to be significant
             inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and/or permeability glycoprotein (P gp),
