  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global aim of this study is to investigate how the human microbiome changes from baseline
      with commonly used topical medications such as topical antifungals, low to mid potency
      topical steroids and emollients.

      The specific aims are as follows:

        1. Investigate whether ketoconazole cream, a commonly used topical antifungal, causes
           alterations in the human skin microbiome with short-term use.

        2. Investigate whether desonide 0.05 % ointment, a commonly used low potency topical
           steroid, alters the human microbiome with short-term use.

      The microorganisms present on human skin influence human health and disease. Older methods of
      studying the skin microbiota, such as culture based techniques, favored bacteria, which
      readily grew under standard laboratory conditions, compared to current molecular approaches,
      which have shown a greater diversity of skin microbiota [Nature 2012].1 Human skin is a large
      organ that contains a wide range of physiological and topographical diversity. Distinct
      niches exist which predispose certain areas, such as hairy, moist underarms to a different
      bacterial community from dry, smooth sites, such as forearms [Science 2009].2 Given that the
      skin is a critical barrier between the body's internal environment and the external
      environment, characterization of the microbiota of the skin may provide insight into the
      balance between skin health and disease.

      Certain inflammatory skin diseases, such as seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and
      psoriasis, have characteristic sites of involvement. The NIH funded Human Microbiome Project
      (HMP) aims to characterize the human microbiota and its role in health and disease [Nature
      2012].3 Recent research by the HMP showed that certain sites, such as the antecubital and
      popliteal fossa, sites commonly affected in atopic dermatitis, shared similar groups of
      organisms and distinct microbial communities [Science 2009].2 Sebaceous sites, commonly
      affected in seborrheic dermatitis, also shared similar microbial communities [Science 2009].2
      In addition, Kong et al., showed that changes in microbial communities were temporally
      associated with disease flares in atopic dermatitis patients [Genome Research 2012].4 Changes
      in the microbial communities in atopic dermatitis patients were not only associated with
      disease flares, but were also associated with whether the patient received treatment with
      topical medications, including antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory medications, during flares
      [Genome research 2012].4 These findings suggest that communities of microbes are important in
      the initiation and perpetuation of certain skin diseases and that the topical medications
      used in treatment of these diseases have an important role, which may be related to their
      alteration of the microbiome.

      The most commonly used treatments in dermatology include topical steroids and topical
      antifungals, which have long established safety and efficacy. Understanding the changes that
      these topical medications cause in the human microbiome will provide further insight into
      their role in the treatment of certain skin diseases and may assist us in developing new
      therapies in the future.
