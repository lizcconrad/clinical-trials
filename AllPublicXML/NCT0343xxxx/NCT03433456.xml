  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether an intervention targeting healthy habit
      development reduces the risk and prevalence of obesity in low-income mothers and children.
      The study intends to evaluate whether the intervention, delivered in the context of home
      visitation services for low-income families, reduces weight gain and risk factors associated
      with parent and childhood obesity compared to those receiving standard home visitation
      services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be 298 mothers (&gt;50% African American; 100% meet federal poverty level) and
      their children (3-5yo at baseline) enrolled in our home visitation partner in central
      Alabama. Home visitors will be randomly assigned to deliver the home visitation curriculum
      with or without HABITS (an obesity prevention program targeting key eating and activity
      behaviors) as part of their weekly home visits for 9 months. Treatment sessions for standard
      of care or standard + HABITS arms will be facilitated by trained home visitors. If a mother
      or primary caregiver and her child are randomized to participate in the HABITS + Standard
      home visitation curriculum, they will receive ~15 minutes of information, activities, and
      assistance regarding the development of key behaviors relating to obesity prevention, which
      will be imbedded within the existing home visitation curriculum. The HABITS program will
      address habit-formation of four behaviors relevant to mothers or primary caregivers and
      children: (1) limit fried foods; (2) limit sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB); (3) increase
      daily steps; (4) increase fruits and vegetables. Additionally, mothers or primary caregivers
      will also practice habit formation focused on self-monitoring of weight and the four
      behaviors previously mentioned. Skill training will focus on habit formation and home
      environment modification conducive to the four behaviors.

      Mothers or primary caregivers in the intervention group will be provided the HABITS +
      standard home visitation program for 9 months, while those in the control group will be
      provided the standard home visitation program during this time. Treatment in the control arm
      includes the content and services typically provided by the home visitation partner, which is
      focused on strengthening children's cognitive skills, early literacy skills, social/emotional
      and physical development.

    <ipd_description>With the documented permission of the IRB, the PI may develop a transportable de-identified database, codebook, and mechanism by which data can be shared with qualified investigators. Interested investigators will be asked to complete a standardized request form stating the specific aims of the analyses, the analytic plan, available resources for completing the proposed project, proposed timeline, and goals (i.e., manuscripts, presentations, and/or grant applications). The PI and research team will review these requests to determine whether the proposed analyses constitute an innovative and significant exploration of the data, whether the proposed team has sufficient resources to complete the request, and whether data will be adequately protected and managed. If any of these issues are problematic, the PI and research team will attempt to negotiate a fair resolution with the interested investigators and NIMHD program staff.</ipd_description>
