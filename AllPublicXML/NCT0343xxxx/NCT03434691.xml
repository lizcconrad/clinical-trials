      Prospective randomized double blinded study. Investigators planned to enroll 60 cases
      diagnosed with septic shock All patients will be sedated with Midazolam and remifentanyl in
      accordance with a local unit protocol.

      After a period of six hours of hemodynamic stability, patients were randomized to receive
      either continuous infusion of Dexmedetomidine at 0.4 μg/kg per hour and remifentanyl (DEX
      group) or a continuous infusion of a Midazolam and remifentanyl (MDZ Group).

    <description>continuous infusion of Dexmedetomidine at 0.4 μg/kg per hour and remifentanyl A microdialysis probe was placed into the femoral quadriceps. An initial set of measurements will be obtained during the sedation with Midazolam and remifentanyl (before randomization). This set of measurements will be considered as baseline. Then samples were collected every 6 hours for 3 days. The changes in the energy-related metabolites lactate, the lactate/pyruvate ratio, glucose and glycerol were analyzed. Concomitantly with dialysate sampling, the effects on global haemodynamics, were assessed. Lactate and L/P clearances were also calculated.</description>

    <description>Interstitial tissue concentrations of lactate, pyruvate, glucose and glycerol were determined at baseline and then every six hours for the following 72 hours after randomization.
During the study period, conventional treatment was continued as per usual practice. Fluid challenges were performed, and repeated as necessary, to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) ≥8 and pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (PAOP) ≥12 mmHg. Norepinephrine was titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥65 mmHg. Packed red blood cells were transfused when Hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations decreased below 7 g/dL, or if the patient exhibited clinical signs of inadequate systemic oxygen supply.</description>
