  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well deep inspiratory breath hold or prone breast radiation
      therapy works in reducing cardiac dose in patients with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in
      situ. Deep inspiratory breath hold is a technique that involves a patient holding their
      breath during radiation to move the heart away from the breast to minimize radiation to the
      heart. Prone breast radiation therapy is a technique in which a patient receives treatment
      &quot;face-down&quot; to minimize the radiation to the rest of the body, including the heart and lungs.
      Comparing deep inspiratory breath hold to prone breast radiation therapy may help doctors
      improve radiation to the target while reducing radiation to healthy tissues surrounding the
      target.

      Patients attend a simulation visit and undergo two CT scans, one in the prone position and
      one in the supine position with DIBH. Within 1 week after the simulation visit, patients
      undergo radiation therapy either in the supine position with DIBH or in the prone position
      daily for 15-30 consecutive days as per physician's prescription
