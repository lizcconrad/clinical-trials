  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      Research shows that the parietal and prefrontal areas of the brain are involved in short-term
      memory. Researchers want to look at the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of
      these areas on short-term memory and brain activity. They will use functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at brain activity.

      Objective:

      To look at the effects of TMS on brain pathways involved in memory.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18-50

      Design:

      Participants will have 3 or 4 visits at least 1 week apart. They cannot drink alcohol for at
      least 48 hours before each visit.

      The screening visit lasts about 1 (Omega) hours. It can be combined with the first testing
      visit. Screening includes:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Neurological exam

        -  Urine tests

        -  Questionnaires about being left or right handed and about their ability to imagine
           physical activities.

      The first testing visit lasts about 1 (Omega) hours and includes an MRI. For the MRI,
      participants lie on a table that slides into a machine. They will lie still or perform simple
      memory tasks on a computer screen.

      The second and third testing visits last about 3 hours. Participants will have:

        -  2 MRIs

        -  TMS: A wire coil is held to the scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the
           coil to create a magnetic pulse that affects brain activity. They will perform simple
           memory tasks.

        -  EMG: Small electrodes are taped to the skin to record muscle activity while they rest.

      After the study, participants will complete a questionnaire about any discomfort they
      experienced during the study.

      Objective: This study aims to identify whether repetitive dual-site transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) can modulate the functional connectivity between the parietal and
      dorso-lateral prefrontal cortices.

      Study population: The study involves 26 healthy volunteers.

      Design: This controlled study comprises 3 main visits for each subject: (1) a baseline,
      evaluation visit during which fMRI will be acquired during a visual short memory task along
      with diffusion tensor imaging and structural MRI; (2) a visit during which resting state fMRI
      (rsfMRI) will be acquired, followed by paired-associative stimulation (PAS) with pulses
      delivered over the parietal and then over the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, in order to
      induce a temporary plastic change in the interaction between the parietal and prefrontal
      cortices; the PAS will be followed by another rsfMRI and task fMRI; (3) a visit identical to
      #2 during which the PAS will be delivered with pulses in reverse order of previous visit.

      Outcome measures: The effects of PAS will be quantified with rsfMRI and a short working
      memory task, considered as a proxy for complex motor and cognitive control.

        -  The primary outcome will be to investigate the resting state functional connectivity
           changes induced by each PAS intervention

        -  The secondary outcome #1 will be to evaluate the difference in visual angle error
           between sessions 2 and 3 in a working memory task during which the subjects will be
           asked to remember the position of a bar presented on the screen at different time
           intervals before the inquiry.

        -  The secondary outcome #2 will be to build an fMRI-DTI analysis pipeline for generation
           of TMS targets individually customized for each subject and a given task.
