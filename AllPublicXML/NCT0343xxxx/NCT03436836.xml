  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nalbuphine has been used as an adjuvant to bupivacaine in intrathecal, epidural, caudal
      anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks showing an increase in the efficacy and the duration
      of postoperative analgesia.The aim of this study is evaluation of the effect of nalbuphine
      when used as an adjuvant to a local anesthetic mixture in peribulbar block undergoing
      cataract surgery
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      44 patients (22 in each group) scheduled for elective cataract surgery using peribulbar
      block. Patients of Group N received local anesthetics received 6 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine 1 ml
      hyaluronidase (75 IU), and 4mg of Nalbuphine in 1 ml of saline (total 8 ml) and patients of
      Group C received 6 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine, 1 ml hyaluronidase (75 IU) and1 ml saline (total 8
      ml).

      Addition of nalbuphine to bupivacaine in peribulbar block is associated with reduced the time
      of onset of globe akinesia, increased the duration of globe akinesia and analgesia with
      better postoperative pain relief

    <intervention_model_description>Forty-four patients were enrolled in the current study and randomly allocated into two equal groups [Group N (n=22) and Group C (n=22)]. Two patients in Group N and three patients in Group C were excluded from the study due to failure of the block to achieve satisfactory surgical condition (inadequate akinesia OMS&gt;2) so, received additional supplementations 2-3 ml of LA mixture and were excluded from the study</intervention_model_description>

Patients of Group N received local anesthetics received 6 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine 1 ml hyaluronidase (75 IU) , and 4mg of Nalbuphine in 1 ml of saline (total 8 ml) and patients of Group C received 6 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine, 1 ml hyaluronidase (75 IU) and1 ml saline (total 8 ml)</masking_description>

If the block was inadequate after 10 minutes, a 2-4 ml supplementation of local anesthetics was given by the same technique and the patient was excluded from the study.
After adequate analgesia (loss of sensation to touch by a small cotton wool) and akinesia, the surgeon was allowed to start the surgery</description>
