    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through completion of study treatment period, an average of 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness that is measured by use of a very short questionnaire. The questionnaire asks the subject to rate his or her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 to 3 for 8 different situations. The scores are added together to obtain a single number.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through study completion, an average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QUIP-RS was developed to assess the severity of impulse control disorders and related behavior symptoms and to monitor changes in symptoms over time. The QUIP-RS has 4 primary questions (pertaining to commonly reported thoughts, urges/desires, and behaviors associated with impulsive control disorders), each of which is applied to 4 impulsive behaviors (compulsive gambling, buying, eating, and sexual behavior) and 3 related disorders (medication use, punding, and hobbyism). It uses a 5-point scale to gauge the frequency of behaviors. Scores for each behavior and related disorder range from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating greater severity (ie, frequency) of symptoms. The total QUIP-RS score for all impulsive control disorders and related disorders combined ranges from 0 to 112.</description>

    <description>The UM-PDHQ is a 20-item clinician-administered questionnaire that is completed during a structured interview. Questions are divided into 2 groups: a quantitative group that consists of 6 questions (modality, frequency, duration, insight, emotional burden) and a qualitative group that consists of 14 questions. Scores range from 0-14.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening and Day 28, an average of 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-assessment scale, was developed to detect states of depression, anxiety and emotional distress. The HADS is a 14-item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety, and 7 of the items relate to depression. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0 to 3, with individual scores ranging between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression.</description>
