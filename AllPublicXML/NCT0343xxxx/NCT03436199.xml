    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 3-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed 25 foot walk (T25FW, feet/second)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The T25FW is a measure of lower extremity function. The subject is directed to a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The task is immediately administered again by having the subject walk back the same distance. The result is reported as time to complete (seconds) or speed (feet per second). Improvement is indicated by a decrease in time or an increase in speed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG is a measure of lower extremity strength, balance, and coordination. The subject stands up from a chair, walks 3 meters then turns around and walks back to the chair to sit down. The result is reported in seconds. Improvement is indicated by negative change scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>2-Minute Walk Test (2MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 2MWT is a measure of lower extremity function. The subject is instructed to walk as far as possible in 2 minutes, and the distance is measured in meters. Improvement is indicated by positive change scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MSWS-12 is a 12-item walking scale that is a measure of subject-reported walking ability during the past 2 weeks. Each item is scored on a 1 to 5 scale. A total score can be generated and transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. Improvement is indicated by negative change scores.</description>
