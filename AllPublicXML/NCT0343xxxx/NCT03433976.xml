  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned cesarean section is an intervention with a standard operating time of less than
      40 minutes in trained teams. Hyperbaric Bupivacaine is the local anesthetic (LA) reference
      for these operations. But the duration of its motor block is generally greater than 3 hours.
      The purpose of this study is to show a reduction in motor block time with hyperbaric
      Prilocaine by at least 30 minutes, which would allow mothers and their children to return to
      the maternity ward earlier and thus improve the circulation of patients within the
      maternity's PACU.

      Prospective study, randomized into two parallel groups (Hyperbaric Prilocaïne versus
      hyperbaric Bupivacaine), double-blind, monocentric (Clinique Saint Roch in Montpellier).

      The number of subjects required is 50 patients, 25 per group.

    <measure>APGAR score of newborns at birth</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>APGAR score of newborns at birth. L'APGAR Apgar score is a method to quickly summarize the health of newborn children.
The Apgar scale is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing up the five values thus obtained. The resulting Apgar score ranges from zero to 10. The five criteria are summarized using words chosen to form a backronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration).
The test is generally done at one and five minutes after birth, and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 7 and above are generally normal, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low.</description>
