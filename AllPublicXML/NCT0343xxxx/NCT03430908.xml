    <description>The provider will be blinded to the ultrasound imaging throughout the entire insertion. This blind insertion process is the standard of care currently practiced at MSKCC. After the provider verbalizes that they have completed the insertion the investigators will stop the ultrasound imaging and complete the data form. No information will be given to the provider about the location of the gastric tube as to not deviate from the standard of care. The only time that information will be provided to the practitioner inserting the tube will be if the tube is positioned in any of the following positions that are thought to be potentially injurious if unrecognized. These positions include intrapulmonary, cranial, nasal or oral pharyngeal placements and diverticular or hiatal hernia sac coiling and remain unrecognized by the practitioner. These are considered positions that have the potential for injury and therefore will be divulged to prevent ensuing injury.</description>
