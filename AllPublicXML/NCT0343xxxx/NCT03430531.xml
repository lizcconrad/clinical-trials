  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to determine the effectiveness of Spheno-Palatine (SP) ganglion
      block to alleviate the pain of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to study the effectiveness of SP ganglion block in
      relieving post-dural puncture headache in terms of :

        1. Number of subjects who get relief of pain

        2. The onset time to pain relief after application of block

        3. The duration of pain relief

        4. The incidence of recurrence of post-dural puncture headache

      Secondary objectives are to:

        1. Monitor any complications due to SP ganglion block

        2. Measure patient satisfaction

        3. Monitor any residual effects at 1 months after the SP block

    <time_frame>15 minutes before the SP block to 30 days post SP block</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported pain scores will be recorded at the following times and positions: Baseline (before SP block)-supine, baseline-sitting, during SP block, 5 min post SP block-supine, 5 min post SP block-sitting, 60 min post SP block-supine, 60 min post SP block-sitting, and for days 1, 2, 7, 30 days post SP block</description>

    <measure>Time to onset of pain relief after application of block</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes before the SP block to 30 days post SP block</time_frame>
    <description>The time between the performance of the SP block and the time the patient reported pain score decreases from the baseline level.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes before the SP block to 30 days post SP block</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported pain scores, recorded at the times listed for Outcome 1, will be used to determine for how long after the SP block the patient reported pain scores that were decreased form the baseline measures (also describes for Outcome 1).</description>

    <measure>Incidence of recurrence of post-dural puncture headache</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes before the SP block to 30 days post SP block</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported recurrence of post dural puncture headache will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Complications due to SP ganglion block</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes before the SP block to 30 days post SP block</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to report any side effects, including: allergic reaction to lidocaine, nose irritation and nose-bleed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with SP ganglion block</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes before the SP block to 30 days post SP block</time_frame>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Sphenopalatine ganglion block</intervention_name>
    <description>Lidocaine 2% viscous (0.5ml) will be squirted on two cotton swab sticks and one will be gently inserted into each nostril, along the floor of the nose. Slight rotatory motion of the stick will be used to insert it as far as it goes with the intention to reach the nasopharyngeal wall (posterior wall of the nose). At that position the swab sticks will be left undisturbed for 5 minutes. The swabs will be taken out and this will be repeated twice more, using fresh swabs and 0.5ml of 2% lidocaine. The block would take about 30 minutes.</description>
