    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using digital technology and
      remote monitoring to track health-related measures in men following prostate cancer
      treatment. Half of the participants will receive tools to monitor their activity and weight,
      as well as personalized feedback on these measures, while the other half will receive
      standard of care. Health related quality of life measure will be collected from both groups.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of using digital technology and
      remote monitoring to track health-related measures in men following prostate cancer
      treatment. All participants will complete a health-related quality of life survey each month
      for 3 months. The digital survey will be administered on a programmed tablet. The
      participants in the intervention group will also receive an activity sensor and weight scale.
      Health state data from this group will be generated over a 3 month period and remotely
      monitored. These data will be used to provide personalized feedback regarding the
      participant's progress towards established goals. Health-related quality of life will be
      compared between participants in the intervention group, who receive (1) tools to monitor
      their activity and weight and (2) personalized feedback, versus participants in the control
      group, who receive standard of care. The potential improved adherence to healthy behaviors of
      the participants receiving personalized feedback may translate to to improved health-related
      quality of life.

    <description>36-Item Short Form (SF) Survey. This survey is a patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section and the scores range from 0-100. A score of 0 is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
