  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study we want to learn more about using non-invasive tools as a way to
      predict whether or not a child under general anesthesia will require and respond to fluid
      administration.

      It is important for an anesthesiologist to know if a child would respond to fluid
      administration so that they can provide the optimal intervention for low blood pressure and
      avoid unnecessary treatment.
