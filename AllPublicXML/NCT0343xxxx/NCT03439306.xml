      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the SpO2 accuracy performance of Belun Ring Oximeter
      placed on the index fingers during non-motion conditions over the range of 70-100% SaO2,
      arterial blood samples, assessed by CO-Oximetry. It is expected that the Accuracy Root Mean
      Square (ARMS) performance of the oximetry system will meet the required specification of ARMS
      of 3.5% or less allowed for reflectance technology in non-motion conditions for the range of
      70 - 100% SaO2.

      The Clinimark proprietary Desaturation Fixture with Automated Data Collection is a single
      limb blow by system used to deliver medical grade oxygen and nitrogen gas mixtures to induce
      various hypoxic levels in subjects at a slow steady rate allowing an automatic marking and
      collection of the Control or secondary Transfer reference Pulse Oximeter and other pulse
      oximetry systems at 1 second intervals.

      The Control Pulse Oximeter, an FDA cleared device, is used to monitor the oxygen saturation
      levels real time throughout the study for subject safety and to target stable plateaus. This
      device is used to assess the stability of the data.

      Multi-parameter monitor used during the study to observe a subject's vital signs including
      ECG tracing, heart rate, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2 with capnograph, secondary monitor
      for the oxygen concentration being delivered to the subject.

      A whole blood analyzer (CO-Oximeter) is used as the reference standard device for obtaining
      the functional SaO2 value from arterial blood samples obtained during the study.

    <description>Subjects were given medical grade mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen to induce stable plateaus across the range of 100% to 70%. The stable plateaus allowed data collection in the following SaO2 ranges 95-100, 90-95, 85-90, 80-85, 75-80, 67-75. In general, 4 to 8 discrete points were collected at each of the levels.</description>
