  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because it is not known which dietary recommendations are best to
      help patients recover after a tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. The purpose of this study
      is to determine how diet after tonsil/adenoid surgery affects bleeding, pain, and oral
      intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently it is not known which dietary recommendations are best to help patients recover
      after a tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Traditional standard of care is to recommend that
      patients be restricted to a soft diet post-operatively. However, the investigators believe
      that there may be benefit in allowing patients to eat a restriction-free diet. In this study,
      the investigators will compare the current standard of care verse a non-restricted diet. The
      purpose of this study is to determine how diet after tonsil/adenoid surgery affects bleeding,
      pain, and oral intake.
