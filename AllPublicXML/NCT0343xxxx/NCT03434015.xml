  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with atrial fibrillation are at significant risk of thrombus formation in the left
      atrial appendage, which can lead to a stroke or systemic embolism. This risk justifies
      first-line prescribing of long-term oral anticoagulant therapy in these patients.
      Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure, is a new interventional cardiology technique for
      patients at high risk of stroke related to atrial fibrillation in whom long term
      anticoagulation therapy cannot be conducted. This procedure involves implantation of an
      occlusion device into the left atrial appendage to close it and prevent migration of
      thrombotic material that can cause distant embolism. Closure of the left atrial appendage
      avoids long term prescription of anticoagulants while protecting patients against the risk of
      systemic embolism and stroke. In 2016, two devices developed for transcutaneous closure of
      the left atrial appendage (WATCHMAN, Boston Scientific, AMPLATZER CARDIAC PLUG, S. Jude
      Medical and its evolution AMPLATZER AMULET) were included in the list of products
      reimbursable in France. The French national authorities have requested the realization of a
      register whose objectives will be to evaluate:

        -  The efficiency and safety of implanting devices in France

        -  The type and duration of antithrombotic treatment prescribed after left atrial appendage
           closure
