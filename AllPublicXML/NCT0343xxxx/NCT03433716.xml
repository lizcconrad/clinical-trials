  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE), also known as tennis elbow, refers to a painful condition at or
      around the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and common extensor tendon (CET) that is
      aggravated by dorsiflexion and/or supination of the wrist against resistance. Lateral
      epicondylitis is one of the most common injuries of the elbow, affecting 1-3% of the
      population.

      Therefore, determining an effective intervention that helps manage the condition and lessens
      the financial burden is important. Passive physical modalities, including electrotherapy and
      orthotic devices, are common treatments for the management of elbow pain. Passive physical
      modalities are physical treatments involving a device that does not require active
      participation by the patient. In a systematic review, 2017, Dion et al examined the
      effectiveness of passive physical modalities for the treatment of soft tissue injuries of the
      elbow, but little evidence exists to support or refute their use.

      Clinically, an invasive technique has appeared, known as Ultrasound-guided Percutaneous
      Neuromodulation (PNM). This minimally invasive intervention consists in the applicacion of a
      percutaneous electrical stimulation (PES) through an acupuncture needle-like electrode that
      is placed in close proximity to the nerve or motor point of the muscle with ultrasound
      guidance. At the clinical level, the PES is always used with the therapeutic aim of relieving
      chronic pain and neuropathic pain. Similarly, in sports, PES is used with the aim of
      improving muscular activity. Therefore, according to the characteristics and the therapeutic
      benefits of this technique, further research is needed to discover multiple clinical
      indications.

      The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a percutaneous neuromodulation
      intervention in patients with unilateral refractory lateral epicondylitis. Findings from this
      study may provide further evidence for the relevance of neural tissues in determining the
      elbow pain and may indicate effects of US-guided NMP technique on the rehabilitation and/or
      prevention of in patients with unilateral refractory LE.

    <description>Subjects were treated for 3 weeks, once a week. Specifically, this consisted in the application of a square wave biphasic electrical current, with 10Hz frequency, a 250µs pulse width, and the maximal tolerable intensity to cause an exacerbated muscle contraction for a total of 1.5 mins, according to the protocol by Valera and Minaya. The subjects were seated while their arms were supported by an arm rest, forearms pronated and elbows moderately flexed. The radial nerve was located at 4cm proximal to the tip of the lateral epicondyle of humerus using an ultrasound machine (cross-section), subsequently, an acupuncture needle (0.30mm x 30mm) was inserted in a short axis approach, perpendicular to the surface of the skin, until the perineurium of the radial nerve (in close proximity).</description>
