      This is a a multicenter, randomized, controlled, phase III trial comparing High-Dose IFN-a2b
      with Temozolomide Plus Cisplatin as Systemic Adjuvant Therapy for Resected Mucosal
      Melanoma.The study objective is to compare efficacy and safety of High-dose IFN-a2b and
      temozolomide-based chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.

      The patients who comply with the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled. The
      estimated recruiting duration is 36 months. Patients with resected mucosal melanoma were
      randomized into two groups: HDI group (group A, treated with i.v. 15×10^6U/m^2/d IFN-a2b on
      days 1 to 5 each week for 4 weeks, followed by s.c. 9×10^6U IFN-a2b three times per week for
      48 weeks), and chemotherapy group (group B, per os 200 mg/m^2/d temozolomide on days 1 to 5
      plus i.v. 75 mg/m^2 cisplatin divided into 3 days,which was repeated every 3 weeks for six
      cycles). All patients will be followed for at least 2 years.
