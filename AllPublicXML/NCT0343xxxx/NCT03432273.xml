          5. Medical history, vital signs, physical examination, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram
             (ECG) and laboratory investigations must be clinically acceptable or within laboratory
             reference ranges for the relevant laboratory tests, unless the investigator considers
             the deviation to be irrelevant for the purpose of the study.

               -  Not of childbearing potential, e.g., has been surgically sterilized, undergone a
                  hysterectomy, amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months and considered post-menopausal, Note: in
                  postmenopausal women, the value of the serum pregnancy test may be slightly
                  increased. This test will be repeated to confirm the results. If there is no
                  increase indicative of pregnancy, the female will be included in the study.

               -  Of childbearing potential, the following conditions are to be met:

             Negative pregnancy test

             If this test is positive, the subject will be excluded from the study. In the rare
             circumstance that a pregnancy is discovered after the subject received IMP, every
             attempt must be made to follow her to term.

             Not lactating

             Abstaining from sexual activity (if this is the usual lifestyle of the subject) or
             must agree to use an accepted method of contraception, and agree to continue with the
             same method throughout the study Examples of reliable methods of contraception include
             oral (documented that the dose has been stable for at least one month before the first
             intake of IMP), injectable or implantable contraceptives and non-hormonal intrauterine
             device.

             In this study the concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives is allowed. Other
             methods, if considered by the investigator as reliable, will be accepted.

          7. History of cigarette smoking of at least 10 cigarettes per day continuously for the
             past 3 months prior to screening and smokes first cigarette in more than 30 minutes
             after waking up in the morning.

          8. No use of any tobacco or nicotine-containing products within 21 days of the first dose
             except cigarettes.

          9. Have no interest in quitting smoking.

         10. Have accepted to refrain from smoking for the duration of the study periods.

         11. Exhaled CO concentration &gt; 10 ppm at screening.

         12. Successfully completed the dissolution training session prior to randomization.

         13. Ability to communicate and comply with all study requirements including the study
             specific method of administration for the nicotine lozenges.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of psychiatric disorder, antagonistic personality, poor motivation, emotional
             or intellectual problems likely to limit the validity of consent to participate in the
             study or limit the ability to comply with protocol requirements.

          2. Any surgical or medical condition which may significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of any IMP substance.

          3. Current alcohol use &gt; 21 units of alcohol per week for males and &gt; 14 units of alcohol
             per week for females or evidence of excessive alcohol use as indicated by an alcohol
             breathalyzer test result ≥ 0.01%.

          4. Regular exposure to substances of abuse (other than alcohol) within the past year.

          5. Use of any medication, prescribed or over-the-counter or herbal remedies, within 2
             weeks before the first administration of IMP except if this will not affect the
             outcome of the study in the opinion of the investigator.

             In this study the concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives is allowed.

          6. Expired CO levels greater than 10 ppm in the morning prior to dosing.

             half-lives for chemical entities or 2 elimination half-lives for antibodies or
             insulin, whichever is the longer) before administration of IMP in this study, at the
             discretion of the investigator.

         12. Treatment within the previous 3 months before the first administration of IMP with any
             drug with a well-defined potential for adversely affecting a major organ or system.

             period, either supine or standing.

         23. Positive testing for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.

         24. Positive urine screen for drugs of abuse. In case of a positive result the urine
             screen for drugs of abuse may be repeated once at the discretion of the investigator.
