    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the prevalence of different stages of diabetic retinopathy
      and diabetic macular edema among patients suffering from type 1 diabetes (DM1) for 5 to 25
      years and have been treated with intensified insulin therapy aiming near-normal blood glucose
      levels for the whole duration of disease.

      Prevalence of different stages of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema is assessed
      using the modified Airlie House classification and the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
      Study (ETDRS) retinopathy severity scheme. Results of this study will provide the basis for
      designing further studies as well as staging and screening guidelines for diabetic
      retinopathy/diabetic macular edema.

      Purpose: This study is designed to evaluate the prevalence of different stages of diabetic
      retinopathy and diabetic macular edema among patients suffering from type 1 diabetes for 5 to
      25 years and have been treated with intensified insulin therapy aiming near-normal blood
      glucose levels for the whole duration of disease.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to examine the prevalence (percentages) of the stages of
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) within one cross-sectional
      examination. Key secondary/exploratory objectives are the prevalence (percentages) of the
      stages of diabetic macular edema (DME), the means of individual average
      5year-/10year-/15year-/20year-/25year-HbA1c value (%) as a measure for long-term glycemic
      control, the means of individual average 5year-/10year-/15year-/20year-/25year-blood pressure
      (mmHg) as a measure for long-term blood pressure control, mean BCVA score, mean contrast
      sensitivity score, mean NEI-VFQ 25 score (for further details see section Objectives).

      Study design: Non-interventional cross-sectional investigator initiated study. The study will
      be conducted at Vista Klinik Binningen/Switzerland (ophthalmological evaluations) and the
      Department of Endocrinology of the University Hospital Basel/Switzerland (patient
      recruitment).

      Study population: All patients with DM Type 1 with a least 5 years and maximum 25 years
      disease duration and intensified insulin therapy for the whole duration of disease, who are
      currently in follow-up for their DM1 at Department of Endocrinology of the University
      Hospital Basel/Switzerland. In order to prevent selection bias, patients will be screened for
      enrollment consecutively. For In-/exclusion criteria see section Eligibility.

      Investigational and reference therapy: None.

      Assessments:

        -  Visual acuity measurements using the ETDRS-like testing charts at a test distance of 4
           meters

        -  Contrast sensitivity

        -  Ophthalmic examinations (slit lamp exam with fundus biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure)

        -  High resolution optical coherence tomography (Spectralis-OCT)

        -  Stereoscopic fundus photography

        -  Fluorescein angiography

        -  NEI-VFQ 25 (25-item National Eye Institute Vision Function Questionnaire)
