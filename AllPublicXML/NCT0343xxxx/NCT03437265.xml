  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study characterises the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of the active ingredients of
      NER1006 and their related substances/metabolites. Subjects will receive NER1006.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NER1006 is a novel, low volume (1 L) PEG 3350 and ascorbate based bowel preparation that has
      been developed to provide whole bowel cleansing. Studies have shown that formulating the
      osmotically active agents sodium ascorbate/ascorbic acid (also known as vitamin C) and sodium
      sulfate in combination with PEG 3350 enable a reduction in the volume of the PEG-based lavage
      solution.

      NER1006 has a dual formulation containing an initial majority PEG dose followed by a majority
      ascorbate dose to maximise the overall effectiveness. This novel formulation addresses the
      challenges faced by patients to comply with drinking higher volume, 2 and 3 L, preparations.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is systemic exposure to components of the
      NER1006 formulation.
