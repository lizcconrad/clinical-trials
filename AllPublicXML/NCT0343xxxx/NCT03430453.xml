  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is define the minimal intensity of stimulation range at which the
      needle is closed to the nerve without penetrating its surface (epineurium layer) in
      ultrasound guided peripheral nerve blockade
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The needle is placed at the target under ultrasound guidance the nerve stimulator is turned
      on and the intensity increased until motor response is observed the Minimum Intensity
      Observation (MIS) is recorded before injection of local anesthetic

    <time_frame>estimated between 2 minutes and 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Minimal Intensity Stimulation (MIS) was measured Using a specific nerve stimulator (modified HNS 12 B. BRAUN, Melsungen, Germany) ; the value are noted in mA. [0- 1.5].
The time frame is only related to procedure of PNB. In other term, the period of assessment should be estimated between 2 minutes and 20 minutes.</description>

    <time_frame>estimated between 2 minutes and 20 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue pressure at the target was measured Using a specific pressure sensor (compuflow pump Milestone Scientific, Livingston, NJ, USA) ; the value are noted in mm Hg. [0- 900].
