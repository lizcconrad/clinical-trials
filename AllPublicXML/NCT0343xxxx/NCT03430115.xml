  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with significant declines in muscle mass, strength, and physical
      performance, all of which lead to disability, loss of independence, and adverse clinical
      outcomes. Obesity exacerbates these age-related declines in function and is associated with
      poorer clinical outcomes and quality of life. Weight loss can also worsen age-related loss of
      muscle mass and decrease bone mineral density. The overall goals of this study are to
      determine if the short-term functional benefits of intentional weight loss are sustained
      long-term, and to examine the long-term benefits and risks of weight loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity exacerbates age-related declines in function and is associated with poorer clinical
      outcomes and quality of life. Although clinical trials conducted study teams show that
      diet-induced weight loss interventions in obese older adults, when combined with exercise,
      improve body composition and physical and metabolic function in the short-term, the overall
      safety and long-term benefits of intentional weight loss in older adults remain
      controversial. Weight loss can also worsen age-related loss of muscle mass and decrease bone
      mineral density. Because of these concerns, health care providers are reluctant to recommend
      weight loss in obese older adults. The goal is to determine whether weight loss-induced
      improvements in body composition and physical and metabolic function observed in short-term
      clinical trials persist over time is critical to inform geriatric obesity treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Aerobic fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the 400-meter walk. Participants are instructed to complete the 400 m distance (on a flat indoor surface) as quickly as possible at a maintainable pace and the time to complete the walk is recorded in seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (expSPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (expSPPB) is a modified version of a widely used assessment of lower extremity physical function that consists of 3 standing balance tasks held for 10 seconds each (side-by-side, tandem and semi-tandem), two 4-m walk tests to assess usual gait speed, and 5 repeated chair stands. To minimize ceiling effects and maximize overall dispersion of test scores, the eSPPB increases the holding time of the semi- and full-tandem stands to 30 seconds and adds a single leg stand and a narrow walk test of balance (walking at usual pace within lines of tape spaced 20 cm apart). eSPPB scores are continuous and range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicative of better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six minute walk distance test (6MWD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>

    <measure>Volumetric bone mineral density</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Helical CT scans of the lumbar spine and hip/pelvis will be used to measure volumetric bone mineral density. The scan coverage for the lumbar spine will be from the top of L1 through the base of L5. The hip/pelvis scan will cover the region from the superior acetabulum to mid-femur.
