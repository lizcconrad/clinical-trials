  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will address impaired emotion regulation in adolescents with ASD (autism
      spectrum disorder). There are no evidence-based interventions to improve emotion regulation
      (ER) in this population, yet poor emotion regulation often leads to maladaptive behavior and
      substantially impedes capacity to learn and function across all life settings, and reduce
      their quality of life and that of their families. The primary objective of this study is to
      formally evaluate efficacy of EASE via a sufficiently powered, two-site randomized-controlled
      trial (RCT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study is to test a new intervention called Emotional Awareness and Skills
      Enhancement (EASE). This program was designed to address ASD-specific obstacles to effective
      emotion regulation, such as reduced awareness concerning others' intentions, a limited
      repertoire of behavioral responses, and inadequate language for understanding emotional
      experiences. This new program is based on an acceptance-based approach in which awareness of
      emotion is developed, emotions (whether negative or positive) are accepted, and behavior is
      regulated in the face of intense emotion. The goal is not to learn to avoid negative
      emotions, but rather to develop a collection of abilities which allow the individual to
      manage stress and act in ways that are more adaptive. The investigators expect to find that
      participants' emotion dysregulation will decrease and their adaptive function will increase
      following completion of the EASE program.

    <measure>Emotion Dysregulation Inventory Reactivity Scale Short Form (EDI-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>The EDI-SF will be completed at 16 weeks (post-treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>The EDI SF is a measure of emotional reactivity and regulation. The EDI SF is based on theta scores, with a mean of 0 and SD of 1 and possible range from -1.99 to 2.105. Higher scores suggest greater dysregulation, so improvement would be measured by a decrease in scores.</description>

    <measure>The Clinical Global Impression Scale- Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>The CGI-I will be completed at 16 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I will be used as a measure of overall improvement. The CGI-I (Improvement) scale was designed to measure overall symptomatic change at a specific time as compared to baseline that is completed by a rater who is blind to treatment assignment. Scores range from 1 (Very Much Improved) to 4 (Unchanged) to 7 (Very Much Worse). It is only a single item, and lower scores indicate more improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The CGI-I will be completed at 16 weeks (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is an interview-based measure of psychopathology severity widely used in clinical trials. It consists of 24 items that measure psychiatric symptoms, each of which are on a 1 (not reported) to 7 (very severe) scale, so that lower scores are an indication of improvement. An assignment naïve rater scores the items based upon client report and clinical observation. All scales ask about symptoms over the last 7 days. The single item on &quot;Global Improvement&quot; will be used.</description>

    <description>EASE Therapy includes 16 weekly sessions. Sessions include mindfulness exercise, review of prior content, practicing prior skills, outline of current session, discussion of the new skill, handouts, practice and plan for out of session practice. The investigators will apply a multimodal teaching approach, where individual therapy is buttressed by parent involvement, practice sessions in the youth's community, and technology-based supports/teaching aids. A secure website developed for this project (emotion-Coach or &quot;e-Coach&quot;) will augment the intervention by providing online supports to increase treatment intensity or dosage. There will be specific information on how to reinforce the skills at home and in the community. eCoach usage will be monitored so that the investigators can evaluate its influence on outcome.</description>

    <description>Supportive Therapy will include 16 weekly sessions. Each session will include the same discussion about emotions and stressful situations and problem-solving with counselor. Supportive Therapy will involve attending 16 weekly therapy sessions held in Webster Hall in Pittsburgh or at the Child Study Center in Blacksburg. The intervention will not involve mindfulness, but other forms of stress management or problem-solving may be utilized. This program does not have an online component.</description>
