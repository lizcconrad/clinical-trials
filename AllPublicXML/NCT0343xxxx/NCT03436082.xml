  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to pilot the feasibility of using a novel patient-led, smartphone-based
      mobile health platform (Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes of patients after they
      undergo a bariatric surgical procedure (either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) and
      catheter-based atrial fibrillation ablation

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plan is to pilot test a novel patient-led, smartphone-based mobile health platform
      (called Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes in 60 total patients after medical
      device use. Research associates will be recruiting patients before they undergo a bariatric
      surgical procedure (either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) and catheter-based atrial
      fibrillation ablation. Patients will then be queried about specific symptoms related to their
      procedure. Patients will also be given syncable devices to use that will provide additional
      insights into their health and health outcomes. This pilot project will engage patients to
      report outcomes while also synchronizing data from their electronic health records and
      pharmacy accounts to ascertain the ability of emerging mobile health technologies to aid in
      post-marketing surveillance.

    <description>Feasibility of the mobile platform will be assessed from data collected from patients who received a sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass. If a patient refuses to participate, the number of people who refused will be noted. If the patient is agreeable, a short questionnaire will be administered to understand the patient's rationale for not participating in the study, to understand potential reasons for non-participation. People who chose not to participate will be asked about basic demographics, if they are willing to answer (age, sex, race/ethnicity, major co-morbidities, insurance status).</description>

Finally, at the end of the pilot study (i.e. at 8 weeks post-procedure), study participants will be called by the research associate and asked to complete a close-out questionnaire to determine their satisfaction with the process of answering queries and provide the opportunity for them to offer comments and suggestions for improvement. The patient will also be asked at what health systems they received care over the past 8 weeks (including hospitalization, emergency department visit, repeat procedure), to assess if all pertinent data was captured in Hugo.</description>

        A patient's eligibility will first be determined by the implanting physician who will be
        performing the catheter-based atrial fibrillation ablation or bariatric surgical procedure
        (either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass). The criterion used will simply be the
        cardiac electrophysiologist stating that the patient is being seen pre-procedurally for
        catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation or the bariatric surgeon stating that the patient
        is being seen pre-operatively for sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass.
