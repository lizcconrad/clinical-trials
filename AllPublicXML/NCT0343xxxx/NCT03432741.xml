  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of direct tumor microinjection and
      fludeoxyglucose F-18 positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in testing drug sensitivity in
      patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, or stage IV breast cancer that has
      returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Injecting tiny
      amounts of anti-cancer drugs directly into tumors on the skin or in lymph nodes and
      diagnostic procedures, such as FDG-PET, may help to show which drugs work better in treating
      patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, or breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of in vivo in host drug sensitivity testing in patients with breast
      cancer and patients with lymphoma (nodal, extranodal or cutaneous lesions).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of in vivo in host drug sensitivity testing in this patient
      population.

      II. To identify targeted therapies with potential activity in relapsed lymphoma and
      metastatic breast cancer.

      III. To evaluate the adverse event profile within each patient population.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for apoptosis in response to intratumoral injection using known biomarkers
      (e.g., by morphology, Ki-67, caspace-3 assay as a marker of early apoptosis).

      II. To evaluate intratumoral biomarkers, intratumoral cell populations, and distribution,
      identify potential biomarkers that correlate with response to therapy based on individual
      therapies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo FDG-PET and receive saline intralesionally on day 1. Patients also receive
      up to five additional injections of gemcitabine hydrochloride, romidepsin, belinostat,
      carfilzomib, nivolumab, trastuzumab, daratumumab, obinutuzumab, pembrolizumab, or rituximab
      intralesionally per investigator on day 1. Beginning 5 days later, patients with nodal
      disease undergo restaging FDG-PET and biopsy (if clinically feasible). Within 3-7 days,
      patients with cutaneous disease undergo restaging FDG-PET, photography, and biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.

    <measure>Incidence of drug sensitivity as measured by injection site skin reaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Skin reactions will be assessed using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) active version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and will consist of any grade 3 or higher treatment-related pain, skin or subcutaneous tissue disorders. Incidence rates of skin reactions will be estimated by the number of patients with reactions divided by the total number of evaluable patients per disease type. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true incidence rate will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Feasibility defined as at least 70% of the enrolled patients complete the injection and response evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Nodal disease response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 days post injection</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as a decrease in standardized uptake value (SUV) uptake by 25% at site of injection.
