      1.Research hypothesis: during weaning patient from prolonged mechanical ventilation, if the
      work load caused by weaning was below the patient's AT, oxygen uptake will be constant.
      Otherwise, if the work load was above the patient's AT, the oxygen uptake will increase.

        1. Patient: who have tracheostomy tubes and with prolonged mechanical ventilation

        2. Measurement: oxygen uptake(V̇O2) and respiratory mechanics during the spontaneous
           breathing trials

        3. Outcome: Correlation between the oxygen uptake(V̇O2) and the weaning outcome

      2.Specific aims:

        1. to investigate the prognostic value of oxygen uptake in weaning patients from prolonged
           mechanical ventilation

        2. Subgroup analysis may suggest which weaning protocol potentially benefit the most for
           each population group (cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, neuromuscular
           disease, cerebrovascular disease)
