    <textblock>
      This study evaluates SPECT image data acquired from Spectrum Dynamics' multi-purpose CZT
      SPECT camera. All subjects will undergo routine clinical Anger SPECT imaging and an
      additional SPECT acquisition on the CZT SPECT camera. The quality of images from each device
      will be compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Spectrum Dynamics Multi-purpose CZT SPECT camera is a whole body SPECT (single photon
      emission computed tomography) scanner which utilises solid-state cadmium zinc telluride (CZT)
      detectors to visualise injected, or otherwise introduced, radioactivity in the human body.
      The CZT SPECT camera detects the location and distribution of gamma-emitting radionuclides in
      the body and produces 3 dimensional cross-sectional images through computed reconstruction of
      the data for the purpose of determining various metabolic and physiologic functions in the
      human body. In comparison to conventional sodium iodide (NaI) gamma camera (or Anger camera)
      technology, solid state CZT technology offers improved energy, spatial and temporal
      resolution, and higher count rates. Improvements in energy resolution and sensitivity thus
      enable the potential capability for enhanced quantification, simultaneous dual isotope
      imaging and dynamic imaging acquisition.
