  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the impact of maximizing patient and
      primary care provider (PCP) activation on breast cancer surveillance rates among women
      previously treated with chest radiotherapy (RT) for a childhood cancer. This is a 12-month,
      3-arm randomized controlled trial using a smartphone intervention with data being collected
      at baseline and 12-months through patient and provider surveys and medical record review.
      Eligible women treated for a childhood cancer with chest RT will be randomly sampled from the
      Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) and randomly selected to one of three groups: control,
      patient activation (PA) using a smartphone-based intervention, or patient activation +
      primary care provider activation (PA+PCP) which will include physician materials about breast
      cancer risk in this population along with guidelines for breast cancer surveillance.
      Participants in all groups will receive mailed targeted print materials as an educational
      resource about their previous chest radiation and breast cancer screening recommendations.
      The primary outcome is a medical record confirmed breast MRI and mammogram with the goal of
      increasing the rate of women completing the national guideline-based recommended combination
      of breast MRI and mammogram. This study will test the hypothesis that women in the PA and
      PA+PCP groups will have significantly higher rates of breast cancer surveillance (breast MRI
      and mammogram) than women in the control group. In addition, the hypothesis that women in the
      PA+PCP group will have significantly higher rates of breast cancer surveillance than women in
      the PA group will also be tested.

    <measure>Patient Activation Measure (PAM) - questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Measures patient activation and includes: believing one has an active role to play, having the confidence and knowledge to take action, taking action, and staying the course under stress.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Breast Cancer Surveillance Practices - Knowledge of Recommendations (questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Breast Cancer Surveillance Practices instrument (questionnaire) was developed as part of an effort supported by NCI funding (R21CA106972) and published in JAMA (Oeffinger KC, et al. JAMA, 301:404-414, 2009). The section regarding knowledge of the recommendations was then adapted for the EMPOWER-I Study, supported by NCI R01134722, and includes 3 items to determine if participants have (1) heard of mammography for breast cancer screening (yes, no, not sure), at what age women like the participant should begin getting a mammogram, and how frequently (multiple time frames).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Barrier scales (questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Elicits a rank order of the most relevant and important barriers of breast MRI and those associated with mammogram, for those women who did not obtain the recommended screening. The barriers are presented as a list of 13 statements in which there are 5 ranges of measure provided for each statement. The scale ranges include &quot;Not at all,&quot; &quot;A little bit,&quot; &quot;Moderately,&quot; &quot;Quite a bit,&quot; and &quot;Extremely.&quot; The value/response of &quot;Not at all&quot; is considered to be the better outcome, whereas the value/response of &quot;Extremely&quot; is considered to be the worst outcome for the barrier scale. The scale is not combined to compute a total score, since responses are scored for each statement individually.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pros and Cons of Mammography and Breast MRI (questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pros and Cons of mammography is a 13-item instrument developed by Rakowski et al (Prev Med 1997). It was used in our Breast Cancer Surveillance Practices instrument (Oeffinger KC, et al. JAMA, 2009). The pros and cons scores (5-point Likert items) are converted to T-scores and then presented as a summary Decisional Balance. For EMPOWER-I Study, we adapted this instrument to also assess a woman's perspective on the pros and cons of breast MRI. This resulted in a 7-item instrument that is analyzed similar to the Pros and Cons of Mammography and presented as a Decisional Balance.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Family history of breast cancer (questionnaire)</measure>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Perception of breast cancer risk (questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This item was developed for the aforementioned Breast Cancer Surveillance Practices instrument and is a one-time question with asking women how they estimate their risk of breast cancer (with five responses: much more than the average woman, more than the average woman, same as the average woman, less than the average woman, much less than the average woman).</description>

Each of these items will be analyzed separately.</description>
