      Comparison of intradevice repeatability of thickness measurements for macular area in the
      eyes with normal and various retinal diseases using SS-OCT and SD-OCT
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators studied the intradevice repeatability of thickness measurements for total
      retina, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform (GC-IPL) layers of
      macular area in the eyes with normal and various retinal diseases using SS-OCT and SD-OCT and
      compared the repeatability between two devices.
