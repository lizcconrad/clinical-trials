    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II single-arm open-label study of nivolumab as maintenance therapy after
      autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma at risk of relapse or
      progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of nivolumab as
      maintenance therapy early after autologous stem cell transplant in patients with Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma (HL).

      Eligible patients will receive nivolumab (240 mg IV) every 2 weeks (± 2 days as long as
      interval between doses is 12-16 days) starting 45-120 post-transplant for up to a maximum of
      6 months of treatment. Response to treatment will be assessed 6 months and 1 year
      post-transplant using Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response
      Assessment of Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification.

             treatment).

          -  Serious active infection at the time of treatment, or another serious underlying

             situ carcinoma (i.e., non-invasive) are eligible, as are patients with history of
             non-melanoma skin cancer.
