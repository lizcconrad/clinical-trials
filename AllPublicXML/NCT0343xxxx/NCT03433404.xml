    <textblock>
      Back pain is one of the most common complaints in pregnancy. It is caused by the growing
      pregnant abdomen which then strains the lower back and pelvis. Often Obstetricians recommend
      rest, Tylenol, pelvic support belts, or exercise. Typically, these do not provide the patient
      much relief. A physical therapy treatment known as soft tissue mobilization (tSTM) has been
      shown to be helpful in treating various types of pain. This study will explore whether tSTM
      can improve back pain in pregnancy.

      Context: Lumbopelvic pain is one of the most common complaints in pregnancy, as increasing
      hormone levels cause joint laxity and the gravid uterus weakens abdominal muscles and
      increases lumbar muscle strain. Obstetricians often recommend rest, exercise, heating pad
      application, acetaminophen, or pelvic support belts. Patients often complain of minimal
      relief from these recommendations. Many experience recurrent lumbopelvic pain in a subsequent
      pregnancy. Additionally, lumbopelvic pain can contribute to disability and sick leave during
      the pregnancy. This is the first study to investigate whether soft tissue mobilization
      improves lumbopelvic pain in the third trimester.

      Objective: To investigate whether a physical therapy intervention known as transverse
      friction massage or soft tissue mobilization improves third trimester pregnancy related
      lumbopelvic pain.

      Design: Randomized pre-test and post-test comparison group design. Setting: Texas Tech
      University Health Sciences Center, Center for Rehabilitation Research, Lubbock, TX, USA.

      Participants: 48 subjects between the 18-45 years of age with a singleton gestation in the
      third trimester with pregnancy related lumbopelvic pain.

      Methods: Subjects consented for the study will be diagnosed by the Obstetrician with PRLPP by
      clinical tests, including the posterior pelvic pain provocation test, active straight leg
      raise test, and the long dorsal sacroiliac ligament test. Subjects will be randomized to one
      of three groups: no manual treatment (noManRx), superficial massage (sMass), and soft tissue
      mobilization (tSTM). All groups will receive standard care, which includes acetaminophen,
      heating pad application, and/or rest. Subjective questionnaires including the numeric pain
      rating scale (NPRS), the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and the Global Rating of Change
      (GROC) will be administered for baseline prior to allocated intervention. The Pressure Pain
      Threshold (PPT) will be measured via algometry. Those receiving sMass and tSTM will receive
      prescribed standard care as well as sMass or tSTM every 1-2 weeks by an investigator as well
      as daily sMass or tSTM at home.

      Main outcome measures: (1) Pain using NPRS, (2) disability using ODI, (3) overall change in
      pain pre- and post-treatment using GROC, (4) pressure pain threshold via algometry.

      Expected results: It is anticipated that this soft tissue mobilization technique known as
      transverse friction massage will decrease lumbopelvic pain in the third trimester of
      pregnancy.

    <measure>Pain using NPRS (Numerical Pain Rating Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The NPRS is a scale from 0 to 10 that is commonly used to measure intensity of pain, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing extreme pain. It is easy to understand and complete that is also valid and reliable. Due to the nature of fluctuating intensity of pain, subjects will use a NPRS to log their current pain, least pain, and most pain each day at home and at the obstetric clinic before the respective treatment. The daily pain score will be averaged, then averaged across each week. The NPRS scores will be also be used to evaluate the change between the overall pain level at the beginning and end of subject's participation. The aim throughout the study is to see a reduction in the overall numerical pain scale rating. For example, if a patient comes in with a pain scale rating of 10, the hope is that after a series of treatments, the pain scale will go down to indicate an improvement in overall pain.</description>

    <measure>disability using ODI (Oswestry Disability Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Back pain and its effect on disability can be evaluated using the ODI. It is a brief 10 question survey on the effect of back pain on daily activities, such as personal care, walking, lifting, sitting, standing, sex life, social life, traveling. Each answer in each section is scored 0 to 5, 0 if the first box is checked (0 if it causes no disability) and 5 (maximal disability) if the last box is checked. The final score is expressed as a percentage out of a total score of 50. It is usually used for lumbar back pain, but has been shown to be specifically valid for sacroiliac joint pain. The ODI questionnaire will be filled out by subjects at the initial session and at the end of the final treatment session.</description>
