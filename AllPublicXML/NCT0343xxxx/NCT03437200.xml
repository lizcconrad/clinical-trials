  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the trial is to assess the feasibility and the safety of the addition
      of immunotherapy with PD-1 antibody nivolumab +/- CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab to concomitant
      chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in inoperable patients with early or locally advanced
      oesophageal cancer and to select the more promising experimental arm among the two possible
      combinations in terms of activity (based on progression free survival (PFS) at 12 months
      according to RECIST 1.1) for further evaluation in a phase III trial.

      The secondary objectives will aim to evaluate progression-free survival, failure-free
      survival and overall survival and pattern of progression (including incidence of distance
      metastasis).
