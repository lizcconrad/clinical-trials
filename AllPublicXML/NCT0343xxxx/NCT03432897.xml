  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate approximately 3 months of treatment with the drug olaparib in
      patients with prostate cancer. A capsule formulation of olaparib (tradename Lynparza™) is
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of women
      with advanced BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. Olaparib is an investigational drug in prostate
      cancer. A tablet formulation of olaparib is being tested in this study. It is a new
      formulation which is more convenient for patients than the approved capsule formulation
      because fewer tablets of olaparib need to be taken daily than with capsules.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether olaparib can reduce prostate cancer with
      defects in DNA repair genes when olaparib is given for approximately 3 months before surgery.
