    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS rate at 6 months is estimated based on the tumor response evaluation and is defined as the proportion of participants alive and progression-free at 6 months from the initial treatment of eribulin.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start date of therapy with eribulin to the date of disease progression or death from any cause (1 day to up to approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the start date of therapy with eribulin to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. Participants without progression will be censored, progression free at the date of late follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Time to treatment failure (TTF)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first treatment with eribulin to discontinuation of treatment for any reason (1 day to up to approximately 2 years)</time_frame>

    <measure>Tumor response rate (TRR)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the start date of therapy with eribulin to the date of death from any cause or last follow-up (1 day to up to approximately 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>TRR will be evaluated by medical records. ORR is defined as the sum of obtained PR and CR and the clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the sum of PR, CR and stable disease (SD) maintained for at least six months. Disease control rate (DCR) is defined as the sum of PR, CR and SD.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with any treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the medicinal product. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>
