      Background When it is severe, hypotension compromises tissue perfusion and organ function,
      leading to multiple organ failure and death. Commonly in intensive care units (ICUs),
      excessive vasodilation causes hypotension. In response, clinicians administer vasopressors to
      induce vasoconstriction and thereby raise blood pressure. However, these medications may
      reduce blood flow to vital organs, including the heart, and therefore damage them. Titrating
      vasopressors therefore requires balancing the risks of organ dysfunction arising from
      vasopressors or hypotension. Current guidelines recommend titrating vasopressors to a mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) 65 mmHg. By not specifying an upper limit, guidelines and clinicians
      put more emphasis on preventing hypotension than on minimizing vasopressor exposure.
      Permissive hypotension, defined as a MAP target below traditional levels, may reduce
      vasopressor-induced harm while avoiding organ dysfunction induced by severe hypotension.

      Work by the investigators group Observational data from the investigators group show that the
      average MAP in Canadian patients on vasopressors is 75 mmHg, 10 mmHg above current guideline
      recommendations and self-reported practices.The recent CIHR-funded OVATION pilot RCT (n=118)
      of permissive hypotension met feasibility objectives of demonstrating a separation in mean
      MAP between arms (9 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001) and enrolling patients efficiently (2.3
      patients/site/month). Investigators have also completed an individual patient data
      meta-analysis with the French SEPSISPAM trial and found that a lower MAP target may be
      beneficial in patients 65 years old.

      Objective The OVATION-65 RCT will evaluate the effect of permissive hypotension vs. usual
      care in patients 65 years old with vasodilatory hypotension treated with vasopressors for ≤12
      hours on the co-primary outcomes of myocardial injury (high sensitivity cardiac troponin
      [cTn], a validated marker of myocardial injury and powerful prognostic factor in ICU
      patients) and 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes will include other end-organ biomarkers.
      Investigators hypothesize that permissive hypotension will reduce organ injury and death.

      Methods Eligible patients will be randomized to target MAP 60-65 mmHg vs. usual care.
      Investigators selected usual care to avoid protocol misalignment with standard practices and
      after ascertaining contemporary vasopressor use in Canada, which suggests that the risk of
      contamination is low. Investigators will enroll 200 patients in 5 Canadian ICUs. The deferred
      consent model will be adopted, successfully used in the pilot trial. Risk of bias will be
      minimized by allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, complete hospital
      follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis.

      Relevance This RCT proposal is embedded in the international OVATION65 program of research,
      which includes the ongoing NIHR-funded UK65 Trial, designed by the investigators group, which
      measures 90-day mortality as the primary outcome. The pooled analysis of both RCTs will be
      powered to detect a plausible difference of 6% in mortality. The proposed Canadian OVATION65
      RCT will be the only trial that measures organ injury biomarkers, providing crucial clinical
      information regardless of the effect on mortality. Results will be incorporated into
      guidelines to inform practice worldwide.
