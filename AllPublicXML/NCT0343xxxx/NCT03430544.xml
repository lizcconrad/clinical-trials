  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to examine whether
      cariprazine (1.5 or 3 mg/d) 1) alters brain and/or behavioral responses to probes of reward
      and inhibition and 2) decreases cocaine use in individuals with cocaine use disorder.
      Subjects will be tested as inpatients during fMRI and behavioral task sessions. Study
      medication will continue for 8 outpatient weeks, during which time cocaine use will be
      tracked. Subjects will be monitored during a 4-wk followup phase thereafter.

    <description>Cariprazine Groups (1.5 or 3mg/d): Cariprazine (VRAYLAR) capsules will be administered orally, once per day. Subjects in the 1.5mg group will receive 1 VRAYLAR capsule containing 1.5 mg cariprazine each day that study drug is administered. Subjects in the 3 mg group will be gradually titrated up to full dose: they will receive 1 VRAYLAR capsule containing 1.5mg cariprazine on the first and second days that study drug is administered and will receive 1 VRAYLAR capsule containing 3mg cariprazine each day for the rest of the medication period. The study medication period begins during the inpatient phase and ends on the last day of outpatient treatment week 8 (approx. 10 weeks total). All VRAYLAR capsules will be over-encapsulated by the University of Pennsylvania Investigational Drug Services (IDS).</description>
