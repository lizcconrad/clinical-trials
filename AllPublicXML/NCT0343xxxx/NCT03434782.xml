      the hypothesis that they may control dental sensitivity.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this double blind, randomized and controlled clinical study, was to evaluate
      the efficacy of potassium nitrate / sodium fluoride (KNO3 / KF) gel associated with LLLT (Low
      Level Light Therapy) on teeth that were exposed to 35% hydrogen peroxide during 3 weeks of
      bleaching treatment. Methods: 50 volunteers were evaluated through the split-mouth model,
      where the hemiarcates were randomized and later allocated in one of the experimental groups:
      G1 (negative control)- group with no desensitizing treatment, only bleached; G2 (positive
      control)- group treated with LLLT + placebo gel; G3- group treated with placebo laser
      application + 5% KNO3 / 2% KF gel; and G4- group treated with LLLT + 5% KNO3 / 2% KF gel.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stimulated pain intensity in different assessment times (P15)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days, with assessments in the 1st, 8th and 15th day of the treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The stimulated pain intensity was self reported by the patients with a modified visual analog scale, from 0 to 3, where 0 means &quot;no pain&quot;, 1 is &quot;mild pain&quot;, 2 is &quot;moderate pain&quot; and 3 is &quot;severe pain&quot;. For all groups, the patients evaluated the stimulated pain intensity two times per session: before and after the treatment in the same day. Thus, in total each patient reported the pain intensity 6 times, two times in the first day (1st session), two times in the eighth day (2nd session) and two times in the fifteenth day (3rd session).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non-stimulated pain intensity measure, (P21)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Self reported non-stimulated pain intensity was assessed daily, during 21 days, through self-perception questionnaire, answered by the patients from the first tooth bleaching session until one week after the last session. The evaluation was performed by each patient, according to a modified visual analog scale, as follows: 0- no pain, 1 mild pain, 2 - moderate pain and 3 -severe pain</description>
