      To evaluate the effect of hemodialysis on various ophthalmologic parameters in patients with
      end-stage kidney disease (ESRD).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects: patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis at the Dialysis Center of Hanyang Guri
      Hospital

      Ocular parameters: visual acuity, intraocular pressure, axial length, OCT Other systemic
      parameters: body weight, ultrafiltration volume, and systolic/diastolic blood pressure

      All measurements were performed near the dialysis center. Measurements were performed on
      Monday (for patients who underwent dialysis sessions on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) or
      Tuesday (for patients who underwent dialysis sessions on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

      All parameters were measured before and after the hemodialysis.
