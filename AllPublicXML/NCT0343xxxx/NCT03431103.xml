  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overlap syndrome (OS), i.e. the association of both Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) in a single Veteran, is prevalent and associated
      with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity. Home-based exercise interventions that
      translate to a lifestyle with increased physical activity (PA) are an ideal strategy as 150
      minutes of leisure time PA a week is associated with a significant reduction in risk of CVD
      related events and death. This novel research study will help develop a home exercise
      intervention that is largely accepted by OS Veterans, as a first step toward implementing PA
      into the routine medical care of the large Veteran population with COPD and OSA. This data
      will be used for larger studies on CVD risk and its modification with exercise in OS, a
      research area that is urgently needed given its high impact on Veterans' morbidity, mortality
      and health-care associated costs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term &quot;overlap syndrome&quot; (OS) is used to describe the association of both chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea disease (OSA) in a single
      Veteran. Given the high prevalence of both COPD and OSA, it is expected that a third of
      Veterans with OSA could be affected by OS. Importantly, Veterans with OS have a higher
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than either OSA or COPD-only Veterans, likely due to
      worse nocturnal hypoxia and subsequent inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Therefore,
      therapy for Veterans with OS that decreases cardiovascular disease (CVD) by targeting
      inflammation is a high priority. Home-based exercise interventions that translate to a
      lifestyle with increased physical activity (PA) are an ideal strategy as 150 minutes of
      leisure time PA a week is associated with reduction in risk of CVD-related events and death.
      Further, PA decreases biomarkers of systemic inflammation. However, no data is available on
      the effect of exercise on biomarkers of systemic inflammation in Veterans with OS. It is
      difficult to increase the leisure time PA in adults with COPD and OSA as this population is
      more sedentary due to a combination of increased obesity, daytime sleepiness and dyspnea.
      Therefore, home-based exercise would be ideal for these Veterans. The objective of this
      proposal is to conduct a single arm 12-week home-based exercise pilot intervention to
      determine the effect on biomarkers of systemic inflammation in 50 Veterans with OS on CPAP.
      The investigator hypothesizes that 1) Baseline PA intensity and duration will correlate
      inversely with the biomarkers of systemic inflammation independently of nocturnal hypoxia;
      and 2) Exercise training using a home-based computer exercise program will decrease
      biomarkers of systemic inflammation and increase exercise capacity in Veterans.

    <description>Patients will be instructed to use the Wii Fit for 20 minutes at least twice a week for 12 weeks using specific Wii Fit exercises while on the Wii pressure sensor floor mat. The Wii Fit exercises will be as follows: 1.&quot; Basic Run&quot; (warm-up exercise by walking in place); 2.&quot;Bird's Eye, Bull's-Eye&quot; (mostly arms, requires arm flipping); 3.&quot;Free Step&quot; (lower extremity exercise); 4.&quot;Hula Hoop&quot; (gyration exercise)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Veterans from the Salem VAMC pulmonary clinics will be screened for a diagnosis of OSA
             and treatment with CPAP therapy. In addition, an inclusion criterion also will be a

             are compliant with CPAP therapy will be enrolled in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
