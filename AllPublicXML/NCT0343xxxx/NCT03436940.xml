    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve discharge planning effectiveness by comparing two
      strategies [on-Demand Discharge Planning (DDP) vs. Routine Discharge Planning (RDP)], in
      terms of reduction of hospital readmissions for inpatients classified at intermediate risk of
      complex discharge using the simplified Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score (BRASS).

      The purpose of this study is to improve discharge planning effectiveness by comparing two
      strategies [on-Demand Discharge Planning (DDP) vs. Routine Discharge Planning (RDP)], in
      terms of reduction of hospital readmissions for inpatients classified at intermediate risk of
      complex discharge using the simplified Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score (BRASS).

      Five Internal Medicine Unit and four Units of Neurology will be randomized to the two
      different strategies of discharge planning (RDP or DDP), based on two different alternating
      sequences of four periods (each period comprising three months). The randomization will be
      stratified by type of unit.

      Patients at risk of complex discharge, according to the simplified BRASS score, are assigned
      to the Hospital Unit of Continuity of Care (NOCC) team, using the hospital telematics system.
      Afterwards, the NOCC team proposes an appropriate discharge planning, considering clinical
      and social needs.

    <description>Proportion of hospital admissions in the standard admission regime within 90 days from the date of discharge. The endpoint will be calculated only for patients discharged alive.

An admission will be considered as LLOS if its duration will be higher than the 90th specific percentile for Diagnostic Related Group (DRG ) detected at the regional level in Piedmont in 2016.</description>
