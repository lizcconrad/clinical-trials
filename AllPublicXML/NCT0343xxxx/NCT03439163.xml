  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has frequently been used to
      investigate local spontaneous brain activity in Parkinson's disease (PD) in a whole-brain,
      voxel-wise manner. To quantitatively integrate these studies, we conducted a coordinate-based
      meta-analysis on 15 studies that used amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and 11
      studies that used regional homogeneity (ReHo). All these ALFF and ReHo studies have compared
      PD patients with healthy controls. We also performed a validation RS-fMRI study of ALFF and
      ReHo in a frequency-dependent manner for a novel dataset consisting of PD and healthy
      controls.

      Seed-based d Mapping (formerly Signed Differential Mapping, SDM) software (version 5.141 for
      Windows) (www.sdmproject.com) was used for meta-analysis.

      For the validation, fMRI data were acquired on a 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance scanner (Trio
      system; Siemens Magnetom scanner, Erlangen, Germany) with gradient-echo echo-plannar imaging
      sequences. Whole brain fMRI scanning was carried out. All participants were instructed to
      keep their eyes closed, relax, remain motionless, not think of anything in particular, and
      not fall asleep. Foam pads were used to minimize head motion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The PD diagnoses were based on the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Clinical
             Diagnostic Criteria. Patients were assessed using the UPDRS III and Hoehn and Yahr
             disability scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. history of head trauma, 2. substance abuse, 3. psychiatric disorder. For healthy
             controls, additional exclusion criteria included

               1. any history of neuropsychiatric disorders.
