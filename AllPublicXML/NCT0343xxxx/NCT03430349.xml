      This first-in-human (FIH) phase 1 study is designed to evaluate in contained conditions the
      safety, immunogenicity, shedding and genetic stability of both nOPV2 vaccine candidates in
      IPV-primed adults before testing in a larger adult and adolescent (&gt; 15 y of age) population,
      and then in young children and infants. The primary objectives of the subsequent Phase 1 and
      2 studies will include the general safety, the shedding and genetic stability of the two
      candidate vaccines, primarily based on comparison with historical data obtained in the Phase
      4 studies of Sabin mOPV2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two nOPV2 vaccine candidates have been developed as attenuated serotype 2 polioviruses
      derived from a modified Sabin 2 infectious cDNA clone. nOPV2 Candidate 1
      (S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3) and nOPV2 Candidate 2 (S2/S15domV/CpG40) were generated by
      modifying the Sabin‚Äê2 RNA sequence to improve phenotypic stability and make the strains less
      prone to reversion to virulence.

      Due to the withdrawal of Sabin mOPV2 and prohibition of its use from April 2016 onwards, well
      before the availability of nOPV2 for clinical testing, Phase 4 trials have been conducted
      with Sabin mOPV2 to provide control data on safety, immunogenicity, against which data for
      nOPV2 in subsequent Phase I and II studies will be evaluated and compared. The Phase 4 trials
      of Sabin mOPV2 were designed to parallel the expected design of the Phase 1 and 2 nOPV2
      studies with respect to overall design, inclusion of similar study cohorts. As for these
      reasons head to head comparison of nOPV2 and mOPV2 is not possible, the overall clinical
      development plan with the Phase I and II studies was designed taking into consideration the
      unique situation of OPV2 cessation in April 2016, and the global public health need of a
      vaccine with lower risk of VAPP and VDPV2 for outbreak response in the post-cessation era.

      This first-in-human (FIH) phase 1 study is designed to evaluate in contained conditions the
      safety, immunogenicity, shedding and genetic stability of both nOPV2 vaccine candidates in
      IPV-primed adults before testing in a larger adult and adolescent (&gt; 15 y of age) population,
      and then in young children and infants. The primary objectives of the subsequent Phase 1 and
      2 studies will include the general safety, the shedding and genetic stability of the two
      candidate vaccines, primarily based on comparison with historical data obtained in the Phase
      4 studies of Sabin mOPV2.

      The novel vaccine is expected to be eventually e licensed based on 3 criteria: non-inferior
      safety to the currently licensed mOPV2 of the Sabin strain, non-inferior immunity, less
      reversion to virulence and less shedding in stool. As all comparisons are to be made to the
      licensed vaccine, a placebo arm was not included in the Phase IV studies or in this study as
      it does not add value for licensure.

      This Phase 1 study will include 30 IPV-only vaccinated adults to be vaccinated with the study
      vaccines (15 subjects per candidate vaccine) and followed in contained conditions (28 days)
      to obtain safety, immunogenicity, shedding and genetic stability data relevant to the
      decision to advance to future studies with testing in un-contained conditions in adults (OPV-
      and IPV-primed), adolescent (IPV-primed) and children who have not been exposed to OPV2. The
      study is designed to first obtain safety data from an adult population which is IPV primed,
      without prior exposure to OPV2, before moving into larger groups of OPV-primed as well as
      IPV-primed individuals.

      Objectives:

      The primary objectives of the study are

        -  to assess safety (serious adverse events [SAEs] and severe adverse events [AEs]) of
           nOPV2 candidate 1 and nOPV2 candidate 2;

        -  to assess viral shedding following nOPV2 candidate 1 and nOPV2 candidate 2
           administration in all stool samples.

      Secondary objectives are to assess

        -  safety (any solicited and unsolicited AEs (including SAE and severe AE)), laboratory
           assessments) of nOPV2 candidate 1 and nOPV2 candidate 2;

        -  immunogenicity (seroprotection rate, seroconversion rate, median antibody titer
           (post-vaccination)) of nOPV2 candidate 1 and nOPV2 candidate 2;

        -  neurovirulence of shed virus (as measured in animal model(s)) in a subset of stool
           samples of all subjects.

      Exploratory objectives are

        -  to assess immunogenicity (geometric mean titer [GMT]) of nOPV2 candidate 1 and nOPV2
           candidate 2;

        -  to assess the genetic stability, including but not limited to the modified regions of
           shed virus in a subset of stool samples of all subjects;

        -  to assess viral shedding following nOPV2 candidate 1 or nOPV2 candidate 2 administration
           in nasopharyngeal swabs of all subjects.

      Overview of Study Design:

      This will be a single center, blinded study in 30 healthy IPV-only vaccinated adults (age
      range 18 to 50 years) as follows:

        -  15 subjects to receive 1 dose of nOPV2 candidate 1 (Group 1);

        -  15 subjects to receive 1 dose of nOPV2 candidate 2 (Group 2). Subjects who will pass
           screening but for any reason will drop out before vaccination will be defined as
           screen-failures and will be replaced.

           15 subjects will be evaluated for the 1-dose regimen nOPV2 candidate 1 (Group 1).

           15 subjects will be evaluated for the 1-dose regimen nOPV2 candidate 2 (Group 2).

    <masking_description>the study will be conducted with each candidate vaccine sequentially. After randomization of the first subject of Group 1 the next 14 subjects will all be enrolled in the same Group and receive the same nOPV2 candidate and the next 15 subjects will be enrolled in the other Group and receive the corresponding nOPV2 candidate. Prior to the start of the study the CRO will provide the site with 2 randomization envelopes for the first subject. By randomly choosing 1 of the envelopes first subject will be dedicated to a certain nOPV2 candidate and this will determine the allocation of the next 14 subjects to the same Group.
Study staff will be blinded in the same way and will be blinded for individual shedding results of the participants of a Group until end of containment of this Group.</masking_description>
