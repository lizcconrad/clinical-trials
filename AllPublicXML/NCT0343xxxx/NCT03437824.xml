  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to assess if vitamin B12 treatment demonstrates a
      beneficial effect on voice performance. If so, they wish to examine the relationship between
      the vitamin B12 treatment and the study participant's general well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through the investigators' experience, they have observed that amongst singers and voice
      professionals, there is a common belief that there are voice benefits from cobalamin
      treatment. Consequently, some singers and voice professionals tend to ask for cobalamin
      injections in order to enhance their vocal performance. However, there are no previous
      reports that illustrate the effects of vitamin B12 deficiency or treatment on voice
      performance.
