      Prospective, randomized, single-blind study, whether perioperative educational improves
      pain-related postoperative outcomes,

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind study in 100 patients undergoing open
      colorectal surgery. If the hypothesis is confirmed, then patients who receive perioperative
      educational interventions to address their expectation about their postoperative pain will
      have improved pain-related postoperative outcomes.

      Randomization and Blinding 100 eligible patients scheduled to undergo open colorectal surgery
      will be approached in the Center for Preoperative Assessment and Planning Clinic. At
      enrollment, each patient will be assigned a study number, which will match a previously
      prepared computer-generated list of randomization numbers to determine whether they will be
      in the intervention or control arm. Pre-operatively, all patients will complete an initial
      questionnaire. The patients in the intervention group (n=50) will, in addition to the
      standard pre-operative assessment, also receive pre-operative educational instruction of what
      to expect from a post-operative pain perspective including education material to take home.

      For this study, deception will be used, with the reasoning that the patients' knowledge of
      the different education materials will affect their rating of the impact of the intervention
      on satisfaction scores.
