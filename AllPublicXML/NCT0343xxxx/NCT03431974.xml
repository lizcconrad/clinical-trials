    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the treatment of psoriasis with aminopterin. Participants will be
      treated for 14 weeks with either aminopterin or placebo followed. The participants will not
      know if they are being treated with aminopterin or placebo.

    <textblock>
      A Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling
      subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis to investigate the safety and efficacy of
      LD-aminopterin (AMT) (3 mg (six 0.5 mg tablets). Forty-six subjects will be randomized to one
      of two parallel treatment arms: LD-AMT (3 mg) or placebo, in a 1:1 ratio. The endpoint
      analysis will include efficacy and safety. Randomized subjects will initially enter a 14-week
      treatment phase, followed by a 6-week post-treatment phase.

    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) (Efficacy)</measure>
    <time_frame>98 days.</time_frame>
    <description>As follows:
Area of Involvement. Determine a score, from 0 to 6, for each body section (head, trunk, upper limbs, lower limbs) based on the percent of psoriasis skin involvement: 0=0%, 1=&lt;10%, 2=10% to &lt;30%, 3=30% to &lt;50%, 4=50% to &lt;70%, 5=70% to &lt;90%, 6=90% to 100%.
Severity of Involvement. Determine a score, from 0 to 4, for each body section (head, trunk, upper limbs, lower limbs), for the psoriatic skin severity of each of erythema, thickness, and scaling: 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe. For each body section the three severity scores are summed.
For each body section the product of the Area and Severity is determined.
For each body section the product of line 3 is multiplied by an Area Factor (head=0.1, trunk=0.3, upper limbs=0.2, lower limbs=0.4).
A PASI score is determined by summing the 4 body section products (line 4). The highest possible score=72; the lowest possible score=0. The higher the scores, the worse the psoriasis.</description>

    <description>As follows:
Induration. A score, from 0 to 5, based on: 0=No plaque elevation; 1= Minimal plaque elevation=0.25 mm; 2=Mild plaque elevation=0.5 mm; 3=Moderate plaque elevation=0.75 mm; 4=Marked plaque elevation=1.0 mm; 5=Severe plaque elevation&gt;1.25 mm.
Erythema. A score, from 0 to 5, based on: 0=No erythema, hyperpigmentation may be present; 1=Faint erythema; 2=Light red coloration; 3=Moderate red coloration; 4=Bright red coloration; 5=Dusky to deep red coloration.
Scaling. A score, from 0 to 5, based on: 0= No scaling; 1=Minimal; occasional fine scale on&lt;5% of the lesion; 2=Mild; fine scale predominates; 3=Moderate; coarse scale predominates; 4=Marked; thick, non-tenacious scale predominates; 5=Severe; very thick, tenacious scale predominates.
The sPGA: Induration, Erythema, and Scaling scores are rounded to the nearest whole number and averaged. 0=Cleared; 1=Minimal; 2=Mild; 3=Moderate; 4=Marked; 5=Severe. Higher score indicates worse psoriasis.</description>
