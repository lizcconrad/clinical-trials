  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ARMD is the main cause of visual disability after 50 years old in France. Patients with
      active neovascular ARMD are treated with intravitreal injections of antiVEGF. Reinjections
      criteria are decrease of best corrected visual acuity or active neovascularization's signs
      (mostly found on macular OCT but also on angiography when necessary).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the link between active neovascularization found on OCT
      and eye fixation quality measured with microperimetry in ARMD patients treated with antiVEGF.

      Quality of eye fixation and exudative signs presents or not present on OCT will be gathered
      at each consultation over the two-years follow-up for each patient. The mean central retinal
      sensitivity, the best corrected visual acuity and the bivariate contour ellipse area will
      also be gathered.

      In case no link will be found, for instance bad fixation quality without exudative signs on
      OCT or good fixation stability despite exudative signs on OCT, microperimetry should have an
      interest to improve reinjections criteria with a treatment more suitable to the patient.

    <description>quality of eye fixation and exudative signs presents or not present on OCT will be gathered at each consultation over the two-years follow-up.
The fixation stability is classified as follows:
Stable if more than 75% of the fixation points are contained inside the circle of 2 degrees of diameter
Relatively unstable if more than 75% of the fixation points are contained within the circle of 4 degrees of diameter and less than 75% contained within that of 2 degrees of diameter
Unstable if less than 75% of the fixation points are contained within the circle of 4 degrees of diameter</description>
