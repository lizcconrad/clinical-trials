      This randomized study aims at comparing between the effects of amantadine, citcholine and its
      combinations on arousal and behavioral consequences in early phase of moderate Traumatic
      Brain injury (TBI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As both agents amantadine and citcholine showed considerable effects on neuro-recovery from
      TBI, The investigators hypothesized that combination therapy of both drugs will have
      significant effect as it simultaneously will target multiple mechanisms of injury. So, this
      randomized study aims at comparing between the effects of amantadine, citcholine and their
      combinations on arousal and behavioral consequences in early phase of moderate TBI

    <measure>Galsgow coma scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological scale which aims to give a reliable and objective way of recording the conscious state of a person for initial as well as subsequent assessment. A patient is assessed against the criteria of the scale, and the resulting points give a patient score between 3 (indicating deep unconsciousness) and 15 (full conscious).</description>

    <measure>disability rating scale (DRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Disability Rating Scale (DRS) was developed and tested with older juvenile and adult individuals with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The maximum score a patient can obtain on the DRS is 29 (extreme vegetative state). A person without disability would score zero. The DRS rating must be reliable, i.e., obtained while the individual is not under the influence of anesthesia, other mind-altering drugs, recent seizure, or recovering from surgical anesthesia.</description>

    <measure>Mini Mental scale (MMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment.
Any score greater than or equal to 24 points (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (â‰¤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-23 points) cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 1 gram (2 vials of citicholine; each 500 mg) every 12 hours given slowly intravenous over 10 minutes for 7 days then oral form of the drug will be used. Participants who can swallow will receive 500-mg (5ml volume; 100mg/ml) oral drops (syrup) twice a day. Participants who cannot swallow will receive the same dose as oral drops syrup of citicoline through a nasogastric (NG) tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube in a total dose of 1000 mg/day for the remainder of the 30 days study period.</description>

Participants who can swallow will receive two 100-mg tablets twice a day. Participants who cannot swallow will receive the tablets of amantadine through a NG tube or PEG tube as 400 mg via crushed tablets with a 25-mL saline or water flush for the remainder of the 30 days study period.</description>
