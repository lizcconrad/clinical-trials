  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most common psychiatric disorders among
      adolescents, and is associated with considerable psychosocial and functional impairments and
      an elevated risk of suicidal behaviour and completed suicide. Meanwhile, sleep disturbance,
      particularly insomnia, is among the most prevalent and prominent presenting complaints in
      adolescents with depression. Despite its high prevalence, insomnia often remains overlooked
      and under-treated in clinical practice. However, growing evidence suggests an intricate
      relationship between insomnia and depression, which has become an area in need of further
      focused attention. This project will involve a randomised controlled trial proposed to
      examine whether insomnia treatment confers additional benefit to depression treatment in
      adolescents with comorbid depression and insomnia, for improving sleep and depressive
      symptoms, and other clinical and daytime symptoms as well as overall functional improvement
      in both the short and long term. Eligible adolescent participants will be randomised to
      either intervention (8-week group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia, CBT-I, or
      8-week group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Depression, CBT-D) or waiting-list control
      condition. Assessments will be conducted at pre-treatment (week 0), during the treatment
      (week 2, 4, 6) and post-treatment (week 8/at the conclusion of the last group session). The
      two active treatment groups will be additionally followed up at posttreatment one-month and
      six-month.
