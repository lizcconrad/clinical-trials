      Brief Summary: This Phase IIb study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo
      and active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PD, and population PK of
      vamorolone administered orally at daily doses of 2.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg versus prednisone
      0.75 mg/kg/day and placebo over a Treatment Period of 24 weeks, and to evaluate persistence
      of effect over a Treatment Period of 48 weeks in ambulant boys ages 4 to &lt;7 years with DMD.

    <textblock>
      This Phase IIb study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo and
      active-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PD, and population PK of vamorolone
      administered orally at daily doses of 2.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg versus prednisone 0.75
      mg/kg/day and placebo over a Treatment Period of 24 weeks, and to evaluate persistence of
      effect over a Treatment Period of 48 weeks in ambulant boys ages 4 to &lt;7 years with DMD.

      The study is comprised of a 5-week Pretreatment Screening Period, a 1-day Pretreatment
      Baseline Period, a 24 week Treatment Period #1 (Weeks 1-24), a 4 week Transition Period
      (Weeks 25-28), a 20-week Treatment Period #2 (Weeks 28+ 1 day to 48), and a 4-week
      Dose-tapering Period (Weeks 49-52).

      Subjects will be randomized to one of six treatment groups in a 2:2:1:1:1:1 ratio, where the
      two prednisone groups in Treatment Period #1 (Groups 3 and 4) will be combined and the two
      placebo groups in Treatment Period #1 (Groups 5 and 6) will be combined, effectively
      resulting in a 1:1:1:1 randomization (vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg/day : vamorolone 6.0 mg/kg/day :
      prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day : placebo) for Treatment Period #1.

      Subjects will be stratified based on age at study entry (&lt;6 vs. ≥ 6 years). During the 4-week
      Transition Period between Treatment Period #1 and Treatment Period #2, all subjects will
      continue on the same oral suspension (vamorolone 2.0 mg/kg or 6.0 mg/kg, or matching placebo)
      they received during Treatment Period #1 and all subjects will have their tablet dose tapered
      to zero. Thus, subjects randomized to receive vamorolone during Treatment Period #1 (Groups 1
      and 2) will continue to receive vamorolone at the same dose, while subjects randomized to
      receive prednisone will have their dose tapered to zero, and subjects randomized to placebo
      will continue to receive placebo.

      A total of approximately 120 subjects will be randomized (2:2:1:1:1:1) to treatment.

      The prednisone group will be used as an active control comparison for safety and efficacy
      endpoints as requested by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The placebo group will be used
      as comparator for efficacy endpoints (superiority model) as requested by the EMA and Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) protocol advisory board.

      At the end of the Treatment Period #2, subjects will be given the option of enrolling into a
      long-term extension study (VBP15-005) or to transition to standard of care treatment for DMD
      (may include glucocorticoids). Subjects completing VBP15-004 and enrolling directly into
      VBP15 005 will not need to taper their vamorolone dose prior to enrollment into VBP15 005.
      All other subjects will begin a 4 week double blind Dose tapering Period during which the
      dose of study medication will be progressively reduced and discontinued.

               -  Complete dystrophin gene sequencing showing an alteration (point mutation,
                  duplication, other) that is expected to preclude production of the dystrophin
                  protein (i.e., nonsense mutation, deletion/duplication leading to a downstream
                  stop codon), with a clinical picture consistent with typical DMD;

          3. Subject is ≥ 4 years and &lt;7 years of age at time of enrollment in the study;

             or if abnormal, are not clinically significant, in the opinion of the Investigator.
             [Note: Serum gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), creatinine, and total bilirubin all
             must be ≤ upper limit of the normal range at the Screening Visit];

          8. Subject has evidence of chicken pox immunity as determined by presence of IgG
             antibodies to varicella, as documented by a positive test result from the local
             laboratory at the Screening Visit;

          9. Subject is able to swallow tablets, as confirmed by successful test swallowing of
             placebo tablets during the Screening Period; and

         10. Subject and parent(s)/guardian(s) are willing and able to comply with scheduled
             visits, study drug administration plan, and study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             medication;

          4. Subject has used mineralocorticoid receptor agents, such as spironolactone,
             eplerenone, canrenone (canrenoate potassium), prorenone (prorenoate potassium),
             mexrenone (mexrenoate potassium) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study
             medication;

          5. Subject has a history of primary hyperaldosteronism;

          6. Subject has evidence of symptomatic cardiomyopathy [Note: Asymptomatic cardiac
             abnormality on investigation would not be exclusionary];

          7. Subject is currently being treated or has received previous treatment with oral
             glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressive agents [Notes: Past transient use of oral
             or inhaled glucocorticoids or other oral immunosuppressive agents for indication other
             than DMD for no longer than 3 months cumulative, with last use at least 3 months (or
             last use at least one month prior for inhaled glucocorticoids) prior to first dose of
             study medication, will be considered for eligibility on a case-by-case basis. Inhaled
             and/or topical glucocorticoids prescribed for an indication other than DMD are
             permitted if last use is at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study medication or
             are administered at stable dose beginning at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of
             study medication, and are anticipated to be used at the stable dose regimen for the
             duration of the study];

          8. Subject has an allergy or hypersensitivity to the study medication or to any of its
             constituents;

          9. Subject has used idebenone within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication;

         10. Subject has severe behavioral or cognitive problems that preclude participation in the
             study, in the opinion of the Investigator;

         11. Subject has previous or ongoing medical condition, medical history, physical findings
             or laboratory abnormalities that could affect safety, make it unlikely that treatment
             and follow-up will be correctly completed or impair the assessment of study results,
             in the opinion of the Investigator;

         12. Subject is taking (or has taken within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study
             medication) herbal remedies and supplements which can impact muscle strength and
             function (e.g., Co-enzyme Q10, creatine, proglandine, etc);

         13. Subject is taking (or has taken within 3 months prior to the first dose of study
             medication) any medication indicated for DMD, including Exondys51 and Translarna;

         14. Subject is currently taking any other investigational drug or has taken any other
             investigational drug within 3 months prior to the first dose of study medication; or

         15. Subject has previously been enrolled in the study.

        Note: Any parameter/test may be repeated at the Investigator's discretion during Screening
        to determine reproducibility. In addition, subjects may be rescreened if ineligible due to
        a transient condition which would prevent the subject from participating, such as an upper
        respiratory tract infection or injury, or if ineligible due to negative anti-varicella IgG
        antibody test result.
