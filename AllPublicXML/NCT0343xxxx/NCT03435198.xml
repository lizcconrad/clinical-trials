  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are investigating the &quot;biochemical fingerprint&quot; of hypoglycemia (low blood
      sugar) in the breath of people with type 1 diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim through the use of proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry to
      perform comprehensive breath analysis to identify compounds of interest associated with
      glucose fluctuations. More than 500 different volatile organic compounds can be detected in
      human breath. Compounds such as ethane, pentane and isoprene (hydrocarbons), as well as
      acetone, acetaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol (oxygen-containing compounds), are most
      likely to be relevant and measurable in our study population. Hydrocarbons are stable
      end-products of lipid peroxidation and show only low solubility in blood and therefor are
      excreted into breath within minutes of their formation in tissues. There is evidence for
      increased hydrocarbon production in states of oxidative stress. Oxygen-containing compounds
      such as acetone/acetaldehyde (ketones) are also clinically relevant in the measurement of
      insulin deficient states of catabolism in patients with diabetes. A previous study of exhaled
      isoprene was found to be elevated during hypoglycemia. This study aims to expand on this to
      characterize the full range of changes in concentrations of volatile organic compounds in
      human breath during glucose fluctuations.

      Characterizing this &quot;biochemical fingerprint&quot; of hypoglycemia may provide clues about what
      so-called diabetes alert dogs are detecting as well as improve our understanding of
      hypoglycemia, the physiology behind hypoglycemia unawareness, and potentially identify a
      novel non-invasive measure of blood glucose.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute and relative change in concentration of measured volatile organic compounds in human breath in subjects with type 1 diabetes during hypoglycemia compared to euglycemia measured by proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry.</measure>
    <time_frame>Until three low blood sugar events have occured with breath samples collected during low blood sugar and upon recovery to normal blood sugar; expected 1-2 weeks but allowed up to 1 month to complete sample collection</time_frame>
    <description>Detectable difference in volatile organic compounds (anticipate up to 120-150 different ion signals to be assessed) in human breath during low blood sugar (&lt;70 mg/dL) compared to normal blood sugar (70-180). As this is a 'hypothesis generating' pilot study, the investigators are observing what compounds are present and in what concentrations -- this is the reason for nonspecific outcome measures</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Characterize relationship of concentration of all measurable VOCs (anticipate 120-150 ion signals) by proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry across the spectrum of glycemia.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Statistically-significant (P&lt;0.05) differences in concentration of volatile organic compounds in human breath in subjects with type 1 diabetes across the spectrum of glycemia (very low &lt;54 mg/dL), low (55-69), in target (70-180), high (181-250), very high(&gt;250))</description>

    <time_frame>up to 1 month</time_frame>
