  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For this project, neflamapimod and placebo will be provided free of charge by the EIP company
      (www.eippharma.com). Neflamapimod is currently tested in 2 clinical trials in AD, one in
      Europe (The Netherlands) and one in the USA (clinical trials.gov/VX-745). The company
      commenced in May 2015 dosing in two phase 2a clinical studies in patients with Early AD: one
      in the Netherlands that is focused on PET amyloid imaging as the primary biomarker of drug
      effect, and one in the US (California) that is focused on Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      evaluation to determine CSF drug concentrations and effects on inflammatory markers and
      disease biomarkers. Pharmacokinetic evaluation in these patients has demonstrated blood drug
      concentration levels in the predicted therapeutic range; and importantly, the data from the
      US study demonstrate that the drug achieves target drug concentrations in CSF, thus
      confirming the drug robustly enters the brain in humans.

      The present project offers us a unique chance to test this promising drug in AD patients. The
      aim of the study is to focus on PET neuroinflammation imaging as the primary biomarker of
      this drug effect. The chosen biomarker for imaging neuroinflammation in patients is [1
      8F]-DPA714.

      The present project is an intervention proof of concept study to test the efficacy of
      neflamapimod in a population of AD patients at an early stage.

      To track the impact of this drug in patients, the investigators will use an innovative
      radiotracer, [18F]DPA-714, as a promising ligand of microglial activation targeting the
      translocator protein (TSPO), specific of microglial activation. The use of [18F]DPA-714 will
      allow to monitor the evolution of neuroinflammation in patients as a function of treatment.
      The main objective will be to compare the level of inflammation using the [18F]DPA-714 in
      neflamapimod and placebo groups after 12 weeks of treatment. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) samples and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will also be collected to assess
      inflammation markers and brain structure respectively in these patients.

               -  Objective memory impairment corroborated by level of performance on a
                  standardized memory test (Free and Cued Selective Reminding test, (Grober, Hall
                  et al. 2008)) &lt; -1.5 DS according to established norms and

               -  Inability for any reason to undergo MRI scans (e.g. pacemaker). Patients who
                  require sedation for screening procedures such as MRI may receive a short-acting
                  sedative.

               -  Psychiatric disorder that would compromise ability to comply with study
                  requirements

               -  History of cancer within the last 5 years, except basal cell carcinoma,
                  non-squamous skin carcinoma, prostate cancer or carcinoma in situ with no
                  significant progression over the past 2 years

               -  Significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, liver, infectious disease, immune
                  disorder or metabolic/endocrine disorders or other disease that would preclude

                  efficacy

               -  Recent (&lt;60 days) changes to AD medications prescribed for cognitive reasons or
                  with the potential to impact cognition

               -  Psychotropic drugs taken within 1 month. Anticoagulant drugs taken within 1 week.

               -  Participation in a study of an investigational drug less than 6 months or 5
                  half-lives of the investigational drug, whichever is longer, before enrollment in
                  the study

               -  Male subjects with female partner of child-bearing potential who are unwilling or
                  unable to adhere to contraception requirements

               -  Female subjects who have not reached menopause or have not had a hysterectomy or
                  bilateral oophorectomy/salpingoophorectomy
