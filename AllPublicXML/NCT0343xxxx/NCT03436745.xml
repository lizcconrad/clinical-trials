  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Insomnia is associated with difficulty sleeping. The drug zolpidem is widely prescribed for
      insomnia. Women have reported worse effects from the drug than men. Women have higher amounts
      of zolpidem in their body that may persist after waking. Drug exposure may also depend on
      male hormones that change during prostate cancer therapy. Researchers want to see if these
      findings can provide a more-accurate dose to healthy women and men with prostate cancer.

      Objective:

      To study amounts of zolpidem in men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer before they
      are castrated and after, and to compare these results to healthy women s.

      Eligibility:

      Men ages 18 and older who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer who are planning to
      receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)

      Healthy women age 18 and older

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Blood tests

      Physical exam

      Electrocardiogram (EKG) heart test

      Male participants will confirm their prostate cancer. This can be done with a tumor sample
      tissue from a previous surgery or a report from a doctor.

      Female participants may have a pregnancy test.

      Participants will be admitted to the clinic in the evening and stay overnight. They will:

      Take a 5 mg zolpidem tablet on an empty stomach around 11 p.m.

      Have blood drawn multiple times

      Have physical exams and EKGs

      Answer questions about their symptoms and medicines they are taking

      Male participants will have ADT as part of their standard cancer treatment. After that, the
      testosterone in their blood will be measured. They will repeat the overnight clinic stay.

      Participants will get a follow-up phone call after each stay.

      Background:

        -  Zolpidem is currently approved for the treatment of patients with insomnia.

        -  Women reported experiencing an increased incidence of adverse effects than men,
           resulting in a reduction of the recommended dose of zolpidem for women.

        -  Zolpidem metabolism is affected by both age and gender; the recommended dose for the
           elderly and female populations is 5mg daily.

        -  Subsequent studies have shown that women experience greater exposure to zolpidem than
           men, potentially due to androgen-driven differences in enzyme expression.

        -  A preclinical study showed that castrated male rats exhibited zolpidem pharmacokinetics
           similar to that of female rats, providing further evidence to suggest that zolpidem
           pharmacokinetics are androgen-driven.

      Objectives:

      -To evaluate the effect of castration on the pharmacokinetics of a single 5-mg dose of
      zolpidem in patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (prevs.
      post-castration therapy) compared to normal healthy females.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with prostate cancer (rising PSA and greater than or equal to 100 ng/dL)

        -  After androgen deprivation therapy, castrate testosterone levels &lt;50 ng/dL

        -  ECOG 0-1

      Design:

        -  Comparative, single-dose pharmacokinetic study.

        -  Men with prostate cancer (pre-castration) and normal healthy females will receive
           treatment with a single dose of 5 mg tablet of zolpidem followed by 8-hour
           pharmacokinetic evaluation of zolpidem and its metabolites.

        -  Men will then undergo androgen deprivation therapy and when castrate testosterone levels
           &lt;50 ng/dL (post-castration), they will receive another 5 mg single dose of zolpidem
           followed by 8-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation of zolpidem and its metabolites.

    <description>In men with prostate cancer, males (precastration, n=8-10) will receive oral zolpidem in the form of a 5 mg tablet. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis at pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8-hours post-dose. This cohort of men will then undergo androgen deprivation therapy with standard doses of goserelin. When castrate testosterone levels reach &lt;50 ng/dL (postcastration), they will receive another 5 mg single dose of zolpidem followed by 8-hr PK evaluation of zolpidem and its metabolites. Normal healthy females (n=5-8) will receive treatment with a single dose of 5 mg tablet of zolpidem followed by 8-hr PK evaluation of zolpidem and its metabolites. Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis at predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8-hours post-dose.</description>
