  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if treatment with medications that reduce the male
      hormone level in the participant's body for a few months before surgery can shrink prostate
      cancer as much as possible, which might reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the
      future. These treatments include a hormone injection given monthly or every three months and
      the study drugs, which include abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and apalutamide.

      These medications are being used in combination with surgery and maybe radiotherapy because
      studies have shown that any single approach on its own is not sufficient to control or get
      rid of the cancer especially if they have high risk or aggressive features. The researchers
      hope to learn if combining the study drugs with surgery and radiation will get rid of the
      cancer from participants' prostates and reduce their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to an
      undetectable level.
