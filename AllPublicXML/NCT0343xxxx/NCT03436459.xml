  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of low level laser therapy and extracorporeal shock wave
      therapy in patients with myofascial pain syndrome of the upper trapezius. Half of the
      patients receive laser therapy, half of them receive shock wave therapy for three weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) inducing photochemical and photothermal effect, increases
      blood flow and vascular permeability and improves cell metabolism. All these lead to muscle
      recovery. It also activates somatosensory receptors of the skin and reduces local pain and
      muscle spasm.

      The specific mechanisms of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in treating
      musculoskeletal pain remain unclear. It reduces pain and inflammation by modulating
      nitrogen-monoxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It can destroy sensory
      unmyelinated nerve fibers, and stimulate neovascularization and collagen synthesis in
      degenerative tissues.

    <description>change from baseline Neck Disability Index (NDI) at week 3. It includes 10 part; pain intensity, personal care, lifting objects, reading, headache, concentration, work, driving, sleeping and entertainments. There are six presumptions; the first is given 0 and the last presumption has the score of 5. The total maximum score is 50, that represents 100% disability. The lower score represents better outcome.</description>

    <description>change from baseline quality of life (36-Item Short Form Health Survey /SF-36/) at week 3. It consists of eight scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health), which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more the disability, i.e. a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability.</description>
