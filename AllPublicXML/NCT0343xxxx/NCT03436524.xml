  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at developing a model for the prediction of time to first treatment in chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia patients presenting with asymptomatic early stage disease
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Already existing and coded health-related personal data will be retrospectively collected
      from the CLL databases of the Institute of Oncology Research and of the Division of
      Hematology of the University of Eastern Piedmont.

      The adjusted association between exposure variables and time to first treatment will be
      estimated by Cox regression. This approach will provide the covariates independently
      associated with progression free survival that will be utilized in the development of a model
      to predict time to first treatment.

      Model performance (c-index and net reclassification improvement) in discriminating patients
      who will eventually be treated vs patients who will not be eventually treated will be
      compared with that of already existing prognostic model that have been validated to predict
      overall survival but not time to first treatment in CLL (i.e. CLL-IPI, MDACC score,
      Barcelona-Brno score).

    <description>Primary endpoint of the study model ability in discriminating patients who will be eventually treated vs patients who will not be eventually treated.
The discrimination capacity of the model will be assessed by calculating the c-index. This approach will allow to estimate the model accuracy and its capacity of discriminating outcome at the individual patient level. Model performance (net reclassification improvement) in discriminating patients who will be eventually treated vs patients who will not be eventually treated will be compared with that of already existing prognostic models that have been validated to predict overall survival but not time to first treatment in CLL (i.e. CLL-IPI, MDACC score, Barcelona-Brno score).</description>
