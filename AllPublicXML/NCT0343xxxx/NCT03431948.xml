             after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  If known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected) then patient is not eligible for cohorts including SBRT to
             liver lesions.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.

          -  Must not have a history of allergy to nivolumab, urelumab or cabiralizumab.

          -  Must not have a history of any significant drug allergy (such as anaphylaxis or
             hepatotoxicity) to prior anti-cancer immune-modulating therapies (eg, checkpoint
