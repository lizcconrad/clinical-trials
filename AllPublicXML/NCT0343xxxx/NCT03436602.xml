  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims at developping and validating an integrated clinico-molecular model for an
      accurate identification of FL patients who are progression free and progressed, respectively,
      at 24 months after treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Already existing and coded tumor biological material and health-related personal data will be
      retrospectively collected. FL diagnosis will be confirmed by central pathology review. Tumor
      somatic mutations, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and mutation status will be analyzed by
      targeted deep next generation sequencing of tumor genomic DNA. Gene expression profiling will
      be performed by targeted RNA-Seq of biopsy-derived RNA.

      An immunohistochemistry panel assessing both tumor phenotype and microenvironment cellular
      composition will be assessed by Tissue macroarray. FISH will be performed to characterize the
      most recurrent follicular lymphoma chromosomal translocations.

      The adjusted association between exposure variables and progression free survival will be
      estimated by Cox regression. This approach will provide the covariates independently
      associated with progression free survival that will be utilized in the development of a
      hierarchical molecular model to predict progression free survival at 24 months. The
      hierarchical order of relevance in predicting 24 months progression free survival among
      covariates will be established by recursive partitioning analysis. Overall, this approach
      will allow the development of a multilayer dynamic model for anticipating progression within
      24 months from treatment.

      The model developed in the training set will be tested in the validation sets and the model
      performance (c-index and net reclassification improvement) in the validation set will be
      compared with that in the training set. The accuracy of the multilayer model in predicting
      progression free survival at 24 months will be compared against the FLIPI using c-index and
      net reclassification improvement.
