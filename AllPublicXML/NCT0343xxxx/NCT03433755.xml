  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn more about evolocumab in Chinese people with primary
      hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. This study will see if evolocumab will reduce low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in Chinese people who are also taking a certain type
      of lipid-lowering medication (statins with or without ezetimibe) and whether it causes any
      side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of
      evolocumab in Chinese Subjects with hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia. Subjects who
      have signed the informed consent form (ICF), will have fasting lipids measured and all
      inclusion and exclusion criteria assessed. Subjects should maintain their current diet and
      exercise regimen. Treatment and follow-up period will be 12 weeks with an additional phone
      call or other subject contact at week 14 for subjects receiving investigational product Q2W.
      The EOS for subjects on QM investigational product is at the week 12 visit which must be at
      least 30 days post last dose of investigational product.

      Evolocumab and placebo will be administered by self-injection under the skin at the study
      site or in an appropriate non-clinic setting (e.g., at home) by spring based prefilled auto
      injector/pen (AI/Pen). Subjects must tolerate an injection of placebo with a prefilled auto
      injector/pen device to be used during the study prior to randomization.

      Approximately 40 sites in China will participate in this study. The overall participants to
      finish the study will be approximately 450 randomly added to one of 4 groups using a 2:2:1:1
      ratio.

      Evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W-150 subjects total) Evolocumab 420 mg once a month
      (QM-150 subjects total) placebo every 2 weeks (75 subjects total) placebo once a month (75
      subjects total) The dose frequencies of every 2 weeks and monthly will not be blinded but the
      identity of investigational product Evolocumab or placebo will be blinded.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be screened for this study and if found eligible as described by the study protocol may be randomized into 1 of 4 groups. Randomized means that you are put into a group by chance. It is like drawing numbers out of a hat. Randomization will be done using a 2:2:1:1 ratio. This means for every 6 participants randomized:
2 participants will be randomized to evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks
2 participants will be randomized to evolocumab 420 mg once a month
1 participant will be randomized to placebo every 2 weeks
1 participant will be randomized to placebo once a month.</intervention_model_description>

        participating in this study

        220. Female subject of childbearing potential not willing to use an acceptable method(s) of
        effective birth control during treatment with investigational product and for an additional
        15 weeks after the end of treatment with investigational product (Refer to Section 6.9.1
        for specific contraceptive information). Female subjects of non-childbearing potential who
        are not required to use contraception during the study and include those who have had a:

          -  hysterectomy

          -  bilateral salpingectomy

          -  bilateral oophorectomy or

          -  who are postmenopausal.

             i. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative
             medical cause. [A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal
             range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal
             contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12
             months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.

        ii. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
        the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT
        during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
        postmenopausal status before study enrollment.

        Acceptable methods of effective birth control include:

          -  sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the
             entire period of risk associated with the study treatments; the reliability of sexual
             abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (eg., calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the
             duration of a study, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception])

          -  bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion

          -  vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female
             subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received
             medical assessment of the surgical success)

          -  use of hormonal birth control methods (oral, intravaginal (eg. vaginal ring(s),
             transdermal, injectable, or implantable)

          -  intrauterine devices (IUDs)

          -  intrauterine hormonal releasing system (IUS)

          -  2 barrier methods (each partner must use 1 barrier method) the male uses a condom and
             the female must choose either a diaphragm, OR cervical cap, OR contraceptive sponge
             with spermicide. If spermicide is not commercially available in the country or region,
             the 2 barrier method without spermicide is acceptable. (A female condom is not an
             option due to the risk of tearing when both partners use a condom.)

             221. Female subject is pregnant or breast feeding (nursing), planning to become
             pregnant or planning to breastfeed (nurse) during treatment with investigational
             product and/or within 15 weeks after the end of treatment with investigational
             product.
