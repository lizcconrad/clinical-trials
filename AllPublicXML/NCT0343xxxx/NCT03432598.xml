  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, 4-cohort study of the monoclonal antibody BGB A317 in
      combination with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in subjects with advanced NSCLC or
      SCLC. The 4 cohorts will be enrolled concurrently including non-squamous NSCLC Cohort,
      squamous NSCLC Cohort A, squamous NSCLC Cohort B and SCLC Cohort. Subjects with a mixed
      adenocarcinoma and squamous cell NSCLC will be allocated to one of the NSCLC cohorts based on
      the predominant histopathological profile. (e.g., subjects with adenocarcinoma component
      accounting for &gt; 50% will be allocated to non-squamous NSCLC cohort.) Subjects with squamous
      NSCLC will be sequentially enrolled into either of the 2 squamous NSCLC cohorts by the trial
      stage i.e. the sequence of the enrollment for the squamous NSCLC cohorts will be as Cohort A
      safety run-in Stage, followed by Cohort B safety run-in Stage, Cohort A dose-expansion stage
      and Cohort B dose-expansion Stage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 18-75 years on the day of signing informed consent.

             non-squamous NSCLC, squamous NSCLC, or extensive-stage SCLC.

             case-by-case basis after discussion with the medical monitors.

          3. Have had no prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease. Prior
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy or chemoradiation therapy with curative intent should
             have been completed at least 6 months prior to documentation of recurrence of disease.

          4. Subjects must be able to provide fresh or archival tumor tissues (formalin-fixed
             paraffin-embedded [FFPE] blocks or at least 10 unstained FFPE slides) with an
             associated pathological report.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a sensitizing mutation in EGFR gene or an ALK fusion oncogene
             (specifically for subjects with non- squamous NSCLC). Subjects with unknown
             mutation/fusion status of EGFR and/or ALK must take the respective test at the
             investigational sites (or other designated sites) prior to enrolment.

          2. Prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years exceptions include the tumor under
             investigation in this trial, and locally recurring cancers that have undergone
             curative treatment, such as resected basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial
             bladder cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast

          3. Prior therapies targeting PD-1, PD-L1 or PD-L2
