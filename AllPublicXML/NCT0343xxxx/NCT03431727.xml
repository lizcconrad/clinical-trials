  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acromegaly is a rare disease caused by a growth hormone (GH) producing pituitary adenoma.
      Surgery is primary treatment, whereas medical treatment with a somatostatin analogue (SA),
      which suppresses GH secretion and reduces tumour size, is used when surgery is insufficient
      or unfeasible. Acromegaly is associated with metabolic abnormalities which contributes to an
      increased morbidity and mortality if left untreated. To which extend these abnormalities
      reverses after treatment, and if treatment modality influences the outcome, remain elusive.
      The aim of the study is to investigate sleep apnea, circulation and metabolism in acromegaly
      before and after surgery and/or medical treatment
