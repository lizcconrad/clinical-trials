    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a participant using an investigational drug, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is not satisfied with his/her aesthetic appearance due to structural features of
             his/her nose and assessed as either &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; by using the
             5-point Nose Satisfaction Scale (NSS)

          -  Requires a total volume of at least 0.5 mL but not exceeding 3.0 mL of VOLUMA with
             Lidocaine for initial and touch-up treatment combined, and treatment to the nasal
             dorsum is mandatory to achieve an aesthetic improvement in the subject's nose
             appearance, in the TI's opinion

          -  Has a reasonable treatment goal for aesthetic improvement in nose, in the TI's
             opinion. Subject and TI have aligned the treatment goals.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a small, shallow nose such that the volume of filler implant needed to create the
             desired dorsal height is in excess of the ability of the skin and soft tissue to
             expand and accommodate the implant

          -  Has active autoimmune disease

          -  Is on a concurrent regimen of lidocaine or structurally-related local anesthetics (eg,
             bupivacaine)

          -  Is on an ongoing regimen of anti-coagulation therapy (eg, warfarin)

          -  Within 10 days of undergoing study device injection, is on an ongoing regimen of
             medications (eg, aspirin or ibuprofen) or other substances (eg, high doses of Vitamin
             C or Vitamin E or herbal supplements with garlic, gingko biloba, or ginseng) known to
             increase coagulation time, or is currently menstruating (study treatment may be
             delayed as necessary to accommodate menstrual period cessation and/or anticoagulation
             washout interval)

          -  Has participated in any clinical trials within 4 weeks prior to signing the informed
             consent form (ICF) or is planning to participate in another clinical trial during the
             course of this study

          -  Females who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy during the course of the
             study. Females of childbearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test result
             during screening. Females who intend to breastfeed during the study. Females of
             childbearing potential who are unwilling to use birth control measures during the full
             course of the study. Birth control measures include oral contraceptives (stable) use
             for 2 or more cycles prior to screening), intrauterine devices, hormonal injections,
             hormonal implants, bilateral tube ligation, vasectomy, condom or diaphragm plus either
             contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly
