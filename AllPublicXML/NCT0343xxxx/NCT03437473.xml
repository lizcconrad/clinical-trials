      Multi-site, first-in-human study to assess safety and efficacy of an active implantable Vagus
      Nerve Stimulation (VNS) device in 15 adult patients with active moderate-to-severe rheumatoid
      arthritis who have had an incomplete response or intolerability to at least two different
      mechanisms of action.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-stage study where Stage 1 is open label, and Stage 2 is randomized and sham
      controlled where the sites and subjects are blinded to treatment. Three subjects will be
      enrolled in Stage 1 of the study. And 12 subjects will be enrolled in Stage 2. Subjects will
      be treated for a total of 12 weeks.

      Subjects will be asked to visit the clinic at day 0, week 1-6, week 8 and week 12. During
      these visits, the following activities will be conducted: standard patient and physician
      assessments of RA activity, blood sample collection for RA biomarkers, and a hand MRI.

      Subjects who complete the study will have the option to enroll in a long-term extension
      study. Subjects that do not participate in the extension study can opt to either have their
      device permanently inactivated and left in place or have the device surgically explanted.
