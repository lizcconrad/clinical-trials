  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of The Adaptive Neural Systems
      Neural-Enabled Prosthetic Hand (ANS-NEPH) system.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new prosthetic system for transradial amputees
      called the neural-enabled prosthetic hand (ANS-NEPH). It is intended to provide the sense of
      touch, grasp force and hand opening to the user by sending electrical stimulation pulses to
      electrodes implanted in nerve fascicles in the upper arm of the residual limb. The system
      uses measurements from sensors in the prosthetic hand and wireless communication to the
      implanted neurostimulator to adjust the pulses continuously so that the user gets sensation
      as tasks are performed with the prosthesis.
