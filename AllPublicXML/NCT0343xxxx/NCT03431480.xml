  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of coronary infusion of autologous
      placental cord blood mononuclear cells during the Norwood heart operation in newborn
      hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label safety study. Autologous cord blood mononuclear cells (stem
      cell containing, cord blood buffy coat fraction) will be delivered by coronary infusion
      during the Norwood cardiopulmonary bypass operation in 12 antenatally diagnosed HLHS patients
      within 2-3 days of birth. Safety and clinical status monitoring will performed to Stage II
      surgical intervention for HLHS (at approximately 3 months of age). Treated patients will be
      continue to be assessed during follow up between Stage II and III (Fontan) surgical
      interventions.
