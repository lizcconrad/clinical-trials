      Metal Ions levels of cobalt, chromium, and titanium in 40 patients preoperatively and at
      least 1 year status post total hip replacement with the Trident II Tritatnium system using an
      MDM liner and ceramic head. Are cobalt, chromium, and titanium levels in patients who undergo
      a total hip replacement with a Trident II Tritanium system, MDM liner, and ceramic head
      normal one year after surgery? Investigators expect to find normal levels of metal ions
      (cobalt, chromium, and titanium) after total hip replacement using Trident II Tritanium cups
      with an MDM liner and a ceramic head. The primary outcome (PO) is blood metal ion levels of
      cobalt, chromium, and titanium (concentration of metal ions in blood). Blood will be drawn in
      the 3rd Floor West of the Main Building, and then tested for metal ions in the Hospital for
      Special Surgery laboratory. The bloods will be drawn at a preoperative visit and at a one
      year visit.
