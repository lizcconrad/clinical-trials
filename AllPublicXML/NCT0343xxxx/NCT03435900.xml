  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate if intraoperative intraperitoneal administration
      of fosfomycin, metronidazole and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
      factor (rhGM-CSF) followed by oral antibiotic for three days is as effective as the current
      intravenous antibiotic treatment given during and three days after appendectomy for
      perforated appendicitis. The primary outcome is the total length of hospital stay, defined as
      the number of hours in hospital after end of operation and until 30-day follow-up.
