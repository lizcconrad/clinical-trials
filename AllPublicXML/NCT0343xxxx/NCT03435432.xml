  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During dietary fat absorption, the gut packages the majority of the fats into lipid particles
      that are secreted into blood circulation. The gut is also capable of storing a considerable
      amount of fats that can be released at a later time upon receiving certain stimulus signals.
      One of the signals is glucose ingestion. This protocol examines blood lipid responses to a
      glucose drink. Participants drink a fatty formula and 5 hours later drink either a glucose
      solution or water (as control), in one of two randomized study visits. Blood lipid levels are
      monitored throughout the study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are recruited after obtaining informed consent. They first have a high fat
      liquid formula. 5 hours later, they drink 50 grams of glucose in 50 ml of water in one visit
      and 50 ml of water in another. The 2 visits are randomized. Blood samples are taken before
      and after they drink the high fat liquid formula, and continued until 3 hours after they
      drink glucose or water. Lipid levels in the blood samples are measured in the lab.
