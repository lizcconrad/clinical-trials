    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial in which caregivers of children suffering from malaria will be
      assigned to two treatment conditions to prevent mental health problems in the children. A
      psycho-education arm (control) and a behavioral arm (intervention). Pre- and
      post-intervention assessments for behavioral problems in the child and mother will be carried
      out.

      This study is designed to prevent mental health problems in children after an episode of
      severe malaria. The effect of the intervention on the mother's psychological wellbeing will
      also be assessed. Both caregivers and children will be assessed on the ward before being
      randomly assigned to the treatment arms. The interventions in both arms will be done in three
      phases with the third phase being done at home after discharge. Post-intervention assessments
      will be done on both the caregivers and mothers 6 months after discharge.

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Psychoeducation</intervention_name>
    <description>This intervention has three phases occurring the same time as the Psychoeducation intervention. Phase I provides verbal and written information about the paediatric acute care unit services and policies. Phase II consists of: (a) verbal and written information about the general paediatric unit and its policies, and (b) a parent-child activity having ''control'' activities like reading a story not related to hospital stay. Phase III of the control program consists of a telephone call 2-3 days after discharge during which time mothers were informed that they should contact their primary healthcare providers if their children were having any problems or unusual symptoms. They also were asked to comment on their children's hospital stays during this telephone call.</description>

    <description>This is an educational-behavioural intervention that educates the parent about the children's likely emotional and behavioural problems that may result from ICU admission. Phase I will be delivered within 6 to 16 hours of admission to the hospital where caregivers are provided with information about the child's likely emotional reactions during admission in hospital. Phase II will be delivered within 2 to 16 hours of transfer to the general ward and will consist of: (a) verbal and written information to reinforce information provided in Phase I and (b) a parent-child skills building activities. Phase III of the COPE intervention program will occur 2 to 3 days after hospital discharge and will consist of a telephone call during which a 5 minute script will be read that reinforces young children's typical post-discharge emotions and behaviours and parenting behaviours which would continue to facilitate positive coping outcomes in their children.</description>
