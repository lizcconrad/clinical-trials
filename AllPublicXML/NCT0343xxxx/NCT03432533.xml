      administered subcutaneously (SC) once a month (QM) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis

    <intervention_model_description>After signing the informed consent form (ICF), subjects will undergo the following periods:
Screening period (35 days) to complete eligibility assessments
Open-label treatment period (6 months)
Follow-up period (3 months) During the open-label treatment period, subjects will be randomized to receive romosozumab either via HCP administration with PFS or via self-administration withAI/Pen.
During the follow-up period, subjects will be followed for an additional 3 months to ensure appropriate follow-up for anti-romosozumab antibody formation and adverse events.
The primary analysis will be performed after all subjects have had the opportunity to complete the Month 6 visit. The final analysis will be performed after all subjects have had the opportunity to complete the Month 9 visit.</intervention_model_description>

             assessed by the central laboratory
