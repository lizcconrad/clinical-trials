    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of an intervention based on systematic screening of
      psychological distress as the basis for individualised support and rehabilitation following
      primary breast cancer surgery focusing on psychological , physical and health-economics
      outcomes. The aim is also to illuminate patients' and relatives' experiences and need of
      support during the rehabilitation .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer survivors are known to suffer from remaining problems from their treatment
      after surgery. Despite numerous of studies evaluating the effect of various rehabilitation
      programs it is know that patients often receive rehabilitation recommendations that are
      general rather than individualised to their needs. The large amount of studies within this
      area have contributed to knowledge about potential beneficial rehabilitation interventions
      for these patients but there is still a lack of knowledge about how patients specific needs
      of rehabilitation can be identified and how health care can adjust and individualize
      rehabilitation to optimize rehabilitation. This study aims to evaluate the effects of an
      intervention based on systematic screening of psychological distress as the basis for
      individualised support and rehabilitation following primary breast cancer surgery focusing on
      psychological , physical and health-economics outcomes. The aim is also to illuminate
      patients' and relatives' experiences and need of support during the rehabilitation.
