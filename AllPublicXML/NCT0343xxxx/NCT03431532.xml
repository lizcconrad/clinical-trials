  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of different anesthetic techniques on the immune system remains unclear.

      Aim of this ex vivo / in vitro study was to determine the effects of general and neuraxial
      anesthesia on monocyte subset alteration and the release of prototypical pro- and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines. Twenty patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery were
      randomly assigned to receive either general anesthesia (ITN) or combined spinal/epidural
      anesthesia (CSE). CD14 and HLA-DR expression patterns on monocytes and intracellular
      TNF-alpha production were quantified via flow cytometry. TNF-α and IL-10 release were
      measured via enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

      Numerous of factors affect the immunological response during surgery. Despite intensive
      research, the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the immune system remains unclear.

      Aim of this ex vivo / in vitro study was to determine the effects of general and neuraxial
      anesthesia on monocyte subset alteration and the release of prototypical pro- and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines. Twenty patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery were
      randomly assigned to receive either general anesthesia (ITN) or combined spinal/epidural
      anesthesia (CSE). Samples of venous blood were taken from the patients before and after
      induction of anesthesia, immediately, 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery. All
      blood samples were incubated in presence or absence of LPS (lipopolysaccharide; 1 µg/ml) for
      24 hours. CD14 and HLA-DR expression patterns on monocytes and intracellular TNF-alpha
      production were quantified via flow cytometry. TNF-α and IL-10 release were measured via
      enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
