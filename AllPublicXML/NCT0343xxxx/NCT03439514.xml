  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy (DCM) due to a gene encoding the lamin A/C protein (LMNA) mutation. The study
      will further evaluate a dose level of ARRY-371797 that has shown preliminary efficacy and
      safety in this patient population. After the primary analysis has been performed, eligible
      patients may receive open-label treatment with ARRY-371797.

    <description>The KCCQ is a self-administered questionnaire that requires 4 to 6 minutes to complete. It contains 23 items, covering physical function, clinical symptoms, social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and Quality of Life (QoL). The PL is a single domain consisting of 7 items scored using a range of 0 - 100, in which higher scores reflect better physical functioning status.</description>

    <description>The KCCQ is a self-administered questionnaire that requires 4 to 6 minutes to complete. It contains 23 items, covering physical function, clinical symptoms, social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and Quality of Life (QoL). The TSS is a combined score based upon the symptom burden, symptom frequency and symptom severity domains of the questionnaire. Scores are transformed to a range of 0 - 100, in which higher scores reflect better health status.</description>
