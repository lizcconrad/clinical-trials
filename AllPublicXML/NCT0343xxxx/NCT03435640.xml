    <textblock>
      Patients will receive intratumoral (IT) NKTR-262 in 3-week treatment cycles. During the Phase
      1 dose escalation portion of the trial, NKTR-262 will be combined with systemic
      administration of NKTR-214. After determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      NKTR-262, NKTR-262 will be combined with NKTR-214 (Cohort A) and with NKTR-214 plus nivolumab
      (Cohort B). In the Phase 2 dose expansion portion, patients will be treated with NKTR-262 and
      NKTR-214 (doublet) or NKTR-262 and NKTR-214 plus nivolumab (triplet) in the
      relapsed/refractory setting and earlier lines of therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer treatments that couple pharmacological activation of tumor antigen presentation with
      activation and expansion of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor environment
      have the potential to induce an effective anti-tumor immune response in patients. NKTR-262 is
      a small molecule agonist of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7/8 designed to be retained in the
      tumor micro-environment in order to activate antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as
      dendritic cells, to create new antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. As a CD122-biased agonist,
      NKTR-214 monotherapy increases newly proliferative CD8+ T cells in tumors. NKTR-262 plus
      NKTR-214 is expected to increase expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In preclinical
      studies, a single IT injection of NKTR-262 plus IV NKTR-214 resulted in complete abscopal
      effects in tumor models. Preliminary clinical data show NKTR-214 plus nivolumab enhances
      immune-stimulatory responses. The REVEAL trial will assess safety and anti-tumor activity of
      NKTR-262 with NKTR-214 +/- nivolumab for the treatment of selected cancers.

    <description>Phase 1 Doublet: NKTR-262 in escalating doses, will be combined with NKTR-214. The goal of this dose escalation part of the study is to establish a safe and tolerable recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for NKTR-262 in combination with NKTR-214 in an Every Three Week (Q3W) fixed dose.
Phase 2 Doublet: NKTR-262 RP2D will be combined with a Q3W dose of NKTR-214 in select tumor indications to evaluate anti-tumor activity and to obtain additional safety data.
Patients may be discontinued from receiving study treatment based on the results of disease assessments or if experiencing intolerable side effects.</description>
