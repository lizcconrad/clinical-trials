  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For ERD(erosive reflux disease), which pathogenesis is mainly the acid reflux mechanism,
      primary treatment is therefore PPI. However, NERD(non-erosive reflux disease) is much more
      complex than ERD and there are more factors causing the typical symptoms. As a result, there
      is no consensus for the treatment of NERD besides using PPI similar to GERD(gastroesophageal
      reflux diseas). This study intent to evaluate the effect of PPI(Esomezol) on NERD patients
      and analyze the improvement of symptoms and the factors related to the result.

      (1) Among GERD patients, EGD(esophagogastroduodenoscopy) must be done before 6 months and
      must prove there is no erosive lesion. (2) During EGD, esophagus mucosa histology will be
      taken for evaluation. (3) For NERD patients, Esomezol is given once a day (before breakfast
      meal), for whole 8 weeks. (4) PAGI-SYM and HAD-K is evaluated and score just before the
      administration of PPI, 4weeks after and 8weeks after the study initiation.
