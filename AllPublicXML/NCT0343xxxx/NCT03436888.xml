      The objective of this study is the adaptation of the Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire to the
      French language from France, and the analysis of its psychometric properties. Firstly, a
      translation and adaptation process will be performed according to international guidelines.
      Secondly, the validation process will be performed through a sample of 250 pregnant or
      postpartum women suffering from pelvic girdle pain. They will fill several questionnaires,
      including Pelvic Girdle Questionnaire, that will allow us to analyse psychometric properties
      of the French version.
