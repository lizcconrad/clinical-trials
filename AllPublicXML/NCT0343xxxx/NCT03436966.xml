      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): is a chronic idiopathic disease affecting the
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract that is comprised of two separate, but related intestinal
      disorders; Crohn s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), IBD is thought to result from an
      exaggerated and inappropriate immune response to gut luminal microbes in genetically,
      susceptible individuals who are exposed to environmental risk factors. IBD is most common in
      North America and western and northern Europe, where incidence rates for UC and CD range from
      2.2-24.3 per 100000 person years, It is estimated that more than 1.4 million Americans and as
      many as 2.5-3 million, Europeans have IBD. While UC and CD share some features, the diseases
      are distinct. Perhaps the most important differences are that while the chronic inflammation
      seen in UC is limited to the large intestine and affects only the intestinal mucosa, the
      inflammation in CD can occur at any location(s) along the GI tract and is often transmural,
      predisposing patients with CD to the development of penetrating (fistulizing) and fibro
      stenotic (stricturing) phenotypes that are not typically seen in UC. In some cases, UC and CD
      are not distinguishable and a diagnosis of IBD unclassified (IBD-U) is made although clinical
      features of IBD-U tend to mirror those of UC Clinical manifestations of UC include diarrhea,
      with or without blood, abdominal pain, tenesmus, and fecal urgency, while the manifestations
      of CD are more variable depending on the extent and location of the GI inflammation. CD with
      predominantly colonic involvement often presents in similar fashion to UC whereas in small
      bowel CD, diarrhea and rectal bleeding are seen less frequently and symptoms, fever, fatigue
      and weight loss are common.

    <description>Positive enteric contrast, can, however, obscure IV contrast enhancement of the bowel wall. In addition, positive oral contrast agents opacify but do not always well distend the bowel. IV contrast is administered and images are acquired in the portal venous phase, which is optimized for visceral organ evaluation.</description>

        -  Number of 30 Patients with inflammatory bowel disease will be included in the study.

          -  CT scans are typically performed for IBD evaluation following administration of both
             oral and IV contrast to detect bowel wall abnormalities and abnormal enhancement[6]

          -  Conventional CT uses positive enteral contrast agents, usually water soluble
             containing solutions, which increase the attenuation of the bowel lumen and of bowel
             wall abnormalities and extraluminal fluid collections.
