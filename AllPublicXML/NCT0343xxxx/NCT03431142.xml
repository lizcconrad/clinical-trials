      Current guidelines recommend that patients with ACS undergoing stent implantation might be
      offered extended DAPT treatment for up to 30 months if necessary.

      Therefore, we designed a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial among
      ACS patients with high-risk on ischemic and bleeding who received a new generation of DES and
      received 9 to 12 months of DAPT, and evaluated whether clopidogrel monotherapy reduce the
      risk of bleeding compared with clopidogrel plus ASA in the following 9 months and achieved
      non-inferior outcomes in preventing ischemic risk.

    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend that patients with ACS undergoing stent implantation might be
      offered extended DAPT treatment for up to 30 months if necessary. For patients with high risk
      of both ischemic and hemorrhage, despite prolonged use of DAPT may bring antithrombotic
      benefit, it may also increase the risk of bleeding. There is an urgent need for specific
      guiding on intensive antiplatelet therapy in this population of patients to reduce the risk
      of ischemia and to avoid the risk of bleeding.

      Previous studies have shown that, after 12 months of DAPT treatment, continuation of
      clopidogrel monotherapy may further reduce the risk of ischemia and bleeding compared with
      aspirin. Therefore, we designed a prospective, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled
      trial among ACS patients with high-risk on ischemic and bleeding who received a new
      generation of DES and received 9 to 12 months of DAPT, and evaluated whether clopidogrel
      monotherapy reduce the risk of bleeding compared with clopidogrel plus ASA in the following 9
      months and achieved non-inferior outcomes in preventing ischemic risk.
