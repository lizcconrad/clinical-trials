  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to determine the safety and feasibility of translating a
      physical activity intervention (LIFE Study) into a community setting. Study outcomes include
      physical performance, safety, and feasibility of conducting the LIFE PA intervention in a
      community setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults who lose their mobility experience a poorer quality of life, are less likely to
      remain independent in the community and have higher rates of chronic disease, falls and
      mortality. Recent results from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE)
      study demonstrated that a structured program of physical activity (PA) reduced the onset of
      major mobility disability in at-risk older adults by up to 28% over a 2.6 year period.
      Despite the public health significance of this study, to-date no study has attempted to
      translate LIFE PA to broader populations of at-risk older adults in community-based settings.
      To address this knowledge gap, and to aid the design of a larger pragmatic trial of LIFE PA
      in community-based settings, the investigators conducted the ENhancing independence using
      Group-based community interventions for healthy AGing in Elders (ENGAGE) pilot study. The
      investigators examined the safety and feasibility of translating LIFE PA into the existing
      infrastructure of a community-based senior center. The investigators also explored the
      preliminary real-world effectiveness of PA on physical performance and several other
      important health related outcomes for older persons, including cognitive function, quality of
      life, depressive symptoms and frequency of falling.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>This study will assess the feasibility of translating LIFE PA to a real-world community based setting with adequate PA adherence in the community by measuring intervention adherence and retention.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention adherence is measured by percent attendance (number of visits attended/total number of scheduled visits). Successful adherence will be defined by an attendance rate of &gt;60%. This will be used as an index of feasibility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accelerometry</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Accelerometry will objectively measure levels of physical activity intensity (light/moderate) and sedentary time. Accelerometry will be measured by GT3X+, Actigraph, Pensacola, FL. The actigraph will be worn for a 7-day period during waking hours during baseline and follow-up. This outcome measure will be assessed by the change in measurements between baseline and 24 weeks</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short physical performance battery (SPPB) test (an additional interim SPPB assessment will be conducted at week 12)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB test will be evaluated using a 4m gait speed test, chair stand test (consisting of five consecutive chair stands), and a balance test (measured by a side-by-side, semi-tandem, and full tandem stand). This test will assess the time to complete a 4m walk and a chair stand test, as well as the time each participant can hold the balance positions (up to 10 seconds). Time will be measured in minutes and seconds. This outcome measure will be assessed by the change in measurements between baseline and 24 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>400 meter walk</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 400 meter walk will be a timed measurement of 10 laps around a 20 meter course or until the participant is unable to continue. Time will be measured in minutes and seconds. This outcome measure will be assessed by the change in measurements between baseline and 24 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Well-Being</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment will be measured using the Quality of Well-Being (QWB) Scale questionnaire. This scale provides a comprehensive measure of health-related quality of life that assesses health symptoms and functioning. The questionnaire is scored using a 0 to 1.0 scale (0 representing death, 1.0 representing asymptomatic full function). This outcome measure will be assessed by the change in measurements between baseline and 24 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms will be assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), which is designed to measure depressive symptomology in the general population. The Scale consists of 20 questions, which are assigned a response score of 0, 1, 2 or 3 depending upon whether the item is worded positively or negatively. Possible range of total scores is 0 to 60, with the higher scores indicating the presence of more symptomatology. A cutoff score of 16 or greater reflects individuals at risk for clinical depression. This outcome measure will be assessed by the change in measurements between baseline and 24 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive performance</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance will be assessed using the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). The DSST is a measure of attention and perceptual speed in which subjects are given a series of numbered symbols and then asked to draw the appropriate symbols below a list of random numbers. The score is the number of correctly made matches in 2 minutes. This outcome measure will be assessed by the change in measurements between baseline and 24 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
