      All patients scheduled for lumbar spine surgery due to discogenic low back pain and/or
      sciatica, will be screened by the principal investigator for presence of inclusion/exclusion
      criteria. Their baseline neurological function before surgery will be assessed and recorded
      for recruitment into one of the three study groups. MRI scans will be assessed for the
      calculation of disc protrusion size. Experimental sensory and pain assessments and
      questionnaires will be performed at list 24 hours before surgery. Blood sample for
      pro-inflammatory mediator will be obtained at the same time as the experimental sensory and
      pain tests. Pre-operative pain and MPQ will be assessed pre-operatively (back and leg pain
      separately), and again on day 30 after surgery. Blood tests for ESR, CRP will be drawn before
      surgery, during the surgery, and on 30 after surgery. During surgery, intervertebral disc
      material will be harvested and divided into 4 specimens for culture and inflammatory mediator
      analysis. Repeat neurological assessment will be performed 30 after surgery.

    <textblock>
      The clinical manifestation of disc degeneration and/or disc herniation can be low back pain
      and/or sciatica. The patterns of sensory and motor signs and symptoms that develop after
      neuropathy vary between individual patients with disc degeneration and/or disc herniation.
      The expression of these sensory signs (hyperalgesia, allodynia, and sensory loss), which we
      call the individual somatosensory profile, reflects pathophysiological mechanisms in damaged
      and surviving afferent nerve fibers such as conduction block, ectopic impulse generation,
      peripheral sensitization, and central sensitization. In addition, studies have been conducted
      in search of a microbial origin responsible for the observed inflammatory reaction in
      discogenic low back pain and sciatica. However, the studies tested mixed cohorts of patients
      in terms of clinical symptoms (low back pain alone, sciatica, both), length of symptoms
      (acute and chronic), and tissue cultured (disc, bone). We hypothesize that the possible
      infectious etiology of the observed inflammatory reaction seen in acute disc herniation and
      sciatica may be different from that of chronic low back pain due to disc degeneration.

      We further suspect that the immununogenicity of an acute disc herniation causing neurological
      deficit may be different from a similar disc herniation not causing a deficit, and still
      different from chronic degenerated discs without herniation or neurological deficit. Despite
      the frequent occurrence of low back pain and sciatica in the general population their
      underling mechanisms are poorly understood.

      Aims and hypotheses of study

      (1) To test the differences in disc microbial cultures and in levels of disc and blood
      cytokines, between patients suffering disc degeneration / herniation and spinal stenosis
      (controls), and (2) to assess the relationship between clinical manifestations and sensory
      profiles of these patients and levels of cytokines found in disc tissue and blood.

      Ouer hypotheses are: (1) patients suffering from disc degeneration / herniation or spinal
      stenosis will differ in microbial culture and cytokines levels, with higher levels of
      positive microbial disc culture and cytokines in the disc herniation group, (2) proinflamtory
      cytokines levels will correlate with hyperalgesic (rather than hypoalgesic) sensory profiles.

      Methods

      200 adult subjects suffering from radicular pain duo to disc degeneration / herniation or
      spinal stenosis will be recruited from the orthopedic clinic at the Rambam Health Care
      Campus.

      Experimental sensory and pain assessments will include a set of non-painful and pain evoked
      tests which assess sensory integrity and pain perception to thermal (heat and cold) and
      mechanical (vibration fork, pressure algometer and Von Frey Filaments) stimulation and an
      assessment of the pain modulation processes: (1) conditioned pain modulation (CPM)- a
      phenomenon whereby the response to a given noxious test stimulus is attenuated by another
      conditioning noxious stimulus which is simultaneously administered in a remote area of the
      body; (2) temporal summation (TS)- the experimental equivalent of 'windup. The tests will be
      performed over the skin of the painful area (back and leg) and over the same areas of the
      non-painful contralateral side. Clinical pain assessments will be based on the evaluation of
      pain intensity on a daily pain diary as well as on a pain questionnaire (Short-Form McGill
      Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)); Thermal detection and pain thresholds and the number of
      paradoxical heat sensations The thermal tests will be performed using the TSA II (MEDOC,
      Israel). Cold and warm detection thresholds will be measured first (CDT, WDT). In addition,
      subjects will be asked about paradoxical heat sensations (PHS) during the thermal sensory
      limen (TSL) procedure of alternating warm and cold stimuli. Then cold pain and heat pain
      thresholds will be determined (CPT, HPT). The mean threshold temperature of three consecutive
      measurements will be calculated. All thresholds will be obtained with ramped stimuli (1째C/s)
      that will be terminated when the subject presses a button. The baseline temperature will be
      32째C and the contact area of the thermode will be 3x3 cm2. Cut-off temperatures will be 0째C
      and 50째C

      Mechanical detection and pain threshold The mechanical detection threshold (MDT) will be
      measured with a standardized set of von Frey hairs (Optihair2-Set, Marstock Nervtest,
      Germany) that exert forces upon bending between 0.25 and 512 mN (1-2s contact time). The
      contact area of the von Frey hairs with the skin will be of uniform size and shape (rounded
      tip, 0.5 mm in diameter) to avoid sharp edges that would facilitate nociceptor activation.
      Using the ''method of limits'', five threshold determinations will be made, each with a
      series of ascending and descending stimulus intensities. The final threshold will be the
      geometric mean of these five series.

      The mechanical pain threshold (MPT) will be measured using a standardized set of von Frey
      hairs. The stimulators will be applied at a rate of 2s on, 2s off in an ascending order until
      the first percept of sharpness will be reached. The final threshold will be the geometric
      mean of five series of ascending and descending stimuli. This test will be designed to detect
      pinprick hypoalgesia.

      Stimulus/response-functions: mechanical pain sensitivity for pinprick stimuli and dynamic
      mechanical allodynia Mechanical pain sensitivity (MPS) will be assessed using the von Frey
      hair with the strongest force (512 mN). Subjects will be asked to give a pain rating for 35
      stimulus on a '0-100' numerical rating scale ('0' indicating ''no pain'', and '100'
      indicating ''most intense pain imaginable'').

      Dynamic mechanical allodynia (ALL) will be assessed using a set of three light tactile
      stimulators as moving innocuous stimuli: Cotton wisp exerting a force of 3 mN, a cotton wool
      tip fixed to an elastic strip exerting a force of 100 mN, and a standardized brush exerting a
      force of 200-400 mN. The tactile stimuli will be applied with a single stroke of
      approximately 2 cm in length over the skin. Fifteen stimuli will be given (five per stimulus
      type). All stimuli will be applied with a 10s inter-stimulus interval - well below the
      critical frequency for wind-up. Mechanical pain sensitivity will be calculated as the
      geometric mean of all numerical ratings for pinprick stimuli. Dynamic mechanical allodynia
      will be calculated as the geometric mean (compound measure) of all numerical ratings across
      all three different types of light touch stimulators.

      Wind-up ratio representing the perceptual correlate of temporal pain summation In this test,
      the perceived intensity of a single pinprick (256 mN) will be compared with that of a series
      of 10 repetitive pinprick stimuli of the same physical intensity (1/s applied within an area
      of 1 cm2). The subject will be asked to give a pain rating representing the single stimulus,
      and the estimated mean over the whole series of 10 stimuli using a '0-100' numerical rating
      scale. The whole procedure will be repeated five times. Wind-up ratio (WUR) will be
      calculated as the ratio: mean rating of the five series divided by the mean rating of the
      five single stimuli.

      Vibration detection threshold The vibration detection threshold (VDT) represents the only
      disappearance threshold within the proposed QST battery. This test will be performed with a
      Rydel-Seiffer grade tuning fork (64 Hz, 8/8 scale) that will be placed over a bony prominence
      (lateral or medial malleolus) and left there until the subject could not feel vibration any
      more. Vibration detection threshold will be determined as a disappearance threshold with
      three stimulus repetitions.

      Pressure pain threshold (PPT) The final test in the protocol will be performed over muscle in
      the painful limb with a pressure gauge device (FDN200, Wagner Instruments, USA) with a probe
      area of 1 cm2 (probe diameter of 1.1 cm) that exerts forces up to 20 kg/cm2. The pressure
      pain threshold will be determined with three series of ascending stimulus intensities, each
      applied as a slowly increasing ramp of 0.5 kg/cm2 s.

      Temporal summation of heat pain Noxious heat stimuli will be given to the painful site. The
      tonic heat pain (THP) stimulation will be applied using the 3 X 3 cm Peltier based
      computerized thermal stimulator (TSA, Medoc Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel). The baseline
      temperature will be 32쨘C and increase at a rate of 2쨘C/sec up to a destination temperature of
      46.5쨘C and will last for 2 minutes. Participants, unaware of the temperature, will be
      instructed to verbally rate the pain intensity every 10 sec using the numeric pain scale
      (NPS; &quot;0&quot; meaning 'no pain', &quot;100&quot;- 'worst pain imaginable'). The average pain ratings will
      be calculated. Temporal summation of heat pain will be defined and calculated as a
      subtraction of the sixth pain rating (after one minute) from the last pain rating (after two
      minutes). Hence, a positive value indicates a temporal summation process, and a negative
      value indicates an adaptation.

      The conditioned pain modulation paradigm For assessment of the DNIC efficiency heat
      stimulation will be delivered using the 3 X 3 cm Peltier based computerized thermal
      stimulator (TSA, Medoc Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel). The baseline temperature will be 32쨘C and
      increase at a rate of 2쨘C/sec up to a destination temperature of 46.5쨘C and for a duration of
      5sec. Patients will verbally report the level of pain intensity using the numeric pain scale
      (NPS; &quot;0&quot; meaning 'no pain', &quot;100&quot;- 'worst pain imaginable'). This will be considered as
      'baseline test pain' (baseline). Then patients will be asked to immerse their dominant hand
      into a temperature-controlled (10 쨘C) water bath (Heto CBN 8-30 Lab equipment, Allerod,
      Denmark) with a maximum temperature variance of 짹 0.5째C, which is continuously stirred by a
      pump. Following 15 seconds of immersion, while the hand is still in the water bath, a second
      and third test stimulations will delivered with 15 seconds interval between them, and pain
      intensity will be recorded again. Two additional heat stimulations will be delivered 15 and
      30 seconds subsequent to removal of the hand from the water bath. Upon completion of the
      session, patients will be instructed to report the intensity of the pain that will be caused
      by immersing the hand in the water bath (conditioning induced pain intensity). DNIC
      efficiency will by calculated and define as subtraction of pain ratings of the test stimulus
      alone from the mean pain ratings of the test stimulus during hand immersion. Thus, negative
      value indicates greater DNIC efficiency.

      Questionnaires SF-MPQ: Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire The main component of the SF-MPQ
      consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory; 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale as
      0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate or 3 = severe. Three pain scores are derived from the sum of
      the intensity rank values of the words chosen for sensory, affective and total descriptors.

      Pain related questionnaires Psychological and personality factors known to influence pain
      perception will be assessed: pain catastrophizing and state and trait anxiety. Assessment
      will be completed using three questionnaires: (I) The pain catastrophizing scale (PCS),
      comprised of 13 statements evaluating three dimensions of pain catastrophizing: rumination,
      magnification and helplessness. Participants will be instructed to rate their agreement with
      each statement on a scale between 0-4 (0 = &quot;never&quot;, 1 = &quot;almost never&quot;, 2 = &quot;occasionally&quot;, 3
      = &quot;almost often&quot;, 4 = &quot;often&quot;). The questionnaire score is defined as the sum of all ratings
      with a high score indicating high pain catastrophizing levels. (II) Spielberger's state-trait
      anxiety inventory (STAI) that includes two sections each evaluating two distinct features of
      anxiety: state and trait anxiety. Each section constructed of 20 sentences describing
      emotional states. Participants will be instructed to rate their emotions about each sentence
      on a scale between 1-4 (1 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;slightly&quot;, 3 = &quot;moderately&quot; 4 = &quot;highly&quot;). The
      questionnaires score is defined as a sum of all ratings after inverting several specific
      items, when a high score indicates high levels of state/trait anxiety.

      Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire The purpose of the Oswestry Low Back Pain
      Disability Questionnaire is to assess pain-related disability in persons with low back pain.
      The questionnaire consists of 10 items addressing different aspects of function. Each item is
      scored from 0 to 5, with higher values representing greater disability. The total score is
      multiplied by 2 and expressed as a percentage.

      DN4 The DN4 questionnaire consists of 10 items. The first 7 items are related to pain
      characteristics and sensations and the remaining 3 items are related to the examination. For
      each item, a score of ''1'' is given if the answer is ''yes'' and a score of ''0'' is given
      if it is ''no.'' The patient is defined to have neuropathic pain if the sum of all 10 items
      is calculated to be 4 or more.

      Levels of proinflammatory factors in blood and disc tissue Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b,
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, TNF-a, INF-g) will be assessed in blood and disc tissue samples obtained
      at the time of surgery using ProcartaPlex Multiplex Immunoassay and real-time polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR). All assessments, coding and tissue storage will be held in the
      Pathology Laboratory at Rambam healthcare campus.

      Tissue culture results To minimize the risk of contamination, the surgeon will perform all
      processing and culturing procedures intraoperatively, and under stringent, sterile, operating
      theater conditions. During surgery, immediately following intervertebral disc removal, the
      surgeon will dissect the disc material into 4 proximately equal pieces. PCR method will be
      used for detection and identification of several bacterial strains from dissected
      intra-vertebral discs. All assessments, coding and tissue storage will be held in the
      Microbiology Laboratory at Rambam healthcare campus.

      MRI scans of enrolled patients, which are performed regardless to this study protocol, will
      be evaluated for area and size of the disc protrusion.

      Motor examination will be performed using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score
      of neurologic assessment. This score will be tested on five muscles in the affected side of
      the body.

      Muscle strength is graded as:

        -  0 Total paralysis

        -  1 - Palpable or visible contraction

        -  2 - Active movement, full range of motion, gravity eliminated

        -  3 - Active movement, full range of motion, against gravity

        -  4 - Active movement, full range of motion, against gravity and provides some resistance

        -  5 - Active movement, full range of motion, against gravity and provides normal
           resistance [Muscle able to exert, in examiner's judgement, sufficient resistance to be
           considered normal if identifiable inhibiting factors were not present]

        -  NT - not testable. Patient unable to reliably exert effort or muscle unavailable for
           testing due to factors such as immobilization, pain on effort or contracture.

      Study procedure All patients scheduled for lumbar spine surgery due to discogenic low back
      pain and/or sciatica, will be screened by the principal investigator for presence of
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Their baseline neurological function before surgery will be
      assessed and recorded for recruitment into one of the three study groups. MRI scans will be
      assessed for the calculation of disc protrusion size. Experimental sensory and pain
      assessments and questionnaires will be performed at list 24 hours before surgery. Blood
      sample for pro-inflammatory mediator will be obtained at the same time as the experimental
      sensory and pain tests. Pre-operative pain and MPQ will be assessed pre-operatively (back and
      leg pain separately), and again on day 30 after surgery. Blood tests for ESR, CRP will be
      drawn before surgery, during the surgery, and on 30 after surgery. During surgery,
      intervertebral disc material will be harvested and divided into 4 specimens for culture and
      inflammatory mediator analysis. Repeat neurological assessment will be performed 30 after
      surgery.
