  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of important systemic therapies have been developed to treat mCRPC and have received
      regulatory approval and now comprise the current therapeutic landscape. Durable and complete
      response following first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced PC are uncommon. Most
      patients will ultimately experience disease progression within 6-9 months after initial
      response. Optimal Second line therapy in mCRPC is not well established and several options
      are possible.

      Olaparib has demonstrated anti-tumour activity in non-comparative studies in patients with
      germline BReast CAncer gene (gBRCA) mutated cancers including ovarian, breast, pancreas and
      prostate. Olaparib is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult
      patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed Breast Cancer gene-mutated (germline and/or
      somatic) high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer
      who are in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy.

      This phase II study is developed to assess the effect of maintenance treatment with olaparib
      on radiologic progression free survival (rPFS) in patients with mCRPC who have received at
      least 6 cycles of docetaxel and achieved partial or complete response or disease
      stabilization according RECIST 1.1 criteria and PCWG3.
