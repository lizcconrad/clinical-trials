  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that the central nervous system (CNS) plays a pivotal
      role in mobility function with age-associated CNS changes strongly contributing to declining
      mobility. Studies linking the brain to mobility have used anatomical measures like brain
      volume and white matter integrity, and suggest that damage to the connecting fibers of the
      brain (white matter) is related to mobility impairment. Unfortunately, age-related structural
      white matter damage appears irreversible and only indirectly indicates the functional
      connectivity between brain regions. It is believed that functional brain network analyses
      have the potential to identify individuals that may benefit from interventions prior to the
      development of irreversible white matter lesions. The current project will assess both
      physical and cognitive function and integrate these variables with measures of brain network
      connectivity.

      Studies linking the brain to mobility have used anatomical measures like brain volume and
      white matter integrity, and suggest that damage to the connecting fibers of the brain (white
      matter) is related to mobility impairment. Unfortunately, age-related structural white matter
      damage appears irreversible and only indirectly indicates the functional connectivity between
      brain regions. The preliminary data show that directly assessed patterns of functional
      connectivity correlate with mobility function and can be changed by interventions that
      improve mobility function. It is not known how changes in CNS functional connectivity relate
      to changes in mobility, information critical for the design of interventions targeting CNS
      connectivity to improve mobility impairments. It is clear that structural connectivity
      underlies functional connectivity, and that structural brain lesions result in altered
      functional connections. B-NET will assess white matter (WM) disease burden and
      microstructural changes and relate these changes to functional brain network connectivity. We
      hypothesize that because sensory motor cortex community structure (SMC-CS) characterizes
      current brain organization, it will be associated with mobility function independently of
      anatomical damage markers. Such knowledge may permit earlier identification of persons at
      high risk for mobility decline and facilitate earlier and better targeted interventions.

    <measure>Change in Extended Short Physical Performance Battery (eSPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6, 18, and 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>The expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (eSPPB) is a modified version of a widely used assessment of lower extremity physical function that consists of 3 standing balance tasks held for 10 seconds each (side-by-side, tandem and semi-tandem), two 4-m walk tests to assess usual gait speed, and 5 repeated chair stands. To minimize ceiling effects and maximize overall dispersion of test scores, the eSPPB increases the holding time of the semi- and full-tandem stands to 30 seconds and adds a single leg stand and a narrow walk test of balance (walking at usual pace within lines of tape spaced 20 cm apart). eSPPB scores are continuous and range from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicative of better performance.</description>

        Community-dwelling adults reflecting the gender/race composition of Forsyth County in the
        target age-range will be identified. The 70-85 year age-span was chosen because
        epidemiologic data shows accelerating functional decline and increased prevalence of white
        matter abnormalities across this age-range.
