      The TASK (Treating Anxiety after StroKe) trial is a feasibility randomized controlled trial.
      It aims to evaluate the feasibility of i) web-enabled trial procedures, and ii) the TASK
      intervention in stroke and TIA patients

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety after stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is common. It is distressing and
      potentially debilitating. Currently, post-stoke psychological care is inadequate. There is no
      definitive evidence to guide treatment of anxiety post-stroke.

      The TASK intervention is a centralized model for delivering personalised therapy for treating
      anxiety post-stroke using telephone and web-technology.

      The TASK intervention includes:

        -  Treatment website and telephone support

        -  Learning ways to overcome anxiety after stroke/'mini-stroke'

        -  Relaxation techniques

        -  Weekly online tasks

        -  Therapeutic videos

        -  Text reminders and participant record card

        -  Useful links to stroke resources and websites

      The investigators designed the TASK trial to be web-enabled, so that it can be conducted
      entirely remotely.

      In the TASK feasibility randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to evaluate the
      feasibility of:

      i) web-enabled trial procedures: online recruitment, remote eligibility checking, electronic
      informed consent, online self-reported outcome surveys

      ii) feasibility of the TASK intervention in stroke and TIA patients

      This trial received a favourable opinion from the South East Scotland Research Ethics
      Committee (ref: 17/SS/0143)

    <masking_description>Participant receives one of the two TASK interventions. Both are considered active interventions for anxiety.
Once started on the intervention participant may realise the type of intervention he has received, thus unblinding treatment allocation. Participants remain unaware of the contents of intervention given to the other group. Outcomes are self-completed by participants electronically to achieve assessor blinding.</masking_description>
