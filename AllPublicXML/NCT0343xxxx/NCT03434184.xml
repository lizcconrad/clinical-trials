  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of double end spinal instrumentation
      from the upper thoracic to the pelvis with sacro-iliac ﬁxation on the gait of ambulating
      patients suffering from cerebral palsy with pelvic obliquity 6 month after surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pelvic fixations were used since many years for these patients. However there are no
      prospective study investigating the gait evolution before and after a surgical treatment by
      long spinal instrumentation with pelvic fixation.

      Investigators are planning to analyze the gait, before and 6 months after surgery.
      Investigators will use 2 qualitative criterions with a gait analysis and a walking test, and
      1 quantitative criterion with a questionnaire assessing the patient's functional change.
      Investigators will use as surgical treatment a long double end spinal fixation without
      fusion, investigators use an ilio sacral screw as pelvic anchor on each side.

      Evaluation of changes in gait after pelvic fixation of a long spinal instrumentation will
      make it possible to extend or, on the contrary, restrict the indications for pelvic fixation
      surgery in walking patients, who are candidates for pelvic fixation.
