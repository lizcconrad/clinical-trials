  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to examine the effects on post operative pain after the use of a
      fixation device to secure a mesh in the abdomen to repair a hernia of the abdominal wall. The
      fixation devices to be used differ with one being made from titanium and is permanent and the
      other being made from an absorbable material. Both fixation devices are commonly used but two
      questions remain unanswered, does one cause more chronic pain and also what if any will be
      the effect on recurrence rates of the hernia. No trial has been undertaken to date which will
      not only examine the fixation device but in the setting where the hernia is closed first. The
      closure of the hernial defect by the keyhole technique is a relatively new and growing
      concept in the hernia world.

      TACKoMESH study (Comparison of using absorbable tacks (ReliaTack™) against a non-absorbable
      tack (Protack™) to fixate Symbotex™ composite mesh in the elective repair of incisional
      hernia) is a prospective, single-centre, double blinded randomised trial which aims to
      establish whether the use of absorbable (ABS) compared to non-absorbable (Non-ABS) tacks in
      adult patients undergoing elective incisional hernia repair produces a lower rate of pain
      both immediately and long-term. Secondary outcomes to be explored include seroma formation,
      hernia recurrence, length of postoperative hospital stay, wound infection, reoperation rate,
      operation time, health related quality of life and time to return to normal daily activity.

      Patients entering TACKoMesh will be randomised immediately prior to their operation with a
      1:1 ratio of ABS versus Non-ABS tack arm allocation. The same composite mesh will be used for
      all operations. Follow-up is according to a predetermined schedule, using specifically
      designed Case Report Forms to collect the blinded data.
