  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase IV interventional study of adults (18 to 55) having a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
      (mild, moderate or severe). The study is completely voluntary and is designed to measure
      participants use and the effectiveness of the device within the 510K indication of: airway
      clearance therapy when external manipulation of the thorax. The trial period shall be 30 days
      and include use of a FDA cleared pulse oximetry monitor (K131111), manual spirometer as well
      as completion of semi-weekly participant survey.

      Phase IV interventional study, of participants with cystic fibrosis with mild, moderate or
      severe conditions, for the efficacy of the Electro Flo Percussor, Model 5000 (K031876),
      Regulation Number: 21 CFR 868.5665, with current FDA indication of: provide airway clearance
      therapy when external manipulation of the thorax is the physician's choice of treatment.
      Indications for this form of therapy are described by the American Association for
      Respiratory Care (AARC) in the Clinical Practices Guidelines for Postural Drainage Therapy (
      I ) (1991). According to AARC guidelines, specific indications for external manipulation of
      the thorax include evidence or a suggestion of retained secretions, evidence that the patient
      is having difficulty with the secretion clearance, or presence of atelectasis caused by mucus
      plugging. In addition, the Med Systems Electro Flo Percussor Model 5000 is also indicated for
      external manipulation of the thorax to promote airway clearance or improve bronchial drainage
      for purposes of collecting mucus for diagnostic evaluation.
