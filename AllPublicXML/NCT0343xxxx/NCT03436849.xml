  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      oral doses of ESN364 in healthy Japanese male and pre- and post-menopausal female subjects.
      This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ESN364 and its metabolite, and the
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of ESN364 after single and multiple oral doses administration in
      healthy Japanese male and pre- and post-menopausal female subjects.
