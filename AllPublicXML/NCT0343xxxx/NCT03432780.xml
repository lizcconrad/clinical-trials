      of Radiation Therapy, Hormone Therapy and Docetaxel Versus Radiation Therapy and Hormone
      Therapy in Patients with High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer (Stage III and IV) whose primary
      objective is determine the percentage of patients free of biochemical recurrence within 5

      of patients free of biochemical recurrence within 5 years of receiving a combination of
      radiation therapy with docetaxel associated with hormone therapy or the standard of care of
      radiation therapy and hormone therapy in patients with stage III and IV localized prostate
      cancer with a poor prognosis.

      Design: A prospective, multicenter, multidisciplinary, parallel-group, open-label study with

The QLQ-c30 has five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale. They are assigned values between 1 and 4 (1: nothing, 2: a few, 3: enough, 4: a lot) according to the patient's responses to the item, only in items 29 and 30 are assessed with a score from 1 to 7 (1: terrible, 7: excellent). The obtained scores are summed and standardized and gets a score between 0 and 100</description>
