  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with peritoneal disease commonly present with symptoms of abdominal distension and
      subacute intestinal obstruction. This results in poor oral intake leading to these patients
      often presenting in a malnourished state.

      CRS and HIPEC can potential provide improve survival for these patients, however can be a
      hazardous procedure, involving multi-organ resections. The risk is especially high in poorly
      nourished patients.

      The study investigators hypothesize that perioperative immunonutrition can reduce wound
      infections and length of hospital stay, and improve perioperative outcomes. To the
      investigators' knowledge, it has not been evaluated in patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC.
