  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is dedicated to identify the patients with possible higher risk of adenoma
      recurrence who should have follow-up colonoscopy in yearly interval. As a result, it can lead
      to optimizing the of follow-up colonoscopies intervals in real-world practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project, 200 individuals (aged 18 - 75 years) with removed colorectal polyps larger
      than 10 mm during colonoscopy performed based on all indication (including symptoms and
      screening procedures) will be included. All procedures will be done with high quality
      endoscopes (high definition, HD).

      In all polyps, the advanced imaging techniques (such as chromoendoscopy and NBI) will be used
      to determine parts of the polyp suspicious from high-grade dysplasia or cancer. The
      therapeutic method will be decided by the size and macroscopic appearance of the polyp. In
      case of flat, sessile polyps and LST lesions (laterally spreading tumors) EMR or ESD will be
      performed. Pedunculated polyp will be removed by EPE. The goal is to achieve the en-bloc
      resection. Pathologists (with presence of the endoscopist) will do the first step of
      histopathology evaluation (cutting the polyp tissue). The aim is to perform the first cut in
      the most advanced part of the polyp and high density cutting in this area. Standard
      histopathology evaluation will proceed and will be followed by initial basic molecular
      testing.

      Subsequently, all patients will be observed by colonoscopy in one-year intervals with focus
      on polyp recurrence. The group of high-risk patients will be selected with at least one of
      these criteria: 1/ high grade dysplasia adenoma at index colonoscopy; 2/ high score of polyp
      heterogenity at index colonoscopy; 3/ polyps recurrence at follow-up colonoscopy.

      In a high-risk patients group the extensive somatic mutations profiling will be carried out
      according to multitarget sequencing by NGS technologies (next generation sequencing). Same
      testing will be done in randomly selected patients not included in the high-risk group, which
      will be used as a control group for statistical evaluation.
