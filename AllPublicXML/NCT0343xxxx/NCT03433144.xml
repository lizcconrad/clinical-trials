  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to answer the question: Does a single pre-operative dose of tranexamic acid
      have a statistically significant reduction in blood loss during orthognathic surgery?

      If it does, this drug may begin to be used routinely during orthognathic surgery to reduce
      blood loss in our patients.
