  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research in this study is to make participants' transplant safer by reducing
      the risk of developing GVHD and GVHD-related complications by giving participants a dose of
      the drug tocilizumab in addition to the standard approach for GVHD prevention. Tocilizumab
      reduces the risk of inflammation by blocking the effect of Interleukin-6, a protein that
      exists in high levels in the blood when there is inflammation. Participants who receive stem
      cell transplants have high levels of this protein in their blood early after transplant.
      Therefore, the goal of this study is to reduce the risk of inflammation after transplant with
      the addition of Tocilizumab. This could decrease the risk of developing GVHD and
      GVHD-associated complications.
