      A multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2A/ proof-of-concept study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intravenous treatment regimen of 300 mg Anifrolumab
      versus placebo in patients with moderately to severely active RA who did not respond to
      biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and who have a high type I IFN
      gene signature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory joint disorder
      with a prevalence of about 0.5-1% and results in joint inflammation and damage, which causes
      loss-of-function and disability, and ultimately results in loss of labour participation, loss
      of independence in daily life and high societal costs. Conventional synthetic DMARDs
      (csDMARDs), especially methotrexate, represent the first-line treatment in RA. If, however,
      the treatment target is not achieved with the first DMARD strategy escalation in the
      treatment regimen is needed. The current praxis is to add a biological (b) DMARD (e.g. TNF
      inhibitors, TNFi). With the growing evidence that type I IFNs play an important role in RA,
      inhibition of the biological activity of type I IFNs with anifrolumab may be a novel
      efficacious therapy for the treatment of RA and its significant unmet medical need.

      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of Anifrolumab compared to placebo on RA disease activity
      in patients with an increased type I IFN gene signature

      Methods: This is a Phase 2A (proof-of-concept), multicenter, randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled pilot study, to evaluat the efficacy and safety of an intravenous
      treatment regimen of 300 mg Anifrolumab versus placebo. Patients with moderately to severely
      active RA who did not respond to at least one TNFi but who had not more than three bDMARDs
      and who also have a high IFN- transcript score will be included.

      Expected Results: The hypothesis underlying this protocol is that blocking type I IFN
      signaling through the human type I IFN receptor with Anifrolumab will reduce the severity of
      disease in RA patients, who have an activated type I IFN response.

          -  Weigh ≥50.0 kg and ≤100.0 kg at screening

          -  Diagnosis of RA according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA

          -  At study entry, patients must take at least one convetional synthetic (cs)DMARD
             (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine (SSZ)) regularly for at least the
             preceding 12 weeks, with stable doses for at least the preceding 8 weeks.

          -  moderately to severely active RA: ≥4 tender joints of 28 joints examined, ≥4 swollen
             joints of 28 joints examined and an elevated serum C-reactive protein level (CRP).

          -  Received at least one TNF-inhibitor (TNFi) but not more than 3 biological (b)DMARDs
             and discontinued treatment because of an insufficient response after at least 3
             months.

          -  Oral Glucocorticoids (OCS) are allowed at stable doses of ≤10 mg/day prednisone or
             equivalent, if already used before the screening visit, dose must be stable for at
             least 2 weeks, and will be kept stable throughout the course of the study

          -  High type I IFN gene signature test

          -  Seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and negative test for hepatitis B
             surface antigen and hepatitis C - antibodies

          -  Negative serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test at screening (females of
             childbearing potential only).

          -  Females of childbearing potential must use 2 effective methods of avoiding pregnancy,
             only one of which is a barrier method, from screening until 12 weeks after the final
             dose of the investigational product unless the subject is surgically sterile (i.e.,
             bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy), has a
             sterile male partner, is 1 year post-menopausal, or practices sustained
             abstinence.Cessation of birth control after the specified period for investigational
             product should be discussed with a responsible physician. Post-menopausal is defined
             as at least 1 year since last menses and the subject having an elevated follicle-
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level greater than the central laboratory value of
             post-menopausal at screening

             spermicide where commercially available for contraception if sexually active with a
             woman of child bearing potential) from Day 0 until at least 12 weeks after receipt of
             the final dose of the investigational product. It is strongly recommended that female
             partners of child bearing potential of male subjects also use a highly effective
             method of contraception (other than a barrier method) throughout this period.

          -  Male subjects must not donate sperm during the course of the study and for 12 weeks
             after the last dose of the investigational product.

          -  Females with an intact cervix must have documentation of a normal Pap smear with no
             documented malignancy (e.g., cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III [CIN III],
             carcinoma in situ [CIS], or adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS]) within 2 years prior to
             randomization. Any abnormal Pap smear result documented within 2 years prior to
             randomization must be repeated to confirm patient eligibility.

                  to randomisation (documented appropriately in source), and, if warranted, receipt
                  of appropriate treatment for latent TB at or before the first administration of
                  investigational product
