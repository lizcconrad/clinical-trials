  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a chronic condition that is characterized by excessive
      and uncontrollable worry and anxiety. In Canada, 3 to 4% of the population suffer from GAD at
      any point in time. These individuals have a lowered quality of life and are at risk for many
      medical conditions such as coronary heart disease and cancer. Research suggests that both
      pharmacological and psychological approaches are effective for treating GAD in the
      short-term; however, psychological treatments appear to offer the greatest long-term
      benefits. There exist a number of effective psychological treatments for GAD, most of which
      fall into the category of cognitive-behavioural therapy or CBT. In the 1990s, a group of
      Canadian investigators developed a CBT protocol for GAD that included four components. Data
      from five clinical trials suggest that one of the four components is particularly important
      for treatment success: experiencing uncertainty rather than avoiding it in everyday life.
      Stated differently, learning to tolerate and deal with uncertainty appears to be the key to
      decreasing worry and anxiety. Given this finding, the investigators have developed a new
      treatment that exclusively targets intolerance of uncertainty: Behavioural Experiments for
      Intolerance of Uncertainty or BE-IU. The goal of the current proposal is to test the efficacy
      of BE-IU (6 weekly treatment sessions) by comparing it to a Waiting List (WL) control
      condition (6 weeks). A total of 50 participants with a primary diagnosis of GAD will be
      randomly assigned to either BE-IU or WL and will be assessed at 4 time points ranging from
      pre-treatment to 12-month follow-up. The conditions will be compared in terms of treatment
      efficacy and mechanisms. The investigators will also examine the predictors of change during
      the 12-months following treatment. The proposed study will produce data on the efficacy and
      mechanisms of a treatment for GAD that is less costly, less complex and easier to disseminate
      than treatments that are currently available.
