  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      France put a massive effort for improving dementia care through a national Alzheimer plan in
      2008 and this effort was confirmed by the next government (Neurodegenerative Diseases Plan
      2014-2019). Some new care models and interventions have been implemented such as Alzheimer
      specialized teams offering occupational therapy. The teams intervene at home with medical
      prescription. A recent pilot study demonstrated that occupational therapy has the potential
      to bring clinical benefits for both dementia patients and their caregivers. Nevertheless,
      occupational therapy has been designed as a short-term intervention and the end of
      intervention is challenging for therapists and patients. We aim to test the clinical and
      economic efficacy of maintaining occupational therapy over supplementary 4 months in a
      pragmatic randomized controlled trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Alzheimer specialized teams provide &quot;occupational&quot; therapy to maintain or restore the
      functional capacities of patients. After a deep evaluation of the expectations and needs of
      patients and their caregivers, the therapists propose to work one or more specific activities
      that were once pleasant through 12 to 15 sessions at home over 3 months. They also advise
      individuals to optimize home safety. A pilot observational study that we conducted reported a
      significant reduction in behavioral disorders of patients during the first 3 months followed
      by stability. According to the therapists involved in this study, the 3-month format is
      considered too short to produce perennial benefits; stimulation is often interrupted at the
      end of the 3 months, which creates a break in management that can be deleterious for
      patients.

      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of the maintenance of
      occupational therapy for 4 months beyond the three months provided for in the regulatory
      framework for the management of demented patients, Measured by the neuropsychiatric inventory
      (NPI). The secondary objectives will be to study the efficacy on other clinical criteria but
      also to carry out an economic evaluation of the maintenance of occupational therapy.

    <description>Information on the presence, severity and impact of behavioral disorders. NPI is used to evaluate 12 different types of behavior: delusions, apathy, hallucinations, disinhibition, agitation, irritability, depression, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, night behavior, euphoria, change in appetite and eating behaviors. This inventory is based on the responses obtained by an informed caregiver, preferably living with the patient. The interview is preferably conducted with the caregiver in the patient's absence, to facilitate open discussion of behaviors that may be difficult to describe in the presence of the patient. If a disorder is present, the caregiver should rate the disorder (1: sometimes, 2: quite often, 3: frequently, 4: very frequently) and the severity of the disorder (1: mild, 2: average ; 3: important). An overall score ranging from 0 to 144 is then calculated, a high score representing greater symptoms in presence, frequency and severity.</description>

    <description>This 13-item scale explores 6 areas of subjective health: fitness, mood, memory, the patient's relationship with family members, financial hardship, and general health. This tool generates quality of life scores per patient ranging from 13 to 52. This score can be weighted by the answers provided by the caregiver. For this weighting, we multiply the patient score by 2, add the caregiver score and divide by 3 to bring the score back to that of the initial scale.</description>

    <measure>Apathy of the patient via the Apathy inventory.</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire that collects information on the presence of apathy in patients suffering from cerebral pathologies. It allows the assessment of three clinical dimensions of apathy: emotional blurring, loss of initiative and loss of interest. The assessment is based on the answers of the accompanying person, and because of this, it can also be carried out in severe deteriorations. The possibility of obtaining the patient's appreciation also makes it possible to evaluate the patient's awareness of his disorders. The evaluation of these 3 dimensions takes into account the frequency (rated from 1 to 4) and the severity of the symptoms (rated from 1 to 3). The score for each dimension is obtained by multiplying these two scores, so that the score for each dimension varies from 0 (absence of the symptom) to 12 (very frequent symptom and of serious gravity)</description>
