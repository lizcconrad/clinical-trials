    <textblock>
      The regimen being tested in this study is the combination of ixazomib, daratumumab, and
      dexamethasone. This study will look at the efficacy and safety of Ixazomib + Daratumumab +
      Dexamethasone (IDd) in people who have relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

      The study will enroll approximately 60 patients. Participants will be assigned to the
      treatment group:

      • Ixazomib 4.0 mg + Daratumumab 16.0 mg/kg + Dexamethasone 20 mg

      All participants will be asked to take Ixazomib on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle plus
      Daratumumab on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle for Cycles 1 and 2, on Days 1 and 15
      of each 28-day cycle for Cycles 3 through 6 and on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle for Cycle 7 and
      beyond plus Dexamethasone orally on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23 of each 28-day cycle.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 5 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and every 12 weeks
      after PD until death or termination of the study by the sponsor.
