      This trial is multicenter prospective study to evaluate clinical efficacy of respiratory
      rehabilitation personalized mobile services for respiratory disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Lung Cancer or COPD who need respiratory rehabilitation were enrolled in this
      trial. The subjets were randomized to 3 group(A: Fixed respiratory rehabilitation program
      group, B: Mixed respiratory rehabilitation program group(Fixed respiratory rehabilitation for
      6 weeks, and then responsive respiratory rehabilitation for 6 weeks) and C: Control
      group(Ordinary rehabilitation service of the site)).

      Patients in Group A&amp;B were provided with mobile application and wearable O2 saturation
      machine and mobile application monitors physical activity and provides

        1. how to do stretching, weight training with The-ra Band

        2. daily and weekly target of exercise

        3. alarm algorithms depending on patient's respiratory status(purse rate and O2 saturation)

    <measure>change from baseline in Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MMRC dyspnea scale is a five-option grading system. The scale measures a person's limitation base on a scale of 0-4 and uses the final value to determine how much disability is caused by shortness of breath.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline in COPD Assessment Test(CAT) score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is a validated, short and simple subject completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of subjects with COPD. Subjects are scored on eight items (cough, phlegm, chest tightness, breathlessness, activity limitation, confidence, sleep and energy) on a scale of 0-5 depending on their impact. The sum of scores for each item gives the subject's impact score ranging from 0 (no impact) to 40 (worst possible impact).</description>

    <description>Assessment tool: Patient's Global Assessment - Subjects are scored on four items (general, easy-to-follow, helpful in exercise and Physical fitness ) on a scale of 1-5 depending on their satisfaction level. The sum of scores for each item will be used for assessement of the subject's satisfaction in the trial.</description>
