  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is multicenter, prospective, non-randomized post-market. The primary objective is
      to evaluate mid-term (5-year) clinical performance of the TESS Version 2 Anatomic and Reverse
      prostheses in shoulder arthroplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TESS Shoulder System has been developed to provide a complete solution for many
      indications of shoulder arthroplasty. This system is founded on an original concept of an
      epiphyseal fixation with an optional stem. It comprises an Anatomic, a Reverse and a Stemmed
      version, however only the Anatomic and Reverse versions are part of this study.

      200 subjects suitable for TESS Shoulder Replacement are included into this study (Anatomic
      and Reverse). All potential study subjects are required to participate in the Informed
      Consent process.

    <measure>Constant Shoulder Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant score is a 100-point functional shoulder assessment tool in which higher scores reflect increased function. The subjective variables are pain (15 points) and function (activities of daily living - sleep, work, recreation/sport; 20 points), for a total of 35 points. The objective variables are active range of motion (clinician assessment; 40 points) and strength (25 points), for a total of 65 points.</description>

    <measure>Passive and active mobility of the shoulder</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Pre- and Post-Operative outcome measures will be recorded (measures in angles). Passive mobility is assessed by elevation of the scapula, rotation of the elbow. Active mobility is assessed by anterior and lateral elevation and by rotation of the elbow and shoulder.</description>
