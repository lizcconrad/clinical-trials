  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research studies in stuttering have shown that activity patterns in certain brain areas
      differ in people who stutter compared to people who do not stutter when speaking. The purpose
      of this study is to investigate how mild, non-invasive brain stimulation applied
      consecutively for five days affects speech relevant brain areas, which may in turn affect
      speech fluency and speaking-related brain activity in people who stutter.

    <masking_description>A researcher who is not involved in any aspect of the study will randomize participants into the sham and active study arms using a minimization procedure. Allocation concealment will be achieved by assigning a unique 6-digit random code per participant, which will be provided to the researcher. The code is used to deliver stimulation. The participants and the researchers who deliver stimulation, assess outcomes, and analyze data will be masked to trial arm.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in brain activation as assessed by fMRI images</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will use the fMRI images taken from before and after tDCS to determine if the treatment intervention contributed to any changes within brain regions associated with speech production. This will be measured by % Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal change.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in percentage of stuttered syllables produced during speech sample</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will calculate the percentage of stuttered syllables (out of total syllables) in a speech sample. Decreased stuttered syllables represents better outcomes (greater reduction in stuttering).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline on the Overall Assessment of Speakers Experience of Stuttering (OASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The OASES is a standardized assessment of the functional impact of stuttering on a person's life. There are 4 sub-tests: general information about speech, your reactions to stuttering, communication in daily situations, quality of life. Each one has a score from 1 to 5 with regard to impact (1 least, 5 most negative impact). These are combined to give a total impact score between 1 and 5, with 5 representing the highest negative impact on person's life. The change on the total impact score will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline on rhythm judgement task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will compare performance accuracy on a computerized rhythm judgement task from before and after tDCS to assess effects of tDCS. Improved accuracy reflects better performance.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline on tapping tasks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will compare performance on computerized tapping tasks from before and after tDCS to assess effects of tDCS.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes from baseline on self-rated measure of speech fluency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will compare participant scores on a self-rated measure of speech fluency (1 = NO STUTTERING; 9 = EXTREMELY SEVERE STUTTERING) from before and after tDCS to assess effects of tDCS. Lower scores indicate improvement.</description>
