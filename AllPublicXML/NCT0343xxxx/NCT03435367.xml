  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venipuncture and intravenous (IV) access continue to be the most common causes of pain and
      distress among children in the pediatric emergency department. Virtual reality has been
      successful for reducing pain and fear in many clinical scenarios, including port access in
      oncology patients, anxiety disorders, phobias, burn and wound care and others. There is only
      one previous study examining virtual reality distraction to reduce procedural pain during IV
      insertion in pediatric patients and no previous studies examining this in the emergency
      department setting. In this study, the investigators will compare immersive virtual reality
      (an interactive underwater environment) to the current standard (tablet device/iPad playing a
      movie) for distraction to reduce procedural pain during IV insertion. The investigators
      hypothesize that the immersive quality of the virtual reality will reduce patient's pain
      scores, fear scores and tachycardia during and after the procedure, and have minimal effect
      on departmental flow and nursing satisfaction. If this feasibility pilot study yields
      positive results, the investigators plan to expand to a larger randomized control trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot randomized control trial that aims to (a) to determine the differences
      in self-reported and proxy-reported pain and fear during IV insertion between the interactive
      VR intervention and control group, and (b) to assess the feasibility (safety, acceptability)
      of the VR intervention to children/families and the healthcare team in the pediatric
      emergency department. The study will consist of two study arms, where both study arms will be
      screened and recruited using the same procedure. Participants will be randomized into either
      (1) Control group: child life specialist plays an age-appropriate video on a tablet device,
      or (2) Intervention (VR Distraction): child life specialist facilitates immersive VR
      experience. Both the intervention and control groups will receive standard medical care
      (e.g., topical anesthetics). A convenience sample of 80 children and adolescents with cancer
      (40 participants per treatment arm; 20 boys and 20 girls per treatment arm) will be
      recruited. In addition to usual care, children in the experimental condition will wear the VR
      headset plus headphones. In the control condition, children will watch a video (i.e., an
      age-appropriate video selected by an emergency department affiliated child life specialist)
      on an iPad, while wearing the same headphones as in the experimental condition.
      Implementation outcomes include accrual and retention rates, acceptability and technical
      difficulties. Effectiveness outcomes include child pain, distress, and fear, as well as
      parent distress.

    <description>Children will report fear BOTH prior to and following the procedure using the Child Fear Scale (CFS) which is a 5-face visual scale that measures fear intensity and is validated in children as young as 5 years. It consists of a 1-question scale rating fear from 0 - 4, based on the faces provided. A higher number represents higher fear intensity.</description>

    <description>Children will report baseline tendencies to catastrophize about pain using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale - Child (PCS-C). This is a self-report measure of children's tendency to catastrophize about pain validated in children 8-18 years of age. 6-items responded to on an 11-point scale from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 10 (&quot;a lot&quot;), with a higher number representing higher pain catastrophizing.</description>
