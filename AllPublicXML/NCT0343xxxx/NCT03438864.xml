  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interferential current is a form of electrotherapy that is obtained by placing two different
      plates that produce medium frequency waveform current, resulting in a low frequency
      interferential waveform in deeper tissues. It was shown interferential current electrotherapy
      is beneficial for reduction of traumatic edema in tissues and pain control.

      Patients with conservatively managed distal radius fractures were recruited after casts are
      shed, and were treated with one session(30 minutes) of different protocols of interferential
      current electrotherapy. Before and after therapy, they were evaluated with volumetry, hand
      grip strength and visual analogue scale for pain.

    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to dip their hands slowly into a special bucket full of water with volume markings until their middle finger touched to the bottom of the bucket. The spilled amount of water were measured as milliliters.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to express their discomfort level from pain in a scale ranging from 1 to 10(with the help of a 10 cm line), and point they showed were measured as millimeters.</description>

    <measure>Hand Grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to use a hydraulic hand dynamometer for hand grip strength in a position of 10 to 30 degrees of wrist extension, and results were registered as kilograms.</description>
