  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impairment in voice and swallowing functions are common after thyroidectomy. The
      investigators aimed to evaluate the objective functional voice and swallowing outcomes in a
      series of patients undergoing thyroidectomy.

      according to the study, even in the absence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, subjective
      and objective swallowing and voice alterations do occur after thyroidectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 43 consenting patients who underwent thyroidectomy were prospectively recruited.
      Subjective evaluation of swallowing was assessed with 'Swallowing Impairment Score' and 'MD
      Anderson Dysphagia Inventory'. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was
      applied for objective evaluation. Also, functional oral intake scale (FOIS) and functional
      outcome swallowing scale (FOSS) were used for swallowing assessment. Voice evaluation was
      assessed with videostrobolaryngoscopy (VSL) and 'The Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP)'
      was used for capturing and analyzing the voice samples. All evaluations were performed
      preoperatively and on 1st day, 2nd week and 6th months postoperatively.
