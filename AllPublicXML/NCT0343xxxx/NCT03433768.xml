  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AR is a steroid hormone receptor that regulates various genes' expression and affects
      cellular proliferation and differentiation. Androgens interact with AR, exert their paracrine
      action on granulosa cells and regulate gonadotropin synthesis, follicle development, oocyte
      maturation and corpus luteum function. Estrogens increase AR mRNA and testosterone binding
      site in uterine endometrium and leiomyoma. In human cancer cells, low estradiol increases AR
      levels, suggesting the estrogen/androgen ratio as a predictor of sex steroid response. AR
      mRNA expression is, also, regulated by progesterone. Although AR mRNA is expressed in the
      female reproductive tissues, its expression has never been studied in peripheral blood.

        Forty normal responders and twenty-seven poor responders according to Bologna criteria,
        undergoing IVF/ICSI. Ovarian stimulation was performed with 200 IU recombinant follicle
        stimulating hormone (rFSH) and gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists.
        Triggering of final oocyte maturation was performed by recombinant human chorionic
        gonadotrophic (rhCG)
