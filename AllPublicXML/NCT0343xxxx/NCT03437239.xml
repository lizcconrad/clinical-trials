    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled pilot study evaluating the effect of occlusion training on bone
      density and function of the upper extremity following a biceps tenodesis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow restriction training, resistance exercise performed with a specialized venous
      tourniquet, leads to beneficial changes in muscle strength at low resistance and minimal
      stress on the nearby joint. Early research further indicates that it improves systemic bone
      mineral density with change in bone turnover markers. This novel resistance training has the
      potential to improve muscle strength and bone density in individuals who are medically unable
      to perform high resistance exercises typically required to improve these attributes. Our
      study will examine the effect of occlusion training on bone density and function of the upper
      extremity following a bicep tenodesis. The primary objective of the intervention is to
      achieve improved bone density and accelerated recovery of upper extremity function as
      assessed using measures such as validated questionnaires, functional outcome testing,
      strength testing, and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.

    <measure>Elbow Flexion Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Elbow Flexion Strength will be assessed using the BTE PrimusRS dynamometer after the completion of the rehabilitation protocol, approximately 18 weeks postoperative. The patient will be seated with a lap belt to perform testing, to include isokinetic measurements of elbow flexion and forearm supination. The patient will perform 3 trials of one repetition on both the operative forearm and the contralateral arm of both elbow flexion and supination. The PrimusRS will generate a number of pounds of force used, which will be averaged for each side and used for analysis to represent strength. The BTE PrimusRS has been validated for measuring strength and used in numerous studies for various joints and movements to include elbow flexion and forearm supination</description>

    <description>Grip strength will be assessed using the JAMAR Hand Dynamometer. It has been selected for use in this study as per the recommendation by the American Society for the Surgery of the Hand and American Society of Hand Therapists ASHT) as the tool of choice to measure grip strength. Studies have shown that the JAMAR dynamometer has high instrument and test-retest reliability. Grip strength will be tested according to the testing position and procedure recommended by the ASHT. The mean of three successive trials will be recorded. There are established normative data for grip strength by both age and hand dominance.</description>

    <measure>Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An 11-point verbal Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (Appendix F) will be used to assess the subject's upper extremity pain the day of each assessment as well as during therapy sessions. The 0 to 10 NRS has been found to be valid and reliable in many patient populations including the musculoskeletal population [64] and has been recommended for inclusion in the core NIH Toolbox for use with adults</description>

    <measure>Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The QuickDASH consists of 11 items that measure physical function and symptoms in musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb. The QuickDASH includes two optional scales to assess a patient's function with work activities as well as sports or playing an instrument. The QuickDASH is scored in two components: the 11-item disability section where each item is scored 1-5, and the optional work and sport/music modules. This study will only use the disability section. Respondents indicate the amount of difficulty they have performing the items (1=no difficulty, 6=unable). Scores are summed and averaged and the value is transformed to a score out of 100 by subtracting one and multiplying by 25. A higher score indicates greater disability. The QuickDASH has been validated and shown to be reliable when compared to the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand</description>

    <measure>Functional Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Specific Functional Scale is a patient-specific outcome measure to assess functional status. The patient is asked to identify three to five activities that he or she has difficulty performing due to his or her condition. The patient then rates the amount of limitation he or she has in performing each of these activities on an 11-point scale with 0 being unable to perform the activity and 10 being able to perform the activity with no problem. An average score for the activities gives an ability score out of 10. The PSFS has been shown to be valid and responsive in the upper extremity musculoskeletal patient population</description>

    <intervention_name>Delfi PTS II Portable Tourniquet System</intervention_name>
    <description>This is a portable tourniquet system that allows for occlusion of venous outflow without inhibiting arterial blood flow. This portable tourniquet system allows for rapid cuff inflation and deflation with a battery. The Delfi PTS is a purpose-built system that allows for precise control of pressure throughout training, despite the natural changes in muscle shape and length. The device has advanced pressure leak detection that monitors the tourniquet cuff, tubing, and connectors for air leaks and safely alerts staff to hazards or follow-up actions required. The device has visual and audio alarms for over and under pressure and elapsed time as well as a large, easily visible display of tourniquet pressure and elapsed time. The Delfi PTS II calibrates and self-tests on startup. It has a safety interlock that limits the normal maximum pressure and integrated tourniquet cuff testing as recommended in current AORN Standards and Recommended Practices</description>
