  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, multi-centre, PMS cohort study is to monitor the safety of
      Cervarix, which is the first HPV vaccine licensed for use in China, to help prevent cervical
      cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18. The vaccine was approved by China Food and Drug
      Administration (CFDA), in July 2016.

      As per Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) commitment, this study will collect data
      regarding the safety of the vaccine, related information on potential immune-mediated
      diseases (pIMDs); which are diseases that could affect the immune system, and the effect on
      pregnancy outcomes (POs) including birth defects in the newborn.

      Cervarix was approved for use in females between 9-25 years of age, for the prevention of
      cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1), cervical intraepithelial
      neoplasia grade 2, grade 3 (CIN 2/3) and adenocarcinoma in situ caused by high-risk human
      papillomavirus (HR-HPV) types 16 and 18.

      The exposed set (ES) will comprise of approximately 3000 subjects, who will be vaccinated
      with Cervarix, on a voluntary basis, as per standard practice. The study will collect
      information on any adverse event following immunisation, pIMDs, POs and congenital anomalies.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with medically attended adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 30-day period (Day 1-30), following each immunisation with Cervarix.</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which follows immunisation, whether or not considered related to the vaccine. An AEFI can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a vaccine. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.
Medically attended AEFIs are defined as events leading to an otherwise unscheduled visit to or from medical personnel for any reason, including emergency room visits. If a medically-attended AEFI leads to hospitalisation (or meets any other serious AEFI criteria), it will be reported as serious AEFI.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with serious adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the period starting at the first immunisation (Day 1) and ending either 12 months following the third immunisation (Month 18) or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix (Month 24), whichever occurs first.</time_frame>
    <description>A serious AEFI is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the period starting at the first immunisation (Day 1) and ending either 12 months following the third immunisation (Month 18) or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix (Month 24), whichever occurs first.</time_frame>
    <description>Potential immune-mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset of AEFIs that include autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects reporting pregnancies and outcomes of reported pregnancies</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (from Day 1 up to either 12 months following the third immunisation or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix, whichever occurs first.)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects reporting pregnancies and outcomes of reported pregnancies (elective abortion for medical reasons, spontaneous abortion or congenital anomaly) when Cervarix is administered to the subject, inadvertently within 60 days before pregnancy onset, or any time during pregnancy, is reported.
Note: The timeframe may be extended to collect information on the pregnancy outcome.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects reporting pregnancies resulting in offspring with congenital anomalies</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study period (from Day 1 up to either 12 months following the third immunisation or 24 months following the first immunisation with Cervarix, whichever occurs first.)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of subjects reporting pregnancies resulting in offspring with congenital anomalies when Cervarix is administered inadvertently to the subject, within 60 days before pregnancy onset or any time during pregnancy, is reported.
Note: The timeframe may be extended to collect information on the child's health at 12 months of age.</description>

    <description>This study assesses the safety of GSK Biologicals' Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine when administered routinely according to the Prescribing Information in female Chinese subjects aged between 9 and 25 years.
The intervention consists in the active surveillance of adverse events following immunization and pregnancy outcomes if the vaccine is administered inadvertently during pregnancy. Information of potential adverse events and pregnancy outcomes will be collected at immunisation visits, telephone contacts and through spontaneous reporting by the patient/LAR/physician.</description>
