  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of transcutaneous direct
      current stimulation (tsDCS) in major depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to 1) determine the efficacy and safety of tsDCS in adult patients with MDD
      and 2) investigate interoceptive awareness, somatic symptoms, autonomic and metabolic
      regulation as potential mediators of antidepressant response to tsDCS. We predict that 1)
      Active tsDCS treatment will result in a greater decrease in depressive symptom severity
      compared to Sham tsDCS in adult patients with MDD, 2) active tsDCS will be safe and well
      tolerated in adult patients with MDD and 3) change in interoceptive awareness, somatic
      symptoms, and autonomic and metabolic parameters will be associated with change in depressive
      symptom severity. To accomplish these aims, we will conduct an 8-week, double blinded,
      randomized, sham controlled, parallel group, pilot clinical trial study design. A total of 20
      adult antidepressant-free MDD patients will be randomized to receive Active (n=10) or Sham
      (n=10) tsDCS protocols for 8 weeks in a 1:1 ratio. We will combine the use of a tsDCS device,
      psychometric instruments to diagnose MDD, and measures of depressive symptom severity,
      somatic symptoms, interoceptive awareness, autonomic function (blood pressure, heart rate),
      and potential metabolic markers as predictors of response.
