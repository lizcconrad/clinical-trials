    <textblock>
      Background :An important risk factor for aspiration is gastric volume, determined in large
      part by gastric emptying. Unfortunately, measuring gastric volume over time is not easy, and
      scintigraphy has remained the gold standard technique for many years. Ultrasound has
      progressively emerged as a useful substitute due to its reduced cost and ease of performance
      Objectives:Assess whether ultrasonographic measurement of antral cross sectional area (CSA)
      can be used reliably for the diagnosis of risk stomach which defined by a gastric content
      volume at risk of clinical consequences for pulmonary aspiration (i.e., presence of solid
      particles and/or gastric fluid volume &gt;1.5 ml/kg) during the preoperative period in
      longstanding diabetic patients.

      Study population :

        -  -Longstanding diabetic patients (group D)

        -  -Non diabetic patients (group N) Study Design : Prospective observational study This
           study will be conducted at Kasr alainy Hospital; Faculty of Medicine, Cairo
           University.Patients scheduled for elective operations need General Anesthesia (GA) with
           endotracheal intubation in theatre of general surgery Preoperative ultrasound to assess
           gastric residual volume then general anesthesia induction will be Modified
           Rapid-sequence Induction as follow; Group (D)/(N) : propofol 2-3mg/kg and fentanyl 1
           µg/Kg followed by Rocuronium 0.6-1.2 mg/kg.

      Suction of Gastric Contents by Nasogastric tube (18 french) will be inserted First set of
      analysis will be comparing preoperative US findings in 2 groups.

      Second set of analysis will be finding correlation between US findings and suction volume in
      two groups.

      Outcome parameters: To assess the residual gastric volume in longstanding diabetic patients
      compared to non diabetic patients.

      Sample Size ; was calculated as 48 patients (24) in each group.
