      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics of TAK-536 and effect of food on

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-536. TAK-536 is being tested in Japanese
      healthy adult male participants. This study will look at the pharmacokinetics and effect of
      food on the pharmacokinetics following single oral administration of TAK-536 pediatric
      formulation.

      The study will enroll 12 healthy participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups and will receive a single
      oral dose of 10 mg of TAK-536 pediatric formulation with 200 mL of water according to the
      following treatments in each period during the study.

        -  Treatment Group A: single oral administration in the morning under fasted condition
           (Period 1), followed by single oral administration after breakfast (Period 2)

        -  Treatment Group B: single oral administration after breakfast (Period 1), followed by in
           the morning under fasted condition (Period 2)

      This single-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately one month. Participants will make five visits to the clinic and be
      hospitalized for eight days in total.
