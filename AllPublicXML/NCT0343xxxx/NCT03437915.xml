  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial breast irradiation is typically performed after surgical removal of the tumor.
      Partial breast irradiation allows for focused radiation to the area from which the cancer was
      removed, sparing breast tissue from the potential bad effects of radiation compared to
      radiating the whole breast, which was the standard of care for many years. This study is
      evaluating the use of partial breast irradiation with NIBB performed before surgery instead
      of after surgery.This should allow researchers to target the cancer even more accurately and
      result in less normal breast tissue receiving radiation which may cause less side effects
      and/or a better cosmetic outcome.

      In this study partial breast treatment will be given with NIBB in 5 treatments over about 1
      week. Surgical removal of the tumor will then be performed between 4-12 weeks following
      radiation treatment. Researchers believe that participant's risk of complications from
      surgery will not be higher after getting these radiation treatments than it would have been
      if participants had surgery first, but that is one of the things researchers are studying.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed histological diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma and/or DCIS (Invasive
             lobular carcinoma excluded);

          -  Age greater or equal to 60 years old;

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months;

             surgery as confirmed in writing by treating physician in consultation with surgeon

          -  Clinically lymph node negative (cN0) as confirmed in writing by patient's treating
             physician. If patient has suspicious lymphadenopathy on imaging it is required that

          -  Estrogen receptor positive if invasive disease (DCIS can be ER negative);

          -  Her2neu negative if invasive disease;

          -  Nuclear Grade 1 or 2 if invasive disease (DCIS can be Grade 3);

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 (Appendix 1);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Excisional biopsy or ipsilateral breast surgery within 6 months;

          -  Invasive lobular histology;

          -  Definitive LVSI on biopsy;

          -  Suspicious imaging findings suggesting multi-focal or multi-centric disease, unless
             biopsy proven benign;

          -  Paget's disease of the nipple

          -  Distant metastases;

          -  Known BRCA 1/2 Mutation

          -  Active lupus or scleroderma,;

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorder that would preclude attending follow-up;

          -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy (adjuvant therapy is permitted);

          -  Breast Implants;

          -  Tumor not well visualized on AccuBoost imaging;

          -  Breast separation with compression &gt; 8cm at time of simulation.
