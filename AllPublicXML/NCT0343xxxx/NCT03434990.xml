  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim will be to compare a experimental group submitted to a protocol of spinal
      manipulation and myofascial release; and a control group composed by spinal manipulation
      only, in individuals with chronic non-specific low back pain. This is a randomized controlled
      trial, characterized by the application of manual therapy, in two modalities: spinal
      manipulation plus myofascial release and spinal manipulation alone. Participants will be
      enrolled and randomly allocated into two groups: 1) spinal manipulation plus myofascial
      release, totaling 6 sessions, 2x/week, for 3 weeks; 2) spinal manipulation: 6 sessions,
      2x/week, for 3 weeks. Participants will be evaluated in two different moments: 1) Baseline
      (pre-intervention); 2) at the end of intervention period (3 weeks). The primary outcomes will
      be pain intensity (measured in centimeters with the visual analogue scale - VAS) and
      functionality (measured by the Quebec questionnaire - QDS). The secondary outcomes will be
      muscle function (measured by isokinetic dynamometer and Biering-Sorensen test), postural
      balance (measured by the Y Balance test), pain threshold (algometry, in kgf) and perception
      of recovery (Likert scale of 6-points). Data analysis will be performed with the SPSS
      (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) software version 24.0. Data normality
      assumptions will be confirmed by the Shapiro Wilk test. If the assumptions were met, a mixed
      ANOVA with repeated measures will be adopted, based on the outcomes (pain, functionality,
      muscle strength and postural balance) and the independent variables (groups), for the
      comparison between pre-intervention and post-intervention. Spinal manipulation plus
      myofascial release is expected to have better effects than spinal manipulation alone,
      associated with the outcomes of interest.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized controlled trial, characterized by the application of manual therapy, in which subjects will be randomly allocated into two groups: spinal manipulation plus myofascial release and spinal manipulation. The participants will be individuals with non-specific chronic low back pain. The study will be reported following the recommendations of the CONSORT Statement. For the present study, non-specific chronic low back pain was defined as uninterrupted low back pain for more than 12 weeks, with unknown causes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>2x/week, for 3 weeks, performed by a chiropractor. Sessions will last 20 minutes, with 1 individual per session. Myofascial release will be done on paravertebral muscle (Erector spinae, quadratus lumborum) and on gluteus maximus and piriform muscles, the pressure will depend of pain tolerance of each subject. After this procedure, the spinal manipulation will be performed on the sacroiliac join and on the lumbar vertebrae with less mobility.</description>

    <description>The protocol will be composed by myofascial release followed by spinal manipulation. Paravertebral muscles and gluteus maximus and piriform muscles will be manually checked for tension, stiffness, spasm and painful points. The intervention will be composed by: trigger points release, release of muscle fascia and active release technique. The myofacial release will be done with a constant pressure during 30 seconds, 3x in each point. After this procedure, the spinal manipulation will be performed in high velocity and low amplitude thrust technique, on the lumbar spine and sacroiliac joint.</description>
