    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1/2a dose escalation study with an expansion phase to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary
      efficacy of CORT125281 in combination with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) to identify a recommended dose (RD) for Phase 2
      studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CORT125281 is a selective glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist. In this study, CORT125281
      will be administered orally in combination with enzalutamide to patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of the regimen. The study
      consists of two phases: a dose-escalation phase and an expansion phase. The dose escalation
      phase is designed to determine DLTs, MTD/biologically active doses and the RD of CORT125281
      plus enzalutamide in patients with mCRPC. Once the recommended dose has been determined, the
      following expansion cohorts will be enrolled and treated with CORT125281 plus enzalutamide at
      the recommended dose level.

        1. Patients who have progressed during treatment with abiraterone, and have received no
           other androgen receptor (AR)-blocking therapies

        2. Patients who have progressed during treatment with enzalutamide or other
           second-generation AR inhibitors.

      The effect of food on CORT125281 PK will be assessed in a portion of the patients enrolled in
      the Expansion Phase. The expansion cohorts will be enrolled in parallel.

      In each phase of the study, routine assessments of safety and tolerability will be performed
      using adverse event (AE) monitoring, measurement of vital signs, recording 12 lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination and clinical laboratory safety tests, and
      samples will be collected to determine standard PK parameters for CORT125281, enzalutamide,
      and their major metabolites. PD, quality of life evaluations and preliminary evaluations of
      anti-tumor activity of CORT125281 with enzalutamide will be performed throughout the study.

             condom and another form of birth control must be used during and for 100 days after
             completing treatment with CORT125281 or enzalutamide. A condom is required during and
             for 100 days after completing treatment with enzalutamide if a patient is engaged in
             sexual activity with a pregnant woman. Patients must also agree to avoid sperm
             donation during the study and for at least 100 days after the final treatment
             administration.
