      Single-arm, two-center, Phase I/II clinical trial assessing the pharmacokinetics (PK),
      safety, and tolerability of once-weekly rifapentine and isoniazid (3HP) for the treatment of
      latent tuberculosis infection among individuals with HIV infection taking dolutegravir-based
      (DTG) antiretroviral treatment. The study population will be individuals with HIV taking DTG
      and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for â‰¥ 4 weeks, who have a suppressed HIV-1
      viral load (VL), and are candidates to receive TB preventive therapy. Sample size is 60
      participants divided into two main groups Group 1 (1A (n=12) and B (n=18)) and Group 2(n=30).
      The first 12 participants (Group 1A) will undergo semi-intensive PK sampling and will be key
      to determining whether an increased dosing of DTG is required in groups 1B and Group 2 due to
      accelerated DTG clearance due to 3HP induced drug-drug-interactions. Group 1B will receive
      dolutegravir at the new dose (if applicable) and will also undergo semi-intensive PK
      sampling. The subsequent 30 (Group 2) will receive DTG at the new dose and will only have
      sparse PK sampling.

  <detailed_description>

      Single-arm, single-center, Phase I/II clinical trial, in two Groups. Individuals with HIV
      infection taking EFV and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) who have
      undetectable HIV viral load and an indication for treatment of LTBI, will be switched to DTG
      with tenofovir/emtricitabine for at least two months and will receive weekly HP for 12 total
      doses. Individuals who are on an existing DTG-based plus two NRTI ART regimen for at least
      eight weeks (and have not received efavirenz or nevirapine for at least two months) who have
      an undetectable HIV viral load may also participate.

      Group 1 (n=30): The first 12 participants (Group 1A) will take dolutegravir 50 mg once daily
      (with tenofovir/emtricitabine) from Days 1-57. Semi-intensive PK sampling for dolutegravir
      will be performed on Day 57. Participants will continue once-daily dolutegravir and will
      receive once-weekly HP for 12 total doses beginning on Day 58. Semi-intensive PK sampling for
      dolutegravir will be performed on Day 72 (with the 3rd dose of HP) and Day 108 (following the
      8th dose of HP). Trough concentrations (CT) will be measured on Days 59, 74, and 78. VL will
      be measured at baseline and weeks 11 and 24. Safety labs (CBC, U&amp;E and creatinine and liver
      function tests) will be obtained at baseline, and weeks 9, 11, 13, 16, 20 and 24. PK
      assessments will be performed at weeks 9 and 11 for rifapentine and at week 11 for isoniazid.

      After the 12 Group 1A participants have completed the second semi-intensive PK visit, an
      interim PK, safety, and VL assessment will be performed to ensure that the 50 mg once daily
      dose is safe and meets PK targets. The subsequent 18 participants in Group 1 (Group 1B) will
      receive either dolutegravir 50 mg or a higher dose of dolutegravir, if dose adjustment is
      required (e.g. dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily just on HP dosing days, dolutegravir 50 mg
      twice daily seven days a week, etc.) Group 2 (n=30): These participants will receive
      dolutegravir and HP at the same doses and dose schedule as the participants in Group 1B. They
      will undergo safety assessments at baseline and weeks 9, 11, 13, 16, 20 and 24; HIV VL
      assessments at baseline and weeks 11 and 24. Sparse (trough) PK samples for dolutegravir will
      be collected on two occasions.

    <intervention_model_description>Group 1: The first 12 participants (Group 1a) will take dolutegravir 50mg once daily (with tenofovir/emtricitabine) plus once weekly rifapentine/ isoniazid for the study period. Semi-intensive PK measurements of dolutegravir,rifapentine,isoniazid will be collected at protocol-defined intervals.
An interim pharmacokinetic, safety,and HIV viral load assessment will be performed to ensure that dolutegravir 50mg once daily is safe and meets PK targets.
The next 18 participants (Group 1B) will receive either dolutegravir 50mg or a higher or more frequent dose of dolutegravir, if adjustment is required, plus once weekly rifapentine/isoniazid. Semi-intensive PK measurements of dolutegravir,rifapentine,isoniazid will be collected at protocol-defined intervals.
Group 2: The next 30 participants will receive dolutegravir at the same dose and frequency as Group 1B. Sparse PK samples of dolutegravir, safety labs and HIV viral load will be measured at protocol-defined intervals.</intervention_model_description>
