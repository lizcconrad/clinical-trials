    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the bioequivalence (BE) of new 600 milligram (mg)
      Cisticid tablet (Test) versus 600 mg Biltricide tablets (Reference) at a dose of 1200 mg in
      healthy male subjects. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the active ingredient for Cisticid and
      Biltricide tablets.
