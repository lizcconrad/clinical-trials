    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an extremely high mortality disease, and ultrasound has
      been recommended for the screening of AAA, which is highly sensitive and specific. Studies
      have shown that screening for AAA in the population can significantly reduce deaths from
      ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, those study mainly focus on cardiovascular
      disease patients or general population, no previous study target on obstructive sleep apnea
      hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) population. Retrospective studies show that the incidence of apnea
      syndrome in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm is higher than that in the control group,
      which suggests that OSAHS may be one of the causes of abdominal aortic aneurysm. At present,
      there is no relevant research on the screening of AAA in OSAHS population.

      The main objective of this study was to screen the prevalence of AAA in OSAHS population by a
      cross-sectional study.
