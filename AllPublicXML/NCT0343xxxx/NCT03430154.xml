  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An online web-based cross-sectional survey in which participants will complete a distinct
      questionnaire for patients with hemophilia and obesity (PwHO) and/or their
      carers/spouses/partners, or a distinct questionnaire for healthcare professionals. Each
      questionnaire consists of more than 100 items including pre-coded (multiple choice)
      closed-ended questions, yes/no questions and rating scales. It is estimated that this one-off
      survey will take approximately 45-60 minutes to complete.

      As a cross-sectional study, there will be no treatment of patients.
