  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the group with an additional plastic stent to
      anchor the fully covered self expandable metal stent (FCSEMS) in patients with malignant
      biliary stricture has less stent migration than the group with FCSEMS only. The primary
      outcome is stent migration for 6 months. The secondary outcomes are stent related adverse
      events, stent patency, and overall survival.

      Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage using a plastic stent for the treatment of malignant
      biliary stricture has advantages in that it is easy to perform and low cost, but it has a
      short period of patency. To overcome this drawback, self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) have
      been developed and are now widely used. But, over time, the SEMS also develop restenosis, due
      to tumor ingrowth and the tissue hyperplasia caused by the stimulation of the surrounding
      tissues by the metal thin wire. To overcome these disadvantages, a fully covered
      self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) covered with a polymer coating have been developed and
      used. However, the FCSEMS showed more stent migration than the uncovered SEMS, which was not
      superior to the uncovered SEMS in terms of loss of stent function. In order to overcome the
      limitations of the FCSEMS, small-scale studies have shown that stent migration can be reduced
      by anchoring the FCSEMS using a plastic stent. To date, there has been no randomized
      controlled study to determine whether the FCSEMS can be anchored with a plastic stent in
      patients with malignant biliary stricture to reduce the stent migration. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of plastic stent anchoring to reduce
      migration of FCSEMS.

    <description>Stent migration is classified as proximal or distal migration. Proximal stent migration is defined as any migration of the FCSEMS(Fully covered self expandable metal stent) into the bile duct, preventing its easy removal.
Distal stent migration is defined in three ways. The first is when the stent is completely distally migrated without being lodged into the duodenum.
The second is when the stent is lodged in the distal bile duct below the stricture.
The third case is when the stent is migrated to the distal portion of the stricture and is lodged in the duodenum opposite the papilla</description>
