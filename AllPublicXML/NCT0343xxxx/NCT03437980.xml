  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient's safety and satisfaction are major concerns of anesthesiologists and obstetricians.
      According to evidence, guidelines and quality markers, regional anesthesia is preferred over
      general anesthesia in obstetric surgery. A high level of anxiety is present in obstetric
      patients preoperatively. Patients with high anxiety tend to prefer general anesthesia for
      cesarean section. The anxiety can be reduced variably by non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic
      methods. The evidence supports the benefits of procedural sedation for distressed, anxious
      pregnant women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Propofol provides short onset, rapid predictable action, anxiolysis and amnesia and it is
      more effective than benzodiazepines. Using propofol infusion in low doses during spinal
      injection in CS did not adversely affect the Apgar scores or the neurological and adaptive
      fetal outcomes. The general consensus is that procedural sedation is not a routine for spinal
      interventions, but required for anxious patients. Our hypothesis is that, with the high
      prevalence of maternal anxiety during cesarean section, ensuring painless comfortable spinal
      anesthesia may increase the acceptance rate of regional anesthesia during cesarean section.

    <description>The surgeon and the anesthetist will discuss the exclusion criteria. Then they will discuss the information's about spinal and general anesthesia with the illegible patients, also reply the patient's questions in a preoperative visit. The primary decision for the patient; either spinal or general anesthesia will be recorded.
The patients refusing spinal anesthesia will be discussed again to detect the rate of acceptance of spinal anesthesia if propofol sedation is ensured during the procedure to provide a painless spinal injection. The final decision will be applied; either spinal with procedural sedation, or general anesthesia.</description>

Patients will be sitting on the middle of the operating table facing towards the table's foot. The table's foot will be dropped 45 degrees for a comfortable chair position, Monitoring through pulse oximeter (SaO2), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) adjusted every 2 minutes automatic measuring and capnography tube in contact with nostrils.</description>
