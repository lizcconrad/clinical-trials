      To determine the clinical benefit rate of selumetinib in combination with vistusertib in

      I. Primary Objective

      • To determine the clinical benefit rate of selumetinib in combination with vistusertib in
      patients with unresectable or metastatic NF1 associated or sporadic MPNST

      II. Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To define and describe the toxicities of selumetinib in combination with vistusertib in
           patients with unresectable or metastatic NF1 associated or sporadic MPNST.

        -  To assess the impact on intensity and pain interference and correlate to changes in
           clinical, imaging response and progression

        -  To assess progression free and overall survival

      Selumetinib will be given orally 75mg twice daily continuously and vistusertib will be given
      orally 125mg twice daily 2 days on/5 days off. One cycle will be 28 days. Patients will be
      able to remain on treatment as long as they do not experience progressive disease or
      unacceptable toxicity. Stage 1 will require 7 patients, with no further accrual if 0 of 7
      respond. If 1 or greater of the 7 patients respond, accrual will continue until 21 patients
      have been enrolled.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This study will use CTEP Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting. The toxicities will be graded and summarized descriptively and tabulations on the type, severity and relationship to study treatment will be performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the impact on pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference metrics will be assessed using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurements Information System (PROMIS) scale to assess the impact of pain on daily activities. This is a self-report measure that assesses the degree to which pain has interfered with the ability to complete daily activities over the past 7 days. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale and the measures yield standardized T-scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the impact on pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain metrics will be assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11) scale to assess pain severity. The scale consists of a horizontal line with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 representing &quot;worst pain you can imagine.&quot; Patients will circle one number from 0 to 10 that best describes how much their tumor pain hurt during the past week.</description>

    <description>Selumetinib (AZD6244) is an oral selective inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) 1/2 currently in development for adult malignancies and pediatric low-grade gliomas. MEK is a critical kinase in the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signal transduction pathway for many growth factor receptors that provide growth signals to cancer cells.</description>

    <description>Vistusertib is an oral selective inhibitor of the kinase activity of mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) serine threonine kinase and inhibits signaling of both mTOR complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2. It has a more profound mTORC1 inhibition and broader range of inhibitory activity in vitro across tumor types compared to rapalogues.</description>
