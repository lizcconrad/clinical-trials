    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is designed to evaluate the enumeration of circulating
      tumor cells and identify the potential biomarkers associated with clinical outcome. The
      secondary objective is to explore whether the changes of tumor related rare cells associates
      clinical outcome.
