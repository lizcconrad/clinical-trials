      This study aims to assess the analgesic effect of the popliteal plexus block as a supplement
      to a femoral triangle block in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A femoral triangle block (FTB) effectively anesthetizes the anterior group of nerves
      innervating the knee (infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve, the medial femoral
      cutaneous nerve and the terminal branch of the medial vastus muscle nerve). However, the
      posterior group of nerves innervating the knee joint is not covered with an FTB, and
      therefore most patients complain of significant, opioid-requiring pain despite a succesful
      FTB.

      The posterior group consists of the popliteal plexus, which is derived from the tibial nerve
      and the posterior branch of the obturator nerve. The popliteal plexus is located in the
      popliteal fossa, where it entwines the popliteal artery and vein. Recent cadaver studies have
      suggested that an injection into the distal part of the adductor canal will spread to the
      popliteal fossa (PubMed ID: 28937534; PubMed ID: 27442773).

      This study aims to assess the analgesic effect of the popliteal plexus block (PPB) as a
      supplement to a femoral triangle block (FTB) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

      In the study all patients will receive an FTB with 10 ml bupivacaine-epinephrine
      (0.5%-1:200,000) with the addition of 0.5 ml Dexamethasone (4 mg/ml).

      All patients are postoperatively observed for the development of significant pain (NRS &gt; 3)
      in the primary observation period (POP) defined as: a 3-hour observation period starting at
      the return of completely normal cutaneous sensation (lateral thigh and lateral side of the
      lower leg) after spinal anesthesia. If the patient reports pain (NRS &gt; 3) in the POP, the
      patient will be randomized to the study treatment - a PPB with 10 ml bupivacaine-epinephrine
      or 10 ml saline.

    <description>Success of the PPB is defined as the proportion of patients with significant postoperative pain (NRS &gt; 3) after FTB, who drop in pain score to NRS ≤ 3 after PPB and maintain NRS ≤ 3 without any opioids until 60 minutes after PPB</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Onset time of the PPB</measure>
    <time_frame>The pain scores after PPB are evaluated every 5 minutes until 15 minutes after PPB and hereafter every 15 minutes until 60 minutes after PPB</time_frame>
    <description>The onset time is defined as the time from withdrawal of the block needle and until the patient reports NRS ≤ 3. The maximal onset time is defined as 60 minutes</description>

    <measure>The effect of the PPB on cutaneous sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 hours after the placement of the PPB</time_frame>
    <description>Performed as a pinprick test on the lateral aspect of the lower leg. Sensation to pinprick is graded on a 3-point scale: 0 = no sensation, 1 = reduced sensation and 2 = normal sensation to pinprick compared to the contralateral side</description>

    <measure>The effect of PPB on isometric muscle strength of the he dorso- and plantar flexors of the ankle joint</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 hours after the placement of the PPB</time_frame>
    <description>Dorsal and plantar flexion of the foot is measured as the maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). During the test, a handheld dynamometer is kept immobile and the patient is asked to push against the dynamometer with maximal force and maintain this maximal pressure for 5 seconds. The MVIC is measured three times, separated by a 30-second pause, and the highest of the three MVIC values is registered</description>

    <measure>Pain scores (Numerical Rating Scale, NRS, 0-10 where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>For subjects receiving a PPB, pain scores will be performed 2, 4 and 24 hours after PPB. For subjects not receiving a PPB, final pain scores will be made at the 24 hrs follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The patient is asked about the worst pain since last test time</description>

    <measure>Pain localization</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects with NRS &gt; 3: when significant pain is reported during the POP; 15 and 60 min after PPB; at any increase in NRS score at any time during the 60 min after PPB; 2, 4 and 24 hrs after PPB. For subjects with NRS ≤ 3: at the 24 hrs follow-up visit</time_frame>
