  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if epacadostat in combination with
      pembrolizumab can help to control previously treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in
      patients who have a specific type of genetic change. This type of genetic change may mean you
      are more likely to respond to the study drugs.

      The safety of this combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Epacadostat is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of many types of cancer. It is investigational to
      use pembrolizumab to treat pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

      The combination of these drugs is considered investigational. The study doctor can explain
      how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 21 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 21 days.

      You will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. After
      the first dose, you will stay in the clinic for an additional 60 minutes after the dose.
      After that, if no intolerable side effects occur, you will only stay in the clinic for an
      additional 30 minutes after each dose.

      You will take 2 epacadostat pills by mouth every day while on study. Tablets should be taken
      about 12 hours apart (1 morning dose, 1 evening dose) at the same time each day. Tablets
      should be swallowed whole; do not chew, crush, dissolve, or divide the tablets. If you vomit
      a dose of epacadostat, you may take a &quot;make up&quot; dose only if the tablets can be seen and
      counted. If you miss a dose of epacadostat, you may take the tablets as soon as you remember
      but only if it has not been more than 2 hours since your scheduled dose. If it has been more
      than 2 hours, wait and take your next dose as scheduled.

      You will be given a medication diary to keep track of when you take each dose of epacadostat.
      The study staff will tell you when you should bring the diary and any unused tablets to the
      clinic.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after follow-up (described below).

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  During Cycles 1-5, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.

      Every 9 weeks for the first 36 weeks and then every 12 weeks after that, you will have an MRI
      or CT scan.

      If the disease appears to get worse, blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker
      testing.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      As soon as possible after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker and routine tests.

      If you stopped taking the study drugs for reasons other than the disease getting worse, you
      will continue to have MRI or CT scans as described above.

      Safety Follow-Up:

      About 30 days after your End-of-Treatment visit, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to
      check your thyroid function.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      About every 8 weeks for the first 3 years and then every 12 weeks after that, a member of the
      study staff will contact you to ask how you are doing. This contact will take place either
      during a regularly scheduled clinic visit or by phone. Each phone call should last about 10
      minutes. If the disease gets worse, you start a new cancer treatment, withdraw from the
      study, or you cannot be reached, this contact will stop.
