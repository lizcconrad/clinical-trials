  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of niraparib
      combination therapies of Part 1 and to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of
      niraparib combination therapies of Part 2.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study will evaluate safety and efficacy of niraparib in combination with
      other anti-cancer agents. The first combination study will combine niraparib with the
      anti-programmed cell death protein (PD)-1 monoclonal antibody, JNJ-63723283 (niraparib
      combination therapies) in participants with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
      This study will be conducted in 2 parts: in Part 1 (dose selection), participants will be
      enrolled to explore 2 doses of niraparib and JNJ-63723283; and Part 2 (dose expansion) will
      evaluate the combination therapy in an expanded number of participants. In Part 2,
      participants will be enrolled into 2 cohorts, biomarker positive and biomarker negative. The
      study will have 4 phases: A Prescreening Phase, a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a
      Follow-up Phase. Study evaluations will include efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK),
      PK/pharmacodynamics, biomarkers, safety and tolerability. Participants' safety and efficacy
      during Part 1 will determine the doses used for Part 2.

    <measure>Part 1: Incidence of Specified Toxicities</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence defined as number of participants with specified toxicities will be reported. The dose will be considered intolerable if a participant developed Grade greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 3 non-hematological toxicity (with exceptions including anorexia, fever, constipation, fatigue that improves to Grade less than or equal to (&lt;=) 2 in &lt;=7 days, vomiting and diarrhea that resolves in &lt;=3 days with best supportive care), treatment-related Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade &gt;= 3 thrombocytopenia, treatment-related Grade 4 neutropenia &gt;= 7 days, or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, treatment-related serious adverse events.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate is defined as the percentage of participants who achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as assessed by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria with no evidence of bone progression according to prostate cancer working group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 millimeter (mm). PR defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence defined as number of participants with AEs will be reported. An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Severity of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. Severity of AEs will be assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE). Any AE not listed in the NCI-CTCAE will be graded according to the investigator's clinical judgment using the standard grades as follows: Grade 1 (Mild): Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities; Grade 2 (Moderate): Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity; Grade 3 (Severe): Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. Prevents normal everyday activities; Grade 4, Life-threatening: Urgent intervention indicated; Grade 5, Death: Death.</description>
