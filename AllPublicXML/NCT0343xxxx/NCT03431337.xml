      Comparative-effectiveness study of the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis with

      Double-blind comparative-effectiveness study of the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis
      with standard dose of amoxicillin/clavulanate 875mg/125mg bid for 7 days, as recommended by
      the Infectious Disease Society of America, with or without the addition of immediate-release
      amoxicillin 875 mg bid x 7 days. The study aims are 1) to confirm, or not, our recent
      findings of more rapid improvement in overall symptoms with the additional amoxicillin, but
      also of more frequent diarrhea and vaginal yeast infections and 2) to assess, from the
      participants' point of view, the balance between improvement and adverse effects.

    <intervention_model_description>Ill adult patients coming to a primary care office will be diagnosed by the treating physicians with acute bacterial sinusitis in accordance with the guidelines of the Infectious Disease Society of America.
If they do not meet exclusion criteria, they will be offered enrollment in the study.
If they agree, they will be provided unlabeled study medication, either amoxicillin/clavulante 875/125 + placebo pills bid x 7 days (standard dose) or amoxicillin/clavulanate 875/125 + amoxicillin immediate-release 875 (high dose).
Outcomes will be assessed, by telephone or over the web (through Qualtrics), at 3 and 10 days after enrollment.</intervention_model_description>
