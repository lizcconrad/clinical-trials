      The overall objective of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of daily acute
      intermittent hypoxia therapy (dAIH), coupled with massed practice training, to improve
      upper-extremity function in individuals with chronic incomplete cervical spinal cord injury
      (SCI).

    <measure>Change in grip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week.</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength will be measured using a hand-held dynamometer, with an average force ( measured in Kdynes) taken over the course of three trials. A rest break is provided between trials. Strength testing will be completed bilaterally.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in coordination/ dexterity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week.</time_frame>
    <description>9-Hole Peg Test is a standardized assessment of coordination/ dexterity. It is one of the most frequently utilized outcome measures. This test will be completed bilaterally, if possible. the total time in seconds is recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pinch strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week.</time_frame>
    <description>Pinch strength will be assessed using a digital pinch gauge (unit of Force= Newton). The minimum value of zero will be assigned when a participant cannot actively squeeze the pinch meter between the thumb and index finger. The mean value of total of 3 trials will be assessed, with a rest break provided between trials.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in elbow strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week.</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric elbow strength will be measured using a dynamometer ( measured in Kdynes). A total of three trials will be taken on each side, with a rest break between trials. The average of the three trials will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in manual dexterity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week.</time_frame>
    <description>Box and Blocks test evaluates manual dexterity, and focuses on the amount of times (count/seconds) an individual can successfully translate 1-inch blocks from one side of a box to another, within a 60 second time point.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in impairment measure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week.</time_frame>
    <description>The Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP) is a clinical impairment measure used to evaluate sensory and motor hand function in individuals with cervical spinal cord injuries. Specifically, it evaluates the domains of sensation, strength, quality of different grip patterns and the ability to complete a variety of functional tasks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of functional limitations</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week.</time_frame>
    <description>The Capabilities of Upper Extremity Questionnaire (CUE-Q) is a 32-item questionnaire that assesses the difficulty in performing certain motions or activities with the upper extremities. This questionnaire was designed to assess the functional limitations in individuals with spinal cord injury, and is recommended for use in individuals with chronic (&gt;6 months) spinal cord injury.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week.</time_frame>

    <measure>Change in resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1st week, 2nd week, 4th week, 8th week, and 12th week.</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity will be assessed through the use of the Modified Ashworth Scale. This scale allows for characterization of increases in muscle tone, from a slight increase in tone to complete limb rigidity.
0 = No increase in muscle tone
1 = Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension
1+ = Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the range of movement (ROM) 2 = More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affect part(s) easily moved 3 = Considerable increase in muscle tone passive, movement difficult 4 = Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>
