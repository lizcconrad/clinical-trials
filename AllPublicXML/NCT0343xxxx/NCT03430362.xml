  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women will be admitted when active phase of labour starts defined as the presence of at least
      three regular uterine contractions over 10 minutes with cervical dilatation four centimeters
      with cervical effacement not less than 50% and no progress of labor for 2 hours or more.

      Group A will receive injection Hyoscine butyl bromide 20 mg first dose at the time of
      amniotomy, and second dose 2 hours after. Group B, will receive normal saline same volume
      first dose at the time of amniotomy, and second dose 2 hours after.

      Labor will be monitored by Vaginal examination every two hours. The duration of the first
      stage was calculated from the time of cervical dilatation of three to four centimeters in
      active labor until a fully dilated cervix was observed.
