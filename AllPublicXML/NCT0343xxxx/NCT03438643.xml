  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is a cellular therapy indicated in the treatment of
      chronic GVHD (cGVHD). In this study protocol, patients suffering from inaugural cGVHD will be
      treated with the association of ECP and corticosteroid treatment. Treatment will start by an
      induction stage with 2 sessions of ECP per week until the 10th week followed by a maintenance
      stage including one session every other week until the 22th week. The objective of this study
      is to highlight the immunological mechanism of extracorporeal photopheresis treatment.
      Indeed, ECP is based on an immunomodulatory immunological effect and despite several
      hypotheses highlighted by different teams; clear mechanisms still need to be defined. This
      French multicenter study realize an immunological follow-up before and during treatment to
      elucidate the impact of ECP on immune system of responder patient.
