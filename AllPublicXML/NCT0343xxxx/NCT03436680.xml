  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using neurofeedback training can help
      teach patients with peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage that affects motor function) how to
      change their own brain waves to lower their own perception of symptoms and help improve
      overall quality of life.

      Neurofeedback training is a type of therapy that uses an electroencephalograph (EEG) and a
      computer software program to measure brain wave activity.

      This is an investigational study. Neurofeedback training is performed using FDA-approved and
      commercially available methods. Using neurofeedback equipment to teach patients ways to
      change their own brain waves to lower the perception of symptoms and improve quality of life
      is considered investigational.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled on this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Baseline Tests:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will have the following
      baseline tests:

        -  Participant will complete 7 questionnaires about pain, quality of life, symptoms, and
           study expectations. It should take about 15 minutes to complete.

        -  Demographic information about participant (such as participant's age and education
           level) will be collected.

        -  Participant will have an EEG to measure the electrical activity of participant's brain.
           During the EEG, researchers will place a cap containing 19 electrodes on participant's
           scalp and 1 electrode on each earlobe. The electrodes will measure and record
           participant's brain wave activity, similar to the way a doctor listens to participant's
           heart beat from the surface of participant's skin. The EEG should take about 45 minutes
           to complete.

      Study Groups:

      After completing the baseline tests, participant will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of
      a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study group is
      better, the same, or worse than the other group. Participant will have an equal chance
      (50/50) of being assigned to either group.

        -  If participant is assigned to Group 1, participant will receive neurofeedback training.

        -  If participant is assigned to Group 2, participant will continue to receive standard
           care. Participant will not take part in the neurofeedback training.

      Participant will be told to which group you have been assigned.

      Neurofeedback Training (Group 1 only):

      Participant will be given a headset and a laptop computer to take home to complete &quot;training
      sessions&quot; which will measure the electrical activity of participant's brain. The study staff
      will instruct participant as to how to set up and complete these sessions and will call
      participant every day for the first week of training to ensure that the set-up has been done
      correctly. This call should last about 5-10 minutes.

      Participant will be asked to complete at least 2 training sessions each week for up to 5
      weeks (20 training sessions total). Each training session should take about 30 minutes to
      complete.

      During each session, participant will have the headset on while participant sits quietly,
      relaxes, and watches the laptop computer screen. Participant will have a choice of seven
      feedback games (for example, a game in which a small character moves around a maze). The
      headset will measure and record participant's brain wave activity, like an EEG. The training
      session data will be recorded and stored on the laptop's hard drive. The data will be removed
      from the laptop before it is given to the next study participant.

      At each neurofeedback training session, participant will also rate participant's symptoms on
      the computer on a scale of 0-10 before participant begins the neurofeedback training and
      again after the session is complete. This should only take a few minutes.

      Length of Participation:

      Participant's active participation on this study will be over after follow-up (about 5-6
      weeks after participant's start date).

      Follow-Up (All Participants):

      Within 1 week after participant's last neurofeedback training session (if participant was in
      Group 1) or about 6 weeks after participant's baseline tests (if participant was in Group 2):

        -  Participant will fill out the same 7 questionnaires participant completed at baseline.

        -  Participant will have another EEG.

      If participant was in Group 2, participant may be able to begin receiving neurofeedback
      training if participant wants to at this point. Participant may talk to the study staff about
      this possibility.
