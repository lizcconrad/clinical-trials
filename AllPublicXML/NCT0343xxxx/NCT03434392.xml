  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) is a novel investigative technique used in other pain
      conditions to evaluate patterns of chronic pain, and in this study will be used to elucidate
      pain patterns in patients with Chronic Pancreatitis (CP). QST uses a specific series of
      standardized stimulations to map the pain system. QST has the potential to change and improve
      the treatment paradigm for patients with CP and may eventually be able to predict response to
      invasive CP therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Chronic Pancreatitis (CP), clinical pain symptoms correlate poorly with pancreatic ductal
      morphology, response to endoscopic or surgical therapy is unpredictable, and the rationale
      for invasive therapies is often questioned. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a technique
      used to map the pain system based on the rationale that different neural pathways and
      networks can be explored using standardized stimulation and simultaneous recording of the
      evoked pain response by psychophysical and/or objective methods. In this study, the
      investigators aim to distinguish phenotypes characterized by segmental sensitization of the
      pancreatic viscerotome, and systemic sensitization with pathological central pain processing.

      The investigators will perform QST on controls and CP subjects consisting of stimulation in
      several different dermatomes including pancreatic and control areas. All subjects will also
      answer standardized questionnaires assessing pain, depression, anxiety, and quality of life
      at baseline. Subjects undergoing endoscopic or surgical therapy will also undergo follow-up
      testing consisting of the same tests at 1, 3, and 6 months post-procedure for evaluation of
      changes in their pain profile.
