    <textblock>
      The main objectives of the BI 754091 monotherapy dose-finding part (Part I) of the trial are
      to investigate the following items in advanced solid tumours:

        -  Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of BI 754091 as monotherapy.

        -  Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BI 754091
           monotherapy.

      The main objectives of the Combination dose-finding part (Part II) of the trial are to
      investigate the following items in advanced solid tumours:

        -  Safety, tolerability, and PK of the combination treatment of BI 754091 and BI 754111.

        -  MTD and/or RP2D of the combination treatment of BI 754091 and BI 754111.

      The main objectives of the expansion part (Part III) of the trial are:

        -  To further investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK of the RP2D of BI 754091 and BI
           754111 combination in patients with gastric/esophagogastric junction cancer, esophageal
           cancer, or hepatocellular cancer

        -  To explore the efficacy of the RP2D of the combination of BI 754091 and BI 754111 in
           patients with gastric/esophagogastric junction cancer, esophageal cancer, or
           hepatocellular cancer

             within 14 days before the informed consent date). However, in Part III Cohort C,
             patients with HBV and/or HCV infection are allowed. Patients in Part III Cohort C with
             HBV infection must be receiving effective antiviral therapy (viral load &lt;100 IU/mL)
