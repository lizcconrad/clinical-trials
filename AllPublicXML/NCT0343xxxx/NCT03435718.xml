  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to provide data on the efficacy profile of different
      doses of oxfendazole when used in Trichuris trichiura infection. The drug will be also be
      examined for efficacy against other common nematodes encountered in man (Ascaris
      lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus). The study will also provide data on
      the safety and tolerability of the oxfendazole in patients.

      This is an assessor blind, randomized, comparative study in adult patients with proven
      intestinal infection with Trichuris trichiura to be conducted as a field study. Patients
      meeting the study entry criteria will receive either 6 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg of
      oxfendazole as a single oral dose, three single doses of oxfendazole on consecutive days, or
      albendazole 400mg as a single oral dose. Stool samples will be obtained and examined prior to
      treatment and at 7, 14 and 21 days after treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be conducted as a field trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups: 6 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg oxfendazole as a single dose; 15 mg/kg oxfendazole on three consecutive days; or 400 mg albendazole as a single dose (50 patients per group). The main objective of this study is to assess the efficacy (Cure Rate) of oral oxfendazole. Secondary objectives are to assess the Egg Reduction Rate for Trichuris in those subjects not cured of infection, to assess the efficacy (Cure Rate and Egg Reduction Rate) of oxfendazole against other common intestinal helminth infections, and to assess the safety and tolerability of oxfendazole treatment in adult patients.</intervention_model_description>
