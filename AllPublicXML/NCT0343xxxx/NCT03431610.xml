  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, 2-week study assessing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and
      tolerability of SB414 in subjects with mild to moderate AD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study to be
      conducted in approximately 48 non-immunocompromised adult subjects with mild to moderate AD.
      Subjects will be randomized to 2 active and 1 vehicle treatment arms. Subjects will apply the
      study drug (SB414 or Vehicle) to affected areas twice daily for 2 weeks (14 days).
