        The study population will include pregnant women within the US who were immunized with the
        TIVc or the QIVc vaccine as part of routine care at any time during pregnancy. Eligible
        pregnant women may self-enroll or voluntarily be enrolled by their HCP.

        Women under 18 can be included in the study as long as parental consent can be obtained.
        De-identified data on minors will be accepted into the study if permitted by laws and
        regulations.

        Inclusion Criteria -

        Enrollment and data collection will be coordinated through a coordination center (CC). The
        minimum eligibility criteria required for enrollment are as follows:

          -  Sufficient information to confirm that the exposure of interest occurred during
             pregnancy and at which date.

          -  Sufficient information to determine whether it concerns a prospectively enrolled
             subject, since retrospective cases are ineligible for enrollment.

          -  Reporter (e.g. HCP) contact information to allow for follow-up
