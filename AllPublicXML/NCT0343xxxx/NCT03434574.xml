  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aronia berries are a native North American berry with high naturally occurring anthocyanins
      among other polyphenols. Based on their polyphenol composition, there is growing interest in
      the potential for Aronia berries to elicit health promoting cardio-metabolic effects.
      Specifically, Aronia berry extracts, which provide a concentrated source of polyphenols, may
      improve blood vessel function.

      Thus, the primary focus of this project is to evaluate the effects of Aronia berry
      polyphenols on blood pressure and other biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk such as
      endothelial function, arterial stiffness and blood lipids.
