  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of phenolic
      compounds from Oxxynea®, a blend of fruit and vegetable extracts, in healthy volunteers,
      during a randomized, double-blind and cross-over trial. After a single dose supplementation,
      both metabolic profile and urinary excretion will be determined over a 48h-period by means of
      High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) to
      identify and quantify phenolic metabolites. In parallel, post-prandial potential
      anti-oxidative and anti-glycemic properties of Oxxynea® will be determined in blood,
      following consumption of a cafeteria-type breakfast.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in plasma concentration of phenolic metabolites after acute ingestion of the supplement/placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>0h, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 24h post-ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples will be collected in EDTA tubes in baseline before supplement/placebo intake (0h) and up to 24h according to the time frame. Plasma metabolites will be identified and quantified by HPLC-MS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in urine phenolic metabolites excretion after acute ingestion of the supplement/placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (12h pre-ingestion), 0-3h, 3-6h, 6-10h, 10-14h, 14-24h, 24-32h, 32-48h post-ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Urine samples will be collected in baseline (12h pre-ingestion) and up to 48h according to the time frame. Urine metabolites will be identified and quantified by HPLC-MS.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total circulating antioxidant defences after acute ingestion of the supplement/placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 8h, 10h, 24h post-ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Red blood cell (RBCs) samples will be collected in EDTA tubes in baseline before supplement/placebo intake (0h), 1h post-ingestion and following a cafeteria-type breakfast, and up to 24h according to the time frame.
RBCs will be submitted to the KRL (Kit Radicaux Libres) test which consists in inducing a free-radical attack to RBCs and to follow hemolysis. Results will be expressed as the time required to reach 50% of maximal hemolysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in post-prandial glycemia</measure>
    <time_frame>0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h post-ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Glycemia will be measured in a fasted state in baseline before supplement/placebo intake (0h), 1h post-ingestion and following a cafeteria-type breakfast, and up to 6h according to the time frame.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in post-prandial insulinemia</measure>
    <time_frame>0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h post-ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Insulinemia will be measured in a fasted state in baseline before supplement/placebo intake (0h), 1h post-ingestion and following a cafeteria-type breakfast, and up to 6h according to the time frame.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in sleepiness during the day</measure>
    <time_frame>0h, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 8h, 10h post-ingestion</time_frame>
    <description>Change in sleepiness will be assessed using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS), a 7-point self-rating scale. The scale is used to track overall alertness during the day. At each point of the time frame, volunteers will be asked to rate their feelings of sleepiness from 1 to 7 according to the following descriptors:
Feeling active, vital, alert, or wide awake
Functioning at high levels, but not at peak; able to concentrate
Awake, but relaxed; responsive but not fully alert
Somewhat foggy, let down
Foggy; losing interest in remaining awake; slowed down
Sleepy, woozy, fighting sleep; prefer to lie down
No longer fighting sleep, sleep onset soon; having dream-like thoughts</description>
