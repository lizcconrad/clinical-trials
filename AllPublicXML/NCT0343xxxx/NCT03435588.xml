  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the best way to evaluate pancreatic masses is through endoscopic-guided needle
      sampling of the mass to determine the diagnosis by looking at the acquired tissue under a
      microscope. This is done by inserting a small camera (endoscope) through the mouth of the
      patient then advanced to the stomach and using ultrasound guidance a sample of the pancreas
      can be acquired through the stomach. The sampling is usually done with a small needle called
      fine needle aspiration needle or FNA. FNA alone is sometimes limited due to inadequate
      acquisition of cells for proper diagnosis under the microscope, which can lead to need for
      repeat endoscopic procedures and delay in diagnosis and possibly treatment. Rapid on-site
      evaluation of cytopathology (ROSE) is where a cytopathologist is next to the physician doing
      the endoscopic procedures and evaluates each sampling performed immediately under the
      microscope and can give feedback to the endoscopist until enough cells has been acquired for
      a diagnosis. This method has been shown to increase the ability to diagnose pancreatic cancer
      but is expensive and requires significant amount of resources. New needles called core
      needles (fine needle biopsy, FNB) have recently been developed which not only acquires cells
      but also the entire tissue structure (histology) and has been shown to be also very accurate
      in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to compare endoscopy-guided biopsy of pancreatic masses with the
      new core needle (FNB), which can obtain more tissue for diagnosis vs. using a traditional
      needle (FNA) with the help of an immediate assessment of the obtained samples under the
      microscope to determine whether enough tissue has been obtained (ROSE). Both approaches have
      been shown to increase the accuracy of diagnosis in solid pancreatic masses but it is unclear
      which one is superior. This is a randomized trial meaning that the participants would either
      undergo biopsy with the new needle or with the traditional needle plus the addition of
      on-site assessment of the obtained samples. The advantage of the new needle is that it is
      easy to implement and likely much cheaper. If the investigators can show in our study that
      the new needles are as accurate as FNA with ROSE then FNB could be implemented across
      hospitals worldwide in an easier and less expensive fashion.

    <intervention_model_description>Procedures are performed with a linear echoendoscope under conscious sedation. EUS-FNB is performed with a 22 gauge Core-needle. Tissue sampling technique is standardized between the endoscopists. Two passes are performed using the core needle. A third pass is allowed if, on macroscopic inspection of the acquired sample, the specimen is deemed insufficient by the endoscopist. EUS-FNA with ROSE is performed with a 22 gauge FNA needle.
This is a multi-center, randomized, single blinded, non-inferiority, trial comparing EUS-FNB alone to EUS-FNA with ROSE in the diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses. Following consent, patients are randomized, at the time of the procedure, to undergo either EUS-FNB alone or EUS-FNA with ROSE. The randomization sequence will be generated by a computerized randomization scheme using a block size of 10 stratified according to the endoscopist.</intervention_model_description>
