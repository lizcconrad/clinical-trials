      A two-arm, parallel group, multicentre, single-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing
      electrical neuromodulation delivered by MyndMove® therapy to intensive upper-limb
      conventional therapy in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe motor impairment to
      their arms and hands from an incomplete, sub-acute, traumatic spinal cord injury.
