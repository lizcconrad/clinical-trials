  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to obtain post market data on the Asahi Chikai Black 18
      neurovascular guidewire in the treatment of intracranial large vessel occlusive stroke. This
      will be compared to a historical control that will include the prior 50 consecutive patients
      fitting the same selection criteria.

      This is a prospective registry collecting information on 50 patients treated with the ASAHI
      Chikai Black 18 microguidewire. Patients will undergo mechanical thrombectomy for acute large
      vessel occlusive stroke within the anterior circulation as is standard of care.

      Additionally, this study will have a retrospective portion which will examine 50 consecutive
      patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria treated for acute anterior circulation large
      vessel occlusive stroke prior to the initiation of the Sure -18 Registry. This retrospective
      cohort will be 50 consecutive mechanical thrombectomy cases performed using any neurovascular
      microguidewire other than the device under study (Asahi Chikai Black 18) at the same
      enrolling centers leading up to December 10, 2018.

        For the prospective portion, patients will be enrolled if their doctor decides to treat
        them with the ASAHI Chikai Black 18 Neurovascular Guidewire.

        For the retrospective portion, 50 consecutive mechanical thrombectomy cases will be
