        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical
             protocol (i.e., willing to wear only the study lenses and not use habitual lenses
             during the study).

          3. Females between 18 and 39 (inclusive) years of age at the time of screening.

          4. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the
             range of -1.00 D to -6.00 D (inclusive) in each eye.

          5. The subject's refractive cylinder must be less than or equal to 0.75 D (inclusive) in
             each eye.

          6. Have spherical best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better in each eye.

          7. Be a current soft contact lens wearer in both eyes with a minimum of 6 hours/day and 5
             days/week over the last month by self-report.

          8. The subject must be willing to be photographed and/or video-taped.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently pregnant or lactating

          2. Any systemic disease (eg, Sj√∂gren's Syndrome), allergies, infectious disease (eg,
             hepatitis, tuberculosis), contagious immunosuppressive diseases (eg, HIV), autoimmune
             disease (eg rheumatoid arthritis), or other diseases, by self-report, which are known
             to interfere with contact lens wear and/or participation in the study (at the
             investigators discretion).

          3. Use of systemic medications (eg, chronic steroid use) that are known to interfere with
             contact lens wear (at the investigators discretion).

          4. Any previous, or planned (during the study) ocular surgery (eg, radial keratotomy,
             PRK, LASIK, etc.).

          5. Any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal inflammatory event
             (eg, past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any other ocular abnormality
             that would contraindicate contact lens wear.

          6. Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within seven (7)
             days prior to study enrollment.

          7. Employee or family members of clinical site (eg, Investigator, Coordinator,
             Technician).
