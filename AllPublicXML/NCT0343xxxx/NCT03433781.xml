    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase Ib/IIa study designed to evaluate the safety, toxicity and
      biological activity of high dose Vitamin C in bone marrow and peripheral blood when
      administered as therapy to patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome
      according to the revised IPSS (international prognostic scoring system) criteria whose
      disease has a Ten-eleven translocation-2, (TET2) mutation.

      This study will enroll patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome. All
      patients will receive at least 1 cycle of treatment (4 weeks). Patients with clinical benefit
      (CR,PR, or SD) then will undergo a second 4-week cycle of treatment.

      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. Evaluate the safety and toxicity of high dose Vitamin C

        2. Estimate the proportion of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with Ten-eleven
           translocation-2, (TET2) mutations who exhibit a biological response defined as maintaing
           a vtamin C serum concentration of ≥1mM over the treatment cycle.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. Estimate the clinical efficacy, namely objectiveresponse rate (ORR). [including complete
           response (CR) and partial response (PR)] duration of response (DOR) and progression-free
           survival (PFS) as defined in the IWG (International Working Group) response criteria in
           myelodisplasia.

        2. Estimate the Maximum measure Vitamin C plasma concentration (max)

        3. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of Vitamin C as hypomethylating or
           demethylating agent
