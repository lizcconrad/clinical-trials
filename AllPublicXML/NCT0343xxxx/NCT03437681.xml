  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about how sleep loss impacts the way the body responds to
      sugar. This work will have important implications for development of treatments and
      countermeasures for people who are not able to get enough sleep for various reasons.

      Participants will stay in the hospital for 6 days and will not be able to leave. Sleep habits
      will be measured for 7 days before the study. A research diet that is designed to maintain
      weight will be provided for 3 days before the study and during the study. Multiple tests will
      be performed, including metabolic testing and muscle and fat biopsies, both when participants
      first arrive and have had normal sleep and again after 4 nights of only 5 hours time in bed.
      The visit takes place at the Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) at the University
      of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical campus. It will take approximately 2 weeks to complete
      this study.
