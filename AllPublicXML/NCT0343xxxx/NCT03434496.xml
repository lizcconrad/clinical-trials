  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) sensorimotor techniques are increasingly used to improve
      spatio-temporal gait parameters and postural stability in the course of Parkinson's Disease
      and following stroke. Nonetheless, the neurophysiological underpinnings of NMT-mediated gait
      recovery is still poorly understood.

      The aim of the study was to investigate the central mechanisms of connectivity related to the
      application of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) in PD gait rehabilitation. The
      investigators will enroll 30 patients with PD. They will be randomized into two groups: (A)
      gait training with Music; (B) conventional treadmill gait training. The experimental group
      will perform training by means of GT3 (Biodex), where the patient is able to walk (on a
      treadmill) following specific musical beets and rhythms. The control group will perform only
      gait treadmill training.

      Subjects will attend 3 sessions a week for at least 4 weeks. Each session will last 45-min.

      The aim of the study was to investigate the central mechanisms of connectivity related to the
      application of Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) in PD gait rehabilitation. The
      investigators will enroll 30 patients with PD. They will be randomized into two groups: (A)

      gait treadmill training.

      Subjects will attend 3 sessions a week for at least 4 weeks. Each session will last 45-min.

      The investigators will assess the gait performance and pattern by using System BTS Smart for
      gait and the sensorimotor functional connectivity by using EEG, both before and after the
      therapy cycle. The patients will be clinically evaluated by means of Time up and go test, and
      ten meters. The overall motor function will be evaluated through the UPDRS III.

      Power calculation by Cohen (1992) methodology will be utilized for this pilot study.
      Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to assess the normality of distribution. Thus, parametric and
      non-parametric tests will be employed for all comparisons (Wilcoxon test, ANOVA).
      Mann-Whitney test or ANOVA will be utilized to evaluate the level of significance in
      differentiation between the examined groups.

    <description>The investigators will enroll 30 patients with PD, randomly divided into two groups: (A) gait training with Music; (B) conventional treadmill gait training. The 15 patients in the experimental group will perform training by means of the device Gait Trainer 3 (Biodex), where they will train on a tredmill equipped with music. They will walk following specific musical beets and rhythms so to entrain their own internal rhythm. Subjects will attend 3 sessions a week for at least 4 weeks. Each session will last 45-min.</description>

    <description>With the BIODEX Gait Trainer 3, patients acquire a smooth gait pattern. In addition, balance, coordination, endurance and the cardiovascular system are trained. Work on the treadmill strengthens the leg muscles. On the screen or via an audio message, the patients and therapists receive direct feedback on the smoothness of the gait pattern. The therapists can then make corrective interventions if necessary and the patients are motivated.</description>
