  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit with or without hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a real health public
      concern. No easy-use diagnosis tool are available. Metabolomic approaches has brought very
      usefull data in others neurological diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or autism
      spectrum disorder, as we had shown in previous studies. Targeting on neurotransmitter
      pathways involving in ADHD, metabolomic screening could help to enhance our diagnosis power
      to better help numerus of children. We propose to study the phenylalanine and the tyrosine
      pathways with a multimodal metabolomic approach, in easy-available biological fluid (blood
      and urine), in child or adolescent suspected of ADHD. Our objectives are: 1- to determine a
      specific metabolomic signature of ADHD 2- to compare the diagnostic value of this metabolomic
      signature with the reference methodology for ADHD diagnosis, as now practiced in our
      reference center for learning troubles.
