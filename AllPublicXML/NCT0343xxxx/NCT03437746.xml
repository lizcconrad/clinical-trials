  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complications due to infection after colorectal surgery are frequent, affecting up to 25% of
      patients. Infection increases mortality, lengthens hospital stays, increases costs and
      decreases long term survival for cancer patients. Perioperative inflammation leads to
      hypercatabolism, denutrition and immunosuppression, all of which are associated to
      postoperative infection. Data from various sources suggests that modulating perioperative
      inflammatory response through the injection of corticosteroids would benefit the patient by
      reducing the number of postoperative complications after major surgery. Pre- or perioperative
      intravenous administration of a single corticosteroid flash is a means of modulating systemic
      inflammation that has been suggested for numerous types of surgeries, including pancreatic
      surgery. The objective of this study is to assess whether a preoperative single
      corticosteroid flash (methylprednisolone: 20 mg/kg IV at anesthetic induction) reduces the
      risk of serious complications after elective colorectal surgery.
