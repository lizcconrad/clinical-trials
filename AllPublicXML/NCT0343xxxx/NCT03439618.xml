  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the nutrition guideline (A.S.P.E.N guideline), there was no recommendation about the
      feeding type in enteral feeding of critically ill patients. Continuous feeding is the most
      popular feeding type in ICU because of its less nursing burden and reducing the aspiration
      incidence theoretically. However, some previous studies demonstrated that there were no
      complications differences between continuous and time-restricted feedings（such as
      intermittent feedings）.

      In ICU, the disorder of protein synthesis is a universal problem and is associated with ICU
      acquired weakness. Time-restricted feeding is more physical than continuous feeding. In some
      animal researches, time-restricted feeding was proved to have a greater stimulatory effect on
      protein synthesis than continuous feeding. Besides of light, time-restricted feeding can may
      also adjust the biological rhythms. It is known that biological clocks could affect energy
      metabolism, emotion and so on. Until now, there are no enough clinical studies to prove the
      advantages in time-restricted feeding in ICU patients.So researchers designed the study to
      compare the time-restricted feeding and continuous feeding effect(especially protein
      synthesis) on ICU patients.

    <textblock>
      Enteral nutrition support can be administered by continuous administration or by
      time-restricted administration in ICU. Continuous feeding is the most popular feeding
      schedule because of its less nursing burden and reducing the aspiration prevalence
      theoretically. However, previous studies demonstrated that there was no complications
      (diarrhea, distension, Ventilator associated pneumonia-VAP incidence, and so on) difference
      between these two feeding schedule. So in the nutrition guideline (A.S.P.E.N guideline),
      there was no recommendation about the feeding schedule. However, time-restricted feeding is
      more physical than continuous feeding. In ICU, the disorder of protein synthesis is a
      universal problem and is associated with ICU acquired weakness. In some animal researches,
      time-restricted feeding was proved to have a greater stimulatory effect on protein synthesis
      than continuous feeding.

      Besides of light, time-restricted feeding can adjust the biological rhythms. It is known that
      biological clocks could affect energy metabolism, emotion and so on. In the &quot;zi wu liu zhu&quot;
      theory of traditional chinese medicine, feeding time should be at 7:00-9:00, 11:00-13:00 and
      17:00-19:00. So researchers designed the study to compare the time-restricted feeding
      according to traditional chinese medicine and continuous feeding effect(especially protein
      synthesis) on ICU patients.

    <description>it equal to Nitrogen intake minus Nitrogen output.Source of nitrogen intake is the enteral nutritional suspension, and the amount of nitrogen can be calculated according to the proportion of nitrogen in enteral nutritional suspension. Main nitrogen losses include urine and feces. The amount of nitrogen in urine and feces can be measured by clinical laboratory.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>This index was to evaluate the feeding complications. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a type of lung infection that occurs in people who are on mechanical ventilation breathing machines for at least 48 hours. The diagnosis of VAP varies among hospitals and providers but usually requires a new infiltrate on chest x-ray plus two or more other factors. These factors include temperature of &gt;38 or &lt;36 °C, a white blood cell count of &gt;12 × 10^9/ml, purulent secretions from the airways in the lung, and/or reduction in gas exchange.</description>
