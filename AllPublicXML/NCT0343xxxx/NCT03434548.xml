  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      iMarkHD is an innovative clinical imaging study and collaboration between the CHDI Foundation
      and Professor Marios Politis from King's College London (KCL) designed to assess longitudinal
      change in Huntington's disease (HD) pathology with positron emission tomography (PET)
      molecular and multi-modal magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and clinical observation for up to
      three years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the program is to derive candidate pharmacodynamics biomarkers that could
      be further developed to measure the efficacy of novel pharmacological treatments for HD.
