  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sometimes people with health conditions become ill suddenly and can no longer speak for
      themselves and another person (such as a family member) will make health care decisions for
      them. This means it is important for people to think about their wishes and tell others about
      them. This is called advance care planning. When people have done advance care planning, if
      they become very sick and cannot speak for themselves they are more likely to get the kind of
      health care they want and it is easier for the people who make decisions for them. In Alberta
      there is a form in the health care system that is used to indicate a person's wishes if
      participants are unable to speak for themselves. It is best to fill out the Goal of Care
      Designation form after a person has thought about what is most important to them and when
      they understand some of the possible decisions. There are tools such as brochures,
      questionnaires, and videos that can help participants learn about these things. This research
      is being done to study whether using tools for advance care planning and goals of care
      discussions will increase the number of patients that have their wishes documented in their
      medical record. The research is also being done to study whether the tools help patients
      understand what is most important to them and help them make the best decisions. This study
      is evaluating whether patients who meet with an advance care planning navigator to learn
      about advance care planning and use a decision aid are more likely to complete a goals of
      care form than patients who receive usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In prospective and randomized trials, advance care planning (ACP) significantly improves
      outcomes including increased likelihood that clinicians and families understand and comply
      with a patient's wishes, reduces hospitalization at the end of life, results in less
      intensive treatments at the end of life (according to patients' wishes) and increases use of
      hospice services. Trials have not been done in primary care. The aim of this study is to
      determine the efficacy of a care pathway designed to increase the quality and quantity of ACP
      in patients and their substitute decision-makers in primary care. The study is a multi-site,
      patient-based, unblinded, randomized trial conducted in family practices in Canada.
      Participants will be patients who are determined by their physician to be able to benefit
      from ACP, and the patient's substitute decision-maker. Participant pairs will be randomized
      to immediate intervention (care pathway) or delayed (8-12 weeks). The intervention is guided
      use of tools and decision aids to clarify values and preferences for treatments in the event
      of serious illness or near end of life. The outcomes will be presence of a goals of care form
      in the chart, substitute decision-maker engagement in ACP (including self-efficacy for
      enacting the role), patient engagement in ACP, and decisional conflict.

    <description>In Alberta there is a form in the health care system that is used to indicate a person's wishes if they are unable to speak for themselves. The form is called a &quot;Goal of Care Designation&quot; form and is part of a package called the 'Greensleeve'. Alberta Health Services requires that all patients in primary care and in hospital have a green sleeve and goal of care designation (RMC classification: R=resuscitative; M=medical; C=comfort care).</description>

    <description>The decisional conflict scale (DCS) measures personal perceptions of uncertainty in choosing options;modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty such as feeling uninformed, unclear about personal values and unsupported in decision making; and effective decision making. The outcome is the agreement between patient's self-reported preference for life sustaining treatment and decisional conflict using a 5-item decisional conflict scale pre- and post-intervention. Each item is scored 0 to 4 (0=Yes; 1=Probably Yes; 2=Unsure; 3=Probably No; 4=No)</description>
