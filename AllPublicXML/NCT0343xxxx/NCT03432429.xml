  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      REI-EXCISE is a multicentre, prospective, non-randomised feasibility study, aimed to evaluate
      the diagnostic accuracy of rapid ionisation mass spectroscopy using an iKnife device. The
      iKnife will collect vapour, a by-product of surgery, which will pass through the mass
      spectrometer machine for analysis in order to evaluate what is &quot;normal&quot; and what is
      &quot;cancerous&quot; breast tissue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to address high rates of close or positive margins and re-operative
      breast cancer surgery, which commonly results from the inability of the surgeon to rapidly
      and reliably evaluate resection margin status intra-operatively.

      This study therefore seeks to address this problem by aiming to develop a method for near
      real time, in vivo intra-operative tissue classification that may be used by breast surgeons
      as an intelligent knife (or &quot;iKnife&quot;) to better guide oncological margin control. The method
      known as Rapid Evaporative Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (REIMS) technology uses mass
      spectrometric and chemometric analysis of the tissue specific ionic content of the surgical
      diathermy smoke plume for the rapid identification of dissected breast tissues.

      There are no additional treatment interventions as part of REI-EXCISE. The main study
      procedures are breast conserving surgery using the REIMS iKnife for mass spectral analysis of
      each surgical margin and correlation between the results of a software recognition algorithm
      that capitalised on the spectral data (i.e. iKnife margin = positive / negative) with
      conventional histopathological assessment. False positive iKnife data will be further
      interrogated with digital droplet polymerase chain reaction and imprint cytology assessment.

    <time_frame>Data collected during recruitment period: 1st June 2017 until 31st May 2019 i.e. 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnostic accuracy of rapid ionisation mass spectroscopy for oncological margin status will be measured during breast conserving surgery (BCS) (n=35 patients with positive margins). The primary end-point will allow to report accuracy (sensitivity and specify) of rapid ionisation mass spectroscopy to distinguish between patients with at least one close or positive margin and those without close or positive margin.</description>

    <time_frame>Data collected during recruitment period: 1st June 2017 until 31st May 2019 i.e. 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This study will quantify whether REIMS adds significantly to the intra-operative time taken to perform breast conserving surgery. Thus, the data generated with REI-EXCISE trial will report the difference in specimen excision time using iKnife as compared to conventional electrosurgery.</description>

    <measure>REIMS technology user satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collected during recruitment period: 1st June 2017 until 31st May 2019 i.e. 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This study will be collecting data to understand if end-users are sufficiently satisfied with REIMS technology framework (including modified hand-piece) , and are willing to use it routinely during breast conserving surgery (BCS). This will be conveyed by analysing the end user questionnaire completed by the surgeons to infer if they are satisfied with the use of REIMS instrumentation in vivo to perform BCS.</description>

    <time_frame>Data collected during recruitment period: 1st June 2017 until 31st May 2019 i.e. 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The intra-operative REIMS analysis will be used to accurately predict/measure the oncological status of the surface of the wide local excision cavity. The data will be reported as the proportion of patients with all close or positive margins correctly detected as positive by iKnife and as the proportion of patients with no margin malignancy correctly detected by iKnife among the true negative patients.</description>

      Resected tissue samples will undergo detailed histopathological examination using a standard
      reporting schema based on the Royal College of Pathologists guidelines for breast specimen
      processing and the results of the histological examination of the tissue along the
      electrosurgical dissection line will be compared to the results of mass spectrometric tissue
      identification.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS) for invasive or non-invasive breast
        cancer.

        There is no upper age limit. We believe that older adults represent a group for whom
        multiple operations could represent a significant perioperative risk and therefore might
        stand to benefit from iKnife as much if not more so than younger patients. The lower age
        limit is 18 for the purposes of adequate informed consent to take part in this trial. A
        breast cancer diagnosis in adolescence is extremely rare.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  BCS for ductal carcinoma in situ (B5a)

          -  BCS for invasive ductal carcinoma (B5b)

          -  BCS for invasive lobular carcinoma (B5b)

          -  B3 lesions undergoing surgical excision

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating

          -  18 years or younger

          -  Diagnostic excision biopsy for classical LCIS (current practice is that classical LCIS
             at a surgical resection margin would not mandate wider excision)

        Or if the patient is diagnosed with

        â€¢ Non-epithelial breast tumour (phyllodes, lymphoma)

        Note on patients receiving Neo-adjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT):

        Patients selecting to receive NACT will be eligible for participation. However, the data
        for patients receiving NACT will be analysed separately as a pre-planned subgroup and these
        patients will not contribute data to the n=35 patients with positive margins required for
        this feasibility trial. Data from NACT cases have not been used to generate the validated
        multispectral database since eccentric fibrosis made the histological analysis more
        complex, which limited the number of patients in whom tissue was available for research.
