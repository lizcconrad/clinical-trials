  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ¹¹C-choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has been used in
      patients with some types of solid cancers, but few data are available in patients undergoing
      hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to analyze the
      prognostic value of metabolic imaging data by using ¹¹C-choline PET/CT in patients with HCC
      before hepatectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our prospectively maintained liver unit database was queried for patients with HCC
      preoperatively staged with ¹¹C-choline PET/CT. This metabolic imaging modality was performed
      in addition to standard abdominal CT or magnetic resonance imaging. Several PET/CT parameters
      were recorded and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify
      whether those PET/CT parameters could be predictors of overall survival (OS) and disease-free
      survival (DFS) of HCC patients.
