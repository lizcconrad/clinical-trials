  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rising success of cell therapies places an increasing burden on health care costs.
      Consequently, the need to reduce production costs while maintaining quality has been widely
      acknowledged. In addition, the demand for high-quality products with an optimal safety
      profile is increasing. The proposed cell treatment is the first therapeutical option with the
      possibility to revert the underlying condition. The investigators expect that this healing
      response will be achieved with minimal side effects justifying the addional costs and
      complexity.

      muscle precursor cells (MPCs) will be isolated from biopsies of the lower leg of patients,
      seeded, expanded and cultivated in vitro in a GMP facility to generate vital muscle cells
      dedicated for implantation.

      These muscle cells exhibit myogenic phenotype (IHC and flow cytometry) and therefore
      morphological and histological prerequisites approximating the properties of native skeletal
      muscle tissue. The muscle progenitor cells shall be applied in external sphincter muscle for
      the treatment of patients with stress urinary incontinence.
