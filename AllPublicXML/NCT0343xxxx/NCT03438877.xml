  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, pilot RCT study, aiming to compare intensive dosage and regular dosage
      of PD for AKI patients with indications for dialysis.

      Aims of the study are to:

      Examine the efficacy and safety of intensive PD for AKI patients as compared to regular PD.

      Establish the appropriate workflow for PD treatment for AKI patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is rapidly increasing worldwide, which partly due
      to greater recognition of AKI, more exposure to various nephrotoxins and an ageing population
      with increased burden of non-infectious chronic disease. Intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) or
      continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) (i.e. venous-venous HD or hemofiltration) are the
      most-commonly modalities applied for acute kidney failure (AKF) patients in both developed
      and developing countries. By contrast, the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been rare.
      There are no consensus on the ideal dosage and target of adequacy for PD in AKI. Therefore,
      we are to perform a multicenter, pilot RCT study in seven units, aiming to compare intensive
      dosage and regular dosage of PD for AKF patients with indications for dialysis. If
      successful, this strategy is expected to enhance the remedy rate of AKF patients, especially
      in developing regions/countries.
