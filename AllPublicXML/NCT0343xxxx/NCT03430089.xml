    <textblock>
      This phase I-like, open-label, monocenter, descriptive, single-arm clinical safety study will
      investigate the Shenzhen quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Shz QIV) in 100 participants aged 6
      months and older in China.

      Participants aged 9 years or more will receive a single dose of Shz QIV, and participants
      aged 6 months to 8 years will receive two doses of Shz QIV administered 28 days apart.

      Healthy participants will either receive a single dose (participants 9 years or older) or two
      doses (participants 6 months to 8 years) of the Shz QIV. Safety in terms of serious adverse
      events, solicited injection site and systemic reactions, and unsolicited adverse events will
      be collected before and 28 days after each and any dose.
