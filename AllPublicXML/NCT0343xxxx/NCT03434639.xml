  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Leaky gut&quot; - or, increased permeability of the intestine - involves the leakage of bacteria
      from the intestine (gut) into the rest of the body and causes serious and repeated
      infections. This condition is associated with many widespread diseases including coeliac
      disease, inflammatory bowel disease, HIV, liver cirrhosis and environmental enteric
      dysfunction (EED). It has a considerable impact on quality of life and, in extreme cases, can
      lead to death. Furthermore, in the developing world (as part of EED), it severely hampers the
      mental and physical development of young children. Thus, new devices that can help us to
      learn more about leaky gut and more accurately monitor its effects are urgently needed.

      To address this issue, this research aims to develop portable devices - known as fluorescence
      spectrometers - to monitor the leakage of fluorescent dyes out of the gut into the blood
      stream. These devices will measure the leakiness (permeability) of the gut in a non-invasive
      manner and will provide an early warning that patients are at risk of infections caused by
      the unwanted flow of bacteria from the intestine to the rest of the body.

      In this project, patients will drink a small dose of a fluorescent dye. Then, by shining
      light on the patients' skin and recording the color and brightness of the light
      (fluorescence) that comes back, it will be possible to measure the amount of dye that has
      leaked into the blood (indicating the likelihood that bacteria are escaping from the gut and
      causing infections). We refer to this as a &quot;Spectroscopic gut permeability test.&quot; We will
      also ask patients to take a traditional permeability test (known as a PEG permeability test)
      so that we can validate our new sensor. Overall, this research will deliver vital information
      that will improve our understanding of leaky gut and help guide the development of treatments
      for the many diseases in which it occurs.

    <description>Where the blood concentration of fluorescent dye is known - for example, in ophthalmology patients who have received a direct intravenous dose of contrast agent - a direct comparison will be made between these values and the results of the spectroscopic gut permeability test without the need for further measurements.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>1 - Ophthalmology patients</arm_group_label>
    <description>Ophthalmology patients who are receiving an intravenous dose of either fluorescein or indocyanine green (ICG) as part of their routine ophthalmic care (e.g. as part of a fluorescence angiography examination) will be recruited to the first stage of this study. These patients will take part in preliminary studies aimed at determining whether it is possible to detect fluorescein and ICG in the blood using transcutaneous fluorescence measurements.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>2 - Healthy subjects</arm_group_label>
    <description>Healthy subjects with no known issues of increased gut permeability. These subjects will act as negative controls in all gut permeability studies.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>3 - Increased permeability</arm_group_label>
    <description>Gastro-intestinal (GI) and non-GI patients who are expected to exhibit increased gut permeability (e.g. patients with celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), liver disease, HIV or another condition in which increased intestinal permeability is common). The more extreme cases in this group will act as positive controls.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Diagnostic Test</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Spectroscopic gut permeability test</intervention_name>
    <description>The spectroscopic gut permeability test first involves patients receiving an oral dose of one or more fluorescent dyes. A wearable sensor will then be attached to the patients' skin and this will be used to monitor the leakage of the fluorescent dyes from the intestine into the blood stream in a non-invasive manner. In this way, a measure of the permeability of the intestine will be obtained.
Note that patients in Group 1 (ophthalmology patients) will not receive oral doses of contrast agents. Instead, the wearable sensor will simply be used to detect the presence of fluorescent dyes that were administered intravenously as part of planned ophthalmic procedures.
Complete details of the spectroscopic gut permeability test can be found in the attached protocol.</description>

        Potential participants will be identified and approached by members of their
        healthcare/clinical team. They will be identified based on their clinical condition and its
        potential relevance to the study - i.e. ophthalmology patients due to receive intravenous
        doses of fluorescein or ICG for Stage 1; GI and non-GI patients exhibiting increased
        intestinal permeability for Stages 2 and 3.

        Healthy volunteers with no indication of increased intestinal permeability will be
        recruited from Imperial College and St. Mary's Hospital staff. Potential healthy volunteers
        will be approached in person by members of the research team.
