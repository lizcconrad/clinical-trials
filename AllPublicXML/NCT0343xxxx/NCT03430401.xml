  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will adopt a newly developed computer-based cognitive rehabilitation program
      targeting the encoding stage of memory. The aims of the study are:

        1. To test the feasibility of conducting a newly developed computer-based cognitive
           rehabilitation program for people with MCI and mild dementia.

        2. To test the effectiveness of the newly developed program in improving cognitive function
           and enabling maintenance of occupational performance in people with MCI or mild
           dementia.

      Using an iPad application, study participants will learn a memory encoding strategy to
      support completion of their daily activities. By implementing memory encoding strategies
      during the mild stages of cognitive decline, the project aims to prolong independence in
      functional performance. It is anticipated that adoption of the same memory strategies will
      enable maintain performance as they may experience ongoing cognitive decline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study extends on the positive results of a pilot study (Lim et al., 2012) which
      demonstrated the effectiveness of a cognitive training program combined with perceptual and
      semantic memory encoding strategies. Following the intervention phase of the pilot study,
      elements of cognition were examined using standardised assessments. The participants showed
      improved general attention (p = 0.03), memory (p = 0.03) and cognitive function including
      naming (p = 0.02), construction (p = 0.01), memory (p = 0.02) and similarities (p = 0.001)
      all of which are necessary for functioning in daily activities. However, due to the
      combination of strategies used during the pilot study, the isolated effect of perceptual and
      semantic memory encoding strategies could not be determined. It has been found that the
      effects of aging impact negatively on both semantic and perceptual encoding. However, with
      age, there tends to be a greater impact on an individual's ability to use perceptual encoding
      strategies in comparison to those of semantic (Kuo, Liu, Ting, &amp; Chan, 2014). This varies in
      the case of individuals in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease in which many individuals
      will show progressive impairment in semantic memory (Hodges &amp; Patterson, 1995). As dementia
      has been positively correlated with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) but not often diagnosed
      until much later in the course of the disease and as not all individuals with MCI will
      progress to dementia it would be beneficial prior to undertaking a memory encoding
      intervention program to understand if an individual would benefit greater from undertaking a
      semantic or a perceptual memory encoding rehabilitation approach. Although it may be easy for
      a healthy adult to report their preference in encoding style, an individual with MCI or mild
      dementia may find this more difficult due to the abstract complexity of the concepts. As it
      is known that not all cases of MCI progress to dementia, this study aims at identifying if
      individuals with MCI or mild dementia will benefit from intervention based on both semantic
      and perceptual encoding styles.

      In addition, given the benefit and successful use of computer-based programs in elderly, this
      study will develop the memory encoding training program into a user-friendly computer-based
      program in which the older adults with MCI or mild dementia will be able to use under the
      guidance of rehabilitation professionals.

    <description>It will involve the use of visual imagery and the method of loci. To achieve this, each of the 15 daily tasks will be filmed and a short video created. In addition, each task will be broken down into 5-6 photographed steps based on activity analysis and task breakdown. The program will prompt the user to indicate in which room of the house the task would usually be completed. Once correct location is identified, the program will prompt the user to watch a chosen daily task video and then visualise themselves completing the task in their home environment.</description>

    <description>It will incorporate association-based strategies to assist with recalling the steps of daily tasks. The steps of a given daily task will be provided and the user will be prompted to link the steps using a honeycomb concept, which makes use of the chunking method to encode the sequenced steps. Following this, the program will prompt the user to categorise the steps according to their association with given words cues. The word cues will represent time, places, objects, and people. The program will then take the user response and form a verbal and visual story according to the responses given. The program will help identify any problems in the sequencing and prompt the user to re-categorise if required.</description>
