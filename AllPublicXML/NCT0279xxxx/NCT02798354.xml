  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposal will focus on 3 specific, high-risk, pediatric ambulatory diagnostic errors each
      representing a unique dimension of diagnostic assessment: evaluation of symptoms, evaluation
      of signs and follow-up of diagnostic tests. Adolescent depression (i.e. symptoms) affects
      nearly 10% of teenagers, is misdiagnosed in almost 75% of adolescents and causes significant
      morbidity. Pediatric elevated blood pressure (signs) is misdiagnosed in 74-87% of patients,
      often due to inaccurate application of blood pressure parameters that change based on age,
      gender and height. Actionable pediatric laboratory values (diagnostic tests) are potentially
      delayed up to 26% of the time in preliminary investigations and 7-65% in adults, leading to
      harm and malpractice claims.

      The investigators propose to conduct a multisite, prospective, stepped wedge cluster
      randomized trial testing a quality improvement collaborative (QIC) intervention within the
      American Academy of Pediatrics' Quality Improvement Innovation Networks (QuIIN) to reduce the
      incidence of pediatric primary care diagnostic errors. QuIIN is a national network of over
      300 primary care practices, ranging from tertiary care academic medical centers to single
      practitioner private practices, interested in and experienced with QICs. Because many
      processes are likely to be common across diagnostic errors in outpatient settings, a
      multifaceted intervention, such as a QIC, has a high likelihood of success and broad
      applicability across populations. Preparatory inquiries to QuIIN primary care providers
      suggest high interest in reducing these 3 diagnostic errors and provider agreement with
      randomization to evaluate diagnostic error interventions. Practices will be randomized to one
      of three groups, with each group collecting retrospective baseline data on one error above,
      and then intervening to reduce that error during the first eight months. Each group will
      concurrently collect control data on an error they are not intervening on during those eight
      months. Following those eight months, the groups will continue intervening on their first
      error, begin intervening on the error they were a control site for, and begin collecting data
      on the third error for which they will be a control site for. Finally, in the final eight
      months, all groups will intervene on all three errors. A second wave of practices will be
      recruited to join the groups after eight months and will only intervene on two of the three
      errors.

      Objectives:

      Primary

      â€¢ To determine whether a QIC consisting of evidence-based best-practice methodologies,
      mini-root cause analyses, data sharing, and behavior change techniques, is associated with a
      reduction in 3 specific diagnostic error rates in a national group of pediatric primary care
      practices.

        -  Hypothesis 1: Implementation of a QIC will lead to a 40% reduction in missed diagnosis
           of adolescent depression.

        -  Hypothesis 2: Implementation of a QIC will lead to a 30% reduction in missed diagnosis
           of pediatric elevated blood pressure.

        -  Hypothesis 3: Implementation of a QIC will lead to a 45% reduction in delayed diagnosis
           of actionable laboratory results.

      Secondary

        -  To determine if a QIC's effect changes for wave 1 versus wave 2 participants, or for the
           second versus the first error a practice intervenes on.

        -  To further investigate the epidemiology of three ambulatory pediatric diagnostic errors:
           missed diagnosis of adolescent depression, missed diagnosis of pediatric elevated blood
           pressure, and delayed diagnosis of actionable laboratory results.

        -  To evaluate patient outcomes related to these diagnoses including outcomes after
           positive depression screening, missed elevated blood pressure screening and delayed
           diagnosis of actionable laboratory values.
