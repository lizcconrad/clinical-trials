    <textblock>
      Gliomas,especially high-grade glioma ,are the most common primary malignant brain tumor in
      adults,yet outcomes from this aggressive neoplasm remain dismal.The extent of resection is
      one of the most essential factors that influence the outcomes of glioma resection.However,
      conventional structural imaging has failed to accurately delineate glioma margins because of
      tumor cell infiltration. the investigators have finished few project that suggest the
      feasibility of Magnetic Resonance Spectrum(MRS)-guided resection,unfortunately, lacking
      sufficient clinical evidence.This prospective cohort study is to provide a clinical evidence
      for the validity of MRS-guided resection in patients with HGG .

    <textblock>
      High-grade glioma(HGG), including anaplastic glioma (AG) and Glioblastomas (GBM), are
      associated with poor prognosis, even with all the scientific development of the last decades,
      attributed to optimally treated with maximum safe surgery, followed by radiotherapy (RT)
      and/or systemic chemotherapy (CT). Despite recent advances in treatment, the prognosis of HGG
      remains poor with comparatively short overall survival (OS) and importantly profound impact
      on quality of life (QoL).Admittedly,multiple factors are related to their outcome, including
      age, biological characteristics of the tumor, and extent of treatment. Notably, extent of
      resection (EOR) plays a major role as an independent modifiable factor associated with
      improved overall and progression-free survival. Achievement of maximal safe resection,
      removing as much as possible the tumor while preserving the neurological function, is the
      main goal of the current surgical treatment of High-grade glioma (HGG).

      Many researchers took into study about the extent of surgery ,despite exist various
      editions,produced similar results, although only one randomized controlled trial(RCT)
      provided 1-year PFS data and there was no significant difference between total resection and
      incomplete resection in that study. It suggests that should push the delineation of tumour
      outward for better prognosis.therefore,the core of conservation point to the simon-pure
      margins that proximate to histopathologic periphery of HGG.Consequently, analyses showed that
      the resection of ≥ 53.21% of the surrounding FLAIR abnormality beyond the 100%
      contrast-enhancing resection was associated with a significant prolongation of survival
      compared with that following less extensive resections,neo-FLAIR abnormality region is
      gradually coming into people' vision,supportive evidence is warranted for the relationship of
      extensive resection and reasonable prognosis,which equal to draw the scope of tumour margins
      that has been put forward to sketch via metabolic information.

      During previous clinical practice,the investigators have researched that the correlation of
      metabolic information and tumour identification about true-false type,study suggests that
      Cho/tNAA ratio threshold values of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 appeared to predict the specie-mens
      containing the tumour with respective probabilities of 0.38, 0.60, 0.79, 0.90 in HGG and
      0.16, 0.39, 0.67, 0.87 in LGG,it is interesting to reveal the metabolic action of
      true-tumour,and immediately the other work projected by our group found that the differences
      between the structural and the metabolic volumes with Cho/tNAA ratio(CNI) thresholds of 0.5
      and 1.5 were statistically significant (p = 0.0005 and 0.0129, respectively) and 0.5 and 1.0
      were statistically significant in HGG.Problem,whether operation that resect by delineation at
      Cho/tNAA ratio threshold 1.0 can bring better outcome ,remains to be solved,namely,the
      investigators need further clinical evidence .

      Based on this thoughtfulness, this prospective cohort study is to provide a reasonable
      evidence for the correlation between metabolic-guide resection and the prognosis of the HGGs
      , cohorts contain 25 cases in the arm group and 25 cases in the control group.Respectively
      receive different operation project followed by statistical analysis aim at overall survival
      (OS)and progression free survival (PFS).Definitively,the investigators hope to draw a
      conclusion that armed group has better outcome,like that,studies have a step in the course of
      HGG therapy.
