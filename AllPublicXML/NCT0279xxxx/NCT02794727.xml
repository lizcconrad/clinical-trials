  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreased physical activity is not only associated with multiple chronic medical conditions,
      including obesity, but also with depressed mood, and other negative emotions. As many
      employed adults spend a great deal of time at work where we are predominantly sedentary,
      strategies to increase physical activity at work are being pursued to help improve the
      physical and mental health of Americans. This 17 week randomized controlled trial will
      investigate changes of occupational physical activity in three groups: those provided with a
      FitBit® but not able to monitor their activity level, and those provided with activity goals
      and individual physical activity challenges, and those who do not use a FitBit®.

      All subjects will be entered into a 4 week run-in phase where subjects will wear a blinded
      Fitbit during work hours. The baseline work activity is collected at this time. This phase is
      followed by a randomization to one of 3 groups: the blinded Fitbit group, the unblinded
      Fitbit group, and the group which will not wear any activity monitors. During these 12 weeks
      we will collect data on activity levels during work hours. Everyone will have a final contact
      at week 17 to close out the study.
