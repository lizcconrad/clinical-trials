  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies, investigators have studied if a pre-meal insulin bolus based on
      estimated carbohydrate meal size would alleviate the burden of carbohydrate counting without
      a significant degradation in postprandial glucose control. With this strategy, the patient
      would only have to evaluate the size of the meal in terms of carbohydrate (snack, regular,
      large or very large). It is however important to establish the safety of this simplified meal
      bolus approach. The safety of overestimating a meal insulin bolus in the context of
      closed-loop strategy needs to be assessed. For ethical reasons, only dual-hormone closed-loop
      will be tested.

      Investigators hypothesize that dual-hormone closed-loop with overestimated meal size bolus
      will not increase time below 4.0 mmol/L compared to dual-hormone closed-loop with an
      adequately estimated meal size bolus.

    <description>Interventions will be undertaken 1 to 5 days after sensor insertion. Subjects will be admitted at the research center at 7:00. Subject's pump will be substituted with the study pump and an additional pump containing glucagon will be installed. At 7:00, closed-loop will be initiated. At 9:00, a standardized breakfast (45g CHO) will be served. Study subjects will consume the same meal on the two intervention days. During the intervention, patients will be allowed to do sedentary activities. Patients will be allowed to consume caffeine during the intervention, but will have to replicate their caffeine consumption on both interventions. The intervention day will end at 13:00.</description>

             inhibitors) if not at a stable dose for 3 months. Otherwise, these medications are
             acceptable and will be kept stable during the entire protocol.

          6. Oral steroids unless patients present a low stable dose (e.g. 10 mg or less of
             prednisone per day or physiological doses, less than 35 mg/day, of hydrocortisone
             CortefÂ®). Inhale steroids at stable dose in the last month are acceptable.

          7. Other serious medical illness likely to interfere with study participation or with the
             ability to complete the trial by the judgment of the investigator (e.g. unstable
             psychiatric condition).

          8. Failure to comply with team's recommendations (e.g. not willing to change pump
             parameters, follow algorithm's suggestions, etc).
