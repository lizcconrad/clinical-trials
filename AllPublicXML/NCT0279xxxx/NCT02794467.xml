  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      epelsiban compared with placebo in treatment of women with adenomyosis.

      This is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with an
      interim futility analysis. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive 75 milligrams (mg) of
      epelsiban three times daily (TID), 200 mg of epelsiban TID, or placebo TID. The study will be
      composed of three periods: screening, treatment, and follow-up and the total time a subject
      will be in the study will be approximately 6 months.
