      Qualitative project, comprising open-ended semi-structured interviews with healthcare
      workers, who provide antenatal care to substance-using women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal substance use during pregnancy (including legal and illicit substances) is a fairly
      common global phenomenon, including in the UK. This can have significant effects on
      pregnancy, infant outcome and enduring consequences into adolescence. Babies born with
      neonatal abstinence syndrome may spend months in neonatal care units, requiring complex,
      24hour care. Here, healthcare workers may experience conflict between preserving maternal
      autonomy, and the challenge of caring for a withdrawing newborn.

      However, there is discrepancy between the objectives of policy-makers &quot;Reducing the harm to
      children from parental problem drug use should become a main objective of policy and
      practice&quot; and those recommended in healthcare &quot;These women need supportive and coordinated
      care during pregnancy.&quot; Therefore, conflict arises between mother-centred and child-centred
      models of caring for pregnant women who use substances.

      The objective of the proposed project is to investigate how healthcare workers providing
      treatment for pregnant women who use illicit substances perceive their duty of care and
      whether they experience tension between the conflicting objectives of mother-centred and
      child-centred approaches through semi-structured qualitative interviews. The investigators
      will explore the ways in which healthcare workers frame problematic substance misuse in
      pregnant women, what they perceive to be the major challenges in providing care and their
      views on the responsibility of a mother to have a healthy baby. The main hypothesis is that
      healthcare workers providing care for pregnant women engaging in problematic substance misuse
      experience conflict between mother-centred and child- centred approaches to care.

        Healthcare workers may include Specialist Midwives, Obstetricians, Substance Misuse Charge
        Nurses, Neonatologists and Health Visitors. Women using substances are defined as those who
        are being seen at the clinic (either due to self-referral, or due to referral by a
        healthcare worker), at any time during their pregnancy. I have personal experience of
        working in this clinic, which is run in an NHS hospital on the South Coast of the UK.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthcare workers will be recruited based on their employment statusÍ¾ they must
             currently provide some form of antenatal are for women who engage in problematic use
             of substances (limited to illicit drugs, excluding tobacco and alcohol).

          -  Healthcare workers will not be restricted by age, and all genders will be included. As
             the research is qualitative, a representative same is unnecessary.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthcare workers will be excluded if they do not have experience of providing
             ante-natal care for women who engage in problematic substance misuse (limited to
             illicit drugs, excluding tobacco and alcohol) during their pregnancy.
