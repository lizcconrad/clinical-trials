    <textblock>
      Vast majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) present with unresectable
      disease. In the last decade results of randomized trials and a subsequent metaanalyses
      established transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or systemic chemotherapy (sorafenib) as
      standard of care. However, TACE alone is not a curative approach. The two year survival
      following TACE ranges from 31-63% with almost 100% patients developing disease progression
      after treatment. There is need to investigate additional therapeutic options that would
      consolidate the initial response to TACE. A recent metaanalyses concluded that addition of
      high dose radiation to TACE results in 10-35% improvement in two year overall survival.
      However as results of metaanalyses were based on studies with small sample size, unclear
      randomization procedure and heterogenous dose of radiation, the need for conducting a high
      quality randomized study was highlighted The present study is designed to investigate the
      role of high dose conformal radiation as consolidation therapy after TACE in patients with
      nonmetastatic unresectable HCC.

      Resection or liver transplant is the only curative treatment in patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) however a vast majority of patients present with unresectable disease. In the
      last decade results of randomized trials and a subsequent metaanalyses established
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as standard of care in patients with Barcelona Clinic
      Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B. However, TACE alone is not a curative approach. The two year
      survival following TACE ranges from 31-63% with almost 100% patients developing disease
      progression after treatment. There is need to investigate additional therapeutic options that
      would consolidate the initial response to TACE. A recent metaanalyses including 17 trials (5
      randomized and 12 non randomized studies) concluded that addition of high dose radiation to
      TACE results in upto 10-35% improvement in two year overall survival. However as results of
      metaanalyses were based on studies with small sample size, unclear randomization procedure
      and heterogenous dose of radiation, the need for conducting a high quality randomized study
      was highlighted. The present study is designed to investigate the role of high dose conformal
      radiation as consolidation therapy after TACE in patients with nonmetastatic unresectable
      HCC.

      With an integrated phase II/III design the study investigates the impact of local radiation
      therapy on infield progression free survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable
      HCC.

    <description>Patients randomized to drug eluting beads(DEB) TACE arm will undergo 3 cycles of DEB-TACE (100 mg of doxorubicin drug eluting beads which will be repeated after 4-6 weeks. CT/MRI will be repeated prior to each cycle. Sorafenib will be omitted on the day of TACE and will be reinitiated after the TACE procedure. After completing all TACE cycles patients will continue to be on sorafenib till progression, or 12 months whichever is later, or in patients who fail to tolerate it after dose modifications. Hepatobiliary CTCAE will be completed at baseline, at each TACE cycle and subsequently at each follow up. QOL will be evaluated at the same time and also at two months after completing all sessions of TACE (matched time point with completion of SBRT in interventional arm)</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to DEB TACE/SBRT arm will undergo DEB-TACE as in standard arm. SBRT will be initiated 4-6 weeks after last TACE procedure. During this period patients will stop Sorafenib. SBRT once initiated will continue for 2-2.5 weeks. Sorafenib will be reinitiated 4 weeks after SBRT completion and will continue to be administered till progression or 12 months whichever is earlier, or in patients who fail to tolerate it after dose modifications. QOL will be evaluated at baseline, before each cycle of TACE, 1 month after SBRT and three monthly thereafter. Hepatobiliary CTCAE will be completed at baseline, after each TACE, before SBRT and after completion of SBRT and subsequently at each follow up.</description>

Though 400 mg bid is the recommended dose a lower dose may be used as per the judgement of treating clinician. It will be omitted on the days of TACE and SBRT. Sorafenib will be reinitiated 4 weeks after SBRT completion and will continue to be administered till progression or 12 months whichever is earlier. Sorafenib can however be stopped in patients who fail to tolerate sorafenib even after dose modifications.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of HCC. Tissue diagnosis is not mandatory however desirable. In the absence
             of tissue diagnosis imaging findings characteristic of HCC will be used. i.e. in high
             risk population a nodule with arterial phase enhancement and wash out during
             portovenous phase will be considered as diagnostic of HCC. In patients where one
             imaging is not conclusive another imaging modality will be used. However if second
             imaging is also inconclusive and Alpha Feto Protein (AFP) is within the nondiagnostic
             or borderline range than tissue diagnosis will be deemed mandatory.

          -  Barcelona Stage B/ Barcelona A not deemed suitable for Sx or refuse surgery. Child
             Pugh A/Select Child Pugh B (score7/10).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0-1.

          -  Total number of measurable target lesions 2 or less than 2, can be encompassed within
             a single hepatic field or 2 different hepatic fields without exceeding safe dose limit
             constraints.

          -  Optimal predicted liver volume reserve &gt;700 cc. No Contraindication for TACE. Tumor
             considered to be sufficiently away from GI structures to deliver safe radiation dose
             (&gt;1 cm).

          -  Willing for molecular banking of tumour tissue (optional).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Metastatic or nodal disease on staging investigations.

          -  Child C Cirrhosis or previous history of liver failure. Expected life span &lt;6 months.

          -  Active variceal bleeding or other signs of hepatic decompensation.

          -  Portal venous thrombosis rendering patients unsuitable for TACE. However if pt is
             suitable for superselective TACE then can be considered for trial inclusion.
