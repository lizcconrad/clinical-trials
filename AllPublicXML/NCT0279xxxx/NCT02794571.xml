  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study is designed to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and PK of MTIG7192A alone or in combination with atezolizumab in
      participants with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic incurable tumors for whom
      standard therapy does not exist, has proven to be ineffective or intolerable, or is
      considered inappropriate, or for whom a clinical trial of an investigational agent is a
      recognized standard of care.
