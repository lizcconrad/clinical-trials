  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT) has a major curative role in women with early breast cancer, and is
      recommended routinely after lumpectomy and selectively after mastectomy. It has contributed
      to a halving of breast cancer mortality in the UK over the last 2 decades despite ever-rising
      cancer incidence. RT in women with left-sided tumours often exposes the underlying heart to a
      damaging dose. The heart is very sensitive to RT, and there were 1-2 deaths from heart
      disease for every 100 breast cancer patients treated during the 1960s-70s. The situation has
      improved in recent years, but standard RT techniques still deliver significant radiation
      doses to heart tissue.

      Two potentially simple techniques reduce heart dose. In one, women are taught to breathe in
      deeply and to hold their breath for about 20 seconds while RT is given. The downward movement
      of the diaphragm pulls the heart away from the RT beam. In the other technique, women lie on
      their fronts, instead of on their backs as they normally do for breast RT. In this position,
      the breast falls away from the rib cage and reduces exposure of the heart. Neither technique
      is routinely available to women receiving breast RT in the UK for reasons that this research
      aims to address. The investigators need to: 1) confirm that patient position can be
      reproduced with millimetre precision every day using these techniques, 2) minimise costs of
      equipment, time and personnel required to support such techniques, 3) select the most
      appropriate technique for different patients and 4) train staff in centres across the UK to
      deliver techniques safely and effectively. By addressing all of these issues, the study aims
      ultimately to make heart-sparing RT available to all UK women that might benefit from
      treatment, thereby significantly reducing the burden of heart disease in breast cancer
      survivors.

    <description>The ABC unit allows for temporary and reproducible immobilization of internal thoracic structures by monitoring the patient's breathing cycle and implementing a breath hold at a predefined lung volume level. The device consists of a mouthpiece connected to a pneumotachometer via a bidirectional valve and tubing. The air flow across the pneumotachometer is integrated and displayed on a computer monitor. The computer also controls a scissor valve which, when enabled, restricts air flow through the system, enabling the breath hold phase. The mouthpiece and air filter are patient specific, as is a nose clip that is used to ensure that patients are breathing through the device.</description>
