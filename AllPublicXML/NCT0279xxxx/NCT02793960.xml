  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study to investigate the effects of a topical cream on patients 12
      years of age and older that have been diagnosed with epidermolysis bullosa.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be conducted in patients with any form of Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) with at
      least 1 active EB wound between 2.5 and 50 cm2 in size or up to 10% of the Body Surface Area.
      The investigators will identify an &quot;index lesion&quot; and other lesions for treatment An area of
      un-involved skin will also be treated with the study cream. This are will be used for testing
      by producing tiny blisters th so that the underlying tissue can be examined using a special
      microscope.

      Patients will apply the study cream

          1. Male or female at least 12 years of age at the time of screening.

          2. Have primary, histologically confirmed EB verified by immunofluorescent antigenic
             mapping (EM) prior to starting application of study drug

          3. Have no other dermatological disease that may adversely impact wound healing.

          4. Willing to refrain from using topical creams or lotions other than the study drug to
             the designated areas during the treatment period and from washing the designated areas
             until the next application is done.

             the duration of the study.

          6. Laboratory values for the tests listed in the Study Schedule are within the local
             reference ranges as defined by the local laboratory, or &quot;out of range&quot; test results
             are clinically acceptable to the investigator. Acceptable &quot;out of range&quot; values are
             generally those within the patient's normal baseline levels due to concurrent
             medications or disease processes with the exception of INR and PT/APTT.

          8. Has a provided written informed consent by patient or a legal guardian, including
             consent for tissue to be examined and stored by the Department of Dermatology and

             xerodermapigmentosa, or clinical evidence of infection.

          4. Concurrent disease or treatment that suppresses the immune system.

          5. Any chronic medical condition that, in the judgment of the investigator(s), can
             interfere with the performance of the study or would place the patient at undue risk.

             Cream

          7. Treatment with any systemic immunomodulators or immunosuppressants within the 2 months
             prior to enrollment, for a duration longer than 2 weeks.
