  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At hospital, short term actions are used (adaptation of meals, oral supplementation…) to
      fight malnutrition. Oral supplementation can have a positive impact on weight gain. But
      actions should continue at home, particularly to maintain autonomy for elderly. The
      hypothesis is that practical workshop about enrichment and interest of foods can help
      malnourished patients to change their eating habits. The main goal of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of this workshop on improving nutritional status, measured by Mini
      Nutritional Assessment

      This is a mono center cohort study of a 4-months follow-up on elderly patients after
      hospitalization.

      Nutritional parameters and evaluation of the quality of life will be collected during
      hospitalization and output during a visit at 4 months at home. These parameters will be
      studied in two groups : nutritional workshop vs usual dietary counseling
