  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies how well a tailored interactive digital versatile disc
      (DVD) with or without patient navigation works in improving screening rates in rural women
      for breast cancer, cervical cancer or colorectal cancer. A tailored interactive DVD and
      patient navigation may help rural women to learn more about cancer screening and to better
      understand the results.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the effectiveness of a tailored and interactive DVD (TIDVD) versus (vs.) TIDVD +
      telephone-based patient navigation (PN) intervention (TIDVD + PN) vs. usual care (UC), to
      increase guideline-based cancer screening rates at 12 months post randomization for breast
      cancer (BC), cervical cancer (CC), and colorectal cancer (CRC) among 1058 women age 50 to 74
      living in rural northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana.

      II. Compare the cost effectiveness of the TIDVD and the TIDVD + PN intervention vs. UC, for
      adherence to each screening outcome or combination of screening tests.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients watch a tailored interactive DVD program and answer questions posed by the
      DVD program.

      ARM II: Patients engage in TIDVD and PN.

      ARM III: Patients receive brochures that explain and provide encouragement for cancer
      screening.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up at 2 and 12 months.

    <description>Will combine MRR and self-report by using MRR when available and self-report otherwise. Participants will be asked to provide contact information on both their primary care physician and any specialist who provided a screening test, reducing the chance of missing a test that was conducted but not reported to the primary care physician. For those who are lost to follow-up, a signed MRR form will enable the investigators to obtain the adherence outcome for those participants.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Binary adherence to all needed screening and any needed screening across the three randomized arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Will be tested initially with pair-wise chi-square tests. Binary logistic regression analysis will be used to compare the two interventions and the UC group on the binary dependent variable (adherence), while adjusting for any potentially confounding covariates. The models will be controlled for any demographic covariate (e.g., age, education) for which the randomized groups differ significantly at baseline using a liberal significance level of 0.20 to achieve conservative adjustment. As a sensitivity analysis, multiple imputation will be used to impute the adherence outcome for participants.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost effectiveness of each intervention assessed by QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Year)-based cost utility</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) implies a comparison of whether the cost per unit of outcome in one situation exceeds that in another. Unless the outcome measures are comparable, this is not possible. Will be able to examine outcomes of the interventions and the UC group (completed cancer screening tests). Analysis will emphasize the first two questions (cost of the intervention itself, calculation of net cost). CEA will consist of measuring the incremental cost of achieving the observed incremental outcomes, but not a cost-effectiveness ratio in standard terms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost of the interventions</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the model implemented in this study, the PN's spend full time in that activity. Thus, the costs of implementation are straightforward and obtainable. Even though the PN is full-time, data will be collected concerning at least the broad categories of time use, so that the cost of specific components (e.g., arranging transportation) can be estimated more accurately. The best way to do this will be a structured time log. A developed Participant Encounter Form and a Tracking Log of Direct Participant Contacts will be used to provide the majority of this information. The procedures outlined above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost savings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In order to avoid distortions in the measured impact of an intervention due to pricing differences, all cancer screening tests will be assigned cost based on their Medicare allowable payment, regardless of how the service was actually paid for. While this is not a pure cost measure, it is comparable and avoids other potential distortions like differences in cost to charge ratio for different payers.</description>
