    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine if subjects taking the natural product AphoelineBrake™
      in addition to their standard treatment experience differences in metabolic disease control,
      gastrointestinal hormones and inflammatory markers diet, hunger, satiety, weight, compared to
      patients taking a placebo in addition to their standard treatment. The secondary objective is
      to study the effect of Aphoeline Brake on oxidative and inflammatory stress markers.

    <description>The study is proposed as a placebo controlled randomized controlled trial with an intervention (AphoelineBrake) in addition to their standard treatment in comparison to a standard treatment control arm receiving an identical placebo. Prior to the commencement of any study procedures, participants will document informed consent and acknowledgement of privacy rights. Participants will be seen for initial consenting procedures, initial study procedures, and follow-up procedures at the Dasman Diabetes Institute clinic.Scheduled study visits will occur at Day 0, Day 7, Months: 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in accordance with standards of medical care.</description>
