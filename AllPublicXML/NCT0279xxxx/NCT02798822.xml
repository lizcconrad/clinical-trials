  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posterior crossbite is a common clinical condition often associated with transverse maxillary
      deficiency and functional mandibular shift. This frequent malocclusion is not self-correcting
      and can lead to the development of craniofacial asymmetries and mandibular dysfunction.

      The aim of the current study was to evaluate maxillary and mandibular arch widths' response
      to RME when it is anchored to the upper second deciduous molars or to the upper first
      permanent molars and to create a decision-making protocol for RME therapy in mixed-dentition
      patients.

    <textblock>
      The effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) on the maxillary complex have been highly
      investigated,4 reporting a maximum maxillary intermolar and intercanine width increase of 6.7
      mm and 5.3 mm,5 respectively, when RME is banded on upper first permanent molars.

      Literature also reported cases of periodontal and endodontic damage on RME anchoring teeth;
      therefore, some authors have suggested banding RME on primary teeth and reporting also
      different mean intermolar (3.6-4.1 mm) and intercanine width increases (5-5.9 mm).

      Few studies have investigated the changes in molar dental tipping and inclinations (on
      average from 3° up to 16.7°) following RME but comprised difficult (ie, barium sulfate
      solution) and more invasive examinations such as computed tomography and cone beam computed
      tomography (CBCT) Few articles concerning the indirect effects on mandibular arch following
      RME reported a low but statistically significant increase of lower intermolar (0.66-0.97 mm)
      and intercanine width (0.9 mm). Since no studies in the literature have analyzed the
      differences in permanent vs primary molars as anchoring teeth for RME, the decision to band
      the permanent deciduous molars did not follow a clinical protocol, but an individual decision
      was made for each patient based on clinician experience.

    <description>Intervention/Procedure: Rapid maxillary expansion. When RME was in situ, patients started the screw activation (Snap-lock expander screw, Forestadent, Pforzheim, Germany) of one-quarter turn a day (0.22 mm) until overcorrection was achieved (ie, the occlusal surface of the first maxillary palatal cusp contacted the occlusal surface of the mandibular first molar facial cusp), and the RME remained in place for 10 months. The screw was turned for 35 ± 6 days for Gr6, and the average treatment time was 12 ± 1.3 months.</description>
