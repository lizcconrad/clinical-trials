  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The double amputation of the forearms is a rare handicap that seriously impacts the autonomy
      and the quality of life of patients, social and familial exclusion, and dependence on third
      parties for everyday activities.

      The management of these patients is nearly exclusively through the use of prostheses. Certain
      patients refuse this solution, or remain penalized by the absence of sensitivity , the lack
      of precision in movements, and body image issues related to the amputation; the double graft
      of hands and forearms may, in this circumstance, be the only solution.

      Since January 2000, date of the first double hand graft, six bilateral grafts of hands have
      been performed at the Hospices Civils de Lyon. This first study reported the feasibility of
      the graft. The functional results obtained after the double transplant have allowed patients
      to recover complete autonomy for everyday activities, at the price of an immunosuppressive
      treatment. We have found that these very good functional results are maintained over time
      and, for a certain number of patients, to return to work which is a factor of social
      integration.

      The rate of medical complications (metabolic, infectious, oncological), essentially related
      to the immunosuppressive treatment, is not greater to that found for other types of graft,
      but are considered as a limiting factor for the development of this strategy. These results
      are confirmed by international experience that is of the same order. Only a few rare cases of
      re-amputation have been reported in patients for whom the immunosuppressive treatment was
      discontinued or following vascular thrombosis.

      A new study is required to continue this evaluation and to compare double graft to prostheses
      in terms costs, quality of life, usefulness, satisfaction, autonomy, and social integration.
      The results of this study will allow the placement of these strategies in the management of
      patients with double amputation of the hands and forearms.
