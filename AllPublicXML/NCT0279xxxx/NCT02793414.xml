    <textblock>
      This is a diagnostic efficacy study to evaluate a set of biomarkers in human breath
      indicative of an acute malaria infection. The investigators plan to enroll 75 malaria
      patients and 175 febrile non-malaria patients in Ethiopia.

      Upon enrollment, blood for malaria RDT, microscopy and PCR will be collected as well as a
      breath sample to assess the presence of biomarkers at a reference center. Malaria patients
      identified by microscopy are revisited at day 2 and 7 to collect a further samples. G6PD
      testing will be performed concurrently to identify prevalent G6PD variants.
