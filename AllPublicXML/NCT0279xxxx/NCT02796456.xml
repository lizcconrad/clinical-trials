  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background :

      Apelin and its receptor APJ have been implicated in pathologies including cardiovascular
      disease, diabetes and obesity. Little is known about the function of the apelinergic system
      during gestation.

      Objective :

      The main objective of this study is to compare apelinemia in fasting normal weight and obese
      women at the end of pregnancy, between 35 and 41 weeks of gestation (WG).

      Strategy and method:

      A prospective research evaluating will be conducted to compare apelinemia in fasting normal
      weight and obese women at the end of pregnancy, between 35 and 41 weeks of gestation (WG).

      A third group will be created to check if gestational diabetes is not a confounding factor in
      obesity (group of obese women with gestational diabetes).

      Investigators will try to see if apelinemia is correlated to lipidic and glycemic markers.

      Samples will be collected in the cord blood to compare maternal and neonatal apelinemia and
      to see if neonatal apelinemia is correlated to the child's weight and birth size and to the
      weight of the placenta.

      Placenta samples will be collected and RT-qPCR will be done to analyze RNA in each group.

      Two days after delivery, obese and not obese women will be fasted and plasma and colostrum
      will be collected. Investigators will compare apelin levels in the colostrum between these 2
      groups and then investigators will try to see if apelin level is correlated in the colostrum
      and in maternal plasma.

      Background :

      Apelin and its receptor APJ have been implicated in pathologies including cardiovascular
      disease, diabetes and obesity.

      Little is known about the function of the apelinergic system during gestation.

      In a previous study, investigators evaluated in mice this system at the feto-maternal
      interface in insulin-resistant obese female (HF) mice. Maternal apelinemia was decreased at
      term and fetal apelinemia was sixfold higher than maternal level. Ex-vivo, the placenta
      releases high amount of apelin at E12.5 and E18.5. In HF pregnant mice at term, apelinemia as
      well as placental apelin and APJ mRNA levels were increased whereas placental release of
      apelin was drastically reduced.
