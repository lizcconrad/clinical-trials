      The aim of the study is to explore association between increased central venous pressure,
      Ejection Fraction and renal dysfunction (eGFR) in patients with Cardio-Renal Syndromes type 1
      and 2. The pilot study was set to provide the expected correlation coefficient for a sample
      size determination of the subsequent study.

      OBJECTIVES

      The aim of the study is to explore association between increased central venous pressure
      (CVP), Ejection Fraction (EF) and renal dysfunction (eGFR) in patients with Cardio-Renal
      Syndromes type 1 and 2.

      BACKGROUND

      The pathophysiology of impaired renal function in cardiovascular disease is multifactorial.
      Recent investigations suggest that management of patients based on low-flow theory does not
      lead to improved outcomes. Relative importance of right heart dysfunction (manifested as
      increased CVP) has not been evaluated . Precise understanding of bidirectional pathways by
      which the heart and kidneys influence each other is necessary to define optimal treatment
      strategies specific to the subtypes, as therapies directed towards one organ system may have
      beneficial or unfavorable effects on the other.

      METHODS

      The study is of non-experimental (observational) type, based on retrospective chart review.
      The patients' personal identifiers are concealed and an anonymized datasets used (unique code
      given to each patient, which is kept secure under the control of hospital staff).
