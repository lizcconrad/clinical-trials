  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to determine the incidence of hemi-diaphragmatic paresis (HDP) with
      two commonly used techniques of supraclavicular nerve block, the single and double injection
      techniques.

      It is our hypothesis that a double injection peripheral nerve block technique will increase
      the risk of HDP when compared to a single injection technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a prospective, blinded, randomized controlled trial to assess
      the two methods of supraclavicular block (single and double injection), and the resultant
      incidence of temporary diaphragm dysfunction, or hemi-diaphragmatic paresis (HDP) will be
      measured with ultrasound. Patients having forearm or hand surgery will be asked by the
      attending anesthesiologist if they will agree to be approached by someone from the research
      team for consent and possible inclusion in the study. This will be done in the anesthesia
      preoperative assessment clinic, or in the pre-op area on the day of surgery (if a patient was
      not seen in clinic).

      Once consented, all patients in the study will have baseline measurements of their sensation
      and movement of the arm for surgery, as well as an ultrasound examination of the movement of
      the diaphragm.

      Patients will then be randomized to either the single or double injection supraclavicular
      nerve block. The blocks will be performed by attending anesthesiologists with experience in
      regional anesthesia, or by residents and fellows under the direct supervision of such
      anesthesiologists.

    <description>Sensation of the terminal peripheral nerves of the upper extremity will be assessed by a single observer blinded to the technique for the musculocutaneous, median, radial, ulnar and the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerves. Sensory assessments will be done using a blunt needle and the response will be assessed on a 3-point scale using the contralateral limb as a control: 0 = normal sensation, 1 = hypoesthesia, and 2 = anesthesia. A composite score will be created for each time point.</description>

    <description>Motor blockade of the musculocutaneous, radial, median, and ulnar nerves will be evaluated by elbow flexion, thumb abduction, thumb opposition, and thumb adduction, respectively. Motor blockade will be graded on a 3-point scale: 0 = normal strength, 1 = weakness relative to the contralateral side, and 2 = complete paralysis.

    <description>The ultrasound probe will be applied in a sterile fashion in the supraclavicular fossa to obtain a short-axis view of the subclavian artery. A 22G, 50mm Echogenic Stimuplex needle will be advanced in-plane with respect to the image, and the needle tip will be advanced to the junction of the first rib and subclavian artery. Ultrasound cineloops will be kept of all nerve block procedures.
30 milliliters of mepivacaine 1.5% will be injected incrementally in 5ml boluses at this location looking for spread of local anesthetic under and medial to the subclavian artery. The needle may be slightly repositioned to improve the distribution of the injectate at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist.</description>

A 22G, 50mm Echogenic Stimuplex needle will be advanced in-plane with respect to the image, and the needle tip will be advanced to the junction of the first rib and subclavian artery. Ultrasound cineloops will be kept of all nerve block procedures.
15 milliliters of mepivacaine 1.5% will be injected incrementally at the same, above-mentioned location. The needle will then be redirected to the superolateral aspect of the brachial plexus, and an additional 15ml will be injected here. Again, the needle may slightly repositioned at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist in order to obtain adequate spread.</description>
