      Background:

      LMB-100 is a man-made protein. It is attracted to the mesothelin protein. This is found in
      many tumors, including mesothelioma. But it is found in only a very small number of normal
      tissues. After binding to mesothelin on tumors, LMB-100 attacks and kills cancer cells.
      Researchers want to test LMB-100 in people with advanced mesothelioma.

      Objective:

      To find a safe dose and anti-tumor activity of LMB-100 for people with advanced mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 and older with:

      Advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma that has not responded to platinum-based

      therapy

      Adequate organ function

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Samples of tumor tissue or tumor fluid. These can be new or from a previous procedure.

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Chest x-rays

      CT or MRI scans

      FDG-PET scans

      Participants will get LMB-100 on days 1, 3, and 5 of each 21-day cycle. It will be given
      through an IV catheter, a tube inserted in an arm vein. They will get standard medicines
      before each infusion to help prevent side effects. Each infusion lasts about 30 minutes. They
      will be monitored for up to 2 hours after.

      During each cycle, participants will repeat the screening tests.

      Participants will get the study drug for up to 4 cycles or until their disease worsens or
      they have intolerable side effects.

      About 4 6 weeks after their last infusion, participants will have a follow-up visit. They
      will repeat the study tests.

      Participants will have follow-up scans every 6 weeks until their disease gets worse.

      Participants will be called about once a year to see how they are doing.

      Background:

        -  Although mesothelioma patients with a limited tumor burden may benefit from surgical
           resection, most patients have advanced disease at diagnosis and are not candidates for
           cytoreductive surgery.

        -  For mesothelioma patients who are not eligible for curative surgery, the median survival
           with supportive care alone is 6 months whereas with the current standard treatment, a
           combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed, the median survival is 12 months.

        -  Mesothelin, a tumor differentiation antigen, is expressed in over 95% of epitheloid
           mesothelioma. Mesothelin is a suitable candidate for targeted therapy due to its very
           limited expression in normal human tissue and its high expression in several tumors
           including mesothelioma.

        -  LMB-100 is a novel recombinant anti-mesothelin immunotoxin developed for the treatment
           of patients with solid tumors that express mesothelin. Mesothelin is targeted by linking
           a humanized fragment of the anti-mesothelin Fab to a de-immunized Pseudomonas exotoxin
           (PE).

        -  The clinical use of first generation immunotoxins such as SS1P was hampered mainly by
           their high immunogenicity. LMB-100 is a next generation PE-fusion protein that has been
           protein-engineered to maximally reduce its immunogenicity. LMB-100 has shown broad
           activity against different mesothelinexpressing cancer cell lines and tumor xenograft
           models.

      Objectives: Phase 1

      To identify the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LMB-100 in patients with treatment
      refractory advanced epithelioid or biphasic mesothelioma and evaluate potential efficacy of
      the identified PP2D.

      -Phase 2

      To determine the efficacy of LMB-100 with respect to objective response rate in patients with
      treatment refractory advanced epithelioid or biphasic mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Histologically confirmed advanced pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma

        -  Subjects must have had at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen with last dose of previous
           therapy occurring at 3 weeks before the start of study treatment

        -  Adequate organ function

        -  Participants with CNS metastases or prior pneumonectomy are excluded

      Design:

        -  This is a Phase I, open-label study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and
           activity of LMB-100 in patients with treatment refractory advanced epithelioid or
           biphasic mesothelioma.

        -  LMB-100 will be administered intravenously on days 1, 3 and 5 of each 21 day cycle for
           up to 4 cycles

        -  Tumor response will be assessed after every 2 cycles

        -  Optional tumor biopsies may be collected at baseline and after 2 cycles of therapy

        -  The accrual ceiling will be set at 30

             have a more than or equal to 50% sarcomatoid component will be excluded. The diagnosis
             will be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI.

          -  Archival sample or fresh biopsy or tumor effusion must be available for confirmation
             of diagnosis.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as greater than or equal to 20 mm
             with conventional techniques or as greater than or equal to10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Patients must have had at least one prior chemotherapy regimen that includes
             pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin. There is no limit to the number of prior

                  reviewed on a monthly basis), or agree to use, and be able to comply with,
                  effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting study
                  therapy (including dose interruptions), while on study medication and for 3
                  months after the last dose of study therapy; and

               -  Have a negative serum pregnancy test ( &lt;= -hCG) result at screening and agree to
                  ongoing pregnancy testing during the course of the study, and after the end of
                  study therapy. This applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from
                  heterosexual contact.

          -  Men must agree to practice true abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual
             contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while
             participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for 6 months following
             discontinuation of study therapy, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed
             consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (All Cohorts):

        -Known or clinically suspected CNS primary tumors or metastases including leptomeningeal
        metastases. History or clinical evidence of CNS metastases unless they have been previously
        treated, are asymptomatic, and have had no requirement for steroids or enzyme-inducing
        anticonvulsants in the last 14 days.

        Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases which could affect compliance
        with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant pulmonary disease
        other than primary cancer, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and/or significant
        cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease,
        myocardial infarction within the last 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, unstable angina, or
        clinically significant pericardial effusion)

          -  Active or uncontrolled infections.

          -  HIV or active HBV or HCV infection. HIV positive patients will be excluded due to a
             theoretical concern that the degree of immune suppression associated with the
             treatment may result in progression of HIV infection.

          -  Patients with prior pneumonectomy

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that would
             contraindicate the use of an investigational drug

          -  Major surgery or significant traumatic injury greater than or equal to 28 days prior
             to the first LMB-100 infusion (excluding biopsies) or anticipation of the need for

          -  Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent

          -  Live attenuated vaccinations 14 days prior to treatment

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with LMB-100, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with LMB-100. These potential risks may also
             apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of LMB-100

          -  High doses of systemic corticosteroids within 7 days prior to first dosing. High dose

             days.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA (Cohort B only)

          -  Subjects must not have received paclitaxel nor nab-paclitaxel within 4 months prior to
             initiation of study therapy.

          -  Participants with contra-indication and/or history of sever hypersensitivity reactions
             to nab-paclitaxel.
