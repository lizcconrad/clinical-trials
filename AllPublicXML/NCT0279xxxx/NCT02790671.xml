               -  Naturally postmenopausal (spontaneous cessation of menses) for at least 24
                  consecutive mo prior to dosing, with a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level
                  at Screening of â‰¥ 40 mIU/mL

               -  Non-lactating

          -  Male subjects must agree to contraception (condom with spermicide) in addition to
             having their female partner (if of childbearing potential) use another form of
             contraception (eg, an intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, oral
             contraceptive, injectables, or subdermal hormonal implant) from the first dose until
             12 wk following last administration. Also, male subjects must not donate sperm during
             the study and afterwards for a period of 12 wk.

          -  Provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study. Able to
             understand and willing to comply with all the study requirements, and willing to allow
             the collection of all blood and urine specimens.

          -  Negative urine test for drugs of abuse (opiates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines,
             cannabinoids, cocaine, barbiturates, phencyclidine), cotinine, and alcohol at
             Screening and During Enrollment on Day -1.

          -  Willingness to abstain from grapefruit/grapefruit juice and Seville oranges 10 d
             before the first dose of study drug on Day 1 until the end of the study on Day 31.

          -  Willingness to refrain from consuming food or beverages containing caffeine/xanthine
             and alcohol 24 h prior to Enrollment on Day -1 until the end of the study on Day 31.

             pulmonary, endocrine/metabolic, neurologic, infectious, gastrointestinal (ie, any
             condition which may affect drug absorption), hematologic, or oncologic disease.

          -  Laboratory results (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) outside of the normal
             range and considered clinically significant in the opinion of the PI. Liver function
             (AST, ALT, bilirubin) test results must be below the ULN at Screening and during
             Enrollment on Day -1.

          -  A QTcF interval duration &gt; 450 msec at Screening.

          -  Participation in a previous DS-8500a study, or dosing with itraconazole, within 6 mo
             prior to the first dose.

          -  Known sensitivity to product components of DS-8500a and/or itraconazole.

          -  Current participation in another investigational study or prior participation in an
             investigational study within the past 30 d prior to the first dose.

          -  Use of any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications (systemic or topical),
             vitamins, or dietary/herbal supplements, including St John's Wort (hypericin), within

             wk (females), where 1 unit of alcohol equals 1/2 pint of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1
             ounce of spirits, or significant history of alcoholism or drug/chemical abuse within
             the last 2 y.
