  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in adult healthy participants and will consist of two phases:
      Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase will consist of 2 periods: a
      Screening Period and a Baseline Period. The Randomization Phase will consist of 2 Periods
      (each 6 days long) separated by a 1-day long Baseline Period and End of Treatment (EOT)
      Period. A total of 60 participants will be enrolled into one of three arms. Arms 1 and 3
      consist of 2 sequences, and Arm 2 consists of 4 sequences (as this is an incomplete block
      design with 2 factors [number of capsules and whether water or apple juice is used as
      vehicle]). Each participant will be randomized into one of 8 sequences.

          4. Adequate liver function, defined as: bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X the upper
             limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
             and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN

          5. Adequate renal function defined as creatinine clearance greater than 70 mL/min
             calculated using the Cockcroft and Gault formula

          6. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a
             negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of
             25 IU/L, or equivalent units of B-hCG. A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug.

          7. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically
             (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all with

             [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral
             contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout
             the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently
             abstinent, the participant must agree to use a double-barrier method as described

             study drug discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have
             been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks
             before dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for
             30 days after study drug discontinuation.

             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the
