  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal diseases are complex chronic pathologies presenting a high prevalence worldwide.
      Etiopathological process involved in initiation and progression of these multifactorial
      diseases are not well understood, explaining the huge clinical forms variability and the
      complexity of the currently used classification of periodontal diseases. Recently, the
      implication of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been suggested as potential track of
      explanation for periodontal diseases pathogeny. The here presented study explore the level of
      expression of genes coding those peptides by studying periodontal smears obtained from
      healthy and periodontitis patients.

      This study explore the level of expression of genes coding those peptides by studying
      Messenger RNA (mRNA) purified from periodontal smears obtained from healthy and periodontitis
      patients by &quot;Masterpure©&quot; protocol.After reverse transcription (RT-PCR), in-silico design of
      primers and specificity and efficiency calculation, Complementary DNA (cDNA) are quantified
      by a semi-quantitative method (delta-delta CT) vs a Housekeeping gene. Wilcoxon-Mann &amp;
      Whitney tests and Chi² tests are performed to check the significativity of the results
      between groups.
