      The purpose of this research is to develop a predictive nomogram for primary ovarian
      insufficiency.

      Many researches show primary ovarian insufficiency(POI) etiology is related with
      gene,immunization,iatrogenic, infection factors and social factors etc. In fact, approximate
      70-90% POI have no definite cause, so a lot of patients don't know what will happen when they
      in occult stage of POI. In this research, researchers will investigate all possible factors
      in POI patients and normal women and select the valuable risk factor by integrated by
      statistical method to establish the reasonable predictive model.

      This study consists two stages.The fist stage is the model establishment, the second stage is
      the certificate and evaluate the model.

    <description>using the bootstrap method nomogram for internal verification to reduce overfitting bias, the evaluation of the model to predict the risk of premature menopause conformity. In the study population data, select postmenopausal cases, the use of prediction of survival analysis model initial assessment model; select Not menopause an independent risk factor for the population were followed ovarian anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) decreased the extent of menopause Age as a standard curve prediction, evaluation nomogram model predictive accuracy and clinical value of premature menopause, and finally provide the first Chinese people have the physical characteristics of premature menopause prediction model</description>
