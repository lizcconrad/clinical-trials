  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin
      and bemiparin, as regards their efficacy and safety in venous thromboembolism prevention
      among intensive care unit patients.

    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized trial to compare thromboprophylaxis using bemiparin and enoxaparin
      in critically ill patients in ICU. The study included one hundred bedridden patients in
      intensive care unit who are at high risk for developing venous thromboembolism and require
      long term anticoagulation

      Patients were divided into two groups each one consists of 50 patients. One group received
      bemiparin 3500 IU subcutaneous once daily and the other group received enoxaparin 40 mg
      subcutaneous once daily as a prophylaxis against thromboembolism.

      Patients were followed up for 60 days for the development of deep venous thrombosis,
      pulmonary embolism and complications related to the injected anticoagulant.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Development of deep venous thrombosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Deep venous thrombosis was detected using bilateral lower limb venous duplex done twice weekly over the period of 60 days or if patient had clinical symptoms of deep venous thrombosis during hospitalization. Best evaluation of Different lower extremities veins is obtained by using different ultrasound techniques. Proximal deep veins, specifically the common femoral, femoral, and popliteal veins are usually examined using compression ultrasound whereas a combination of duplex ultrasound and color Doppler imaging is more often used to interrogate the calf and iliac veins</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Development of pulmonary embolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary embolism was detected clinically by hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and decreased end-tidal carbondioxide and confirmed radiologically by CT pulmonary angiography if there was arterial occlusion with failure to enhance the entire lumen due to a large filling defect , a partial filling defect surrounded by contrast material or a peripheral intraluminal filling defect that forms acute angles with the arterial wall</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Complications related to the injected anticoagulant</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Patient were followed up daily for complications related to the injected anticoagulant including any ecchymosis or hematomas developed at the site of anticoagulant injection , the presence of major bleeding defined as decrease in hemoglobin levels by 2 gm/L or more or requiring transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red cells or whole blood, the presence of minor bleeding defined as any bleeding other than major bleeding events , drop in the platelet count and the presence of allergic skin reactions or urticaria, If any of these complications was observed , the anticoagulant was immediately discontinued.</description>
