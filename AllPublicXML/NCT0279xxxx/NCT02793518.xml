      Self-defining memories (SDMs) are memories that are still important today to understand who
      the investigators are and participate to the maintain of personal identity. SDMs are also
      linked to our capacity to project ourselves into the future. In bipolar disorder, life events
      play an important role in the course and outcome of the disease. the study is the first to
      investigate SDMs and self-defining future projections in a population of remitted patients
      with bipolar disorder.

      Study design: case / control study in inclusion prospective, single center. population:

        -  A group of 30 patients aged 18 to 60 years and followed in the psychiatry department of
           adult CHU Reims for bipolar disorder type I (DSM-IV criteria).

        -  A group of 30 control subjects with no personal or family history of severe psychiatric
           disorder (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), recruited from
           the staff of the University Hospital of Reims, the medical faculty of Reims or Marnais
           center health promotion of Reims, via the intranet and paper display.

      The two groups will be matched for age (± 3 years), sex and educational level (± 2 years).

        -  The first visit by a psychiatrist for:

             -  information on the objectives and the methods of research, verification criteria
                for inclusion and non-inclusion and participation of obtaining consent (written
                consent)

             -  comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and procurement different scales (anxiety
                scale, Hamilton depression scale, evaluation of verbal IQ, ...).

        -  2nd visit, a maximum of 15 days after the first visit by a psychologist,
           neuropsychologist for the award of the memories of love and future projections defining
           self: the experimenter asks the subjects to relate memories 3 and 3 future projections.
           It is important personal events that arouse strong emotions and that the subjects often
           think.

      Memories and projections reported by the subjects are then classified according to their
      emotional valence, their content, significance and degree of integration itself.
