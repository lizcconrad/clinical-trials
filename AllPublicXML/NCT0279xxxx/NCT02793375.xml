      Objective: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative
      Montelukast as an analgesic for adenotonsillectomy

      Study Design: Randomized controlled double blinded clinical trial.

      Setting: Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Division of Pediatric
      Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery

      Methods: Children between the age of 3-8 undergoing adenotonsillectomy with planned 23 hour
      observation for adenotonsillar hypertrophy and sleep disordered breathing will be randomized
      to receive either montelukast or placebo in Same Day surgery.

      Analysis: Differences in demographics (age, gender, race, weight) between the intervention
      and control groups will be assessed using chi-square (for categorical measures) and t tests
      (for continuous measures). Differences in postoperative opioid usage, postoperative pain
      scores using the FLACC scale, and the number of postoperative contacts (Emergency department
      visits or phone calls) with patients or their family regarding pain or tonsillar hemorrhage
      will be evaluated using chi-square (categorical measures) and t tests (continuous measures).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A) is the one of the most common pediatric procedures performed in the
      United States, with over 530,000 procedures performed annually1. Pain control after T&amp;A is
      essential for improving recovery and enhancing quality of life. At CCHMC, our current
      protocol in patients over the age of three is to treat pain with scheduled Tylenol, ibuprofen
      and steroids, as well as opioids (oxycodone) as a &quot;rescue&quot; medication for uncontrolled pain.
      Despite this regimented approach, pain control is often suboptimal, and numerous doses of
      opioids are often required. Montelukast is a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist that
      may have a role in decreasing post T&amp;A pain2. The primary objective of the present study is
      to evaluate the effect of montelukast on post-T&amp;A pain by measuring the amount of opioid pain
      medication required postoperatively in patients receiving montelukast preoperatively compared
      to those receiving placebo. The secondary objective will evaluate post-surgical outcomes and
      include group comparisons of post T&amp;A pain scores and number of Emergency department visits
      and/or phone calls for perioperative pain related complaints.

      Hypothesis #1 Preoperative montelukast will decrease the amount of opioid pain mediation
      required in the first 24 hours postoperatively compared to those in the control group.

      Hypothesis #2 Preoperative montelukast will decrease pain scores in the first 24 hours after
      surgery in patients undergoing T&amp;A compared to those in the control group.

      Hypothesis#3 Preoperative montelukast will decrease the number of postoperative contacts
      (Emergency department visits and phone calls) by parents for pain related concerns in the
      first 3-4 weeks after surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria: All patients between the ages of 3-8 undergoing adenotonsillectomy for
        an indication of adenotonsillar hypertrophy who are scheduled for overnight 23 hour
        observation at CCHMC main campus.

        Exclusion Criteria: Patients with moderate to severe developmental delay will be excluded
        due to difficulties in scoring postoperative pain. In addition, those with allergies to
        Montelukast and those currently using Montelukast will be excluded. Those with moderate to
        severe cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary or renal disease will be excluded. All patients with a
        primary indication of chronic tonsillitis will be excluded. Those with active respiratory
        infections requiring cancellation of surgery will be excluded based on the Anesthesia
