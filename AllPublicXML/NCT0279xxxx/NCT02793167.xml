  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common, serious and expensive.It is associated with significant
      mortality, morbidity and increased length of hospital stay.To improve clinical outcomes of
      AKI by early detection and timely referral to the renal,the investigators developed an
      electronic alert system which identifies all cases of AKI occurring in patients over 18
      years.The system was also designed to collect data on AKI incidence one of the biggest
      tertiary hospital in China.

      A prospective, randomly controlled cohort study will be conducted agmong the patients with
      AKI who are detected by the use of AKI sniffer. The investigators chose to assess all
      inpatient serum creatinine results using a combination of &quot;KDIGO&quot; criteria.

      The investigators randomly divided the patients into two groups:

        1. Usual care : patients will receive standard clinical care by the primary physicians

        2. AKI alert : an AKI alert will be sent to the the doctor in charge. Our team of kidney
           experts would give a suggestion if the the doctor in charge issue consultation
           applications.
