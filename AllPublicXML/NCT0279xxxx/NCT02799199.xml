      Objectives: This study describes efficacy and safety of Fingolimod in patients treated for at
      least 6 months in the east of France from January 2011 to December 2014.

      Background: The Grand-Est is a geographical region in France with a high prevalence of
      multiple sclerosis (more than 10000 patients registered in the European Database for Multiple
      Sclerosis (EDMUS) database). In this region and since January 2011, more than 1014 patients
      have been treated for at least 6 months with Fingolimod, the first oral therapy for patient
      with very active relapsing-remitting MS.

      Methods: Features of patients followed up in the Grand-Est region and treated with fingolimod
      in the 6 university hospitals, general hospitals and private neurologists were reviewed in a
      retrospective study after identification of the clinical files reported in the EDMUS
      database.
