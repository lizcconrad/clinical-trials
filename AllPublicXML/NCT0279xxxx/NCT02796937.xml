      This is a 2-year open-label, multicenter extension of the double-blind, placebo-controlled
      GTi1201 study. The purpose of this study is to obtain an additional 2 years of safety data
      for intravenously administered Alpha1-MP 60 mg/kg/week in subjects with alpha1-antitrypsin
      deficiency (AATD).

      This is a 2-year open-label extension of the double-blind, placebo-controlled GTi1201 study.
      The purpose of this study is to obtain an additional 2 years of safety data for intravenously
      administered Alpha-1 MP 60 mg/kg/week in subjects with AATD.

      The study consists of a Screening Visit (the same visit as the End-of-Study Visit in the
      GTi1201 study for subjects who complete the GTi1201 study or is the same visit as the Early
      Discontinuation Visit for subjects meeting the early withdrawal criterion for forced
      expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] decline), a treatment period of 104 weeks (beginning
      immediately after screening [on the same day as the Screening Visit] but no sooner than 1
      week after the last infusion of investigational product in the GTi1201 study), and an
      End-of-Study Visit.

      Subjects meeting the entrance criteria of the extension study will begin receiving weekly
      intravenous (IV) infusions of Alpha-1 MP 60 mg/kg on the day of screening and will continue
      to receive weekly infusions for a total of 104 infusions.

      Safety assessments will include adverse events, concomitant medications, complete physical
      examination (excluding breast and genitourinary examination), hematology, chemistry, urine
      cotinine, and pregnancy test. Efficacy assessments will include whole lung computed
      tomography density, quality-of-life assessment, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity, and
      pulmonary function tests. The occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary exacerbations, will
      also be evaluated as a safety and as an efficacy measurement.

             160/End-of-Study Visit) OR has experienced a decline in FEV1 at the annualized rate of
             ≥134.4 mL/year at or after the Week 104 Visit in GTi1201.

          -  Is willing and able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

             implanted hormonal methods of contraception; placement of an intrauterine device or
             intrauterine system; condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository; male sterilization; or abstinence) throughout the
             study.

          -  Has clinical signs and symptoms of viral infection requiring virus safety testing at

             the virus safety test results are indicative of acute or chronic infection with
             hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V). Note: If the virus safety test
             results are indicative of acute or chronic infection with HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, or B19V,
             the subject will be considered a screen failure and must be withdrawn from the study.

          -  Has current evidence of smoking, which includes electronic/vapor cigarettes, or has a
             positive urine cotinine test at the Week 160/End-of- Study Visit in Study GTi1201 that
             is due to smoking.

          -  Has current evidence of chronic alcoholism or illicit drug abuse (addiction).

          -  Is currently participating in another investigational product (IP) study.

          -  Has a history of anaphylaxis or severe systemic response to any plasma- derived
             alpha1-PI preparation or other blood product(s).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, is likely to have compliance problems with the
             protocol and the procedures of the protocol.

          -  Has any medical condition that the investigator feels might confound the results of
             the study or pose an additional risk to the subject during study participation.
