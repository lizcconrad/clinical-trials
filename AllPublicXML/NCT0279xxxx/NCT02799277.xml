  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project to investigate the psychological processes underlying moral
      judgments in social dilemmas. WE will examine neuroendocrine determinants of moral judgment
      by investigating the effects of exogenous testosterone

      -  Medical Screening Interview: Participants will be asked to answer several questions to
           identify potential medical and non-medical conditions that would preclude the
           self-administration of testosterone.

        -  First Saliva Sample: Participants will be asked provide a saliva sample after they
           completed the medical screening interview.

        -  Testosterone Self-Administration: Immediately following the first saliva collection,
           participants will self-administer spray puffs of either testosterone or placebo.

        -  Relaxation: Participants will be given the opportunity to relax for 30 minutes.

        -  Second Saliva Sample: Participants will be asked provide a saliva sample after the
           relaxation period.

        -  Moral Dilemmas Judgments: Participants will be asked to read a set of 28 moral dilemmas
           that describe situations in which an actor has to make a decision on whether or not to
           engage in a particular action (e.g., sacrifice the well-being of one person to protect
           the well-being of several others). Participants will be asked to indicate whether they
           consider the described action acceptable or unacceptable.

        -  Demographics: Participants will be asked to indicate their gender, age, and ethnicity.

        -  Ear Temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure will be measured before drug
           administration, and again 20 minutes after drug administration. If temperature changes
           more than 2 degrees, heart rate changes more than 20bmp, or if blood pressure changes
           more than 20%, the experiment will be terminated and subjects will be escorted across
           the street to the University Emergency Room.
