  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to a study of the DREES (Direction de la Recherche, des Etudes, de l'Evaluation et
      des Statistiques), in 2013, nearly 229 000 abortions were performed in France, an increasing
      number.

      The success rate of drug abortion before 49 days of amenorrhea, defined by the National
      Health Autority as a complete abortion not requiring surgery, varies from 92 to 98% depending
      on the pregnancy term and the dose used.

      The control visit is performed between the 14th day and the 21th day post abortion. Its role
      is to monitor the effectiveness of the method, to verify absence of complication and to
      better adapt contraception to prevent another unwanted pregnancy. The choice of the method is
      left to the physician's discretion: β-HCG dosage, pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound.

      In the Orthogenic Departement of the Croix-Rousse Hospital Lyon, France, the method performed
      during the control visit is transvaginal ultrasound.

      To simplify the monitoring of drug abortion, a urine pregnancy test would be an attractive
      alternative to transvaginal ultrasound: simplicity of use, speed, ease of interpretation and
      low cost.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of urine pregnancy test
      CHECK TOP compared to transvaginal ultrasound in monitoring the outcome of drug abortion
      during the control visit.

      This is a monocentric observational study.

    <description>Negative predictive value of urine pregnancy test CHECK TOP taking as reference transvaginal ultrasound.
A negative result at transvaginal ultrasound will be defined as the absence of ongoing pregnancy. An ongoing pregnancy is characterized by the presence of gestational sac, yolk sac and/or embryo with cardiac activity. A positive result will be retained only in case of ongoing pregnancy.
Check Top test will be considered as negative if only one colored line appears in the control window, without any line in the result window. It will be considered as positive if two colored lines are present in the result window, corresponding to a β-HCG level &gt; 1000 IU/ml.</description>
