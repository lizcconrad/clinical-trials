    <textblock>
      The early diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is particularly difficult in surgical
      critically ill patients. If the use of rapid immunological diagnostic methods and pretest
      scoring systems has been proposed in the medical intensive care unit (ICU), none of these
      methods have been specifically evaluated in the diagnosis of HIT in surgical patients.

    <textblock>
      Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is of concern in critically ill patients, given the
      high prevalence of heparin use. The diagnosis of HIT in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) is
      problematic due to the lack of reliable diagnostic method. No gold standard currently exists
      and the definitive diagnosis is mainly based on the detection of heparin-dependent
      platelet-activating antibodies by ELISA method, on the platelet serotonin release assay (SRA)
      and on the changes of the blood platelet count after the discontinuation of heparin therapy.
      As a result, no early definitive diagnosis could be done. This could expose patients to
      thrombotic complications related to the HIT or hemorrhagic complications related to the
      alternative anticoagulant prescribed. This complications can threaten the prognosis of these
      patients. Particle gel immunoassay and automated immunoassay has been proposed for the early
      diagnosis of HIT in medical critically ill and non-critically ill patients. Many authors
      suggest that the accuracy of these immunological methods for the diagnosis of HIT could be
      altered in surgical patients, but these tests has never been specifically evaluated in this
      population. The 4Ts and the HIT Expert Probability (HEP) score systems sound interesting for
      the diagnosis of HIT. These clinicobiological scores can be easily used by non-expert
      clinicians, but have also never been evaluated in the surgical ICU.

    <description>The HIT study group will include all patients admitted in our surgical intensive care unit (ICU) during the study period if the clinician in charge of the patient suspects the diagnosis of HIT. The HEP score, the 4Ts score, the immuno-diffusion particle gel immunoassay (ID-PaGIA) and the HIT-Ab(PF4-H) test will be done for each patient the day the diagnosis of HIT will be suspected.</description>

    <description>The HEP score is a clinicobiological score evaluating the probability of the HIT diagnosis.
The HEP score is based on the blood platelet count, the timing of the platelet decrease, the existence of clinical manifestations of HIT (thrombosis, haemorrhage, skin necrosis) and the existence of an other cause of thrombocytopenia.</description>

    <description>The HIT-Ab(PF4-H) test consist in the incubation of plasma samples with latex beads coated PF4/polyvinylsulfate complexes. After binding of the plasma antibodies a monoclonal antibody recognizing PF4/heparin complexes is added. In the presence of human anti-PF4/heparin antibodies, binding of the monoclonal antibody and subsequent agglutination of latex beads is inhibited. Inhibition of agglutination is quantified and reported in arbitrary units (U/ml). A value equal or higher than 1.0 u/ml may indicate the presence of HIT antibodies.</description>

        Patients admitted in our surgical intensive care unit (ICU) during the study period will be
        elligible if the diagnosis of HIT is supected by the attending physician. The diagnosis of
        the HIT will be suspected in the presence of at least one of the following criteria in a
        patient receiving an heparin therapy: (1) a thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 G/l or a decrease of the
        blood platelet count &gt; 40%, (2) a thrombocytopenia between the 5th and the 8th of the
        heparin therapy, (3)an arterial or a venous thrombosis in a patient receiving heparin,
        (4)the failure of a treatment of a thrombosis with heparin. These criteria are described in
        the French guidelines.
