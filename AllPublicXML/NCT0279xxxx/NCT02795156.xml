  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the increased availability of next-generation sequencing, oncologists are starting to
      incorporate genomic profiling into routine care of cancer patients. If a genomic alteration
      is identified during profiling, it could help guide the choice of therapy and improve
      treatment outcomes. This study will examine the anti-tumor activity of selected commercially
      available molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients who have failed first-line
      treatment for one of the following tumor types: non-small cell lung cancers; urothelial
      cancer; non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and upper aerodigestive tract cancer.

    <textblock>
      This four-arm pilot phase II study will evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of
      selected commercially available molecularly matched targeted therapies in patients who have
      failed first line treatment for one of the following tumor types:

        1. non-small cell lung cancer,

        2. urothelial carcinoma,

        3. non-colon gastrointestinal cancers, and

        4. upper aerodigestive tract cancers (lip, tongue, salivary glands, gum, mouth, oral
           cavity, tonsils, oropharynx, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, sinus, and larynx tumors).

      Approximately 160 patients (40 per tumour type) are planned for enrollment. Consideration for
      enrollment will be based on results from profiling with next-generation sequencing technology
      that was performed outside of the protocol. Eligible patients will receive one of the
      FDA-approved targeted agents at the recommended dose. The treating physician will decide
      which targeted agent to prescribe based on the genomic alterations per tumor type and the
      targets listed in the package insert for each agent.
