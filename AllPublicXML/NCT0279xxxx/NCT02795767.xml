    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase III clinical study will evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of emicizumab administered subcutaneously initially
      once weekly (QW) in pediatric participants with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors. This
      study will open two additional non-randomized cohorts to investigate Q2W and Q4W regimens in
      pediatric participants.
