    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the potential for induction of photosensitization by P-3074 0.25%
      finasteride cutaneous solution compared to that of placebo vehicle cutaneous solution and a
      negative control (0.9% sodium chloride, NaCl)

    <textblock>
      Healthy male volunteers, drawn from the general population, will be treated with P-3074
      solution, placebo vehicle control and 0.9% sodium chloride USP (negative control) by using 6
      induction applications on the back area and Ultraviolet A (UVA)/Ultraviolet B (UVB)
      irradiations during the 3 week induction period, a 10 day rest period, and a challenge phase
      of a 24-hour patch application, UVA and UVB irradiation followed by evaluation of
      photosensitization over the subsequent 72 hours.
