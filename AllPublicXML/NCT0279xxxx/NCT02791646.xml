    <textblock>
      This trial is a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART), that will examine
      response to differing doses of a behavioral cancer pain intervention (Pain Coping Skills
      Training [PCST]) and subsequent response-based adjustments to doses. Cancer patients with
      pain will initially be randomized to receive either PCST-Full or PCST-Brief. Participants who
      do not report pain reduction to their initially assigned intervention will be re-randomized
      to receive either maintenance or an increased level of intervention. Participants who report
      pain reduction to their initially assigned intervention will be re-randomized to either a
      maintenance dose or no further treatment. Intervention responses will be compared across
      conditions using a standard two-sided, two-sample t-test. Techniques typically used for SMART
      studies will be used to compare intervention dosage sequences across PCTS that adjusts to
      initial dosage based on patient responses. The risk and safety issues in this trial are low
      and limited to those common to a psychosocial intervention (e.g., loss of confidentiality).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of moderate to severe pain in cancer patients remains greater than 50%. NIH
      guidelines recommend the implementation of behavioral cancer pain interventions into patient
      care. Yet, implementation remains low. Evidence on patient dose-response (i.e., number of
      sessions, skills), intervention adaption based on initial response, and understanding
      personal characteristics related to differing dose-response can improve implementation by
      optimizing behavioral intervention delivery.

      This trial is a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART), that will examine
      response to differing doses of a behavioral cancer pain intervention (Pain Coping Skills
      Training [PCST]) and subsequent response-based adjustments to doses. Cancer patients with
      pain (N=327) will initially be randomized to receive either PCST-Full or PCST-Brief.
      Participants who do not respond (&lt;30% pain reduction) to their initially assigned
      intervention will be re-randomized to receive either maintenance (i.e., booster sessions
      focused on problem solving and skills reinforcement) or an increased level of intervention
      (i.e., additional sessions and skills). Participants who respond (&gt; 30% pain reduction) to
      their initially assigned intervention will be re-randomized to either a maintenance dose or
      no further treatment. Intervention responses will be (% reduction in pain) will be compared
      across conditions using a standard two-sided, two-sample t-test. Techniques typically used
      for SMART studies will be used to compare intervention dosage sequences across PCTS that
      adjusts to initial dosage based on patient responses. The risk and safety issues in this
      trial are low and limited to those common to a psychosocial intervention (e.g., loss of
      confidentiality).

    <measure>Change in Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity will be assessed by asking patients about their pain at its &quot;worst&quot;, &quot;least&quot;, &quot;average&quot;, and &quot;now&quot;. Patients will answer on a scale where 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 = &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The worst, least, and average items will be asked in reference to the last 7 days. A composite averaged score of these four items will be used to represent pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>Pain Interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference will be assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Pain interference will be assessed by asking patients how much their pain has interfered with seven daily activities including general activity, walking, work, mood, enjoyment of life, relations with others, and sleep within the last 7 days. Answers will be on a 0 = &quot;does not interfere&quot; to 10 = &quot;completely interferes&quot; scale; items will be averaged to represent pain interference. These measures have been recommended for use in chronic-pain clinical trials.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>These items ask about patients tendency to catastrophizing when faced with pain (e.g., &quot;When I feel pain it is awful and it overwhelms me&quot;) and are answered on a 0 = never to 6 = always scale. Items are summed for a total score</description>

    <description>We will create a composite cost variable based on patient time, provider time, and the EQ-5D.The EQ-5D is a measure of health status that can be linked to population-based preference weights is widely used in economic evaluations. It is short, assessing 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). The respondent indicates no problems, some problems, or severe problems in each dimension.</description>
