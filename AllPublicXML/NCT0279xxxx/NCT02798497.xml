  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus expresses a variety of virulence factors, including Panton Valentine
      leukocidin (PVL), a cytotoxin. PVL is specifically associated with primary skin and
      soft-tissue infections and severe necrotizing pneumonia (Gillet et al. Lancet,
      2002;359:753-9). PVL-positive S. aureus pneumonia is often preceded by influenza-like
      symptoms, and is mainly characterized by hemoptysis, pleural effusion, rapid onset of acute
      respiratory distress, leukopenia and a high fatality rate (65%) (Gillet et al. Lancet,
      2002;359:753-9). Ten year after the first description of this disease and a number of
      controversies in the scientific literature, the question arise as to whether PVL remains an
      independent factor of severity in S.aureus pneumonia. In addition, numerous questions remain
      unanswered yet; these are:

        -  (i) which factors, including treatment regimen, are associated with favourable outcome?,

        -  (ii) what is the susceptibility toward antibiotics of strains associated with this
           disease ?

        -  (iii) is there any genetic susceptibility of the host to explain both the rarity, and
           the explosive presentation of the disease ? To address the above questions a prospective
           observational study at the nationwide level will be set up. All French hospitals will be
           invited to describe the clinical features of all new cases of S. aureus
           community-acquired pneumonia with severity criteria, regardless PVL production. The
           study will include an investigation of a possible innate immune dysfunction in
           collaboration with the INSERM-U550 (Génétique Humaine des Maladies Infectieuses, Faculté
           Necker, Paris). Hence, in addition to collecting clinical and biological data from all
           pneumonia cases as well as all strains of S. aureus isolated, the patients with
           PVL-positive pneumonia will be sampled for immune genetic studies (ORFeome sequencing
           and functional studied)
