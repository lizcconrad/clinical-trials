  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety, tolerability and blood concentrations of single and multiple
      oral doses of PF-06751979 in health subjects and healthy elderly subjects. PF-06751979 is
      being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of PF-06751979 following oral doses in healthy adult and healthy elderly subjects at higher
      doses than previously administered. Such characteristics will enable the design of future
      clinical trials in patient population, in the effort to optimize the efficacy of PF-06751979,
      as well as to establish safety margins in humans. Inclusion of healthy elderly subjects will
      be optional, but can provide additional safety and tolerability information in the age range
      of the target population while confirming the PK of PF-06751979 in these subjects for future
      clinical trials in the Alzheimer's disease patient population.

      The Primary Objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      ascending oral doses of PF-06751979 in healthy adult subjects. Secondary Objectives are to
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of PF-06751979 in: plasma following single and multiple
      ascending oral dose administration in healthy adult subjects and urine following multiple
      ascending oral dose administration in healthy adult subjects. An additional secondary
      objective is to evaluate the effect of multiple oral doses of PF 06751979 on CSF A-beta
      fragments in healthy adult subjects.

      This study is divided into three parts: Part A - Single ascending doses (SAD) healthy adult
      subjects (18-55 years); Part B - Multiple ascending doses (MAD) in healthy adult subjects
      (18-55 years); Part C - Multiple doses (MD) in healthy elderly subjects (60-85 years). Study
      Parts may be run in a staggered fashion; Part C of the study may commence after satisfactory
      review of relevant data from Parts A and B.

    <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to Y days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to Drug X was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>
