  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical removal of a tumour in the lung offers the best chance for survival in early stage
      lung cancers. One main criteria of surgical eligibility is the absence of cancer spread to
      the lymph nodes; rendering the staging process extremely important. The evaluation of these
      lymph nodes is thought to be best completed using Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS), a
      procedure in which several lymph nodes are sampled and send to pathology to determine whether
      or not it is malignant. More recently, studies have observed that there are clear differences
      in the characteristics of cancerous and benign (non-cancerous) lymph nodes, and so there has
      been great interest in creating a list of criteria that can determine whether a node is
      malignant. This study aims to prospectively validate a previously proposed score based on
      observed characteristics of lymph nodes during an EBUS procedure relating to
      pathology-confirmed results. To test this, the results of the lymph node samples and the
      observed score will be compared for agreement. If the investigators find that the scoring
      system can accurately predict which lymph nodes are cancerous, it would provide the evidence
      to establish the score as a standard procedure during cancer staging.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Internal validity of an aggregate sonographic score</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of EBUS procedure (estimated 1 hour)</time_frame>
    <description>Objective is to compare the lymph node malignancy predictor score obtained by two raters, one who performed the procedure and the other a secondary rater who viewed the video of the procedure. The score will ideally be similar between raters, showing good inter-rater internal validity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>External validity of an aggregate sonographic score</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of EBUS procedure to date of surgery (expected to be up to 1 month)</time_frame>
    <description>As the gold standard for lymph node assessment is via tissue sampling obtained during an EBUS (or other invasive method) procedure, the scores obtained using the lymph node malignancy predictor scoring technique will be compared to later post-surgical pathological staging. The score will be considered to have good criterion (external) validity if there is a high degree of agreement between the pathology and score values.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of staging re-intervention after initial EBUS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>If the original tissue samples taken during the EBUS procedure were found to be insufficient to rule out malignancy, the patient may undergo another EBUS, or will undergo an Endoscopic ultrasound or a mediastinoscopy. During these follow-up procedures, the surgeon would be obtaining additional tissue in the hope that a result can be made. These re-intervention is not without a risk of adverse events, and ideally should be minimized. We will be abstracting re-intervention occurrences from patient charts.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between lymph node aggregate sonographic score and Positron Emission Tomography-elicited Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first presentation for diagnosis to date of surgery (Estimated to be 2-3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>All patients undergo Positron Emission Tomography in the course of their clinical staging for suspected lung cancer. The values obtained from this diagnostic test (Standardized Uptake Values [SUVs]) will be obtained and compared to the surgeon's observed score on the lymph node aggregate sonographic scoring tool to investigate whether there is any relationship between the score and the SUVs.</description>

    <description>Patients undergoing EBUS with TransBronchial Needle Aspiration will be invited to enroll on the day of their procedure. Once informed consent is obtained, the surgeon will assess the sonographic criteria, take pictures, and biopsy every lymph node of interest. All three elements of this assessment will need to be completed for a specimen to be included in the study. After the procedure, the operating surgeon will fill the Lymph Node Assessment questionnaire, assign an aggregate score to every lymph node specimen, and attach the pictures to the form. Pictures from every specimen will stored electronically to be reviewed and secondarily rated by a second blinded surgeon. Patient involvement in the study ends at the completion of the planned procedure.</description>
