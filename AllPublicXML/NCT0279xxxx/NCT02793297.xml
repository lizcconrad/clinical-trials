  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the impact of sourdough fermented crisp bread on effects
      on appetite and postprandial glucose and insulin responses. Beneficial effects on appetite
      and postprandial insulin responses have been observed, particularly for unfermented rye crisp
      breads in a previous study. In the present study, the investigators evaluated how the intake
      of sourdough fermented rye crisp breads vs. unfermented rye crisp bread as well as a control
      refined wheat crisp bread product may affect self-rated appetite and postprandial insulin and
      glucose responses in healthy men and women in a meal-study. The investigators characterized
      intervention products with regards to microstructural and chemical features in order to
      elucidate underlying mechanisms for potential effects observed on appetite and postprandial
      metabolic responses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two commercial whole grain rye crisp breads processed differently (unfermented and sourdough
      fermented) and a refined wheat control product were tested in the study. The rye crisp bread
      products contained similar ingredients. All products provide similar amounts of available
      carbohydrates (about 30g). The total amount of test product is about 50-60g.

      The specific primary aim of the study: To conduct a short-term breakfast intervention study
      in humans (n = 24) to compare the effect of 2 high-fiber rye crisp bread products processed
      in different ways (sourdough fermented or unfermented) and a refined wheat control crisp
      bread as part of a normal breakfast on self-rated appetite, postprandial glucose and insulin
      concentrations. Difference in post-prandial insulin response between products is the primary
      endpoint.

      Secondary aim (conducted if significant effects in the primary endpoint have been
      demonstrated): To assess changes in hormones and their relation to self-perceived satiety,
      hunger and desire to eat and to differences in chemical and microstructural composition of
      the tested foods.
