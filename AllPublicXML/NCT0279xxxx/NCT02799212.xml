  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suffer from
      underlying liver disease and are exposed to the risk of postoperative ascites, with
      subsequent morbidity, liver and renal failure, the need for specific treatments and prolonged
      hospital stay. Postoperative ascites is favored by an imbalance between portal venous inflow
      and the diminished hepatic venous outflow. Finding a reversible, non-invasive method for
      modulating the portal inflow would be of interest: it could be used temporarily during the
      early postoperative course to prevent acute portal hypertension. Somatostatin, a well-known
      drug already used in several indications, may limit the risk of postoperative ascites and
      liver failure by decreasing portal pressure after hepatectomy for HCC in patients with
      underlying liver disease.
