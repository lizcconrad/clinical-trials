    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate changes in transcutaneous oxygen tension (tcPO2,), and the inferred
      change in local cutaneous blood flow, in healthy subjects wearing a control and a 100%
      CelliantÂ® fiber upper torso garment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adequate blood supply is necessary for many physiologic processes. However, there are few
      valid, reproducible, non-invasive methods with which to assess it. One such measure is
      transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen (tcPO2). This measurement is a non-invasive method
      of measuring oxygen tension at the skin surface; represents the amount of oxygen diffusing
      outward across the skin; and can be used as a surrogate for arterial perfusion. This method
      is reproducible with clinically acceptable intrasubject variability; is used for a variety of
      conditions, including peripheral vascular disease evaluation, predicting the outcome of
      patients requiring amputation and survival of skin grafts; and correlates well to angiography
      and increases in blood flow rates. However, tcPO2 is affected by many variables, including
      oxygen concentration in inspired air, lung function and hemoglobin saturation, as well as
      local factors, such as skin thickness, sympathetic tone, the presence of inflammation,
      capillary formation and skin oxygen consumption.
