  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is reported as one of the main causative
      pathogen of community acquired SSTIs. In the USA, high prevalence of MRSA among Skin and soft
      tissue infections (SSTIs) is known to be due to the spread of the USA300 clone [Moran et al.
      2006]. Among S. aureus SSTIs infections in Europe, data regarding the prevalence of MRSA in
      SSTIs and the causative genotypes remain scarce. The paucity of literature on the prevalence
      of MSSA, MRSA and PVL-producing S. aureus strains in SSTI in Europe is probably due to the
      fact that culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not a routine component of SSTI
      management.

      Setting-up a prospective multi-centre study involving patients presenting to emergency
      departments with SSTIs in several European countries would allow drawing a picture on the
      role and the respective contribution of MSSA, MRSA and PVL-producing S. aureus strains as a
      cause of SSTIs. However, the roles of emergency rooms and local policies with regard to
      performing microbiological analysis after surgical drainage of SSTIs vary between countries.

      In order to evaluate the feasibility of such multicenter European study, we aim at performing
      a pilot study based on few European clinical laboratories (five to seven) which will: i)
      evaluate the prevalence of MSSA, MRSA and S. aureus PVL-positive strains in
      community-acquired SSTIs; and ii) determine molecular characteristics of the isolated
      strains. The main objectives of this pilot study are to collect some preliminary information
      on the role of S. aureus in SSTIs and to determine factors that need to be harmonized or
      taken into consideration for the set-up a larger prospective cross-sectional study involving
      more European countries with several centers per country to cover different geographical
      areas per country.

    <description>The study will be conducted by microbiology laboratories. Before the start of the study, each participating laboratory will send an information letter to its corresponding emergency departments to increase vigilance of clinicians in collecting samples from all patients presenting with SSTIs; this will improve the level of inclusion. Each participating lab will also insure connection to local representation of the project for ethical clearance, collection of clinical data and SSTI specimen.</description>
