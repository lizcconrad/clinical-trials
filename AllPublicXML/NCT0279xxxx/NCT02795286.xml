      The ASIST study is a medical device study testing the safety and efficacy of a new
      hemodialysis machine software in chronic haemodialysis patients. The software's intention is
      to reduce hemodialysis related symptoms such as unwell being, blood pressure changes by
      adapting the dialysis fluid ion concentration to the patients plasma ion concentration by
      conductivity measurement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be in clinically stable condition as judged by the treating physician,
             and demonstrated by stable medical history, physical examination, and laboratory
             testing for 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Subject must be receiving HD or hemodiafiltration (HDF) for at least 30 days prior to
             study enrollment, be dialyzing a minimum of 3 times per week in an in-center setting
             and each treatment session must be between 3.5 and 5 hours in duration.

          -  Subject has a stable functioning vascular access (arteriovenous [AV] fistula, graft,
             or dual-lumen tunneled catheter) based on the judgment of the treating physician and
             is performing dual-needle therapy with an actual blood flow rate of 250 - 400 mL/min.

          -  Subject has a pre-dialysis plasma sodium of ≥132 mmol/L for at least 60 days prior to
             study enrollment.

          -  Subject has achieved a dialysis dose of stdKt/Vurea ≥ 2.1 within 60 days prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Subject has a pre-dialysis hemoglobin ≥ 90 g/L measured at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the
             study period.

          -  Subjects who have a significant psychiatric disorder or mental disability that could
             interfere with the subject's ability to provide Informed Consent and/or comply with
             protocol procedures.

          -  Subjects with a medical condition that the investigator thinks may interfere with the
             study objectives.

          -  Subjects with significant signs of access recirculation as judged by the treating
             physician.
