  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Background : Deep brain stimulation of SubThalamic Nucleus (STN-DBS) is an effective
           treatment for a large variety of movement disorders. However, the efficacy of STN-DBS
           relies on unclear mechanisms.

        -  Purpose: In this study, using optical imaging, the investigators will evaluate the
           cortical hemodynamic changes induced by STN-DBS of parkinsonian patients during motor
           task and delay discounting task. the investigators will perform an optical imaging study
           using Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) in a parkinsonian patient after STN-DBS. The
           investigators will measure bilateral local cortical hemodynamic changes under &quot;On&quot; and
           &quot;Off&quot; stimulation conditions and during a motor task (left hand movement) and delay
           discounting task Relative concentration changes of oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb, and total Hb will
           be continuously analyze.

        -  Primary outcome: Study of local cortical hemodynamic change (oxy-Hb, deoxy-Hb, and total
           Hb) under &quot; on &quot; and &quot; off &quot; stimulation during a motor task.
