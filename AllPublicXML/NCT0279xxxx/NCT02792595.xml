  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 8 cosmetic products in vivo on
      the back of human participants, according to the International Standard Sun Protection Test
      method by using a sun simulator.

    <description>Visual evaluation of irradiated test area will be carried out to determine Minimal Erthemal Dose (MED). The lowest irradiation dose producing perceptible erythema will be chosen as MED. The individual SPF (SPFi) for each test product will be determined by calculating the ratio of the MED on test product protected skin (MEDp) to the MED on unprotected skin (MEDu).</description>

    <description>After irradiation of the test area with a sun simulator with an increment of UV radiation of 1.25, positive control will be applied. The dose of positive control will be measured in accordance to the application volume (2 milligram (mg)/centimeter (cm)^2 (± 0.05 mg/cm^2) and it will be applied using a micro litre syringe in approximately 15-30 small droplets all over the test area. Positive control will be then quickly spread by gently rubbing with a non-saturated finger cot, first with rotating followed by crosswise movements for a final uniform coating on the skin. Spreading time will be between 20 and 50 seconds (s). After waiting for 15 to 30 minutes (min), the test area will be again irradiated (increment of 1.12 or 1.25) with the sun simulator. The irradiation time will depend on the SPF of positive control, participants' skin prototype, determined MED after irradiation and actual power of sun simulator.</description>
