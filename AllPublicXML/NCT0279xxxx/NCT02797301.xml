  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to develop a computerised test with an adapted peripheral to assess the
      emerging literacy knowledge of children with mobility difficulties. The software was
      implemented using a game-like design controllable by a peripheral device without needing fine
      movements.

      Conventional tests for assessing the early reading skills of preschool children on school
      entry are not accessible to children with mobility limitations. This paper presents a
      game-like computerised test featuring an appealing scenario that is accessible to these
      children. It was developed on a platform that creates 2D vector graphics and contains three
      phases of interactive content accessible through an adapted peripheral. Conventional tests
      were also used to validate the effectiveness of the game. The two types of tests had the same
      degree of predictive power when completed by thirty three preschool children without mobility
      impairment.

    <description>The tests determine whether children can differentiate between the letters of the alphabet and squiggles, numbers, and mathematical signs (first phase); can realise that the same word can be written using uppercase, lowercase, and cursive letters (second phase); know the correct number of letters required to graphically represent the sounds used in speech (third phase). The numbers of incorrect choices made by children during the three phases of the computerised test (G1, G2 and G3) and the synthetic test (G1 and G2) are quantified.</description>
