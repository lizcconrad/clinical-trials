      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775
      when given together with fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLAG) combination
      chemotherapy in treating children, adolescents and young adults with relapsed or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia. Wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775 may help combination chemotherapy work
      better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      fludarabine and cytarabine, may prevent tumor cells from multiplying by damaging their
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which in turn stops the tumor from growing. Giving wee1 kinase
      inhibitor AZD1775 and FLAG chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of wee1
      kinase inhibitor AZD1775 (AZD1775) administered orally daily for 5 days in combination with
      FLAG (fludarabine, cytarabine, filgrastim) chemotherapy in children and adolescents with
      recurrent or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of AZD1775 in combination with FLAG chemotherapy
      administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics AZD1775 in combination with FLAG chemotherapy in
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory AML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of AZD1775 plus FLAG within the confines of
      a phase 1 study.

      II. To evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers of wee1 inhibition with administration of AZD1775
      including cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDC2) phosphorylation at tyrosine 15 (Tyr15) and
      induction of gamma H2AX in pre- and post-treatment leukemic blasts.

      III. To explore mechanisms of apoptosis induction and cell death in leukemic blasts treated
      with AZD1775 plus chemotherapy.

      IV. To identify genomic alterations in leukemic blasts that may correlate with response to
      therapy with AZD1775 plus FLAG chemotherapy.

      OULTINE: This is a phase I dose escalation study of wee1 kinase inhibitor AZD1775.

      Patients receive filgrastim intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) daily, fludarabine
      intravenously IV over 30 minutes, cytarabine IV over 1-3 hours and wee1 kinase inhibitor
      AZD1775 orally (PO) on days 1-5. Patients who meet criteria for complete remission (CR),
      complete remission with partial recovery of platelet count (CRp) or partial response (PR) may
      receive a second course of therapy. Courses repeat every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

          -  Specimens for cytogenetic analysis are required, and must be obtained prior to therapy
             initiation; for patient with refractory disease, the diagnostic specimen may be used

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breast-feeding:

               -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women may not be entered on this study; pregnancy
                  tests must be obtained in girls who are post-menarchal

               -  Males or females of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have
                  agreed to use an effective double barrier contraceptive method for the entire
                  duration of protocol therapy

          -  Corticosteroids should not be used as anti-emetic therapy; corticosteroid therapy is
             not permissible except for the following indications:

               -  As treatment or prophylaxis for anaphylactic reactions

               -  As a treatment for symptoms of cytarabine (Ara-C) syndrome (including fever,
                  rash, or conjunctivitis)

               -  Physiologic replacement stress-dosing as indicated for suspected or confirmed
                  adrenal insufficiency

          -  Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible

          -  Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible except
             for hydroxyurea (which may be continued until 24 hours prior to start of protocol
             therapy)

          -  Anti-graft versus host disease (GVHD) agents post-transplant:

               -  Patients who are receiving cyclosporine, tacrolimus or other agents to prevent
                  graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant are not eligible for this
                  trial

               -  Patients must be off all systemic immunosuppressive therapy for at least 2 weeks,
                  excluding hydrocortisone for physiologic cortisol replacement

          -  Patients who are currently receiving drugs that are strong or moderate inhibitors
             and/or inducers of cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) or
             sensitive CYP3A4 substrates and CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range are
             not eligible; the use of aprepitant as an antiemetic is prohibited due to early drug
             interaction data demonstrating increased exposure to AZD1775; caution should be
             exercised with concomitant administration of AZD1775 and agents that are sensitive
             substrates of cytochrome P450 family 2 subfamily C polypeptide 8 (CYP2C8), family 2
             subfamily C polypeptide 9 (2C9) and family 2 subfamily C polypeptide 19 (2C19), or
             substrates of this enzyme with narrow therapeutic ranges, as well as agents that are
             inhibitors or substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)

          -  Patients must not have received enzyme inducing anticonvulsants for at least 14 days
             prior to enrollment

          -  Patients must be able to swallow capsules whole; nasogastric or gastrostomy (G) tube
             administration is not allowed

          -  Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible

          -  Patients with any of the following diagnoses are not eligible:

               -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)

               -  Down syndrome

               -  Fanconi anemia, Kostmann syndrome, Shwachman syndrome or any other known bone
                  marrow failure syndrome

               -  Wilson's disease and any other disorder of copper metabolism

               -  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)

          -  Patients who have received a prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible
