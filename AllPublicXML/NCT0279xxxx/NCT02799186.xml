  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD) is a rare and often misdiagnosed cause of Acute
      Coronary Syndrome (ACS) affecting predominantly young women without cardiovascular risk
      factors. The origin of SCAD remains uncertain but a strong and frequent association with
      Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) has been recently reported based on imaging evidence only.

      The aim of our study is to assess the presence of FMD and its genetic determinants i in a
      sample for haematoma or spontaneous coronary artery dissection.

      From May 2016 to 2018 we plan to include prospectively and retrospectively 200 patients
      admitted for ACS with confirmed diagnosis of SCAD. This study will be conducted in more than
      30 French interventional cardiology centers. Coronary angiograms or intracoronary imaging
      data will be reviewed by two experienced interventional cardiologist experts in SCAD
      diagnosis.

      For each patient a genetic analysis will be performed. A systematic screening for FMD will be
      realized by computed tomographic or MRI angiography of renal, cerebrovascular and iliac
      arteries and reviewed by two experienced radiologists. A one year follow-up is expected.

      This study aims to confirm the presumed association of FMD and SCAD through the exploration
      of several artery beds and the study of confirmed genetic determinants, which has never been
      described previously to our knowledge.

      The recruitment of patients takes place in each interventional cardiology department.

      The patients can be included in a retrospective way (for SCAD occurred from 2010) or
      forward-looking way. The patients are informed about this study by the investigator. After a
      reflection period and an answer to the possible questions, the patient is included. The
      informed consent is signed.

      Every patient included with a SCAD or hematoma, will systematic benefit a tomographic or MRI
      angiography of renal, cerebrovascular and iliac arteries, to look for the presence of a
      fibromuscular displasia. A blood sample will be collected for the genetic analysis which will
      be realized by the Team 3 of the INSERM UMR970, Paris Cardiovascular research Center, France.
