      Perioperative Celecoxib to promote bowel movement and to reduce post-operative pain after
      elective colonic resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative ileus is a common surgical complication occurring in with up to 20% of
      patients, with a significant clinical and economical effect.

      Many preventative measures have been tested to promote gastrointestinal motility following
      intestinal surgery have been suggested.

      The medical intervention in the proposed study includes administration of a selective COX-2
      inhibitor, specifically Celecoxib, in the peri-operative period following an elective colon
      resection. Celecoxib is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory,
      analgesic, and antipyretic therapeutic effects.

      The drug is approved for use in by the ministry of health in Israel and in the United states.
      The study aims to assess the use of this widely used medication for evaluation of the
      clinical effect on post-operative bowel transit, as well as the drugs' effect on
      post-operative pain.

    <description>Celecoxib will be given orally to patients participating in the study and allocated to the treatment group, for an intervention period of 6 days, starting from the day of surgery.
Celecoxib will be given throughout the intervention period of the study orally at a dose of 400 mg per day divided into two doses, a dose which is within the recommended and a widely used dosage and is expected to induce a significant inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by the COX2 pathway. Celecoxib will be given throughout the intervention period of the study orally at a dose of 400 mg per day divided into two doses.</description>
