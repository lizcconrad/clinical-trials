  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this stepped wedge randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a crowdsourced intervention on promoting HIV testing among young Chinese men
      who have sex with men (MSM). The crowdsourced intervention will include an open contest,
      judging to determine finalists and prizes, a designathon, and contest-based MSM engagement.
      The hypothesis is that a crowdsourced intervention will be superior to conventional HIV test
      uptake campaigns in eliciting HIV test uptake.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use an adaptation of the stepped wedge randomized controlled trial design. A
      total of eight major metropolitan cities will implement the crowdsourced intervention. These
      cities will be chosen based on the following criteria: 1) previous Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) MSM sentinel surveillance site; 2) capacity for campaign
      implementation; 3) capacity for intervention implementation at the community level. Four
      cities will implement more intensive in-person events to promote engagement (Guangzhou,
      Shenzhen in Guangdong Province, Qingdao, and Jinan in Shandong Province) during survey
      intervention stage. The Randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be evaluated using two
      different sources of data: 1) online survey data from MSM in the eight cities prior to and
      after the intervention; 2) CDC routine surveillance data in the eight cities prior to and
      after the intervention.

      <pre_assignment_details>Overall, the survey link was clicked 36,863 times from 25,141 independent Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, and a total of 2,112 eligible participants finished the questionnaire (many people clicked the survey link but withdrew before the eligible screening).

Crowdsourced intervention: The crowdsourced intervention is composed of three phases that cumulatively draw on crowd wisdom to engage the community: (1) a crowdsourcing contest to solicit optimal images/concepts/taglines; (2) a designathon to formulate optimal HIV testing campaigns; (3) a process of localization unique to each of the eight cities.</description>
