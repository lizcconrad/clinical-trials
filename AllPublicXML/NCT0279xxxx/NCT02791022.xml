    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a common disease in the aging population that has severe implication
      if left untreated as it leads to embolic stroke and other embolic phenomenon. Embolic stroke
      in particular has severe implications to our community as the cost of care for such immobile
      patients can be extremely high. Atrial fibrillation typically begins as Paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation (PAF), which makes early detection extremely difficult as the PAF may only occur
      transiently in the initial stages. Long term continuous ECG monitoring is currently required
      over weeks to detect early PAF. Current devices typically need to be implanted (loop
      recorders) to be sensitive enough to detect infrequent episodes of PAF. New generation ECG
      remote devices (non-invasive) are however now available that are wearable over long periods
      and can send data directly to a database for centralized collection and analysis of the data.
      The aim of this study will be to use such a device to evaluate the incidence of PAF in
      different population of patients, with each patient wearing and sending continuous ECG data
      for periods of a week or more to a central database, across several public hospitals in
      Singapore.

      The implications of PAF detection in an individual are huge to the individual and the
      community as it increases the risk of embolic stroke and other embolic phenomenon. Once
      detected, intervention can be taken to lower such an individual's clinical risk and decrease
      the clinical burden to the community. The lack of suitable tools and large population cohorts
      has led to a likely underestimation of PAF in various patient populations. This study will
      specifically address and characterize the different incidence on PAF in various patient
      populations and hence help to target at risk groups for earlier screening and intervention.

      Patients with HF are more likely than the general population to develop AF. Conversely AF is
      also a strong independent risk factor for subsequent development of HF.

      In Heart Failure (HF) patients, later development of AF was associated with increased
      mortality. Preexisting HF adversely affected survival in individuals with AF. Both HF with
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and Heart Failure with a Preserved Ejection Fraction
      (HFpEF) patients are at greater risk for AF. There is a direct relationship between
      functional state (as shown by the NYHA class) and prevalence of AF in patients with HF
      progressing from 4% in those who are NYHA class I to 40% in those who are NYHA class IV.

      Acute HF decompensation in patients with prior HF is due to AF as a precipitant in 5.4% of
      cases in a single center study.

      Knowing the true prevalence of AF in HF will allow us to plan for strategies to further
      reduce the clinical burden of HF.
