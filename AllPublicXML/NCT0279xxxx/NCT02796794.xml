      To evaluate effects of genistein supplementation to enteral nutrition on inflammatory
      cytokines and morbidity in patients with sepsis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a state develops as a response to severe infection with high mortality rate.
      Incidence of sepsis among patients admitted to hospitals is 2%. Annual incidence of sepsis is
      50-95 for 100.000 population and incidence is increasing approximately 9% each year. Severe
      sepsis and septic shock is the most frequent reason for mortality in intensive care units
      (ICU). There is exaggerated and irregular host response in sepsis. Cytokines such as
      interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, Interferon-γ and high
      mobility group box-1 are released as response to invading microorganisms and they play a
      major role in sepsis pathogenesis.

      Soybean proteins are used for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases,
      osteoporosis and different cancer types.

      Soy isoflavones such as genistein, daidzein and glycitein are the main components for cancer
      prevention. Genistein is the dominant isoflavones.

      The main mechanism for anti-inflammatory effect of genistein is related to transcription
      nuclear factor (NF-kB) and inhibition of chemokine-8. The risk for prostate cancer was proven
      to decrease in epidemiological studies.

      NF-kB plays a central role for inflammatory cytokine release, prevents apoptosis and induces
      tumor cell growth. The effect of topoisomerase II inhibitory chemotherapeutic agents is
      increased with NF-kB inhibition.

      Hypothesis

        1. Addition of genistein to enteral nutrition in patients with sepsis can play an important
           role to decrease inflammatory cytokines.

        2. Morbidity can be decreased with lower levels of inflammatory cytokines in patients with
           sepsis.
