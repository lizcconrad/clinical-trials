  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trust between patients and medical providers is the cornerstone to obtain success
      treatment. To boost the trust can increase medical prescription compliance, enhance patient
      satisfaction, and improve the effectiveness of treatment. Otherwise, mistrust between medical
      providers and patients will result in ineffective treatment and excessive defensive health
      care. This situation may cause medical dispute and medical resources wasting problems.

      Most of treatment complete in a few times of admissions and interventions. So, how to improve
      the trust between patients and doctors quickly became a more knotty problem. Several studies
      found that speech (including listening, showing compassion, and take longer to explain),
      reputation, clothing, offer a newer therapy were more important than age, title, and sex.

      However, past researches were restricted to an unclear causal relationship. That is they
      can't be determined whether good doctor-patient relationship and better trust conditions
      create a longer visit time, better satisfaction, and good reputation, or vice versa. They
      also unable to clarify whether the high degree of trust result in improved treatment effects,
      or good relationship result from good medical outcomes.

      Investigators want to design a randomized control trial by giving patients recommendation and
      physical therapist introductions to enhance the trust of patients to therapists. And this
      study may verify whether enhance trust between therapists and patients will lead to changes
      in treatment effectiveness.
