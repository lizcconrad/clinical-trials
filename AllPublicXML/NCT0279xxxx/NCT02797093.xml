  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship between anti-retroviral therapy
      (ART) adherence with levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reservoir and residual
      viremia in suppressed, HIV-infected individuals on chronic ART.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Understanding whether the size and dynamics of the HIV reservoir are associated with
      adherence, measured by an objective biomarker, could have significant clinical and
      therapeutic implications for ART and HIV cure.

        1. First, this aim will quantify levels of CA-RNA, CA-DNA, and plasma residual viremia in
           suppressed, HIV infected individuals and correlate them with levels of TFV-DP in DBS as
           a measure of cumulate drug exposure (adherence).

        2. Second, this study will evaluate the changes in the HIV reservoir in relation to changes
           in ART adherence over time.
