  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The repeated exposition to S. aureus is considered as a determining factor of acquisition of
      the nasal colonization. The healthcare professionals are regularly in touch with this
      pathogenic bacterium. Prevalence of the nasal carriage of S. aureus in this population was
      the object of several studies but little took into account the respect for the rules of good
      hygienic practice. The results of our previous study carried out during the international
      congress of staphylococci (ISSSI, Lyon in August 26-30th, 2012) showed an association between
      the work in a hospital environment and the increase of the risk of nasal carriage. On the
      contrary, the use of the hydro-alcoholic solutions had a protective effect against this
      carriage. However, sized of the health care population of our study was limited.

      The goal of this study is to confirm our previous results on a larger cohort of healthcare
      professionals. The main objective is to estimate the prevalence of nasal carriage according
      to the professional category and by taking into account the degree of conformity with good
      hygiene practices including the use of hydro-alcoholic solutions.

    <description>After formal consent, nasal swabs are collected for each participant. SA nasal carriage and its susceptibility to methicillin is determined using a rapid PCR technique (GenExpert, Cepheid). Each participant is asked to complete a short questionnaire regarding some demographic variables, smoking habits, long-term medication, sector of activity, and direct manipulation of the pathogen.</description>
