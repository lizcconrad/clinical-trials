      The purpose of this study is to conduct a study on genetic pathology, obtaining of pure
      cancer tissues is mandatory. Although the endoscopy with biopsy has been a gold standard for
      diagnosing gastric cancer, percentage of cancer cells in biopsy samples is usually 30% or
      less. Recently, confocal laser endomicroscopy has been introduced for real-time
      histopathologic diagnosis in various cancers. In previous pilot study in our institution,
      pCLE-targeted biopsy provided superior results in terms of the proportion of cancer cells in
      biopsy samples compared to WLE-targeted biopsy, especially for gastric cancers with
      undifferentiated histology. However, there was a limitation because of small sample size.
      Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate that biopsy using probe-based confocal laser
      endomicroscopy for undifferentiated gastric cancer will increase the percentage of cancer
      cells and expression ratio of tumor marker in biopsy samples.
