  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort of relatively healthy individuals, using comprehensive clinical
      information, advanced imaging (including cardiac MRI), cardiovascular exercise physiology,
      metabolomics and genetic analysis. These findings will be correlated with adverse clinical
      outcomes including death, stroke and myocardial infarction. In selected cases, follow-up
      imaging and biomarker samples will also be obtained. These studies will enable us to begin to
      address a critical gap in our knowledge as to how best to interpret the very large amount of
      cardiovascular tests done in Singapore and how to better to predict outcomes and manage
      healthcare costs in our local populations

      SingHEART sub-study will collect the following data types or perform the following
      investigations:

        1. Demographic and clinical characteristics data.

        2. Basic blood investigations. Basic blood investigations include: FBC, CRP, renal panel,
           random glucose, LFT, fasting lipids, ESR, CRP,

        3. Perform a single baseline cardiac MRI (already consented and obtained as part of the
           primary study).

        4. ECG

        5. Calcium score

        6. Biobanking (whole blood, plasma and serum, already performed as part of the primary
           study)

        7. Exercise and physical activity tracker over two 1-week periods

        8. Ambulatory BP monitoring over two 24-48H periods
