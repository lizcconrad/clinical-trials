      Purpose: To evaluate the retention and caries preventive effect of the glass-ionomer fissure
      sealants and resin-based fissure sealant. Materials and Methods: Using a split mouth design
      ,a double blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted to compare the retention
      and the caries preventive effect of light cure resin base sealant (3M ESPE) and Glass ionomer
      sealant (FUJI). The study comprised of 120 government school children of 7-9 years age group.
      The glass-ionomer sealant and resin-based sealant were applied randomly on either side of the
      first mandibular permanent molars. They were recalled for assessment of sealant retention at
      intervals of 3, 6 and 12 months.
