      Objective: The main target of this study was to research the early changes in pulmonary
      function and intrarenal hemodynamics, then research the correlation between the pulmonary
      function and the renal hemodynamics in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without diabetic
      kidney disease (DKD).

      Method: 37 T2DM patients (diabetes group) without DKD and 33 healthy people (control group)
      were choosed to research early changes in pulmonary function and intrarenal hemodynamics,
      then research the correlation between the pulmonary function and the renal blood flow in T2DM
      patients, all having normal renal function. The primary endpoints were the pulmonary function
      parameters (VC%, FVC%, FEV1%, PEF%, MVV%, TLC%, FEV1/FVC%, DLCO%, and DLCO/VA%); the
      secondary endpoints were the intrarenal hemodynamic (bilateral kidney RI) in bilateral
      interlobular renal arteries were evaluated using; the tertiary endpoints were the biochemical
      variables: blood-fat (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG), renal function parameters (BUN, Cr, and
      GFR); in addition, the albumin excrete rate (AER), urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR)
      were measured.

      Pulmonary function was measured by spirometer which was provided by Jaska Corporation in
      Japan, model number: HI-101; RI were measured by Logiq 400 MD Pro Series scanner (GE Medical
      Systems, Milwaukee, WI) using a 3.5-4 MHz vector array transducer

        We selected 42 T2DM patients (24 males, 18 females) without DKD as diabetes group and 38
        healthy people (21 males, 17 females) as control group from the diabetic outpatient clinic
        in Shenyang the Fourth Hospital of People, but only 37 patients (21 males, 16 females) in
        the diabetes group and 33 healthy people (18 males, 15 females) can be researched in our
        study, all the participants were the Chinese Hans.
