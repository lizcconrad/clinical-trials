    <textblock>
      Up to 35 adult patients with metastatic melanoma will be enrolled in this study with a target
      enrollment of 30 evaluable subjects who complete the baseline and an approximately 3 week FDG
      PET/CT scans, they may also complete an FDG PET/CT after 10 weeks of pembrolizumab therapy.
      Subjects may also be a part of the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program and then will be
      asked to have one additional tumor biopsy and one additional blood draw for the purposes of
      this imaging study. Subjects who are eligible for this imaging protocol will undergo a
      baseline FDG PET/CT scan as part of their clinical restaging prior to starting new therapy. A
      research FDG PET/CT will take place approximately 3 weeks post-therapy and a 3rd FDG PET/CT
      scan will be done at more than 10 weeks after starting pembrolizumab, this scan may be done
      as a clinical scan for evaluation of response or restaging after therapy, however, if it is
      not ordered as a clinical scan it will be done as a research scan. Changes in FDG uptake will
      be correlated with blood and tissue results from the patient's medical records and from the
      data collected as part of the Penn Melanoma Tissue Collection Program and with long term
      outcomes including progression free and overall survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures.

          -  The subject must be â‰¥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          -  The subject must have biopsy proven or clinically documented advanced stage metastatic
             melanoma.

          -  The subject must have measurable disease (per RECIST 1.1) that is seen on CT, MRI, or
             FDG PET/CT.

          -  The subject must be recommended to start pembrolizumab.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding at the time of screening will not be
             eligible for this study. Female participants of child-bearing potential will have a
             urine pregnancy test at the time of the screening visit.

          -  Subject is not able to tolerate imaging procedures in the opinion of the investigator
             or treating physician.

          -  Subject has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory
             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Subject has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent
             as assessed by medical record review and/or self-reported.

          -  Subject has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies)
             as determined by medical record review.

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy
             or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose
             of trial treatment.

          -  Subject has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV
             RNA [qualitative] is detected) as determined by medical record review.

          -  Subject has known active central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis.

        Note: Subjects with previously treated brain metastases will be eligible to participate
        provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four
        weeks prior to receiving pembrolizumab and any neurologic symptoms have returned to
        baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
        steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.
