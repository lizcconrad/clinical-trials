  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the amount of nicotine that is absorbed into the blood
      stream following the use of a new Electronic Cigarette device called the CN electronic
      cigarette. The amount of nicotine delivered via the CN electronic cigarette will be compared
      to the amount of nicotine delivered from smoking a regular cigarette and from using the
      Nicorette® Inhalator.

      Electronic cigarettes aim to mimic the experience of cigarette smoking, by delivering
      nicotine rapidly. Unlike cigarettes however, they do not contain all of the many harmful
      combustion products contained in tobacco smoke.

      Electronic cigarettes are readily available in many markets, and may contain significant
      quantities of nicotine. However, they are not regulated as medicines, and their manufacturers
      can make no medicinal claims about them.

      Such products are unregulated, having not been subjected to regulatory review by either the
      Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or any Notified Body.

      It is the intention of CN Creative (makers of the CN electronic cigarette) to submit an
      application to the MHRA for the CN Electronic Cigarette, in order to make a high quality,
      regulated product available. Males aged 18-65, who smoke and who have no intention of
      stopping smoking during the trial are eligible to take part in this study. The study consist
      of a screening visit, a treatment period with 5 overnight stays with nicotine treatment on
      days 1, 2, 3 and 4 with a post study visit on day 5.
