  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will undergo a SmartPill test to gain additional understanding of Fabry disease
      manifestation via motility abnormalities in order to improve symptom targeted therapy. An
      additional Endoscopic mucosal resection may be performed on further qualifying patients.
      Tissue analysis from this biopsy will include evaluation of abnormalities of cellular
      structure and morphology with correlation with gastrointestinal complaints for each patient
      and comparison against age matched non-Fabry patient tissue. The hypothesis is that patients
      with fabry disease will have abnormal motility which will correlate with the patients
      symptoms and quality of life as noted on the questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Gastrointestinal manifestations such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and nausea are
      prominent and, although typically non life-threatening, can frequently cause significant
      morbidity and burden in a patient with Fabry disease. Additional in depth understanding of
      gastrointestinal symptoms pathophysiology in Fabry disease is acutely needed in order to
      develop more specific evaluation of the symptoms and advance the treatment of these patients.

      Hypothesis: Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms will have delayed motility on the
      SmartPill study, abnormal histologic findings on mucosal resection and symptoms that
      correlate with abnormal histologic and SmartPill findings. By gaining additional insight into
      the characterization of symptoms and the relationship to dysmotility, we anticipate improved
      and more focused adjunct therapies for the patients.

      Methods: This study will consist of a screening visit, a SmartPill testing procedure visit,
      and a follow up visit for all subjects enrolled in the study. Fifteen of these patients, who
      clinically warranted sigmoidoscopy, will be asked to also complete an endoscopic mucosal
      resection (EMR) visit in addition to the other aspects of the study. Thus, each subject will
      report to the study site for at least 3 visits and up to 4 visits.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of dysmotility will be the measurement of transit time via a SmartPill study. The transit time will be reported as gastric time, small bowel time and colonic time in additional to total transit time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gastrointestinal symptom assessment via questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete several questionnaires during study participation regarding gastrointestinal symptoms (lower and upper GI). These results will be used to determine overall gastrointestinal involvement and will be correlated with transit time and histologic findings</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Extent of injury and deposition in rectal tissue via histologic assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Via deep specimen biopsies the extent of deposits and injury will be assessed. Deposit quantification will be determined based on a scale use previously for analysis in Fabry disease (0 No deposit, +deposit present in a few cells, ++ deposits present in some cells, +++ deposits present in many cells). Additionally, the specimens will be assessed for presence or absence of neuronal swelling, myelination, vascular sclerosis, intimal fibrosis and hypertrophy of the smooth muscles of the arterioles. The results of analysis of all specimens will be compared to healthy aged-matched controls obtained from banked specimens in the pathology department.</description>

    <description>All subjects will be asked to complete a SmartPill test. The SmartPill capsule is pill-shaped and about an inch long and Â½ inch wide, or about the size of a vitamin pill. The receiver unit is about the size of a paperback book. The receiver gets signals from the capsule and stores the signals on a computer chip. The capsule detects the level of acidity, temperature, and pressures in your stomach and intestines and sends the information by radio wave signals to the receiver.</description>

    <description>An additional small group of subjects will also be asked to complete a Sigmoidoscopy (an exam used to evaluate the lower part of the large intestine) during which an Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (removal of a small amount of tissue from the outermost layer of gut wall) will be completed. In the Endoscopy Mucosal Resection (EMR) procedure we will use an instrument called an endoscope (a lighted, flexible tube) to take a tissue sample from the rectum. This is the same type of instrument used in a routine colonoscopy</description>
