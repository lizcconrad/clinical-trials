  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a type of radiation therapy called
      frameless fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FFSRT) is effective for treating
      patients with brain metastases. The safety of this therapy will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. FFSRT is delivered using FDA-approved and commercially
      available methods. The study doctor can explain how FFSRT is designed to work.

      Up to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson
      locations in Rio Rancho and Albuquerque, NM and the following Houston area locations in Bay
      Area, Katy, Sugarland, and The Woodlands.

      Treatment Planning Visit:

      If you choose to take part in this study, before you receive FFSRT, you will have a magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and a CT scan with contrast to help the doctor plan where to deliver
      your treatment. The contrast solution is given by vein to help make the pictures more
      accurate.

      If you can become pregnant, blood (about 2 tablespoons) or urine will be collected for a
      pregnancy test within 7 days before the start of treatment. To take part in this study, you
      must not be pregnant.

      Study Treatment:

      You will receive FFSRT daily for 3-5 days (weekdays only), based on what the doctor thinks is
      needed. Each dose will last about 30 minutes. A mask will be fitted to keep your head in the
      same position for each dose. You may notice sounds and lights from the radiation machine
      working. You will be alone in the room during your treatment, but you will be able to see and
      hear the staff.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Your participation on this study will be over after your 1-year follow-up visit, described
      below.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      Every 3 months for 1 year after your last dose of FFSRT, you will return to the clinic for
      follow-up visits. At each visit you will have an MRI to check the status of the disease. You
      will also be asked about how you are feeling.

    <description>Lesion failure based on imaging assessments for each lesion. Local failure in brain on follow-up MRI defined as &gt;20% increase in sum longest distance relative to lesion size prior to radiation treatment. Participants' lesions will be followed for failure starting on day 1 of radiation treatment in 3-month intervals for up to 1-year. Participants unable to complete at least 80% of their prescribed dose will be replaced. Participants who complete the prescribed dose but die prior to their 6-month evaluation will be considered treatment failures.</description>
