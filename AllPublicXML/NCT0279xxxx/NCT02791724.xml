    <textblock>
      The trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel internet intervention (Desiconnect),
      which was designed to introduce relevant cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to
      Persons with Epilepsy (PwE) and comorbid depression. Therefore, 200 PwE and a current
      depressive disorder (major depressive disorder or dysthymic disorder) will be recruited and
      randomized to two groups: (1) a control group, in which they may engage with any epilepsy
      treatment (Care-as-Usual, CAU) and receive access to Desiconnect after a delay of three
      months (i.e., CAU/wait list control group), or (2) to a treatment group that immediately
      receives six-month access to Desiconnect and may also use CAU. The primary outcome measure is
      the depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), collected at three months
      post-baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common among persons with epilepsy (PwE), affecting roughly one in three
      individuals, and its presence is associated with personal suffering, impaired quality of
      life, and worse prognosis. Despite the availability of effective treatments, depression is
      often overlooked and treated inadequately in PwE, in part because of concerns over drug
      interactions. Previous studies strongly suggest that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can
      help alleviate depression in PwE, but CBT is not always available to patients.
      Internet-administered psychological interventions are easily accessible and might complement
      antidepressant medication or psychotherapy, and preliminary evidence suggests that such
      interventions can be effective. However, no trial has yet examined whether a CBT-based
      internet intervention designed to meet the needs of PwE can achieve sustained reductions in
      depression and related symptoms, such as anxiety, when offered as adjunct to treatment as
      usual.

      The Internet-based intervention evaluated in this trial was designed with the aim of
      conveying evidence-based psychotherapeutic techniques, gleaned primarily from CBT, to PwE
      over a period of 180 days. The intervention focuses on identifying and challenging cognitions
      that trigger or sustain depression and anxiety, increasing activities that are likely to
      reduce depression and anxiety, practicing relaxation and stress management exercises and
      increasing mindfulness skills. The program is based on general CBT and other evidence-based
      psychotherapeutic techniques that have been shown to be helpful for patients suffering from
      depression (and ideally, that have been shown to be helpful among PwE). Furthermore, program
      content addresses other issues in disease self-management, including lifestyle habits (e.g.,
      nutrition, exercise) and medication adherence. The delivery and training of content is
      continuously individualized to match users' preferences and needs, based on responses within
      the program. The intervention is delivered via the Internet and protected by individually
      assigned passwords.

      This randomized controlled trial will include 200 participants with epilepsy and a current
      depressive disorder, along with currently at least moderately elevated depression.
      Participants will be recruited from various settings, including epilepsy treatment clinics,
      outpatient treatment centers, and Internet forums/groups. Methods such as newspaper articles,
      flyers, posters, and media articles or web-advertisements will be used to inform potential
      participants about the study (all material will be in German). Participants will be randomly
      assigned to either (1) a control group, in which they receive care as usual (CAU) and are
      given access to the internet intervention (Desiconnect) after a delay of 3 months (i.e.,
      CAU/Wait list control group), or (2) a treatment group that may also use CAU and in addition
      immediately receives six-month access to the novel, internet-administered intervention
      (Desiconnect). Measurements are collected online at pre-treatment (baseline, T0), three
      months (T1), six months (T2), and nine months (T3).

    <description>Desiconnect is an Internet intervention for persons with epilepsy and elevated depression. Content is continuously adapted to patients' concerns and needs. Techniques to overcome depression (e.g., cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation) and to cope with anxiety symptoms (e.g., exposure, role of avoidance, mindfulness exercises) are conveyed in interactive sequences that are accompanied by audio recordings, illustrations, and worksheets. Topics covered also include coping with epilepsy symptoms, identifying and coping with seizure auras and triggers, and the role of nutrition and exercise. Patients are also prompted to regularly complete brief symptom severity self-monitoring questionnaires. Optional daily text messages with motivational content accompany the program. The program can be accessed for 180 days after registration.</description>
