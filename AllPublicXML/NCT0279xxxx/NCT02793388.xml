    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open label trial to assess the effectiveness of
      unsupervised versus supervised primaquine treatment in patients with uncomplicated malaria.
      In co-endemic regions, the risk of P. vivax relapse following treatment for P. falciparum is
      high. Hence patients infected with either P. vivax or P. falciparum will be included in the
      study. The study will be conducted in Ethiopia. Participants will be enrolled at health
      centres and provided with the recommended schizontocidal treatment plus primaquine radical
      cure which will be either supervised or unsupervised according to randomisation. Participants
      will be followed up for four months and assessed at regular intervals for the presence of
      patent and sub-patent malaria. The outcome of the study will contribute to an improved
      treatment scheme for uncomplicated malaria in this area.
