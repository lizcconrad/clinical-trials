  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The classic form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (prevalence 1/15,000) is the most common cause
      of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). This autosomic recessive disease is responsible for
      virilization of the external genitalia in girls through androgen hypersecretion during fetal
      life. Since 1984, the Lyon Pediatric Endocrinology group has proposed prenatal dexamethasone
      (DEX) for all fetuses at risk of CAH With the aim of preventing fetal androgen hypersecretion
      in affected girls and avoiding poor long-term results from reconstructive surgery. Prenatal
      DEX was used in Europe and the USA but its use was recently suspended: in 2007, a Swedish
      study conducted on 26 children treated with DEX in utero for a short period of time reported
      cognitive impairments. These data were not confirmed by an American study on the short-term
      DEX use, which showed potential cognitive impairments in CAH children exposed to DEX for long
      periods of time. These confusing and controversial results have caused the scientific
      community to question its position and have resulted in the suspension of the use of prenatal
      DEX with drastic consequences for CAH girls (virilization; genital surgery etc.). In this
      context, an evaluation of neuropsychological development under in utero DEX is essential to
      validate its indication for use during the prenatal period. This study will evaluate outcomes
      using prospective cognitive and emotional assessments. It will first focus on the unaffected
      children previously treated in utero in order to assess the adverse effects of the drug. The
      study will then assess the children with CAH for whom DEX could have beneficial effects.

    <description>Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) is designed to measure human intelligence. WISC-IV includes:
Verbal Comprehension Index: measure of verbal concept formation.
Perceptual Reasoning Index: measure of non-verbal and fluid reasoning.
Working Memory Index: measure of working memory.
Processing Speed Index: measure of processing speed. Data measured: raw score (0 to 150), standard score (1 to 19), index (40 to 160).
The four indexes of the intelligence quotient will be considered hierarchically as follows: first the Working Memory Index, then the Processing Speed Index, third the Perceptual Reasoning Index, fourth the Verbal Comprehension Index.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The anatomical evaluation (phenotyping) of girls' external genitalia was performed at the time of the surgical correction and included the measurement of the genital tubercule (GT), the distance between the perineum and the urethra-vaginal confluence, the degree of fusion of the genital folds (labia majora), their pigmentation and creases. The measurement of the ano-genital distance was not routine practice in the past.</description>
