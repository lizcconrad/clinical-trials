  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the management of chronic heart failure patients
      with atrial fibrillation, to collect data on compliance with clinical guidelines and the
      prevalence of long-term anticoagulant therapy,complications. The results will be used to
      develop most rational therapeutic and diagnostic strategies to improve clinical outcomes of
      such patients.

      Quality assurance plan: investigators are going to plan site monitoring every three months.
      Any audits are not planned Investigatirs will check all entered data into the registry with
      the predefined ranges. The database is protected against any inconsistency and incorrect
      entering by the strictly predefined range in all fields. Instead of that, data checks will be
      performed yearly.

      During the site monitoring data verification of the transfer from source documents to the
      database will be performed.

      Iiverstigators have data dictionary, which includes descriptions of each variable and, if
      relevant, normal ranges.

      Investigators use standard local operation procedures for any activities during the registry
      (as patient recruitment, data collection and management, data analysis) and local authorities
      approve all of those procedures.

      Investigators calculated the sample size for demonstration of hypothesis of the registry.

      Descriptive analysis of the data will be reported using basic summary statistics. Results
      will be summarized for the whole group and for the diagnostic subgroups. P-values and
      confidence intervals will be 2-sided, and statistical significance will be declared at the
      2-sided 0,05-level. For continuous variables mean values, standard deviations, 95% confidence
      intervals, median and lower and upper percentiles, as well as minimum and maximum values will
      be calculated.

      Safety is assessed by reports of AEs with relation, seriousness, action taken, and outcome.
      AEs are summarized using the MedDRA coding system. Event rates for single AEs are calculated
      based on the total number of documented patients. AEs are categorized according to relation,
      seriousness and outcome.
