  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the hypothesis that direct transfer to an Endovascular Stroke Center, compared to
      transfer to the closest Local Stroke Center, offers a better outcome in the distribution of
      the modified Rankin Scale scores at 90 days in acute ischemic stroke patients with clinically
      suspected Large Vessel Occlusion identified by Emergency Medical Services (EMS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, cluster randomized controlled, usual care conditions, open,
      blinded-endpoint trial of acute stroke patients with suspected acute large vessel occlusion
      (LVO) identified by EMS at first assistance on the field, in which two strategies will be
      compared: transfer to the closest local stroke center (Local-SC) Vs. direct transfer to an
      endovascular stroke center (EVT-SC).

      The RACE scale (Rapid Arterial oCclusion Evaluation) will be used as a prehospital screening
      tool to identify acute stroke patients with suspicion of LVO. Upon candidate identification,
      EMS will contact a stroke neurologist on call using a prehospital telestroke system who will
      confirm inclusion criteria and will allocate the subjects to a specific intervention
      according to a pre-established temporal sequence. Allocation will account for 3 strata: time
      band (two groups of 12 hours), territory (metropolitan versus provincial area) and week day
      (working versus weekend day).

      Subjects will be followed up to 90 days post-randomization.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suspected LVO acute stroke patients identified by a RACE scale score &gt;4 at the
             pre-hospital setting, that is evaluated by EMS professionals when attending patients,
             in non-stroke ready centers or primary health centers, previous to the transfer to a
             stroke center.

          -  Patients located in geographical areas in which the reference stroke center is a
             hospital not capable to offer endovascular treatment (Primary stroke Center or
             Telestroke Center).

          -  Estimated arrival time at an EVT-SC &lt;7 hours from symptom onset. Symptom onset is
             defined as point in time the patient was last seen well (at baseline).

          -  No significant pre-stroke functional disability (modified Rankin scale 0 - 2)

          -  Age ≥18

          -  Deferred informed consent obtained from patient or acceptable patient surrogate (after
             the acute phase, as permission to use clinical data within a clinical registry)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in a coma (NIHSS item of consciousness &gt;1)

          -  Patients with unstable clinical status who require emergent life support care

          -  Serious, advanced, or terminal illness with anticipated life expectancy of less than 6
             month.

          -  Suspected LVO acute stroke patients identified at the Emergency Department of a stroke
             center

          -  Subject participating in a study involving an investigational drug or device that
             would impact this study.

          -  Patients with a pre-existing neurological or psychiatric disease that would confound
             the neurological or functional evaluations. This excludes patients who are severely
             demented, require constant assistance in a nursing home type setting or who live at
             home but are not fully independent in activities of daily living (toileting, dressing,
             eating, cooking and preparing meals, etc.)

          -  Unlikely to be available for 90-day follow-up (e.g. no fixed home address, visitor
