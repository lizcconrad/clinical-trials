  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial will examine whether a well-controlled and monitored site-based
      exercise intervention, initiated before beginning aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy, improves
      cognitive function in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer and will explore
      whether neuroimaging metrics of brain health, pro-inflammatory biomarkers and symptoms
      (fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety) mediate the effects of exercise on cognitive
      function. Furthermore, the study will explore whether the magnitude of the improvements in
      cognitive function are modified by estradiol levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims include:

        1. Compared to usual care, examine whether the 6-month exercise intervention improves
           cognitive function over the first six months of AI therapy in postmenopausal women with
           early stage breast cancer.

           Hypothesis 1. Exercise will improve cognitive function in women receiving AI therapy in
           a domain specific fashion such that attention, executive and memory functions will be
           influenced more than other domains.

        2. Compared to usual care, examine the direct effects of exercise on neuroimaging metrics
           of brain health including regional gray matter volume, white matter architecture and
           functional dynamics of the brain and the pro-inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6 and CRP as
           primary outcomes; TNF-α as secondary), and explore the direct effects of exercise on
           symptoms (fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety).

           Hypothesis 2. Exercise will improve neuroimaging metrics of brain health and
           pro-inflammatory biomarkers.

        3. Compared to usual care, explore whether the effects of exercise on cognitive function
           are mediated by a) neuroimaging metrics of cognitive function, b) IL-6, CRP and TNF-α
           levels and c) symptoms (fatigue, sleep problems, depression, anxiety), and moderated by
           E2 levels over the first six months of AI therapy.

    <description>Fitness will be measured by submaximal VO2 test. The submaximal test is similar to the full test, but stops at 85% of the age-predicted heart rate. The protocol involves walking at a self-selected pace between 2.0-4.0 mph with increasing grade increments of 2% every two minutes. The test is terminated when the subject reaches 85% of their age-predicted heart rate or at volitional exhaustion.</description>

    <intervention_name>Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Exercise Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The intervention is moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, monitored on-site. Walking on a motorized treadmill will be the encouraged mode of exercise; however participants may use other equipment. Participants will begin by exercising 10-15 minutes for 3 days/week during the first 2 weeks and gradually increase the duration for the following 4 weeks until they reach 40-50 minutes per session/3 days per week. This level is then maintained for the remainder of the 6 months. The rate of increase will be tailored based on baseline cardiorespiratory fitness and response to exercise. All sessions start and end with a vital sign check and 5-10 minutes warm-up/cool-down. Trained exercise physiologists will supervise all exercise sessions and closely monitor adherence, intensity, and safety.</description>

    <ipd_description>At the completion of the intervention, after investigators have been un-blinded to group status, and after the testing and publication of the primary aims and hypotheses, the investigators will provide de-identified data to interested investigators provided that they closely consult with Drs. Bender and Erickson with respect to study design, analytical procedures, and to avoid overlapping research in analyses or manuscript preparation. The primary investigative team will be given priority in addressing scientific questions of interest with the collected data, but will work closely with any interested investigators in maximizing the data to address other questions of interest that could be answered by these data.</ipd_description>
