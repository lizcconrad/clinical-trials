  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is multisystem autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. It's
      characterized by activation of immune system, microvascular changes and intimal
      proliferation.

      The EULAR/ACR 2013 criteria for the classification of SSc will help identify SSC patients
      before fibrosis of internal organs and will allow early treatment.

      Patient with RP, SSc-related autoAb, anti-topoisomerase I (SCL-70), anti-centromere autoAb,
      anti-RNApolymerase III, abnormal nailfold capillaries and puffy hands would have SSc.

      The OR of abnormal capillaroscopy for subsequent development of SSc can reach 163 with
      positive predictive value of 52% and negative predictive value of 99% .Some studies found
      that preclinical internal organ involvement in pre-scleroderma patients, DLCO&lt;80% was
      detected in 11/32 patients with RP plus SSc-associated autoAb plus SSc-type nailfold
      capillary changes.

      The heritability of SSc was considered controversial in the, largest published SSc .Twin
      study, which in general suggested a modest genetic contribution to the Phenotype
      .Nevertheless, this study included only 42 sets of twins, and it should Be considered that,
      in a family study of 703 cases, an affected first-degree relative Increased the risk of SSc
      13 times compared to the general population . Moreover, having an affected sibling increased
      SSc risk by 15 times , and there Was a remarkable concordance of auto antibodies between SSc
      twins . Additionally, recent analyses have shown that the standardized incidence ratio of SSc
      seemed to be less than those observed in autoimmune diseases (ADs) such as Rheumatoid
      arthritis or Ankylosing Spondylitis, but similar to those observed for Hashimoto, thyroiditis
      or psoriasis. In addition, SSc prevalence, clinical Outcomes and autoantibody profiles have
      been reported to vary depending on Patient ancestry Therefore, the role of genetic factors in
      SSc susceptibility can now be considered solidly established.

      A positive family history of SSc appears to confer a risk that is at least 10-16-fold Higher
      than normal for SSc in first-degree relatives and 10-27-fold higher than Normal for SSc in
      siblings, and thus represents the strongest susceptibility factor Yet reported for this
      disease .
