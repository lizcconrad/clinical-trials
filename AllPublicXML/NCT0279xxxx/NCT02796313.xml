  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized trial to test our DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)
      based intervention in 400 adult American Indians with inadequately controlled systolic blood
      pressure (≥140 mmHg). Over the 5 years of the project, we will recruit and randomize 200
      participants from each of 2 urban sites in Washington and Oklahoma.

      In addition, we will conduct a pilot study after the 8 week intervention concludes to test
      whether providing 6 additional week of dietitian support (without the grocery supplement) can
      help improve blood pressure over the long term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For Goal 1, all participants complete 4 data collection visits at the clinic (in person
      screening visit, baseline, week 8, and week 12). Participants will be randomized into either
      the control group or the intervention group at the baseline visit.

      All participants will receive 8 weekly credits for groceries and will be given equipment for
      monitoring their BP at home. Study staff will help participants place their grocery orders
      each week, and will collect readings from the home BP monitoring equipment at the same time.
      This data will be used to understand whether the intervention is effective for controlling
      BP.

      All participants will be encouraged to maintain their regular levels of physical activity and
      receive treatment as usual from their healthcare providers.

      The control group participants will receive an American Heart Association printed brochure
      about the health benefits of a low-salt diet. All foods will be available to purchase,
      including those that do not meet the DASH diet guidelines.

      The intervention group participants will receive 1 hour of in-person nutritional counseling
      and a personalized prescription for the low-salt DASH diet based on estimated calorie needs
      at baseline, followed by weekly 20-minute phone calls in weeks 1-8 to provide extra support.

      The intervention group's food choices will be limited to fresh produce and a pre-determined
      list of other foods included in the DASH diet. During weekly phone calls, the dietitian will
      use a structured phone curriculum to discuss in more detail a different component of the DASH
      diet, followed by goal setting related to that component. Through small goal setting each
      week, participants will receive ongoing support to improve full adherence to the DASH diet by
      the end of week 8.

      The pilot study will provide preliminary evidence for natural attenuation of BP, and will
      evaluate the added benefit of the additional telephone support that can be used to inform
      design of future studies.

      Beginning in Year 3, 100 intervention group participants (50 at each site) who attend the
      Week 8 follow up research visit and who successfully completed 5 of the 8 weekly phone calls
      will be randomized to:

        -  Pilot Control group -no additional support, weekly BP measurements only

        -  Pilot Intervention group - 6 extra weeks of 20-minute phone consultations with the
           dietitian (enhanced intervention)

      We will also recruit 100 control group participants (50 at each site) to the pilot study, who
      will be automatically assigned to receive no additional support while providing weekly BP
      measurements.

      The enhanced intervention consultations will provide support for maintaining a low-sodium
      DASH lifestyle after the weekly grocery credit ends. We will contact pilot study participants
      by telephone 6 and 9 months after baseline and talk them through accessing BP readings from
      their home BP monitor.
