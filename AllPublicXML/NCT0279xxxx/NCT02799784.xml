  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of umeclidinium/vilanterol
      (UMEC/VI) versus tiotropium/olodaterol (TIO/OLO) in subjects with moderated COPD.

      This is a multicentre, randomized, open label, 2 period crossover complete block design
      study.

      Eligible subjects, who complete a 2-week run-in period, will be randomized to receive a
      sequence consisting of UMEC/VI inhalation powder (62.5/25 microgram [mcg] once-daily [QD])
      administered as 1 inhalation via the ELLIPTA® Inhaler and TIO/OLO 5/5 mcg inhalation spray
      administered as 2 inhalations via the RESPIMAT® inhaler, for 8 weeks each. This will be
      followed by a 3-week washout period and one-week follow-up period. The total duration of
      subject participation in the study will be approximately 22 weeks.
