  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast conservation surgery (BCS) is performed on patients with breast cancer with the intent
      to resect and completely remove the tumour while conserving as much of the surrounding normal
      tissue as possible. Currently, there is no way for surgeons to determine the adequacy of
      surgical resection in real-time during surgery; the assessment of surgical margins requires
      histological examination that is not available in real-time and is impractical in most
      clinical cases. This results in a re-excision rate of 23% among Canadian women in order to
      achieve optimal surgical margins. In addition, the presence or absence of cancer in tumor
      draining lymph nodes is recognized as a key element for breast cancer staging; however, lymph
      node dissection can be associated with overtreatment and morbidity (nerve damage and post
      surgical lymphedema) and histological analysis of nodes can be time consuming and thus delay
      subsequent procedures. In an effort to address these issues, we have designed and
      constructed, in collaboration with Sogang University, Seoul, S. Korea, a novel imaging system
      that performs three complementary imaging modalities (tri-modal): ultrasound (US),
      photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL).

      This first-in-human pilot study will recruit 10 breast cancer patients undergoing breast
      conserving surgery at Princess Margaret Hospital (Toronto, Canada). The study is designed to
      test our tri-modal (US, PA, FL) imaging technology in breast cancer patients. The overall
      goal is to obtain initial information on the technical feasibility of the tri-modal system in
      a peri-operative setting and to confirm the anticipated safety of the procedures.
      Additionally, it will provide initial data on the ability of this system to detect/localize
      primary breast cancer lesions and cancer-involved lymph nodes prior to surgery.

    <description>This tri-modal imaging system was developed in collaboration with Sogang University and is composed of three subsystems: ultrasound, photoacoustic and fluorescence. For this study, the fluorescence subsystem will not be used. The photoacoustic and ultrasound subsystems and data acquisition are controlled by a single workstation. The complete system is Canadian Standards Association (CSA) certified</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to provide informed consent

          -  Pre-operative therapy for current breast cancer (including chemotherapy, endocrine
             therapy and radiotherapy)

          -  history of other previous cancer requiring therapy (including chemotherapy, endocrine
             therapy and radiotherapy) within the past 12 months

          -  History of photosensitivity, skin disease or recurrent disease

          -  Pregnancy
