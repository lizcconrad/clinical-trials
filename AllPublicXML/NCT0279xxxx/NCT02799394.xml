      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of activity modification, exercises
      and a gradual return to sport in adolescents (age 10-14) with Osgood Schlatter disease. The
      primary outcome is self-reported recovery on a 7-point Likert scale at 3 months. Secondary
      endpoints include 4 and 8 weeks and 6 and 12 months after inclusion into the project. The
      adolescents will be recruited from primary schools, general practitioners and through online
      advertising on Facebook.
