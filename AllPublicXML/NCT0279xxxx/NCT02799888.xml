  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD) and HLA-haploidentical donor (Haplo Donor)
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with increased
      graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and impaired survival. The chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)
      antagonist maraviroc has immunomodulatory properties potentially beneficial for GVHD control
      as it can blockade lymphocyte chemotaxis without impairing T-cell function. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of maraviroc combined with standard
      graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies after
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA-Unrelated or HLA-Mismatched Related donors.
      Based on the results of our previously small sample study with maraviroc combined with
      cyclosporine/tacrolimus and methotrexate for prophylaxis of GVHD, the investigators plan to
      perform the clinical trail.

    <description>Maraviroc administration (in addition to the standard prophylaxis therapy of cyclosporine/tacrolimus and methotrexate) will start on day -2 and will end on day +30 after stem cell transplant, making the total number of days of drug administration 33 days. Maraviroc will be administered 300mg twice daily orally.</description>

    <description>Cyclosporine will be given intravenously at a dose of 2-3 mg/kg starting Day -1. Subsequent dosing will be based on blood levels. Patients were advanced to oral cyclosporine once they could tolerate. The dose should be adjusted accordingly to maintain a suggested target serum level of 150-250 ng/mL. In the absence of aGVHD, the oral cyclosporine dose was reduced by approximately 5% weekly, beginning on or near day 100, and therapy was usually discontinued by Day 180 after transplantation or relapse.</description>

Subsequent dosing should be adjusted accordingly to maintain a suggested target serum level of 5-10 ng/mL. Tacrolimus taper can be initiated at a minimum of 100 days post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD. The rate of tapering will be done according institutional practices but patients should be off tacrolimus by Day 180 post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD.</description>
