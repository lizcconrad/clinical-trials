    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to detect antibodies to vitamin D in the serum at Different Groups
      of patients and healthy volunteer. A second goal is to find the relation between Vitamin D
      Antibody and Vitamin D level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D and its metabolites have a significant role in the calcium homeostasis and bone
      metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency as measured by serum 25(OH)D below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) may
      contribute to the development of osteoporosis and Osteomalacia.

      Several studies have clearly demonstrated that low 25(OH)D levels are associated with more
      comorbidities, higher estimated cardiovascular risk and autoimmune diseases.

      Exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) rays in sunlight is the major source of vitamin D. other
      sources are dairy products enriched with vitamin D.

      Vitamin D deficiency can result from inadequate exposure to sunlight, malabsorption including
      inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and patients undergone resection of the small
      intestine and inadequate intake of dairy products enriched with vitamin D.

      Another possible explanation for vitamin D deficiency is the presence of neutralizing
      autoantibodies to vitamin D.

      The aim of this study is to detect antibodies to vitamin D in the serum at Different Groups
      of patients and healthy volunteer

      At least 64 Blood samples of Patients and healthy volunteer will be tested for the presence
      of auto-antibodies using an ELISA reader.

      The result will compare antibody-positive and antibody-negative individuals with respect of
      serum 25(OH)D level and other variables and to find the relation between Vitamin D Antibody
      and Vitamin D level.
