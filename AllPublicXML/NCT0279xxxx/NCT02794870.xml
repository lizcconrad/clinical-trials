    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a
      single dose of a recombinant live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in
      RSV-seronegative infants 6 to 24 months of age.

      This study is a companion study to CIR 311.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower
      respiratory illness in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of a
      recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine, RSV LID ΔM2-2 1030s, in RSV-seronegative infants 6
      to 24 months of age.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV LID ΔM2-2 1030s
      vaccine or placebo (administered as nose drops) at study entry (Day 0).

      Participants will be enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 14, outside of the RSV
      season, and will remain on study until they complete the post-RSV season visit between April
      1 and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Total study duration is between 6
      to 10 months, depending on when participants enroll in the study. Participants will attend
      several study visits throughout the study, and the visits may include blood collection, nasal
      washes, and physical examinations. Participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by
      study staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.
