  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a placebo controlled, double blind, randomized phase II dose-response study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of BF-200 ALA (containing the active ingredient 5 -
      aminolevulinic acid- ALA) used with photodynamic therapy (PDT) in patients with actinic
      keratosis (AK).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was performed to define the effective therapeutic dose of the active pharmaceutical
      ingredient (ALA) in a nanoemulsion formulation in the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK)
      with topical PDT and to assess the efficacy of topical PDT with a new nanoemulsion
      formulation of ALA in the treatment of AK. The efficacy of BF-200 ALA was calculated by the
      AK clearance rate, defined as the proportion of AK lesions showing complete remission 12
      weeks after PDT treatment.

      Subjects of two study centres provided plasma and urine samples for the quantification of ALA
      and its metabolite, the active photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX).

The cosmetic outcome at the end-of-study visit will be calculated on the basis of the skin quality assessment (skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled or irregular pigmentation, degree of scarring, and atrophy. The cosmetic outcome is rated as very good if the sum score of the previously mentioned ratings (all ratings for each sign added up) at a given visit has improved by at least 2 points as compared to baseline; the cosmetic outcome is rated as good if the sum score at a given visit has improved by at least 1 point as compared to baseline; the cosmetic outcome is rated as satisfactory if the sum score at a given visit is identical to the one at baseline; the cosmetic outcome is rated as unsatisfactory if the sum score at a given visit has worsened by 1 point compared to baseline, the cosmetic outcome is rated as impaired if the sum score at a given visit has worsened by at least 2 points compared to baseline.</description>
