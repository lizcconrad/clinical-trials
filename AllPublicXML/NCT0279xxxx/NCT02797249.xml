  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preeclampsia is one of the three leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality all over
      the world. The use of low dose aspirin has been mentioned in several studies with promising
      results. The investigators decided to evaluate the use of low dose aspirin in Chinese
      pregnant women, starting between 12+ and 20 weeks of pregnancy, based on clinical
      characteristics aiming to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia.

      Detailed Description:

      The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial to estimate the efficacy of low
      dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in Chinese pregnant women who are evaluated with risk
      factors. The investigators will also obtain biological specimen including maternal blood,
      cord blood, placenta specimen and etc. for basic science studies.

      Rationale for Design:There is a lack of evidences or guideline of aspirin using in preventing
      PE for Chinese women. The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial, which is the
      'gold standard' of research design, hoping to answer the question.
