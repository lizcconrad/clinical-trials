    <textblock>
      This is clinical feasibility study on the device performance with paediatric patients. The
      main objective is to validate the performance of investigational device in distinguishing and
      identifying the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inside the subarachnoid space during a lumbar
      puncture on paediatric patients.

    <description>Measurement device indicates with a sound and visual feedback when needle reaches cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Physician verifies the location by removing the needle stylet and testing whether CSF flows from the needle, similarly as in traditional process. Detection is true positive if CSF flows from the needle and false positive if not. Even if the device does not detect CSF, physician performs the CSF test when needed. Physician marks to the case report form whether the device provided detections during the lumbar puncture and were the detections true or false detections.</description>

    <description>Injeq IQ-Needle is a spinal needle that has bioimpedance measurement capability. It consists of traditional needle cannulae and removable bioimpedance probe which enables the measurement of bioimpedance. The needle is connected to measurement device and tissue identifying algorithm. Bioimpedance is measured during the operation and the algorithm detects when the needle tip is in contact with cerebrospinal fluid.</description>
