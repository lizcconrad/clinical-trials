      Analysis of freely circulating DNA in liquid biopsies using the BEAMing method
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of freely circulating DNA in liquid biopsies using the BEAMing method is proposed as
      a technique that may be useful for analysing the RAS mutation status in different types of
      cancer. However, first it is necessary to evaluate the concordance between the results
      obtained in tumour samples and liquid biopsies.

      Primary objective

      • To evaluate the RAS mutation status at baseline in liquid biopsies in subjects with RAS
      wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the appearance of new RAS mutations using liquid biopsies at the moment of
           disease progression.

        -  To evaluate the appearance of new RAS mutations using liquid biopsies prior to
           radiological documentation of disease progression.
