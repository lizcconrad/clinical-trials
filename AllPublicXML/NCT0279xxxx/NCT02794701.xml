      Objectives: This study aims to explore the risk profiles among people with silicosis in Hong
      Kong underpinned by the Pittsburgh Mind-Body Center model.

      Design and subjects: This study will adopt a cross-sectional study design with sampling
      stratified by participants' degree of incapability. 320 Chinese people diagnosed with
      silicosis and registered with the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Fund Board will be recruited.

      Data collection: A demographic data sheet and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire will
      be used to collect the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants.
      The behavioral factors (smoking, drinking, physical activity level, consumption of vegetable
      and fruits and plasma vitamin C level) as well as the psychological risk factors (anxiety and
      depressive symptoms, and social support) will be examined by validated questionnaires.
      Biological and physiological parameters, including insulin resistance, C-reactive protein,
      hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose and lipid profiles, will be ascertained by fasting blood
      sample.

      Data analysis and expected outcomes: The findings of this study will create the database
      profile of the physical, psychosocial and disease specific aspects among people with
      silicosis in Hong Kong, subsequently forming the empirical basis of an intervention to tackle
      the identified modifiable risks among them.
