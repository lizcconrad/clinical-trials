  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the therapeutic response by modern FMRI and PET techniques with the
      perspective to exploit multimodal data (fusion MRI/PET). The Sponsor would like to optimize
      the respective performances and to define the early assessment criteria, at the first detox,
      of the treatment efficacy, with and without antiangiogenic agent.
