      Investigate the bioavailability of the main flavonoid, their colonic transformation and
      untargeted metabolites by an metabolomic approach following acute intake of a grumixama juice
      by humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The grumixama is a sweet and little cherry native of the South and Southeast regions of the
      Atlantic Forest of Brazil rich in phenolic compounds, mainly anthocyanins and ellagitannins.
      The objective of this study is Investigate the bioavailability of the main flavonoid, their
      colonic transformation and untargeted metabolites by an metabolomic approach following acute
      intake of a grumixama juice by humans.

      Fifteen healthy subjects consumed grumixama juice at single dose, and urine and plasma
      samples were collected at different time points over 24 h period. The metabolites were
      analyzed by LC-ESI-MSn, LC-Q-TOF plasma and urine were also analyzed using untargeted
      metabolomic approach for amino acids and organic acids by GCMS.

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The samples were collected as describe in &quot;Arms and Interventions&quot;, but for urine samples were used only the samples collected at times 0 (before the juice intake), 0-1h, 1-2h, 2-4h and at 24h after intake. The plasma samples had their proteins precipitated with cold methanol, the metabolites were extracted, concentrated and the amino acids and organic acids were derivatized to became volatile and the samples were analyzed by GCMS. For urine samples the procedures were similar. The mass fragment profile of derivatized compounds were compared to a GCMS library.</description>

    <measure>Cycle cell analysis in breast cancer cells treated with metabolites extracted from plasma and urine of 10 healthy volunteers after grumixama juice intake</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma and urine preparations were obtained by SPE extraction were dried and tested against breast cancer cells (MDA-MB 231) MDA-MB 231 cells were cultured in monolayer on Dulbecco Eagle modified culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, it was used 5x10-4 cells per well. The cells were incubated in a humidified chamber including 5% CO2 at 37ºC into a confluence of approximately 80%. Cells were further exposed to 200 mg/mL of urine and plasma extract preparations and phenolic compound standards (PCA, VA, HA, C3G) at 0.25 and 25 mg/mL, and maintained at 37ºC, under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 48 hours. Negative control was supplied with growth media and DMSO, and blank wells containing growth media only.
The cells were lysed, the RNA were degraded and the DNA were marked with propidium iodide (1mg/mL) and the fluorescence was measure by flow cytometer and the cell cycle analysis were done by FlowJo. The results were expressed in % of cell for each cell cycle phase.</description>

    <description>The peak intensity of each compound identified by GCMS were normalized by using a internal standards (D4-alanine). For urine these data also were normalized by creatinine values to normalize sample volume. Multivariate data analysis were done observe changes in these metabolites (amino acids and organic acids) during the 24h after grumixama juice intake. The data were analyzed by MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (http://www.metaboanalyst.ca/).</description>

It was made with filtered water and sanitized fruits, with a blender. It was administered in single dose of 0.97 mg of anthocyanins and of 4.71 mg of ellagitannins per mL of juice. Which volunteers ingested 10 mL of juice per each Kg body weight.
