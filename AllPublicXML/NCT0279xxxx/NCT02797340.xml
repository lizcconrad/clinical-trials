    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the pharmacokinetics of metformin in heart failure patients in acute and
      chronic state in relation to metformin transporter genotypes. Participants have heart failure
      and type 2 diabetes treated with metformin.

      Hypothesis:

      Primary: The renal clearance of metformin is decreased in acute state of congestive heart
      failure compared with chronic state.

      Secondary: Metformin trough values in HF patients are influenced by polymorphisms in
      transporter genes relevant to the pharmacokinetics of metformin.

    <textblock>
      Background: Heart failure (HF) is a common disease and diabetes/insulin resistance are
      present in approximately 50 % of HF patients. Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral
      anti-diabetic drug, and a huge inter-individual variability in trough steady-state metformin
      concentration in type 2 diabetics have been demonstrated. Genetic polymorphisms in metformin
      transporter genes are likely to have a direct impact on metformin pharmacokinetics and
      variability in drug responses, but the influence of polymorphisms in these transporter genes
      on circulating metformin levels is presently unknown in HF patients.

      Objectives:

      A) To compare the pharmacokinetics of metformin in 12 diabetic patients with HF in acute and
      chronic state.

      B) To investigate the influence of polymorphisms in genes encoding the metformin transporter
      proteins on metformin trough levels in 150 diabetic HF patients.

      Design: An open, single-center study enrolling 12 patients with acute heart failure (study A)
      and 150 patients with stable chronic heart failure (study B). The participants have diabetes
      already treated with metformin prior to inclusion. Through repeated blood draws, the
      concentration of metformin will be determined along with genotyping for metformin transporter
      genes.

      Primary outcome:

      Study A: Changes in renal clearance of metformin between patients with acute and chronic
      heart failure.

      Study B: Mean trough steady-state concentrations of metformin with emphasis on the
      intra-interindividual variability in HF patients.
