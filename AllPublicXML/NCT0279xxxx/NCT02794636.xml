      The primary objective of this study is to quantify and compare the prevalence of adverse
      events (AEs) in patients with stage III melanoma before and after initiation of interferon
      (IFN) therapy in a real-world setting. A secondary objective is to quantify annual costs and
      resource utilization before and after IFN initiation among patients with stage III melanoma
      in a real-world setting.

    <description>Adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients identified as having stage III melanoma and no other primary or secondary cancer who initiated treatment with IFN between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2011.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a pharmacy claim for IFN between 1/1/2007 and 12/31/2011. The date of
             the first observed claim will be defined as the index date

          -  Patients with a melanoma diagnosis based on two medical claims prior to the index date

          -  Patients with a procedure code for melanoma-related lymph node dissection before the
             index date

          -  Patients ≥ 18 years of age on or before the index date

          -  Patients with continuous benefit enrollment for at least 180 days before and after the
             index date

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with diagnosis of any other (primary) cancer during the 180-day pre-index
             period (excepting skin cancers and hematologic malignancies)

          -  Patients with diagnosis of a secondary cancer during the 180-day pre-index period or
             on the index date (excepting lymph node metastasis to a site common for melanoma or an
             improbable site for any other primary cancer)

          -  Patients who received systemic chemotherapy during the pre- or post-index period
