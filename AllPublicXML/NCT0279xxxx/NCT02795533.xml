  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a continuation of the study &quot;Effect of early rehabilitation in patients
      with acute aSAH&quot; which was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics,
      South-East Norway, archive number 2011/2189, Clinical Trials number 0925-0586 (Clinical
      Trials gov. identifier NCT01656317). The original study was a prospective, controlled,
      interventional study comprising patients managed at the neuro-intermediate ward following
      repair of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm in 2011-2012. 157 patients signed the informed
      consent form and were included in the study. Patients were assessed in the acute phase, as
      well as a 3 and 12 months post ictus. The main research goal of the present study will be to
      assess physical, cognitive and emotional function 5 and 10 years after aSAH in the 2011-2012
      population. In addition we will also describe quality of life and work-status along with the
      time-course of recovery from the acute sage after aSAH to the chronic phase.
