      Many people is afraid of dental treatment specially local anesthesia and do not refer to
      dental clinics until they are obliged due to dental pain. There are so many articles in the
      literature about dental phobia and fear of anesthetic injection. Due to these evidences,
      dental people are supposed to show elevated psychological dimensions such as anxiety, and
      somatization.

      We are going to know which psychological dimensions of dental patients may be elevated when
      they refer to dental clinics.
