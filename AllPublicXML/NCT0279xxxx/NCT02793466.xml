      This clinical trial is the first clinical trial to study Durvalumab, a checkpoint inhibitor
      which stimulates the patient's own immune system to act against cancer cells in children and
      adolescents. This trial will assess the safety and tolerability of Durvalumab in children and
      adolescents and also study how Durvalumab is processed in their bodies.
