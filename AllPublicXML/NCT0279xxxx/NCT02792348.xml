  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the new-born, diagnosis and prognosis of congenital urine flow impairment (UFI) are
      difficult to confirm only with morphological examination (ultrasonography, intravenous
      pyelography) and functional examination (dynamic renal scan MAG3). Only the test of time
      allows the post confirmation of a significant UFI requiring a surgery. This meant that the
      actual therapeutic indications are imperfect by the absence of an &quot;absolute&quot; endpoint for
      UFI.

      The objective of the study is to characterize the urinary metabolomics profile of new born
      with renal pelvis and/or ureters tract dilatation (suspicion of pelvi-ureteric junction
      anomalies, primary megaureter and vesico-ureteric reflux), detected by prenatal
      ultrasonography, by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and metabolomics analysis. This
      characterization will allow the identification of statistically significant metabolomics
      markers for the diagnosis and prognosis of a favourable evolution of the anomaly. The
      evolution with time of these metabolomics profiles will also considered.

    <time_frame>Urine samples of patients will be collected at recruitment time (Day 0).</time_frame>
    <description>Urine will be stored at _80 _C before acquisition of the NMR data. Urine samples will be thawed at room temperature before use. 400µL of supernatant will be diluted with 200 µL of a buffer solution Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH = 7.4; 20% D2O/H2O v.v, internal reference: 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic,2-2-3-3-d4 acid) in Eppendorf tubes. Each sample will be centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C at 12,000 g. Finally, 550 µL will be transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for analysis. Standard 1H 1D NMR pulse sequences, NOESY and CPMG with water presaturation, will be applied on each sample to obtain corresponding metabolic profiles. In addition, 2D NMR experiments (1H-1H TOCSY or 1H-13C HSQC, and 1H J-Resolved) will be recorded to achieve structural assignment of the metabolic signals.</description>
