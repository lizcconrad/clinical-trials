    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of different doses of specially prepared T
      cells collected from the blood. The investigators want to find a safe dose of these modified
      T cells for patients who have metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.

    <description>We have designed the dose-escalation using a standard 3+3 design. In this design, patients will be treated in sequential groups of 3 to 6 patients per T cell dose. With 4 dose levels, the projected trial size for this study is a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 24 patients.</description>

    <description>A single blood volume leukapheresis for harvesting of PBMCs will be performed, As the transduced T cells will be frozen, the timing of leukapheresis is not defined &amp; can vary from patient to patient. Subsequently, a single dose of mesothelin-targeted T cells will be infused via intravenous catheter or central line (i.e., mediport). Patients will be monitored in the hospital and discharged home after a minimum of 48 hours. Patients will be monitored closely as outpatients for the next 2 months. Patients will be followed weekly as outpatients for the first 8 weeks after treatment. All patients will be hydrated intravenously, premedicated with acetaminophen &amp; diphenhydramine, &amp; administered cyclophosphamide at 1.5 g/m2 2 to 7 days (Day -7 to Day -2) before administration of mesothelin-targeted T cells.</description>

             defined by the following:

               -  HER2 negative (in cases of mixed HER2 results, the most recent pathology results
                  considered reflective of the active cancer will be considered)

               -  Previously treated with at least 1 chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease
                  and documented progression

          -  Chemotherapy, targeted therapy (such as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), or radiotherapy
             must have been completed at least 14 days before administration of T-cells. Prior
             immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade (i.e., PD1 inhibitor, PDL1 inhibitor, or
             CTL4-antagonist or similar agent) must have been completed more than 1 month before
             the T-cell infusion.

             *Chemotherapy must have been completed at least 7 days prior to leukapheresis

          -  Any major operation must have occurred at least 28 days before study enrollment.

          -  All acute toxic effects of any previous radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or surgical
             procedures must have resolved to grade 1 or lower according to CTCAE

          -  Lab requirements (hematology):

               -  White blood cell (WBC) count ≥3000 cells/mm^3

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500 neutrophils/mm^3

               -  Platelet count ≥100,000 platelets/mm^3

          -  Lab requirements (serum chemistry):

               -  Serum alanine aminotransferase/serum aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) &lt;2.5x
                  ULN; for patients with liver metastases, ALT/AST &lt;5x ULN is acceptable.

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;1.5x ULN or Cr &gt;1.5x ULN, but calculated clearances of &gt;60

          -  Negative screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             antigen, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). If testing was performed during the previous 3
             months, there is no need to repeat testing, as long as documentation of results is
             provided to the study site. Subjects must receive counseling and sign a separate
             informed consent form for HIV testing.
