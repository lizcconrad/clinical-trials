  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is one of the most underestimated
      complications of breast cancer treatment with a reported incidence of 30% to 40% after
      axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and 7% after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).
      Although the axillary treatment regimens are changing with a focus on less aggressive
      axillary treatment in order to reduce morbidity without compromising survival, BCRL will
      still remain a relevant problem in the future.

      Objective: To improve breast cancer survivorship by reducing/eliminating one of the most
      debilitating upper-body morbidities related to breast cancer treatment: chronic lymphedema of
      the arm.

      Study design: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) carried out in the Maastricht
      University Medical Center, VieCuri Medical Center and Zuyderland Medical Center in the
      Netherlands.

      Study population: The study population includes all women over 18 years old who underwent
      surgical treatment for early stage breast cancer with an SLNB or ALND, or who received
      axillary radiotherapy, presenting with an early stage lymphedema of the arm (stage 1 and 2a
      on the ISL classification for lymphedema).

      Intervention: In this RCT patients are randomized over two arms: the first group will
      continue standard of care conservative lymphedema therapy, while the second group will
      undergo lymphaticovenous anastomoses (LVA) by a plastic surgeon.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are the difference in excess limb
      volume (ELV) after one of both treatments, the effect of treatment on the quality of life and
      the cost-effectiveness of both treatments.

      Study-specific procedures: After randomization the follow-up moments will be at 3, 6, 9, 12,
      18 and 24 months. A follow-up moment includes an interview and a medical examination. During
      this examination, the upper limbs will be assessed for sensory, motor, strength and mobility
      changes. Furthermore, the investigators will measure the volume of the treated and untreated
      side using the water displacement method and circumference measurement. A lymphoscintigraphy
      is made at inclusion, after 12 months and after 24 months. Lastly, the subjects will be asked
      at certain time points to fill in five questionnaires: Lymph-ICF, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC
      QLQ-BR23, EQ-5D-5L and the DASH questionnaire.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life will be measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, resulting in an index score for the change in quality of life between 0 and 1. This index score will also be used to calculate quality-adjusted life years.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life will be measured using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, resulting in a score for the quality of life between 0 to 100. The results after twelve months can be compared to the baseline quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness of LVA compared to complex decongestive therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A trial-based economic evaluation is performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of LVA compared to complex decongestive therapy from the societal perspective. Cost data is collected on the patient-level and includes health care related costs, costs to patient and family, and costs due to lost productivity. The primary outcome measure for the effects is the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Cost-effectiveness is expressed in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (i.e. cost per QALY gained). In addition, a Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) will be performed from a budget holder perspective.</description>

    <description>LVA is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia. Indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography is used to visualize the (obstructed) lymphatic vessels. When using the images as a guide, the lymphatic pathways and the sites for incisions for lymphaticovenous anastomoses are marked with a pen. The patient's limb is then prepared for surgery. Under a surgical microscope the lymphatic vessels are identified and viable lymphatic vessels are anastomosed to similarly sized adjacent recipient venules in the subdermal plane.</description>
