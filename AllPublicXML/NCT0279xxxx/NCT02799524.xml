      The objective of this study is to evaluate the scales commonly used in geriatrics and
      oncology distress thermometer ( analogue scale rated from 0 to 1 for the emotional distress )
      , the GDS15 (15 issues closed binary response seeking signs of depression ) the HADS (14
      questions assessing the intensity of anxiety signs and signs of depression listed 0-3 ).

      The prospective observational study will be conducted in parallel on two sites ( University
      Hospital Centre and François Baclesse ) after informed patient information.

      It will be offered to patients 70 years and over with a new diagnosis or relapse of cancer or
      haematological malignancies in the hospital to meet the mood disorder screening
      questionnaires .

      There are various tools validated and recommended by the SiO and SFPO for screening mood
      disorders in geriatric oncology . The choice among them depends on the usual practices of the
      various teams , only some scales assessing depressive signs and other signs of anxiety too.
      None were assessed in a population aged diagnosis of cancer or hematologic malignancy in pre-
      therapeutic situation.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the scales commonly used in geriatrics and
      oncology distress thermometer ( analogue scale rated from 0 to 1 for the emotional distress )
      , the GDS15 (15 issues closed binary response seeking signs of depression ) the HADS (14
      questions assessing the intensity of anxiety signs and signs of depression listed 0-3 ) The
      prospective observational study will be conducted in parallel on two sites ( University
      Hospital Centre and François Baclesse ) after informed patient information.

      It will be offered to patients 70 years and over with a new diagnosis or relapse of cancer or
      haematological malignancies in the hospital to meet the mood disorder screening
      questionnaires .

      If one test is abnormal , a clinical psychological care will be offered . When returning home
      : telephone contact will be made the same day with the doctor , asking him to please make
      thymic revaluation within 2 weeks ( informed patient). It will be sent to the doctor by post
      a rubric of Major Depressive Episode criteria of the DSM V to return . If the patient remains
      hospitalized , the doctor taking care of patient will be contacted to obtain the same
      information .

      In addition, the investigators will study the impact on the management (change or
      introduction of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic use of psychotherapy or psychological
      counseling ... ) to 5 weeks
