      This is a multi-center, single arm Phase II study of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
      using human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched unrelated bone marrow transplantation donors
      and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy), sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
      for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in patients with hematologic malignancies.

               3. Hepatic: total bilirubin ≤ 2.5 mg/dL, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
                  aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt; 5 x upper
                  limit of (ULN) (unless disease related)

               4. Renal: serum creatinine (SCr) within normal range for age (see table 2.3). If SCr
                  is outside normal range for age, creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73m2
                  must be obtained (measured by 24-hour (hr) urine specimen or nuclear glomerular
                  filtration rate (GFR), or calculated GFR (by Cockcroft-Gault formula for those
                  aged ≥ 18 years; by Original Schwartz estimate for those &lt; 18 years))

          7. Subjects ≥ 18 years of age must have the ability to give informed consent according to
             applicable regulatory and local institutional requirements. Legal guardian permission
             must be obtained for subjects &lt; 18 years of age. Pediatric subjects will be included
             in age appropriate discussion in order to obtain assent.

          8. Subjects with documentation of confirmed HIV-1 infection (i.e. HIV-positive), and a
             hematologic malignancy who meets all other eligibility requirements must:

               1. Receive only RIC regimen (i.e. Regimen A)

               2. Be willing to comply with effective antiretroviral therapy (ARV)

               3. Have achieved a sustained virologic response for 12 weeks after cessation of
                  hepatitis C antiviral treatment (in HIV-positive subjects with hepatitis C)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. HLA-matched related or 8/8 allele matched (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1) unrelated donor
             available. This exclusion does not apply to HIV-positive subjects who have a
             CCR5delta32 homozygous donor.

          2. Autologous HCT &lt; 3 months prior to the time of signing the informed consent form

          3. Females who are breast-feeding or pregnant

          4. HIV-positive subjects:

               1. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) related syndromes or symptoms that may
                  pose an excessive risk for transplantation-related morbidity as determined by the
                  Treatment Review Committee (see Appendix D).

               2. Untreatable HIV infection due to multidrug ARV resistance. Subjects with a
                  detectable or standard viral load &gt; 750 copies/mL should be evaluated with an HIV
                  drug resistance test (HIV-1 genotype). The results should be included as part of
                  the ARV review (described in Appendix D).

               3. May not be currently prescribed ritonavir, cobacistat and/or zidovudine

          5. Current uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection (currently taking medication
             with evidence of progression of clinical symptoms or radiologic findings)

          6. Prior allogeneic HCT

          7. History of primary idiopathic myelofibrosis

          8. MDS subjects may not receive RIC and must be &lt; 50 years of age at the time of signing
             the informed consent form

          9. Subjects may not be eligible for inclusion in Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical
