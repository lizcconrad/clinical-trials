      The purpose of this study is to determine whether estrogen may help reduce fear of high
      calorie-density foods in weight-restored women with Anorexia Nervosa (AN).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Electrodermal skin conductance activity (EDA) during a test meal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day 1) and post-treatment (day 21)</time_frame>
    <description>Meal-related anxiety will be estimated from EDA recordings during a 90 minute test meal session pre- and post-treatment (day 1 and day 21). EDA will be reported as the rate of peaks (&gt;0.02 microsiemens) per second and the average skin conductance level (in microsiemens).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate variability during a test meal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day 1) and post-treatment (day 21)</time_frame>
    <description>Variability in heart rate will be measured by the variation in interpeak (beat-to-beat) interval during the 90 minute test meal session pre- and post- treatment (day 1 and day 21).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective ratings of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day 1) and post-treatment (day 21)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scales will be used to assess self-report anxiety at multiple points (time 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 50 min, 70 min and 90 min) during the 90 minute test meal session pre- and post-treatment (day 1 and day 21).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary cortisol concentration during a test meal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (day 1) and post-treatment (day 21)</time_frame>
    <description>The concentration of salivary cortisol will be assessed at multiple points (time 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 50 min, 70 min and 90 min) during the test meal session. Test meals occur twice during the entire length of the study on day 1 and day 21. The cortisol response will be reported as area under the curve.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria (AN):

          -  Previous diagnosis of recent AN with BMI of &lt;18.5 (within past year)

          -  Current BMI &gt; 19.0 and &lt; 23.0 kg/m2

          -  Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea

        Inclusion Criteria (Healthy Controls):

          -  BMI &gt; 19 &lt; 23 kg/m2

          -  Taking hormone-based contraceptives for a period of one month or more

          -  Eating disorders symptom scores within one standard deviation of healthy controls

        Exclusion Criteria (AN):

          -  Any medical or psychiatric problem requiring urgent medical or psychiatric attention,
             including acute suicidality

          -  History of breast cancer, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial
             infarction or stroke, diabetes, liver disease, known thrombophilic disease

          -  Currently taking estrogen or progesterone medication

          -  Tobacco use greater than 1 pack per week

          -  Use of St. John's Wort, Phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, and
             dexamethasone can all decrease plasma estrogen level because they are CYP3A4 inducers.
             Cimetidine, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and
             grapefruit juice as these may increase plasma estrogen, potentially increasing the
             presence of side effects

          -  Pregnant, lactating or unwilling to use appropriate birth control (which may include
             abstinence) to prevent pregnancy for the duration of study participation (i.e. up to 4
             weeks)

          -  Allergy to estradiol or medroxyprogesterone or ingredients in food items used for test
             meals

          -  Undiagnosed, abnormal vaginal bleeding

        Exclusion Criteria (Healthy Controls):

          -  Ever diagnosed with an Eating Disorder

          -  Any medical or psychiatric problem requiring urgent medical or psychiatric attention,
             including acute suicidality

          -  Pregnant, lactating or unwilling to use appropriate birth control (which may include
             abstinence) to prevent pregnancy for the duration of study participation (i.e. up to 4
             weeks)

          -  Food allergies to items in the test meal
