  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the effect of an early induced hypernatremia
      protocol (150-155 milliequivalent/L) versus normonatremia plus mannitol (135 - 145
      milliequivalent/L) in terms of neurologic outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain
      injury managed at critical care unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe traumatic brain injury is one of the main causes of death in young people.
      Additionally, it is considered a public health problem because of the high prevalence of
      motor and cognitive dysfunction in those who survive.

      One of the cornerstones of management is the control of both intracranial pressure and brain
      edema. It is indicated to use osmotic active solutions to modulate the transit of fluids from
      the interstitial to the intracellular space. Not only mannitol but also hypertonic saline
      acts at this point. Currently there is no evidence in favor or against one of them.

      Mannitol has been usually recommended for intracranial pressure control in patients with
      brain trauma. However, others recommend hypertonic saline to achieve a serum sodium level of
      160 milliequivalent/L to modulate brain edema. It is not clear if these therapies have an
      impact on the neurologic prognosis and how frequently adverse effects occur.

    <description>The Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) is a global scale for functional outcome that rates patients into eight categories. The categories of severe disability, moderate disability and good recovery are subdivided into a lower and upper category. The scale will be used to evaluate the patient through a phone interview at 6 months of the trauma occurred. The structured interview contains nineteen specific questions which determine upper or lower levels of disability.</description>

    <description>Acute kidney injury (KDIGO criteria). The criteria for acute kidney injury(AKI) are based on changes in serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output.
Stage I : Increase in SCr more than 1.5 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days OR increase in SCr more than 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours OR urine output &lt;0.5 ml/kg/h for 6-12h.
Stage II : Increase in SCr between 2.0 - 2.9 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days OR urine output &lt;0.5 ml/kg/h for more than 12 hours.
Stage III : Increase more than 3.0 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days OR Increase in serum creatinine to 4.0 mg/dL OR Initiation of renal-replacement therapy OR urine output &lt;0.3 ml/kg/h for more than 24 hours OR Anuria for more than 12 hours.</description>

If after 4 doses of 7.5% sodium chloride the serum sodium is below the target, a bolus of 1 ml/kg of 12% sodium chloride will be used every 4 hours. The goal of serum sodium will be maintained for 48 hours.</description>

Mannitol 100 ml every 4 hours for the first three days; 80 ml every 4 hours the fourth day; 60 ml every 4 hours the fifth day and 40 ml every 4 hours the sixth day and then stopping. The mannitol protocol will be interrupted at any moment if serum sodium is below 135, the systolic blood pressure is below 90 mmHg or the patient has signs of hypovolemia. In this case, 2 ml/kg of 3% sodium chloride every 4 hours will be used until the target of serum sodium is achieved and both, normovolemic state and blood pressure are restored. In addition, the mannitol protocol will be suspended when serum osmolality is above 320.</description>
