  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the increased incidence of cervical cancer observed in
      Appalachian women over their non-Appalachian counterparts is due in part to inherited and
      somatic alterations of key components of the Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) signaling
      pathway.

      This project is a case control study that is designed to determine prevalence of inherited
      polymorphic and somatically acquired variants of key TGF-ß pathway components in a large
      cohort of Appalachian invasive cervical cancer (ICC) patients compared to healthy Appalachian
      women. It will be determined whether these genetic alterations contribute individually or in
      combination with other known environmental (Human Papillomavirus, Epstein-Barr Virus),
      behavioral (smoking), and social (stress, social networks) risk factors, to the increased
      susceptibility of Appalachian women to ICC development. Women will be recruited from several
      clinics and physician practices in West Virginia, Charleston and Appalachia Ohio and
      Kentucky. Participants will be women residing in these area who are 18 years and older, not
      pregnant, speak English, not cognitively impaired and able to provide informed consent. There
      will be three distinct types of women recruited into the study; 1. ARM 1 - previously treated
      for invasive cervical cancer; 2. ARM 2 - newly diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer; and
      3. healthy controls - without a diagnosis of cervical cancer.

        cervical cancer cases; and 3) healthy controls (women without a diagnosis of any type of
