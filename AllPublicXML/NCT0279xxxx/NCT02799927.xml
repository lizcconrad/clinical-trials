      Objective: The study's main purpose is to evaluate and compare the clinical and radiographic
      outcomes of Biodentine and a light-activated calcium hydroxide based-liner (Ultra-Blend
      plus®) as indirect pulp treatment (IPT) liners, over the dentin-pulp complex of vital primary
      molars with carious lesions approaching the pulp. Study design: 80 four-to-eight year-old
      patients were enrolled from a Mexican University Pediatric Dentistry Clinic. A split-mouth
      design trial is being conducted in order to compare both IPT interventions on 160 bilateral
      primary teeth, without signs or symptoms of irreversibly inflamed or degenerative pulp
      tissue. Teeth were treated and restored with a preformed crown in a single session, and then
      closely followed-up for 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

      A Split-mouth clinical trial was the design selected. Clinical Procedures: IPT procedures
      were carried out by three pediatric dentistry residents (E.K.C.G., R.A.V.V., and J.M.A.R.),
      previously trained in the clinical setting with a pilot sample of 10 similar child patients
      each. Study participants received local anesthesia and rubber dam isolation, which was
      disinfected, followed by the remove of the carious peripheral dentin with high speed
      tungsten-carbide bur # 3, and air-water spray. Then, the soft dentin layer was carefully
      removed with a sharply-edged sterilized hand excavator, based on tactile and visual
      standards, leaving only the hard dentin adjacent to the pulp ceiling. The cavity was
      thoroughly rinsed only with water and then dried with sterilized cotton pellets; no other
      special disinfection protocol was applied. The next step consisted in the placement of the
      correspondent liner over the remanent carious dentin layer, following the manufacturers'
      instructions, and according to the randomly assignment scheme previously described. In the
      case of the control group, the liner was cured undr 20 seconds of light exposure. All treated
      molar were restored with stainless steel preformed crowns (3M ESPE) cemented with glass
      ionomer (Ketac-Cem, 3M ESPE). One week later, the same procedure was repeated in the opposite
      tooth with the contrary IPT agent.

    <description>Biodentine (Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fosses, France) has been recently introduced and marketed as a bioactive dentin substitute. The Biodentine powder contains tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate and calcium oxide, while its liquid consists of calcium chloride and a carboxylate-based hydrosoluble polymer (water-reducing agent).
After local anesthesia and rubber dam isolation, carious peripheral dentin is eliminated with a high speed tungsten-carbide bur # 3, and air-water spray. Then, the cavity's floor soft dentin layer is carefully removed with a sharply-edged sterilized hand excavator, leaving only the hard dentin adjacent to the pulp ceiling. The cavity is thoroughly rinsed only with water and dried with sterilized cotton pellets. The next step consists in the preparation of Biodentine liner (a mix of powder and liquid), following the manufacturers' instructions, and its placement over the remanent carious dentin layer.</description>

    <description>Ultra-Blend plus® (Ultradent Products Inc., South Jordan, UT, USA). This material is a light-activated calcium hydroxide based-liner. Calcium hydroxide has demonstrated to reduce and promote immediate deactivation of the residual microorganisms after IPT.
