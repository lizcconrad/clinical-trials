      1. To assess dynamics of the T-lymphocytes subpopulations in patients peripheral blood
           during 12 weeks of TAB08 treatment.

        2. To assess dynamics of selected cytokines levels in patients peripheral blood during 12
           weeks of TAB08 treatment.

        3. To assess TAB08 concentrations in patients blood during 12 weeks of TAB08 treatment.

        4. To assess frequency, seriousness and severity of adverse events during 12 weeks of TAB08
           treatment.

        5. To assess changes in PASI, IGA and DLQI during 12 weeks of TAB08 treatment and
           subsequent 4 weeks follow-up.
