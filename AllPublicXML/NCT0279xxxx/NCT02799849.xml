  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant weight gain and obesity are observed for most patients with narcolepsy, mainly
      at the beginning of the disease and narcolepsy in young children. There is no specific study
      on the population and the consequences of overweight in the lives of these long-term
      patients. Narcoleptic patients gain weight significantly at the onset of their illness. It is
      also known that weight gain is not related to the treatment of narcolepsy. The etiology of
      obesity in narcoleptic patients is not established. Several assumptions were made (physical
      activity, leptin diet, metabolism). The reason and the pathophysiology of overweight and
      obesity in this population therefore remain unclear.

      In this study, potential change in the total metabolism (24h) for narcoleptic children that
      could explain their tendency to obesity will be assessed ?
