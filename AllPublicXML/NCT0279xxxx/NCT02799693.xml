  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm non-randomized prospective observational cohort study to assess the
      outcomes of patients undergoing intramural needle catheter ablation of recurrent ventricular
      tachycardia that has failed antiarrhythmic drug therapy and standard radiofrequency (RF)
      catheter ablation. Following ablation, patients will be monitored for 6 months. The duration
      of the study is up to 4 years.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational prospective cohort study of patients undergoing needle catheter
      ablation. Patients with recurrent sustained or incessant ventricular tachycardia who have
      recurrent monomorphic ventricular tachycardia that has failed antiarrhythmic drug therapy and
      prior catheter ablation who are undergoing intramural needle ablation for VT will be offered
      participation. Data will be collected during the procedure and during follow-up. Patients
      will be monitored in hospital for complications and during 6 months follow-up.

      Data Collection:

      Baseline Data: Baseline demographic information and a narrative medical history will be
      collected on all patients, including documentation of prior cardiac history, and arrhythmia
      history, as well as prior medications and cardiac procedures.

      Procedural data: Details of the procedure including both procedural methods and arrhythmias
      induced, ablation parameters, needle deployments, recordings and response to procedure.

      Followup data: Adverse events will be collected for events which are documented during
      enrollment and follow-up. During follow-up, hospitalizations will be collected, need for
      further procedures, implantable defibrillator therapies and procedures will be collected, as
      well as follow-up echocardiography findings.
