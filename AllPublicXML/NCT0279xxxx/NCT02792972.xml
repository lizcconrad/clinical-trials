  <brief_summary>

      Context: Research on natural products with therapeutic, analgesic or antimicrobial purpose
      should be encouraged to create new drugs. Acmella oleracea, typical plant of the Northern
      region of the country and popularly known as jambu, has aroused the interest of researchers
      because of its therapeutic potential. Objective: To evaluate the potential topical analgesic
      and antimicrobial of Acmella oleracea plant extract from the skin antisepsis in venipuncture
      procedures. Methods: This is a clinical, randomized, controlled trial with healthy volunteers
      recruited at the Clinic I of the collection of biological materials sector of the Hospital
      das Clinicas Samuel Libânio, in Pouso Alegre-MG. The plant extract A. oleracea manipulated
      with Transcutol® and 70% alcohol were used in the volunteers before the venipuncture
      procedure as allocation in study groups. Held collection of skin microbiota by the swab
      technique and the end of the venipuncture procedure was applied to the volunteer, the visual
      numeric scale (VNS) standard to determine the degree of pain.
