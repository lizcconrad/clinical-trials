      RATIONALE: Hand foot syndrome may be treated or reduced by soaking Traditional Chinese
      Medicine Formula LC09 in patients receiving capecitabine for colorectal and/or breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying soaking Traditional Chinese Medicine
      Formula LC09 to see how well they work compared to placebos in preventing hand-foot syndrome
      in patients who are receiving capecitabine for colorectal or breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      OBJECTIVES: Determine whether Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula LC09 can treat or reduce
      the severity of capecitabine-caused hand foot syndrome.

      Evaluate the potential toxicity of Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula LC09. OUTLINE: This
      is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are randomized
      to 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula LC09 by soaking their affected
      hand and feet 20 min twice daily.

      Arm II: Patients receive placebo by soaking their affected hand and feet 20 min twice daily.

               -  creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times the ULN

               -  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 ml/min (by Cockcroft-Gault)

          7. Ability to cooperate with HFS grade evaluation, understand and the willingness to sign
             a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are ineligible for study entry:

          1. Concurrent with level 1 or above peripheral neuropathy (such as diabetic neuropathy or
             chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy);

          2. Other acute or chronic inflammatory conditions or infections of the hands or feet that
             would complicate safety, application of topical creams, or study endpoints;

          3. Currently taking other treatment for PPE (including topical urea cream, pyridoxine,
             celecoxib, compound matrine injection and deproteinized calf blood extractive
             injection);

          4. History of severe or uncontrolled organic disease or infection, such as heart,
             pulmonary or renal failure that cause the termination of chemotherapy;

          5. Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or nursing women;

          6. Participating in other clinical trial currently or within 4 weeks.
