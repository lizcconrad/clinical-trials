  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether riluzole, a drug that increases
      glutamate reuptake, will decrease CNS glutamate in breast cancer survivors with increased
      inflammation and fatigue. We will also determine whether decreasing glutamate with riluzole
      will reverse inflammation-related fatigue and other symptoms including cognitive dysfunction
      and decreased motivation. To accomplish these goals, we plan to conduct an 8 week,
      double-blind, randomized control trial of riluzole (100 mg/d) versus placebo in 40 breast
      cancer survivors (n=20 per group). All breast cancer survivors will have completed treatment
      within 1-3 years and have a fatigue level of ≥4 (on a 10 point scale) and a plasma c-reactive
      protein (CRP) concentration &gt;3mg/L (indicative of high inflammation). Patients will undergo
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure CNS glutamate before and after 2 and 8 weeks
      of riluzole or placebo treatment. Fatigue and other behavioral assessments including measures
      of cognitive function and motivation will be conducted before and after treatment and
      correlated with the change in CNS glutamate.

      The primary objective of the proposed research is to provide the first data on the role of
      CNS glutamate and symptoms of fatigue in breast cancer patients using MRS and a medication
      that has been shown to lower CNS glutamate in animal models and human subjects. No previous
      study has examined the potential connection between increased inflammation, increased CNS
      glutamate and symptoms in breast cancer patients, although there is strong clinical and
      preclinical support for an important interrelationship among these variables. Identification
      of a significant relationship between increased CNS glutamate and symptoms will:

        -  Enable the development of inflammatory biomarkers to identify patients with altered CNS
           glutamate.

        -  Help focus future studies using glutamate stabilizing medications and glutamate
           antagonists on patients most likely to respond to glutamate-targeted therapies
           (personalization of trials and treatment).

        -  Expand treatment studies to include synergistic or sequential targeting of inflammation
           and glutamate to reduce symptom burden in breast cancer patients.

      This study will also serve as a foundation for efforts to link the impact of inflammatory
      cytokines and their relationship with increased CNS glutamate and behavior to a variety of
      cancers. Moreover, by testing novel treatment approaches (targeting glutamate), this study
      may ultimately improve the quality of life of breast cancer and other cancer patients.

    <time_frame>Baseline 1 visit and at 1 and 8 weeks of treatment (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a specialized technique associated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRS is a non-invasive way to obtain biochemical information about the tissues of the human body. Patients will undergo single voxel (3-dimensional volume X pixel) MRS to measure CNS glutamate before and after 1 and 8 weeks of riluzole or placebo treatment. Voxels will be placed in the right and left basal ganglia and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), well known targets of inflammatory cytokines on the brain, and cytokine effects on these brain regions have been associated with symptoms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunction as well as reduced motivation.</description>

    <measure>Change in score of the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) between riluzole and placebo arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 1 visit through end of treatment (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item scale used to evaluate the presence and severity of fatigue among subjects by self-reports. The MFI assesses 5 dimensions of fatigue, including general fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, reduced activity, and reduced motivation. Participants respond to fatigue related statements using a 5 point scale where 1 = &quot;yes, that is true&quot; and 5 = &quot;no, that is not true&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in score of the Promise-Fatigue Short Form (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 1 visit through end of treatment (up to 8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS-Fatigue Short Form is a 7-item scale developed by the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a part of the NIH Roadmap Initiative which is focused on developing a publicly available resource of standardized, accurate, and efficient outcome measures of symptoms, distress, and functioning. The criterion for a minimally clinically important difference in patients with advanced-stage cancer is a 3 to 5 point difference in raw score.37 Recommendations for high priority research on cancer-related fatigue recommend use of the PROMIS fatigue scale to allow comparison of results across studies.</description>
