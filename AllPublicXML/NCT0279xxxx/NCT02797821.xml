        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be ≥18 years of age at Screening

          2. Patient has pediatric-onset HPP, defined as onset of first sign(s)/symptom (s) of HPP
             prior to 18 years of age

          3. Patients must have a documented diagnosis of HPP as indicated by a documented history
             of HPP-related skeletal abnormalities and 1 or more of the following:

               -  Documented TNSALP gene mutation(s) from a certified laboratory

               -  Serum ALP level below the age-adjusted normal range AND plasma PLP above the
                  upper limit of normal at Screening.

          4. Patients must have a plasma PPi level of ≥3.9 µM at Screening

          5. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at the
             time of enrollment

          6. Sexually active male and female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a
             highly effective method of birth control during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently enrolled in a clinical study involving another study drug or non-approved
             use of a drug or device.

          2. Participated, within the last 30 days, in a clinical study involving a study drug
             (other than the study drug used in this study).

          3. Have completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study investigating asfotase
             alfa in the previous 3 years.

          4. Women who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding

          5. Serum 25-OH Vitamin D below 20 ng/mL at Screening

          6. Screening serum creatinine or parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels 1.5 times the upper
             limit of normal

          7. Any medical condition, serious concurrent illness and/or injury, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance or study endpoints.

          8. Prior treatment with bisphosphonates within 2 years of study entry for any length of
             time or for more than 2 consecutive years at any prior timepoint

          9. Treatment with PTH, strontium, or sclerostin inhibitors within 6 months prior to the
             first dose of study drug
