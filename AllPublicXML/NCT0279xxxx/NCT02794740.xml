      Primary Objectives:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating single and multiple doses of X0002
      administered as a topical application.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To characterize the single and and multiple pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of X0002 and
      its active metabolite ibuprofen as a topical application.
