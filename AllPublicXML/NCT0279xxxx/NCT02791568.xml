  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop advanced ultrasound (U/S) and Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging, known as MRI to study uteroplacental health. The goal of this study is to evaluate
      the blood and oxygen flow to the placenta using advanced U/S and MRI testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decreased uteroplacental perfusion is a recognized antecedent event in pregnancies that
      ultimately result in adverse outcomes like fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia and/or
      preterm birth. This concept is well supported clinically by identification of spiral artery
      vascular lesions called acute atherosis. Current literature suggests that these events occur
      very early which is why the investigators propose imaging using multiple techniques related
      to flow at early time points. The investigators propose that individuals with either poor
      maternal vascular response and/or inadequate spiral artery remodeling with resultant
      inadequate placentation will have a reduced uteroplacental perfusion. Given that the spiral
      arteries draw the vast majority of the blood flow in a gravid state, poor placentation would
      be reflected in the total uteroplacental blood flow, and early detection would allow both
      design and then routine initiation of novel preventive therapies early in gestation to
      improve pregnancy outcome.

      The goal of this research is to develop an arsenal of advanced ultrasound (U/S) and Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques that are compatible to be run simultaneously or
      sequentially to probe uteroplacental health and overcome the limitations posed by obesity and
      motion. While safety concerns remain with MRI, particularly in the first trimester, the
      investigators will front-load developmental and optimization studies in primate models as
      &quot;proof of principle&quot; before translating to humans; this conservative approach is key to our
      achieving paradigm shifting outcomes. A pilot study will be completed prior to the main study
      to evaluate U/S Doppler and two dimensional phase contrast (2D PC) MRI for Uteroplacental
      Blood Flow (UPBF) measures that including contributions from the ovarian arteries in addition
      to the uterine arteries.

      The investigators will match all imaging measures with clinical data and blood and urine
      sample post-hoc analyses for cytokines and tissue-specific metalloproteases, these
      correlations will further inform a differential diagnosis of distinct disease mechanisms that
      may otherwise show common imaging outcomes.

      At the end of the studies on both lean and obese women, the study team will inevitably have
      outcomes categorized as Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR), hypertensive and/or preeclampsia
      (PE), perhaps preterm and/or rarely stillbirth outcomes. Using this combination of approaches
      we will determine: 1) an optimal combination of imaging methods that is practical and
      sufficiently safe to use in humans; 2) if new data so derived is informative beyond that
      currently available clinically; 3) at what point in gestation an abnormality may be detected
      by these new methods relative to current standard clinical measures and/or diagnoses; 4) If
      imaging outcomes can predict specific complications, or only warn of a higher risk of general
      complications.
