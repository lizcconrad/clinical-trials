  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implant systems most frequently used an all-polyethylene
      cemented tibial component1. Based on finite-element analysis studies reporting superior force
      distribution compared with conventional all-polyethylene components, metal-backed tibial
      baseplates have dominated the TKA implant market since the middle of the 1980's2. These
      modular implants provided excellent long-term implant survivorship3.

      As TKA became increasingly successful, younger patients increasingly became eligible.
      Increasing life expectancy has raised the concern that cemented TKAs may not withstand
      prolonged use, particularly in younger patients4. Patients younger than 65 years are
      projected to account for more than 50% of patients undergoing TKA by 2016 and to more than
      50% of patients undergoing revision surgery by 2011. The number of total knee revisions in
      the United States is expected to increase from 38,300 in 2005 to 268,200 in 20305.

      Many authors have reported excellent and equivalent results of cemented and cementless
      TKA6-8. Despite these encouraging reports, the major concern with cementless TKA has been the
      tibial component, and, therefore, the preference for many surgeons still remains to cement
      the tibial component9,10. The femoral component may be the most suitable for cementless
      fixation11-13. However, the best femoral method of fixation is still being discussed.
      Currently, the decision to cement or not to cement the femoral component is based on the
      surgeon's preference14.

      The current study was designed to compare the hybrid NexGen LPS (Zimmer Inc, Warsaw, IN) and
      the cemented NexGen LPS. The purpose of this study is to establish whether the hybrid NexGen
      LPS leads to equally successful results as the cemented TKA gold standard

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative functional outcome as measured by the Knee and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and compare if hybrid NexGen LPS TKA leads to equally successful results as the cemented NexGen LPS TKA.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The current study will be designed as equivalence trial. The amount of allowable difference is the margin that defines the &quot;zone of indifference&quot; within which the interventions are considered equivalent.
The KOOS has a Minimally Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of 8 - 10 points, and the standard deviation in a cohort of TKA patients is ca. 15 points.
The null hypothesis (of non-equivalence) of the study is that functional outcome at 10 years of follow-up in the hybrid group is not equal to the functional outcome at 10 years of follow-up in the cemented group, or:
H: ϑ ≤ ϑ0 - δ1 or ϑ ≥ ϑ0 + δ1, versus the equivalence assumption that functional outcome at 10 years of follow-up in the hybrid group is equivalent to the functional outcome at 10 years of follow-up in the cemented group: K: ϑ0 - δ1 &lt; ϑ &lt; ϑ0 + δ1.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence and extend of radiolucent lines (RLL) as measured by standard radiography.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Radiography: x-rays will be taken during visit 4 and visits 7-10. Conventional anteroposterior and lateral radiographs will be taken at designated time-points. In order to obtain &quot;true orthogonal&quot; radiographs and to reduce the probability of false-negative findings, the lateral image will be obtained under fluoroscopic control. Postoperative radiographs will assess component position and alignment, the incidence and location of radiolucent lines using the Knee Society TKA radiographic evaluation system.</description>

    <description>The KSS is a questionnaire validate in Spanish.The study regimen for each patient will consist of a screening / baseline phase (Visit 1), follow-up visits (Visits 3 - 9) and a conclusion visit (Visit 10). All procedures specified in this protocol must be documented in the patient's record and on the corresponding Case Report Form (CRF).</description>
