    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility and acceptability of using mobile applications to
      improve medication adherence. Participants in the experimental group will receive educational
      materials and daily reminders through mobile applications. While, participants in the control
      group will receive only educational materials. After the intervention, interviews will be
      conducted among participants through phone calls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve medication adherence for Chinese patients with
      coronary heart disease (CHD) by using mobile applications. An exploratory randomized
      controlled trial (RCT, N=49) and interviews (n=15) will be included in this pilot study. The
      RCT will compare the effects of the medication adherence (MA, n=24) intervention and control
      condition (n=25) on the MA score (percent of prescribed antihypertensive drugs taken), and
      health outcomes (SBP and DBP obtained) of patients. The health outcomes will be assessed at
      enrollment and every three days after the intervention begins for thirty days. Feasibility
      will be determined by the number of patients enrolled, and retention (percent of patients who
      complete the study). Acceptability (read daily reminders and educational materials via mobile
      applications) will be evaluated through focus group interviews. All analyses will be
      performed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC). The potential risks of this study are minimal.

    <description>Reminders. Participants will receive medication-taking reminders from the researcher. These reminders are sent through the mobile applicationâ€”BB Reminder on an unencrypted external device (a phone borrowed from Duke University School of Nursing and is used specifically for this study by the researcher). BB Reminder has the function that after inputting a patient's phone number and prescriptions, participants can receive reminders through text messages of the name, dosage, function, and administration route for every dose of his/her medications. The daily reminders will be sent to participants 15 minutes before every dose of their medications.</description>

    <description>Educational materials. Participants will receive educational materials from the researcher. These educational materials will be sent through the mobile application-WeChat. The educational materials include short articles (&lt; 500 words) and/or pictures. They will be retrieved from the Chinese Cardiovascular Disease-Prevention Information Website (www.healthyheart-china.com), which is governed by the Chinese Ministry of Health. The validity of information from it is guaranteed. The retrieved educational materials will be screened by the cardiologist, the head nurse, and the researcher, before sending to participants. The educational materials will be sent to participants every other day at any time during 8 am and 10 pm.</description>
