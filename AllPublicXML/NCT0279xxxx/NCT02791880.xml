  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an increasingly
      utilized alternative procedure for replacing a stenotic aortic valve. This study collects
      clinical information, DNA, blood and urine samples (throughout procedural hospitalization) in
      order to investigate the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing TAVR
      and to identify key clinical and procedural predictors of AKI. This study seeks to identify
      blood and urine biomarkers that can be used for early detection of AKI around the time of the
      procedure. The study seeks to assess for novel genetic variants associated with development
      of AKI after TAVR. Finally the study seeks to assess for novel genetic variants and
      biomarkers that are associated with adverse cardiovascular events after TAVR and to further
      explore how these events may inter-relate with acute kidney injury.

      This study enrolls patients who have aortic stenosis who undergo TAVR at the University of
      Texas Southwestern Medical Center University Hospital. Development of post-TAVR AKI defined
      according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) SCr based and urine output
      based criteria will be ascertained. Patients will be followed during primary hospitalization
      and during the 5 years following TAVR for adverse kidney outcomes as well as potentially
      related adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Clinical and procedural data is collected for each
      study patient. All subjects will have paired blood and urine collection done pre-TAVR, 6
      hours after aortic valve prosthesis deployment, and on post-procedure days 1 and 2. Subjects
      who develop AKI will also have paired blood and urine samples collected on days 3, 4 and 5.
      Patients receive follow-up questionnaires by mail or email asking about hospitalizations as
      well as visits to cardiology, nephrology and primary care physicians. Questionnaires will
      also ask about health-related quality of life using validated study questionnaires. Patient
      follow-up will occur at regular intervals until 5 years after TAVR procedure.
