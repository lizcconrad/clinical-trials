    <textblock>
      This phase 1 study will identify recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) of AR-42 and pazopanib
      when given in combination for subsequent clinical trials and may potentially identify
      candidate pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-arm, open-label, phase 1 trial to determine the RP2Ds of AR-42 and
      pazopanib when given in combination to patients with advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) or
      Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS). Eligible patients will have recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic
      RCC or STS for which pazopanib is an appropriate therapy.

      AR-42 will be taken orally once per day on 3 non-consecutive days each week during the first
      3 weeks of each 4-week cycle. Pazopanib will be taken by mouth once daily continuously during
      each cycle.

      A modified 3+3 dose-escalation design will be followed until the maximum tolerated doses
      (MTDs) have been determined. Additional patients will be enrolled until a total of 12
      patients have been treated at the MTDs. The maximum number of patients needed is 51 with an
      expected sample size of 29-35 patients enrolled over a period of about 15-35 months.

      Correlative studies will be conducted using samples of tumor that were archived following the
      most recent surgery or biopsy.

    <description>To determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) for AR-42 and pazopanib that are the same as or less than the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period will be the first treatment cycle. Patients must have taken a minimum of 6 AR-42 doses and a minimum of 21 pazopanib doses during cycle 1 to be considered evaluable for DLT, if DLT has not been observed at the delivered dose. Patients' treatment dose level, dose modification, evaluability for DLT, and DLTs will be listed and summarized by basic descriptive statistics such as frequency and proportion. The maximum tolerated dose(MTDs)/recommended phase 2 doses (RP2Ds) will be found based on the criteria in the protocol.</description>

A modified 3+3 dose-escalation design will be followed until the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) have been determined. Different doses of AR-42 and pazopanib will be given to several study participants. Two different Pazopanib doses of 600 mg and 800 mg will be used. The AR-42 will continue to be increased for each group of participants until side effects occur that require dose of one study drug to be lowered.</description>
