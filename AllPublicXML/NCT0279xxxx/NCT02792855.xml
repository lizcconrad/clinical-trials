      The simple head extension is recommended for optimization of glottic visualization during
      awake orotracheal intubation whith fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) . However, no study to date
      has conﬁrmed its superiority over &quot;snifﬁng position&quot; . In a prospective, randomized study,
      the authors compared the snifﬁng position with simple head extension in awake orotracheal
      Intubation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included sixty obese patients with anticipated difficult airways.The snifﬁng
      position was obtained by placement of a 7-cm cushion under the head of the patient. The
      extension position was obtained by simple head extension.

      The head position was randomized as follows: group A was in the snifﬁng position ;group B was
      in the extension position . Glottic exposure was assessed by the Cormack scale.

      Randomization was performed by placing index cards with the letter A or B into100 sealed
      envelopes (more than the number of study patients), which were then placed in random order.
      At the time of a patient's enrollment, the next available envelope was placed with the
      patient's chart. At the time of intubation, the envelope was opened and the sequence was thus
      determined.

    <description>The primary endpoints were the time to view the vocal cords (TVC) which was taken when the operator indicated verbally that he view the vocal cords and the time to successful tracheal intubation (TSI). TSI was defined as the time taken from insertion of the FOB between the teeth until the appearance of a capnograhy curve.</description>
