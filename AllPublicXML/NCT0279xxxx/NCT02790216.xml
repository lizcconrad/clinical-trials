      Objective:

      To focus the high dose radiation to the gross tumor in the prostate while maintaining
      adequate dose for control of microscopic disease elsewhere in the prostate.

      In order to test the incorporation of the robust MRI and TRUS fusion algorithm in the
      clinical setting the investigators planned a study of Focused therapy with a primary endpoint
      of accurate localization of the high risk region. This is a pilot study of dose painted
      permanent I-125 seed implant to verify absence of tumor cells outside a high risk region
      using multi-parametric MRI and deformable TRUS registration. The high risk region will be
      dose painted to 160 Gy and the rest of the prostate will receive the normal prescription
      dose.

      Primary end-point:

      Feasibility of dose painting will be determined by the absence of tumor outside the high-risk
      region on an intra-operative trans-perineal biopsy.

      Frozen sections will not be obtained, however on receipt of the final pathology 2-4 weeks
      after the procedure 2 possible scenarios arise:

        1. There is no evidence of cancer: this confirms the accuracy of the TRUS MRI registration.

        2. There is evidence of tumor on the stereotactic biopsy: In this case a regular dosimetric
           check (this is performed in the Standard of care procedure and is known as
           post-operative dosimetry) will be performed to determine whether adequate dose was
           delivered. If not, as the involved needle position was recorded in the treatment plan
           and labeled with co-ordinates, the regular possibility of accurately adding radioactive
           seeds is possible.
