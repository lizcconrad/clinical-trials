  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a age dependent physiological state of vulnerability. Frailty is screened by the
      phenotypic model (5 clinical criteria) or the cumulative model (various clinical and
      biological criteria). Currently, aging with autism spectrum disorder and mental retardation
      (ADS-MR) is poor described. Nevertheless many data indicate that people with ADS-MR may
      present an early aging.

      Principal aim of this study is to determine if frailty in people with ADS-MR aged over 20
      years depend on age. Secondary aims are to evaluate frailty prevalence, to describe with
      details health according to age, and to verify the frailty index validity for predicting
      falls, hospitalisation and death, in this population of ADS-MR patients aged over 20 years.

      This monocentric and prospective study will include 60 ADS-MR patients aged over 20 years and
      living in Languedoc-Roussillon's medico-social care homes. Patients are evaluated at the time
      of inclusion. Frailty index is calculated from 104 clinical and biological criteria.
      Furthermore the investigator staff collect data about ADS severity (CARS), adaptative and
      intellectual functionning (Vineland), and psychiatric and somatic comorbidities (Reiss scale,
      DSQIID and CIRS). Falls, hospitalisations or death occurrence is then collected every year
      during 5 years.

      The connection between frailty index and age will be studied using linear regression. The
      frailty index validity will be analysed using ROC curves. Modelisation of the falls,
      hospitalisations or death risk in the 5 years after the initial evaluation will help in
      identification of the more frailty predictive criteria.

      Calendar :

      This study will take place during 60 months. 4 first months will be devoted at the ethic and
      administrative issues. Inclusion will take place during 26 months. Follow-up will take 5
      years. Last months will be used for data analysis and articles submission.

      Perspectives :

      This study will be the first describing frailty evolution during aging in patients suffering
      from ADS-MR. It will be useful for creating a new, simple and pragmatical frailty screening
      tool specific for ADS-MR patients in order to detect earlier which patient are the most
      frail.
