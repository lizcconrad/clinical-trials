  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are known to present an increased risk of
      osteoporosis and cardiovascular calcification. It has also been suggested that bone
      remodelling and cardiovascular calcification are regulated by the same mechanisms, but
      inversely in terms of calcium deposition, as osteoporosis is often associated with
      cardiovascular calcification. Inflammatory and immune factors have been implicated in these
      two processes.

      The role of the RANKL/OPG system in osteoclast differentiation has been elucidated over the
      last ten years. RANKL induces differentiation of monocytes-macrophages into osteoclasts,
      while, inversely, OPG exerts an inhibitory role by inactivating RANKL. Differentiation of
      smooth muscle cells into osteoblasts in the vessel wall induces calcification, and this
      phenomenon is counterbalanced by differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts. Although the
      role of the RANKL/OPG ratio in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis has now been clearly
      established, its role in vascular calcification is only hypothetical at the present time.

      This study will focus on patients with SLE diagnosed and followed in the Amiens University
      Hospital Internal Medicine and Nephrology departments
