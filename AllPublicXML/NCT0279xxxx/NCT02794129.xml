  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a mental disease characterized by mood dysregulation and arises from
      manic, depressive or mixed episodes. The observations of the patient's speech and language
      behaviour due to flight of ideas or loss of goal probably result from an underlying
      disturbance in semantic networks dealing with semantic associations. The aim of our study
      will be to have a better comprehension of thought disorders in bipolar disorder by cognitive
      exploration of semantic processing.

      Bipolar disorder is a mental disease characterized by mood dysregulation and arises from
      manic, depressive or mixed episodes. During these episodes, formal thought disorders are
      observed, associated to emotional perturbation, behaviour troubles and some psychotic
      symptoms. During mania, the type of thought disorders observed are derailment, flight of
      ideas, with an increase in the amount of spontaneous speech and loss of goal. These
      observations of the patient's speech and language behaviour probably result from an
      underlying disturbance in semantic networks dealing with semantic associations. These
      networks have been studied extensively in schizophrenia but remain unknown in bipolar
      disorder. In this context, the aim of our study will be to have a better comprehension of
      formal thought disorders in bipolar disorder by cognitive exploration of semantic activation
      and inhibition.
