      Atomoxetine, a selective norepinephrine transporter (NET) blocker, increases standing blood
      pressure and improves neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH)-related symptoms to a greater
      extent than midodrine, the current standard of care. Atomoxetine could be a new therapeutic
      alternative for the treatment of NOH in patients with autonomic failure, particularly those
      with multiple system atrophy (MSA).

      The proposed study consists of an open-label, dose-optimization phase followed by a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 crossover phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (defined by a reduction of â‰¥30 mmHg drop in SBP
             within 3 minutes of standing, associated with impaired autonomic reflexes as assessed
             by autonomic function tests.

             anaphylaxis)

          -  Use of other norepinephrine transporter inhibitors such as Wellbutrin (Bupropion),
             Cymbalta (Duloxetine), Effexor (venlafaxine), Pristiq (desvenlafaxine), Savella
             (milnacipran)

             return for follow-up visits, unlikelihood of completing the study, and mental
             conditions rendering the subject unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible
             consequences of the study
