      Objective: To observe the effect of alogliptin combined with metformin on pulmonary function
      in obese patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy (500
      mg, bid po, for at least 3 months), and evaluate its efficacy and safety.

      Method: After a 2-week screening period, adult patients (aged 36-72 years) entered a 4-week
      run-in/stabilization period. Then, patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention
      group (n=55) or control group (n=50) for 26 weeks. The patients in the control group were
      given metformin (1,000 mg, bid po) and the patients in the intervention group were given
      metformin (500 mg, bid po) combined with alogliptin (25 mg, qd po). All the patients received
      counseling about diet and exercise from a nutritionist during run-in and treatment periods.

      The primary endpoints were the between-group differences in the changes pulmonary function
      parameters [VC%, FVC%, FEV1%, PEF%, MVV%, TLC%, FEV1/FVC%, DLCO%, and DLCO/VA%] between
      pretherapy and posttreatment. The secondary endpoints were changes from baseline to week 26
      in HbA1c, FPG, 2hPG, HOMA-IR, WC, and BMI. The tertiary endpoints were the changes from
      baseline to week 26 in blood-fat (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG). The quartus endpoints were the
      changes from baseline to week 26 in SBP and DBP. The fifth endpoints were the changes from
      baseline to week 26 in oxidative/antioxidative parameters (ROS, MDA, SOD, and GSH-PX). In
      addition, safety endpoints were assessed (AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and
      electrocardiographic readings).

    <description>Alogliptin (alogliptin benzoate) is the most recent DPP-4 inhibitor; it entered the market in 2006. It is a potent and highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor with oral antidiabetic activity; Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line drug worldwide for the treatment of T2DM, it acts by decreasing both hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, while improving insulin sensitivity, metformin as a safe and valid oral antidiabetic drug was recommended to the obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m2, it has some value in reducing or preventing weight gain and changes in metabolic parameters during treatment, and it can be combinated with other antidiabetic drug</description>
