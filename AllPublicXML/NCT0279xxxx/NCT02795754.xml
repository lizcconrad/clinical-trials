  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2838232 is a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) maturation inhibitor being developed for
      the treatment of HIV in combination with other antiretroviral therapy (ART). The primary
      objectives of this study are to investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of single and repeat doses of GSK2838232. This study will be a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, single and repeat dose escalation study. This study will be conducted in
      two Parts: single escalating doses (Part 1A and 1B), and repeated escalating once daily (QD)
      doses for 11 days (Part 2) of GSK2838232 co-dosed with RTV. During Part 1A, single doses of
      GSK2838232 (as of active pharmaceutical ingredient-powder in bottle [API PiB]) 50 milligrams
      (mg), 100mg and 200mg will be administered with RTV. Part 1B will evaluate the relative
      bioavailability of single doses of crystalline active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)
      Immediate Release Tablet (IR) tablets versus API PiB as reference, administered with RTV. In
      Part 2, multiple doses of GSK2838232 will be co-administered with RTV 100mg QD for 11 days as
      sequential dose cohorts. Maximum duration of study participation will be approximately 10
      weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: Between 18 and 55 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed
             consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by the Investigator or medically qualified designee based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests
             and cardiac monitoring.

          -  A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not
             specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, and outside the reference
             range for the population being studied, may be included only if the Investigator in
             consultation with the Medical Monitor, if required, agree and document that the
             finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             the study procedures

          -  A creatinine clearance (CLcr) &gt;80milliliter/minute (mL/min) as determined by
             Cockcroft-Gault equation CLcr (mL/min) = (140 - age) * weight (Wt) / (72 * serum
             creatinine [Scr]) (times 0.85 if female) where age is in years, Wt is in kilogram
             (kg), and Scr is in units of milligram / decilitre (mg/dL);.

          -  Body weight &gt;= 50.0 kg (110 pounds [lbs.]) for men and &gt;= 45.0kg (99lbs) for women and

        Pre-menopausal females with one of the following: Documented tubal ligation; Documented
        hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal

        months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
        follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels consistent with menopause (refer to
        laboratory reference ranges for confirmatory levels)]. Females on hormone replacement
        therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the
        highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
        Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior
        to study enrolment.

        Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the
        following contraception requirements from the time of first dose of study medication until
        one week after the last dose of study medication.

        Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia, or Male condom plus partner use of one of the

        as stated in the product label; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system that meets the
        SOP effectiveness criteria including a &lt;1% rate of failure per year, as stated in the
        product label; Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone. Injectable
        progestogen; Contraceptive vaginal ring; Percutaneous contraceptive patches.

        These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly
        and in accordance with the product label. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that
        subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.

             interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: For US
             sites: an average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One
