      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy in reducing glycated hemoglobin of
      ipragliflozin in combination with metformin compared with metformin plus placebo in subjects
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control on metformin.

      This is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized study to assess the efficacy and safety of
      ipragliflozin in combination with metformin compared to metformin plus placebo in subjects in
      Russia with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control on metformin.
      Subjects will enter a 10-day (± 3 days) screening period, followed by a 2-week single-blind
      placebo run-in period, followed by a 24-week randomized double-blind treatment period and a
      4-week follow-up period
