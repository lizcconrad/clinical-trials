    <textblock>
      Background: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an innovative treatment for
      major depression. However, its mechanisms of action are still unclear. Major depression is
      characterized by impaired processing of emotional information, which returns back to normal
      after successful antidepressant treatment. In this randomized double-blind study, the
      investigators aim to assess the effect of tDCS on emotional processing in major depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods: 40 subjects with major depression (20 active treatment and 20 placebo) will receive
      ten 30-minutes sessions of active two milliamps or sham tDCS (anode over left dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex and cathode over right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), twice a day for 5
      consecutive days. Psychometric assessment of depression (MADRS,Beck Depression Inventory ,
      CGI) and a neuropsychological assessment will be conducted before and after the treatment.

      A facial emotion recognition task and an attentional emotional task with measurement of
      eye-tracking, heart rate, respiratory frequency and skin conductance will be conducted before
      and after the first session, and after the last session.

      The investigators hypothesize that active tDCS will improve emotional processing in major
      depression, and that this will be observed after 1 and 10 sessions of tDCS.

      Conclusions: Studying the impact of transcranial direct current stimulation on emotional
      processing in major depression could allow to better understand its antidepressant mechanisms

    <measure>Number of correct responses at a facial expression recognition task</measure>
    <time_frame>within 5 days after stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>A computerized facial expression recognition task was designed for the study. 240 pictures of emotional faces (8 identities, expressing anger, sadness, happiness, surprise, disgust, or fear, morphed with intensity of 20, 40, 50, 60 and 80%) are randomly displayed on a screen for 500ms. Subjects are asked to identify the emotion by answering on a keyboard.
Rate of correct responses is the main outcome. During this task, eye movements are recorded by an eye-tracking device. Skin conductance, respiratory and heart rate frequency are also recorded</description>

    <time_frame>within 5 days after stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Computerized &quot;dot-probe &quot; attentional task designed for the study. Pairs of emotional faces (neutral/sad ou neutral/happy) are randomly presented on a screen for 1000ms. Then, a probe is presented during 1100ms.subjects are asked to indicate a which side the probe approved During this task, eye movements are recorded by an eye-tracking device. Total time spent on Region of Interest (sad, happy or neutral face) is measured.
Skin conductance, respiratory and heart rate frequency are also recorded.</description>
