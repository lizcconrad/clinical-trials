      This is a Phase 1, open-label, single-center, non-randomized study to assess the mass balance
      of a single oral dose of DS-8500a in healthy male subjects, 18 years (y) to 60 y of age,
      inclusive. The radiolabeled investigational medicinal product will be administered to 12
      healthy male subjects in 2 cohorts of 6 subjects each.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects between 18 years (y) and 60 y of age, inclusive.

          -  Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) of 19 kg/m2 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive; or, if
             outside the range, not clinically significant and agreed with Sponsor and primary
             investigator (PI).

          -  Subjects must be in good health as determined at Screening and Day -1 (Check-in)
             assessed by medical history (Screening only), physical examination, vital signs,
             hematology, virology (Screening only), and urinalysis.

          -  Laboratory results (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) must not be outside
             the normal range or if outside the normal range, then the PI considers the value not
             clinically relevant.

          -  Subjects must agree not to participate in any other investigational study until the
             end of the trial.

          -  Subjects must be willing to abstain from grapefruit/grapefruit juice and Seville
             oranges from 10 d before the first dose of study medication and throughout the study.

          -  Subjects must be willing to refrain from consuming food or beverages containing
             caffeine/xanthine and alcohol starting 24 h prior to Check-in on Day -1.

          -  Subjects must be able to understand and willing to comply with all study requirements,
             and willing to allow the collection of all blood, fecal, and urine specimens.

          -  Subjects must give written informed consent to participate in the study prior to
             Screening. Consent will be documented by the subject's dated signature that will be
             counter signed and dated by a witness. The appropriate HIPAA authorization forms must
             be signed and dated by the subject.

          -  Male subjects must agree to contraception (condom with spermicide) in addition to
             having their female partner (if of childbearing potential) use another form of
             contraception (eg, an intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, oral
             contraceptive, injectables, or subdermal hormonal implant) from the first dose until
             12 wk following the last dose administration. Also, male subjects must not donate
             sperm for a period of 12 wk following drug administration.

          -  Subject must have a history of regular bowel movements (defined in this instance as a
             bowel movement at least every other d without the need for medication).

          -  Subjects must be willing to eat entire meals and snacks provided during the stay at
             the research facility and understand that the diet will include foods with high fiber
             content and possibly prune juice.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have received any prescription or non-prescription (over-the-counter
             [OTC]) systemic medication, topical medication, or herbal supplement (including St.
             John's Wort [hypericin]) within 14 d prior to dosing.

          -  Subjects who participated in a clinical study involving administration of an
             investigational drug (new chemical entity), or a marketed drug within 30 d or 5
             half-lives of that investigational drug or marketed drug prior to dosing.

          -  Subjects who were administered radiolabeled substances or exposed to significant
             radiation (eg, serial X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans, barium meal,
             occupational exposure etc) within 12-mo of dosing.

          -  Subjects who have been involved in an occupation that requires monitoring for
             radiation exposure (eg, X-ray technician).

          -  Liver function (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT],
             total bilirubin [TBL]) test results range should not be be &gt; upper limit of normal at
             Screening and during Enrollment on Day -1.

          -  Subjects with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (using Modification of
             Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] equation) &lt; 90 mL/min.

          -  Subjects with Fridericia's corrected QT interval (QTcF) interval duration &gt; 450 ms,
             obtained as an average from the 3 ECG recorder's measurements on triplicate Screening
             ECGs (3 ECGs in close succession at least 1 min apart) taken after at least 10 min of
             quiet rest in the supine position.

          -  Subjects with abnormal waveform morphology on any of the ECGs at the Screening and on
             Day -1 that would preclude accurate measurement of the time for both ventricular
             depolarization and repolarization (QT) interval duration.

          -  Subject who have participated in a previous DS-8500a study within 6-mo prior to the

             Screening.

          -  Subjects who have used tobacco products or nicotine-containing products (including
             smoking cessation aids, such as gums or patches) within 6-mo prior to dosing.

             Screening and on Day -1.

          -  Subjects who test positive for HBsAg, or antibody to HCV or HIV, at Screening.
