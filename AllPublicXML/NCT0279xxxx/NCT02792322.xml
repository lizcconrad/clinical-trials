  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate if transoral surgery with the patient in the seated
      position utilizing the da Vinci&amp;#174; Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.,
      Sunnyvale, CA) will enable better visualization and expedited removal of benign and malignant
      tumors of the throat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The da Vinci Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) being
      evaluated in this pilot study consists of 3 basic components: a surgeon's console,
      articulated mechanical arms and sterilizable instruments. The console includes a computer,
      video monitor and instrument controls, and is located in the operating room adjacent to the
      operating room table. The console is connected via computer to the mechanical arms holding
      the endoscope (surgical TV camera) and sterile surgical tools (e.g., forceps, scissors,
      electrocautery, etc.). These arms are located immediately adjacent to the patient on the
      operating room table. The surgeon sits at the console and controls the position and movement
      of the arms and surgical tools. The design of these tools is based upon well-established,
      commonly used surgical instruments. The da Vinci Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical,
      Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) is a &quot;manual image-guided surgery&quot; system that is computer enhanced
      rather than &quot;computer guided robotic surgery&quot; in which the surgeon programs the computer to
      do the surgery and the robot does the surgery (also known as a &quot;milling&quot; device). Use of the
      da Vinci Robotic Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) in the
      aforementioned configuration in fact facilitates an exact translation of the surgeon's hand
      and finger movements at the console to precise and tremor-free movements of the arms and
      instruments.
