      Background:

      Zika virus is mostly passed on by the bite of an infected mosquito. It usually causes mild
      illness. But in pregnant women it can cause serious birth defects to the baby. The virus can
      also spread by blood transfusion and sexual intercourse. This is why the U.S. Food &amp; Drug
      Administration (FDA) recommended that people should not give blood if possibly exposed to
      Zika virus. Dengue virus and chikungunya virus are passed by the same mosquitoes as Zika
      virus. These can cause severe reactions if passed through transfused blood.

      Donated blood is usually not tested for these three viruses. Researchers want to count the
      infections in people who have been exposed because of travel or sexual exposure. They want to
      learn the risk these viruses might pose to the U.S. blood supply. They also want to study the
      natural history of these viruses by following infected people over time.

      Objective:

      To study the risk of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses to the U.S. blood supply.

      Eligibility:

      Adults age 18 or older who were turned down for donating blood because of possible exposure
      to certain viruses.

      Design:

      Participants will have blood and urine tests. They will answer questions about their travel.

      They will be called in about a week with virus test results.

      Participants with negative results do not have any more study visits.

      Participants with positive results will be asked to stay in the study for 6 months. They will
      have weekly clinic visits and tests until results are negative for 2 straight weeks. Once
      test results are negative, they will have monthly visits. Visits will include physical exams,
      blood and urine samples, and optional semen samples from men.

      Most people will have 3-4 weekly visits and 5 monthly visits.

      Zika virus (ZIKV) is an Aedes species mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus responsible for an
      ongoing epidemic in over twenty countries and territories in the Caribbean, and in North,
      Central and South America. A 20-fold increased risk of microcephaly has been reported in
      newborns of infected mothers in Brazil. Of nine identified pregnant travelers returning to
      the U.S. from areas with local ZIKV infection, five have experienced severe neonatal
      outcomes.

      ZIKV can be transmitted via blood transfusion and by sexual exposure to a ZIKV-infected man.
      In response, AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) made recommendations and
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued guidance for donor deferral based on 1) travel
      to locations with active ZIKV transmission; or for 2) sexual exposure to a man who has
      traveled to an area with active ZIKV transmission. Further, Aedes species mosquito vectors
      that transmit ZIKV also transmit dengue virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Areas
      with local ZIKV transmission also commonly have local DENV and CHIKV transmission. DENV and
      CHIKV are transmissible via blood transfusion and can result in severe outcomes in
      transfusion recipients.

      The primary aims of this study are to: 1) assess the prevalence of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV
      infection (RNA-positives) among adults who attempted to donate blood but were deferred
      because of travel to places with local transmission of ZIKV, DENV and/or CHIKV
      (travel-deferred donors); 2) assess the prevalence of ZIKV infection (RNA-positives) among
      adults who attempted to donate blood who were deferred due to potential sexual exposure to
      ZIKV infection; 3) assess the prevalence of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infection (RNA-positives)
      among blood donors whose blood or platelets were collected and who called back to report any
      illness within 2 weeks of donation; and to 4) study the 24-week natural history of ZIKV, DENV
      and CHIKV infection among deferred adult donors who tested RNA-positive for any of these
      agents.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Adults who traveled within the past month to places with local transmission of ZIKV,
             DENV and/or CHIKV who would otherwise be eligible to donate blood;

          -  Volunteer adult blood donors or potential blood donors who are deferred from blood
             donation because they tested positive for Zika virus.

          -  Volunteer adult blood and platelet donors (blood donors) who present to the NIH
             Clinical Center Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) and the Fishers Lane Donor
             Center are eligible for study enrollment if they:

               1. Are deferred because of travel to an area with active ZIKV transmission within
                  the past 4 weeks; or

               2. Are deferred because of sexual contact during the past 4 weeks with a sexual
                  partner who traveled to an area with active ZIKV transmission in the 3 months
                  prior to that instance of sexual contact; or

               3. Are deferred because of travel to a malaria-endemic area; and returned from the
                  area in the past month; or

               4. Have donated blood or platelets AND within 2 weeks of donation they called the
                  NIH DTM or Fishers Lane Donor Centers to report any signs or symptoms of
                  infection, AND they traveled to an area with active transmission of ZIKV, DENV or
                  CHIKV within the past 4 weeks (from symptom onset); OR had sexual contact within
                  the past 4 weeks (from symptom onset) with a sexual partner who traveled to an
                  area with active ZIKV transmission in the 3 months prior to that instance of
                  sexual contact.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Potential donors who do not meet the inclusion criteria are excluded. Potential donors
        under 18 years of age, paid or research blood donors and pregnant women are excluded from
        enrollment. Children are not eligible to donate blood without parental consent and the
        frequency of number of follow-up visits places an undue burden on school age children. Paid
        or research blood donors are not representative of the normal blood donor population.
        Pregnant women are not eligible to donate blood.
