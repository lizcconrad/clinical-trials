  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is one of the most common pediatric congenital malformations.
      In recent years, in view of the rapid rise of transthoracic minimally invasive hybrid closure
      for pediatric VSD in the clinical practice, precision assessment of perioperative its
      effectiveness and safety has already become an important issue that must be solved. On the
      basis of echocardiography, integrating with characteristics associated critical care, the
      investigators focus on precision assessment of perioperative effectiveness and safety of
      transthoracic hybrid closure for pediatric VSD, compared with conventional surgical
      sternotomy repair with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

    <description>Anaesthesia is maintained by inhaled isoflurane in concentrations 0.7-0.8 % end-tidal with additional sufentanil injected during surgery, as required. During extracorporal circulation patients receive isoflurane via a vaporizer incorporated in the extracorporeal gas supply in the same concentrations.</description>
