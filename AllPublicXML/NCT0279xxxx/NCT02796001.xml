      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relationship between rhinovirus specific
      T-cell immunity and the human host response to primary rhinovirus challenge and subsequent
      secondary challenge with either homologous or heterologous rhinovirus serotypes.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the relationship between RV-specific T-cell
      immunity and the human host response to primary RV challenge and subsequent secondary
      challenge with either homologous or heterologous RV serotypes. The overall hypothesis that
      will be addressed by the mechanistic studies in this proposal is that T helper (Th) and T
      follicular helper (Tfh) cells directed against conserved RV epitopes expand upon RV exposure
      and some of these cells persist as stable cross-reactive memory populations capable of
      displaying lineage-specific protective functions upon re-infection with related or unrelated
      strains of RV. The human specimens collected in this study will be analyzed with a variety of
      state-of-the-art techniques to provide an in depth description of T-cell responses to RV
      infection, and the correlation of these responses with viral infection, antibody responses,
      and illness. Beyond this objective, by using a systems biology approach, we aim to gain new
      insight into the role of diverse cell types involved in adaptive immunity to RV. .
