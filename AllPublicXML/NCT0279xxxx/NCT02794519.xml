  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sirukumab is a fully human anti interleukin (IL)-6 immunoglobulin G1-kappa monoclonal
      antibody (MAb) which is in development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The
      continuing unmet need in subjects with asthma refractory to corticosteroid therapy and
      increased understanding of asthma pathogenesis have stimulated the development of targeted
      biologics based on predictive biomarkers. The majority of approaches to date have targeted T
      Helper 2 (Th2) cytokines or their downstream effects. Targeting IL-6 in severe asthma
      represents an unprecedented approach that has potential to address non-Th2 drivers of severe
      asthma. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblind), placebo-controlled,
      parallel group study will investigate the efficacy of sirukumab compared to placebo in
      subjects having uncontrolled severe asthma despite use of high dose inhaled corticosteroid
      (ICS) in combination with long-acting Beta-agonist (LABA). The study will employ a variable
      treatment period for individual subjects. Dosing will continue every 4 weeks until week 44
      (inclusive), or until 24 weeks after the final subject has been randomized, whichever the
      sooner. Upon receiving the final dose of study medicine or placebo, subjects will enter a 16
      week Follow Up period. Overall, the duration of participation for subjects who complete the
      full 44-week treatment period and Follow Up period may be up to 64 weeks. Approximately 175
      subjects will be randomized such that 140 evaluable subjects complete the study.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-7 is a seven-item questionnaire that is a measure of a subject's asthma control. Six of the questions will be self-completed by the subject, recalling over the previous 7 days. The six questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze), and rescue bronchodilator use. The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. The final question is a rating of forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1% predicted. The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ score is the mean of the 7 questions and therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). Baseline value is the value obtained at Day 1 before administration of investigational product (IP). Change from baseline in ACQ-7 score will be analysed using a Bayesian repeated measures model.</description>

             hospitalisation or extended observation in a hospital emergency room or outpatient
             centre. [For subjects on maintenance systemic corticosteroids, at least double the

             after the last dose of study medication: Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia;
             Male condom plus partner use of one of the following contraceptive options:
             Contraceptive subdermal implant; Intrauterine device or intrauterine system; Combined

             when used consistently and correctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the
             product label. For non-product methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator
             determines what is consistent and correct use. The GSK definition is based on the
             definition provided by The International Council for Harmonization of Technical
             Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).

          -  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly
