  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal pressure with different cuff shapes can result in different cuff pressure change
      after head positional change. In this study, 52 patients underwent middle ear surgery with
      general anesthesia were randomly allocated to two group; patients were intubated with taper
      guard cuffed tube or cylindrical shaped cuffed tube. Anesthesia was maintained with
      sevoflurane with air/oxygen and remifentanil. The cuff pressure was initially set at 22
      centimeters of water in the neural head position and was measured after the change to the 45
      degree head rotation. The change of cuff pressure was compared between two groups

      general anesthesia were randomly allocated to two group; patients were intubated with taper
      guard cuffed tube or cylindrical shaped cuffed tube. Anesthesia was maintained with
      sevoflurane with air/O2 and remifentanil. The cuff pressure was initially set at 24
      centimeters of water in the neural head position and was measured after the change to the 45
      degree head rotation. In addition, sore throat, hoarseness , dysphagia and cough were
      recorded 0, 6, 12, 24 hr after surgery. The change of cuff pressure was compared between two
      groups. The side effects associated with tube were compared between two groups.
