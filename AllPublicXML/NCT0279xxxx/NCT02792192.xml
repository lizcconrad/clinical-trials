  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ib/II study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      immunogenicity, patient reported outcomes (PROs), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of
      atezolizumab administered by intravenous (IV) infusion alone and in combination with
      intravesical BCG in high-risk NMIBC participants. The study will be conducted in following
      cohorts: Cohort 1A, Cohort 1B, Cohort 2, and Cohort 3. Atezolizumab will be administered at a
      fixed dose of 1200 milligrams (mg) every 3 weeks (q3w) for a maximum of 96 weeks. BCG will be
      administered to evaluate dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), or
      maximum administered dose (MAD). De-escalation will be allowed for up to three dose levels of
      BCG (full dose [50 mg], 66 percent [%] of a full dose, and 33% of a full dose [Cohort 1B
      only]). After the MTD or MAD is determined for Cohort 1B, this dose will be used for all
      subsequent participants enrolled into Cohorts 1B, 2, and 3, unless the MTD is determined to
      be 33% of a full BCG dose. If MTD is determined to be 33% of a full BCG dose, then, no
      participants will be enrolled into Cohorts 2 and 3 until an assessment of the safety and
      activity of the combination of atezolizumab plus 33% of a full BCG dose is completed.
