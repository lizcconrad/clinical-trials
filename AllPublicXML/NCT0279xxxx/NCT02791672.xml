  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pedicled latissimus dorsi flap is a piece of tissue taken from the back that is used to
      reconstruct the breast after cancerous tissue is removed. Over the years, improvements in
      surgical technique and pain control have decreased the length of stay in hospital after this
      procedure. Recently, early discharge after breast reconstruction using another very similar
      pedicled flap, called the transverse rectus abdominis flap, was shown to be safe,
      patient-centered, and associated with significant hospital cost-savings by another Canadian
      group.

      With increasing pressure from hospital administrators to weigh financial considerations into
      treatment decision making, doctors must test cost-saving strategies in order to ensure
      patient satisfaction and safety. Here, we plan to evaluate patient safety, satisfaction and
      cost efficacy in breast reconstruction using the pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap.

      We hypothesize that patient care planning can allow for safe and cost-effective same-day
      discharge and improved patient satisfaction after autologous breast reconstruction using the
      pedicled latissimus dorsi flap. After nearly 10 successful same-day discharges using this
      flap, our experience at the Ottawa Hospital suggests that this practice is safe, has
      increased patient satisfaction scores, decreased narcotic use, no short or long term
      complications and is more cost effective compared to patients who stay overnight.

      In the present study, we hope to quantify our results by demonstrating that same day
      discharge is a cost effective strategy that does not compromise patient safety and
      satisfaction.

      The pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap is a reliable option for autologous breast
      reconstruction after mastectomy. Improvements in technique and postoperative analgesia have
      decreased the length of hospital stay required after this procedure. Early discharge
      following a range of procedures has been consistently shown to increase patient satisfaction,
      decrease perioperative complication rates, and improve hospital cost-effectiveness.
      Specifically, early discharge after breast reconstruction using another pedicled myocutaneous
      flap, the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap, was shown to be safe,
      patient-centered, and associated with significant hospital cost-savings by another Canadian
      group.

      The balance between financial savings and patient safety/comfort has been studied vigorously
      across many medical disciplines. With increasing pressure from hospital administrators to
      weigh financial considerations into treatment decision making, clinicians must empirically
      test cost-saving strategies in order to ensure patient satisfaction and safety.

      Here, we evaluate patient safety, satisfaction and cost efficacy in ambulatory breast
      reconstruction using the pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap.
