      A minimum of 23 people aged 60 years and older, of both sexes, from an informatics course for
      beginners will participate in the study. The evaluation will consist mainly in answering two
      validated questionnaires on socialization, the short Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale
      for Adults (SELSA-S) and short-form UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-6). Reaction time and
      performance will also be measured by three virtual reality games, namely Reaction Time,
      Random and Moviletrando. All this evaluation will be repeated in three moments: T0 - at
      baseline; T1 - after 8 conventional informatics classes and; T2 - after 8 informatics classes
      which includes 15 minutes for practicing virtual reality games.

      Background: The use of new Technologies, such as the resources of augmentative and
      alternative communication (AAC), appears as a valuable tool to promote socialization in many
      groups of people. Serious games with virtual reality are an example of these resources and
      might bring benefits also to the elderly population, allowing an enjoyable and safe
      interaction that uses various sensorial stimuli. The purpose of this study protocol is to
      evaluate the effects of practicing virtual reality games on elderly socialization.

      Method/Design: It will be an experimental, prospective longitudinal study which will use
      serious games with virtual reality to improve the socialization of elderly people. A minimum
      of 23 people aged 60 years and older, of both sexes, from an informatics course for beginners
      will participate in the study. The evaluation will consist mainly in answering two validated
      questionnaires on socialization, the short Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults
      (SELSA-S) and short-form UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-6). Reaction time and performance will
      also be measured by three virtual reality games, namely Reaction Time, Random and
      Moviletrando. All this evaluation will be repeated in three moments: T0 - at baseline; T1 -
      after 8 conventional informatics classes and; T2 - after 8 informatics classes which includes
      15 minutes for practicing virtual reality games.

      Discussion: This study will determine whether the practice of virtual reality games in
      addition to the usual informatics classes contributes to elderly socialization. The evolution
      in socialization, the evolution of reaction time and performance in virtual reality games and
      the correlation of motor learning to socialization will also be investigated.

    <description>Improvement on self-perceived loneliness, representing the socialization level of the elderly, comparing baseline to the first 8 usual computer classes and after the 8 classes with virtual reality games. This will be verified through a decrease in the score of SELSA-S.
SELSA-S has 15 items, scoring up to 7 in each, 105 in total.</description>

    <description>A minimum of 46 elderly, students of a informatics course, will participate in the study. Initially, the students will have 8 usual informatics classes in the institution where they were enrolled spontaneously. Then, during the next 8 classes (from class 9 to class 16) they will practice 10 minutes of virtual reality games, as part of the class.</description>
