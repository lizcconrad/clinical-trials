  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prove that a study drug is noninferior to a control drug with a proportion of subjects who
      showed HBV DNA undetected (less than 400 copies/mL (69 IU/mL)) at the 48th week after 48-week
      administration of Besifovir 150 mg, or Tenofovir 300 mg as a control drug to chronic
      hepatitis B patients

      -  Screening Period Subject registration is conducted with confirming selection and
           exclusion criteria after a written consent form is obtained within 42 days before
           clinical trial drug administration.

        -  Baseline Subjects who visit on the date of starting clinical trial drug administration
           are randomized to a test group or a control group at a ratio of 1:1. Double blindness is
           applied for both groups.

        -  Treatment period Subjects are orally administered with a clinical trial drug q.ds.i.d.
           for 48 weeks and visit at the 0, 4th, 12th, 24th, 36th, and 48th week for an HBV DNA
           test, laboratory tests, a physical test, vital signs, and adverse events.

        -  Follow-up period Subjects are provided with appropriate treatment after completing the
           48-week trial or dropping out. Subjects visit once at the 60th week for follow-up of
           adverse events, such as acute deterioration of hepatitis B, and HBV DNA test results. If
           any treatment is not conducted after 48-week administration, subjects visit at intervals
           of four weeks until a follow-up visit (60th week) and the same tests with the 24th week
           visit (Visit 5) are conducted. However, subjects who participate in a 48-week separate
           extended trial conducted after 48-week administration in this clinical trial do not have
           a follow-up period.
