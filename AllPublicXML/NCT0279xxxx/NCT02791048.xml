  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to find out if music therapy is effective in improving the quality of life of
      palliative care patients. It will do this by comparing palliative care patients who receive
      music therapy with those who do not receive music therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quality of life (QOL) is very important for palliative care patients, and includes the
      physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of a patient's life. Music therapy is
      often used to help palliative care patients and there is some evidence that music therapy
      helps improve their quality of life, especially in relation to reducing levels of pain. Many
      palliative care patients and their families have also said that music therapy is helpful.
      However, more research is needed to help healthcare providers and funders decide if music
      therapy really is a useful treatment for patients receiving palliative care.

    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire: MQOL (Cohen et al., 1995), which contains 17 items, and has been shown to have the best clinimetric quality rating, content validity, construct validity and internal consistency of reviewed quality of life questionnaires in a systematic review (Albers et al., 2010). Out of 29 instruments evaluated, only the MQOL demonstrated good reliability. However, the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire-Cardiff Short Form (MQOL-CSF: 8 items) (Pratheepawanit et al., 1999), will be considered as an alternative for the main trial if the former instrument is found to place undue burden on respondents. An analysis of the feasibility, reliability and validity of the MQOL-CSF concluded 'that the MQOL-CSF is a feasible tool with favourable psychometric properties for routine HRQoL assessment in the palliative care population' (Lua et al., 2005: 1669).</description>

    <description>Music therapy is a clinical intervention conducted by qualified therapists who use shared music-making and improvisation to engage and interact with the client (s) in order to work towards specific therapeutic objectives.
This is the aim of sessions, rather than the teaching or utilising of any musical skills, and clients do not have to have any prior musical training or experience whatsoever in order to participate in and benefit from music therapy. The intervention is client-led and the therapist will guide the patient in a range of strategies and activities appropriate to the therapeutic aims in place. Sessions can be individual, or family members can also be involved if appropriate and desired.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Only patients deemed able to engage with interactive music therapy will be invited to join
        the study. Eligibility will be assessed by a clinician during inpatient admission or day
        hospice attendance using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale and the
        Abbreviated Mental Test (AMT).

          -  Patients will be eligible if they have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2 (0
             indicating the patient is asymptomatic, 1 the patient is symptomatic but fully
             ambulatory, and 2 the patient is symptomatic and confined to bed for less than 50% of
             the day) indicating they are able to engage with interactive music therapy. - Eligible
             patients will also have a score of 7 or more on the AMT, indicating they are capable
             of providing meaningful informed consent and accurate responses to the study's primary
             outcome measurement tool.

          -  Patients with communication difficulties will also be eligible if they are able to
             indicate their responses to the questionnaire.

          -  Musical skills are not required. Prior musical skills will not lead to exclusion from
             the study. The patient must freely consent to participation following receipt of
             information about the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they have an ECOG performance status of 3
             or 4 (3 indicating the patient is symptomatic and confined to bed for more than 50% of
             the day, 4 indicating the patient is severely symptomatic and completely bedridden) or
             a score of 6 or less on the AMT, indicating they may not be capable of providing fully
             informed consent or accurate responses to the study's primary outcome measurement
             tool.

          -  Participants who decide not to consent will be excluded from the trial. Patients will
             be assured that this decision will have no implications for the care that they
             receive.
