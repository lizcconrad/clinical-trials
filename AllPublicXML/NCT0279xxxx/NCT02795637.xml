      Study of the what the body does to the drug in subjects with mild, moderate, and sever liver
      dysfunction (not working properly)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single-dose study. Approximately 40 total subjects will be enrolled. In
      each of the 3 hepatic impairment groups (mild hepatic dysfunction [Child-Pugh score of 5 -
      6], moderate hepatic dysfunction [Child-Pugh score of 7 - 9], severe hepatic dysfunction
      [Child Pugh score of 10 - 12]) approximately 10 subjects will be enrolled in order to achieve
      8 subjects completing the study in each group. In addition, approximately 8 12 healthy
      subjects with non-impaired hepatic function will be enrolled to match the subjects in the
      hepatic impairment groups. Subjects with non-impaired hepatic function may be matched to more
      than 1 hepatically impaired subject and may be matched to impaired subjects in different
      Child-Pugh categories; ie, mild, moderate, and/or severe. In order to obtain matched control
      subjects, after each subject with hepatic impairment has completed the study, a subject with
      non-impaired hepatic function will be sought; the already enrolled matched control subjects
      will be checked for a match prior to screening and enrollment of a new match. Each matched
      control subject will be selected to be demographically comparable to one or more hepatic
      dysfunction subjects in age (± 10 years), gender, and weight (± 20%). Subjects who do not
      complete the study may be replaced in order to achieve 8 subjects completing the study in
      each hepatic impairment group and appropriate healthy matched control subjects.

      The study will consist of Screening (Days -28 to -2), Inpatient Period (Days 1 through 7),
      and Follow-up (Days 8 28). Screening assessments will be used to classify the degree of a
      subject's hepatic impairment. The degree of impairment will be assigned based on the
      Child-Pugh category for classification for severity of liver disease. Subjects will be
      admitted to the clinical site on the day prior to administration of study drug and remain
      inpatient until discharge on Day 7 (approximately 168 hours after treatment). Subjects may be
      discharged on Day 5, if in the investigator's opinion they can be relied upon to return for
      the Day 6 and 7 visits. The following safety assessments will be performed: physical
      examination; vital signs; clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology, prothrombin time,
      serum chemistry, and urinalysis); AE collection, ECGs, and C SSRS. Blood and urine samples
      will be collected for analyses of study drug concentrations and plasma protein binding. The
      blood sampling duration (648 hours postdose [Day 28]) was chosen to determine the terminal
      half-life of dasotraline, with the expectation that this time may be extended in hepatically
      impaired subjects compared to the control subjects. A blood sample for pharmacogenetics will
      be collected only from subjects who provide separate informed consent to collect this sample.
      The sample will be utilized for potential evaluation of genetic polymorphisms upon selected
      enzymatic pathway(s) responsible for the metabolism of dasotraline; this sample is optional
      for participation in the study.

      Exclusion Criteria continued from Eligibility Section:

      Any subject with hepatic impairment meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded:

          5. Subject must be in general good health be demographically comparable to a least 1
             subject with hepatic impairment who completed the study.

          6. Subject has a negative urine drug screen (UDS).

        Subjects with hepatic impairment must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Male or nonpregnant, nonlactating female between 18 and 70 years of age.

          2. Subject must have a normal neurologic exam including tests for impending hepatic
             encephalopathy. Note: Subjects with grade 0 or 1 hepatic encephalopathy will be
             considered for enrollment in the study.

          3. Subject's weight is at least 50 kg.

          4. Subject's BMI is at least 18 kg/m2 but no more than 37 kg/

          5. Subject has a negative UDS.

          6. Subject with stable, chronic medical conditions (eg, hypertension and hyperlipidemia)
             in addition to hepatic impairment that, in the opinion of the investigator, will not
             significantly alter the disposition of the study drug, will not place the subject at
             increased risk by participating in the study, and will not interfere with
             interpretation of the data may be permitted to enroll in the study after discussion
             and agreement between the investigator and medical monitor.

          7. Subject exhibits vital signs within the reference range for their age and level of
             hepatic impairment; subjects with vital signs outside the reference ranges may be
             eligible for the study if the investigator and medical monitor agree that the results
             are not clinically significant based on the age and hepatic impairment status of the
             subject, and will not impact study conduct.

          8. Subject with out-of-range laboratory results that are related to the subject's
             underlying condition are eligible; however, the results will need to be carefully
             reviewed by the investigator and medical monitor to determine if a subject is eligible
             for study participation. Out of range results could indicate a stable or unstable
             situation. If the subject is unstable (eg, rapidly changing liver tests, significantly
             worsened anemia compared to earlier labs, etc), then such subject would be excluded
             from study participation. Serum bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time will be
             assessed individually for a point score according to the Child-Pugh classification.

          9. Subject has a diagnosis of chronic hepatic impairment for at least 6 months and, in
             the opinion of the investigator, the severity of the subject's hepatic disease is
             stable, which is defined as having no clinically significant change in disease status
             within the 90 days prior to study drug administration, as documented by the subject's
             recent medical history. Copies of documentation of any clinical information used to
             make a previous diagnosis of hepatic dysfunction must be available. This may include
             abnormal liver function tests, clinical evidence of portal hypertension, a positive
             liver biopsy (eg, for cirrhotic disease, portal hypertension), and/or hepatic
             ultrasound.

         10. The total score of the Child Pugh classification must be 5 or 6 for subjects with mild
             hepatic dysfunction, and between 7 and 9, inclusive, for subjects with moderate
             dysfunction, and between 10 and 12, inclusive, for subjects with severe hepatic
             dysfunction.

         11. Subject receiving medication for underlying disease states or medical conditions
             related to hepatic dysfunction must be on a stable dose of medication and/or treatment
             regimen. Subjects who are receiving a fluctuating treatment regimen may be considered
             for inclusion if, in the opinion of the investigator, the underlying disease is under
             control; however these subjects must have medical monitor approval.

         12. Subject with a history of hepatic impairment due to hepatitis B is eligible provided
             there is no evidence of an active disease state, defined as a positive hepatitis B
             antigen test at screening.

         13. Subject with a history of alcohol abuse is eligible provided the urine alcohol test is
             negative.

         14. Subject with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is eligible provided that, in the
             investigator's opinion, he or she has stable diabetes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any subject with non-impaired hepatic function meeting any of the following criteria will
        be excluded:

          1. Subject who does not tolerate venipuncture or has poor venous access that would cause
             difficulty for collecting blood samples.

          2. Subject has any clinically significant unstable medical abnormality, chronic disease,
             or history of clinically significant abnormality of the cardiovascular, respiratory,
             hepatic or renal systems.

          3. Subject has any clinically significant abnormal medical history, physical examination,
