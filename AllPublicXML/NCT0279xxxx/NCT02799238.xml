    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, open-label, multi-centre, Phase II study in patients with newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma.

      Up to 87 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will be enrolled in the study in a 1:2
      allocation (standard of care (SOC): ALECSAT as an adjunct therapy to SOC).

      Data from a further 29 patients gathered from an ongoing observational study of glioblastoma
      patients treated according to SOC at Sahlgrenska University hospital in Göteborg, Sweden will
      be used as historical control data and combined with the randomised control data in
      performing the statistical analysis.

      Patients recruited into this study will receive either:

        -  ALECSAT as an adjunct therapy to standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma
           (first line therapy: Stupp regimen, followed by second line therapy at the
           Investigator's discretion) or

        -  Standard of care therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma (first line therapy: Stupp
           regimen, followed by second line therapy at the Investigator's discretion).
