  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroplasticity-based approaches seem very promising to maintain cognitive health in older
      adults and postpone the onset of cognitive-decline and dementia symptoms. The aims of this
      project are threefold:

        1. the evaluation of the effects of a neuroplasticity-based-cognitive randomized
           computer-based intervention consisting in training with non-action video games on brain
           and cognitive functions that decline with ageing, including attention and spatial
           working memory (WM), in older adults using behavioral measures and electrophysiological
           recordings (event-related potentials -ERPs- and event-related spectral perturbations
           -ERSPs);

        2. the study of the effects of age and 3 months maintenance on the cognitive and neural
           signatures of transfer effects to attentional and spatial WM tasks; and

        3. to investigate the neuroinflammatory mechanisms assessed by non-invasive methods in
           saliva from participants underlying cognitive training-induced effects.

      A better understanding of these mechanisms elucidates pathways that may be targeted in the
      future, either by behavioral or neuropsychological interventions. To achieve these aims, the
      investigators will recruit between 60-80 older adults volunteers to participate in the
      randomized, controlled, single-blind study. After screening, participants will be randomly
      distributed in one of these two groups: experimental and active control. Participants in the
      experimental group will receive 16 1 hour computerized training with non-action video games.
      The active control group will receive 16 1 hour training sessions with a social video game.
      The design is a mixed factorial design with type of intervention (experimental, active
      control) and assessment session (pre, post, maintenance). The results from the proposed
      research project will clarify the existence of transfer-of-benefit and neural mechanisms
      underlying cognitive improvement. The hypothesis is that mental stimulation through
      non-action video games will improve attention and memory, promoting brain and mental health,
      and extending independence among elderly people by avoiding the negative personal and
      economic consequences of long-term care.
