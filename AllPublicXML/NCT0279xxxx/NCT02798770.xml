  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of acquired disability among adults, and one of the main
      causes of death. In Switzerland, the approved time window for stroke treatment with
      intravenous thrombolysis after symptom onset is 4.5 h. Even within the 4.5 h time-window,
      however, the benefit of treatment strongly decreases as time passes.

      Moreover, only around 10% patients receive thrombolytic treatment, since patients with stroke
      arrive too late to the hospital (prehospital delay). Despite efforts to educate the community
      on the symptom of stroke, prehospital delay did not decrease over time, and the reasons
      remain incompletely understood. Prehospital delay reduces the proportion of patients with
      ischemic stroke treated with thrombolysis, and reduces the odds of favorable outcome among
      the minority treated with thrombolysis.

      This prospective cohort study aims at understanding the causes of prehospital delay among
      patients with acute ischemic stroke. Trained study-nurses will interview, at the bedside,
      patients and proxies along a standardized questionnaire on prehospital delay. Avoiding
      modificables causes of prehospital delay may increase the thrombolysis rate and improve
      outcomes after stroke.

    <description>Prehospital delay will be assessed by asking the Patient or witnesses how long the time interval between stroke onset and Hospital Admission is. For instance, if stroke symptoms have onset today at 3:00 PM and the Patient gets admitted today at 4:00 PM, prehospital delay is 1 hour.</description>
