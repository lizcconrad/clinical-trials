  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to learn more about the different ways in which people process
      information that is stressful and rewarding, and how abnormalities in these two processes are
      related to depression.

      Participants will participate in two 3-hour sessions separated by a week at Providence Care,
      Mental Health Services, and a third, 1.5-hour session at the Queen's MRI Facility. At the
      first session participants will complete a packet of questionnaires about their mood and take
      part in an interview about their mood, medications, drug use, and any other symptoms, as well
      as an interview about their relationships with their parents and any experiences of abuse. At
      the second session participants will participate in a stress test, which involves giving a
      speech to a panel. The investigators will also collect saliva samples to look at stress
      hormones. Participants will also complete a task on the computer that involves looking at
      cartoon faces and making decisions about them. At the third session, the investigators take
      images of of participant's brain using a magnetic resonance scanner.

      Participants are invited to participate in a 6-month follow-up for this study, which would
      involve the same procedure as outline above.

      Saliva is collected at eight points across the second session in 5mL vials. Saliva samples
      are assayed for neuroendocrine hormones (e.g., cortisol). Whole blood is collected in EDTA
      tubes at the first session. Whole blood is currently being banked. No assays are being
      conducted at this time.
