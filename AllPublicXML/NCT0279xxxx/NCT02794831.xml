      -  NSAIDs are widely consumed, and some are currently available for self-medication with
           indications 'Pain and Fever' (Cavalié, National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM), 2014)

        -  There is no recommendation to limit their use in bacterial infections except for chicken
           pox in children.

        -  To date, no study has highlighted the aggravating role of exposure to NSAIDs on
           bacterial infections in adults, based on the usual septic severity Levy's score (SSS),
           and mortality, but it delays adequate antibiotics (Legras, Critical Care, 2009)

        -  Community-acquired bacterial infections in adults exposed to NSAIDs are serious by their
           spread (multiple locations), and suppurative character requiring frequent use of
           invasive procedures such as surgery or drainage. The SSS does not reflect the
           seriousness of these infections. They are frequently associated with use of ibuprofen
           (63.4%), and self-medication practices (65.5%).

      The main hypothesis is that NSAIDs exposure is associated with a specific severity of
      community-acquired bacterial infection, marked by dissemination, suppurative complications or
      even invasive procedures requirement.

      Our objectives are also to:

        -  Describe what NSAID use terms are associated to the risk of serious bacterial
           infections: molecule, dosage, duration of exposure, access (prescription or
           self-medication), associated drugs.

        -  To determine what type (s) (s) of bacterial infection is worsened by exposure to NSAIDs.

        -  To determine if other risk factors contribute to severity of bacterial community
           acquired infection

        -  To describe hospital costs associated to such severity of bacterial infection

    <description>The risk studied is the exposure to NSAIDs, the overall medication history will be collected for cases and controls. The standard questionnaire to document medications history, including self-medication, was previously published (Asseray et al., 2013) The window of exposure to drugs is defined as 14 days before hospital admission. Drug exposure will be assessed at the time of inclusion.</description>
