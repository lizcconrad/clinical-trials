      Objective Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed for resolving
      cholestasis by sphincterotomy and/or stone extraction and is done with deep sedation or
      general anesthesia. The investigators primary outcome was to evaluate the effects of the
      depth of anesthesia on oxidative stres provided via Bispectral Index (BIS) monitorisation
      during the ERCP procedure by analyzing the biochemical parameters. And their secondary
      outcome was the effects of anesthesia depth on propofol consumption and postoperative
      sedation status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 patients undergoing ERCP procedure were randomly allocated in two groups. Propofol was
      given to provide the patients Ramsey sedation scale as 3 and 4 in Group R (n=25) patients
      whereas it was given to Group B (n=25) patients to provide BIS values between 65 to 85. The
      levels of total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and Oxidative stres
      index (OSI) were measured. Hemodynamic signs, propofol consumption, postoperative recovery
      time were recorded.
