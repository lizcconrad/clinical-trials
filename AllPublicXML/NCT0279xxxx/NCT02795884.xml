      This study will be performed as a local multicenter, randomized, phase III clinical study. It
      will compare the adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC with common EGFR mutation (Exon
      19 deletion or L858R) who underwent total resection and the Erlotinib-Intercalation adjuvant
      chemotherapy with the chemotherapy alone. The patients will be randomly assigned to the
      Intercalation combination chemotherapy regimen and the chemotherapy alone regimen at the
      ratio of 1:1. The treatment regimen of each arm is as follows.

    <description>During the intercalation phase of the initial 12-week period, erlotinib is to be orally administered at the dose of 150 mg daily from Day 8 to Day 21 at every cycle of 21 days. During the maintenance phase after 12 weeks, it is orally administered at the cycle of 28 days without a wash-out period at the dose of 150 mg daily for one year. The combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin will be administered for 4 cycles in total by each cycle of 21 days, and it is to be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion on every Day 1. Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 will be diluted in 100 ml of 0.9% saline solution and will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion for 10 minutes. Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 will be diluted in 150 ml of 0.9% saline solution and will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion for 10 to 15 minutes. The combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin will be administered for 4 cycles in total by each cycle of 21 days, and it is to be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion on every Day 1.</description>
