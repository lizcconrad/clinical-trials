      Non-randomized, Single Arm Clinical study to Evaluate the Safety and Effectiveness of MR
      Guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery in the Treatment of Early Breast Carcinomas

      Study specific aim is to Coagulate the tissue volume of a proven breast cancer with MRgFUS
      and Collect post treatment follow-up clinical and radiological data for a period of 5 years
      following MRgFUS for breast cancer.

      Safety of the treatment will be evaluated by recording and assessing the incidence and
      severity of device- related complications from the first visit through the 5 years follow-up
      period.

      Secondary objective of this study is to evaluate post treatment local recurrence in the same
      quadrant or less then 4cm from the periphery of the treated lesion, during a 5 year period
      following the MRgFUS treatment.

      Women with breast cancer in whom breast MR imaging identifies a single focal breast lesion up
      to 1.5 cm in diameter will be eligible for the study.

    <description>MR images of the breast will be obtained for lesion localization purposes. The breast surgeon or the radiologist will make a treatment plan or map. Sonication at therapeutic power level will be performed on multiple overlapping points successively until sonication of the target volume has been completed.
Follow-up evaluation will be made within 14 to 21 days after the MRgFUS treatment.</description>
