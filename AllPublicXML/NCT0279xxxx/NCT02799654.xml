    <textblock>
      In this Post Market Clinical Follow-up Study (PMCF Study), the short-term clinical and
      radiological results of the cementless Excia T® prosthesis in routine clinical use shall be
      assessed and the migration taking place in the first 24 months evaluated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subsidence over time of Excia T® stem (EBRA-FCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>discharge (approx. 1 week postop), 3, 12 and 24 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The subsidence of the Excia T stem will be measured with Ein-Bild-Röntgen-Analysis Femoral Component Analysis (EBRA-FCA). EBRA allows a non-invasive measurement of routinely taken A/P radiographs. Necessary is a series of at least four x-rays that can be read by the EBRA software.
The whole implant must be visible on the A/P x-ray, as well as the greater and lesser trochanter.
Subsidence shall be measured on the follow-up x-rays in comparison to the discharge x-rays.</description>

    <time_frame>preoperative, discharge (approx. 1 week postop), 3, 12 and 24 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical assessment will be done with the Harris Hip Score (HHS)</description>
