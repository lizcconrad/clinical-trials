  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis (BV), abnormal vaginal flora (AVF) and vulvovaginal
      candidiasis (VVC) are associated with serious complications and discomfort. Yet, treatment
      options are limited. Lactobacilli administration was suggested to treat and prevent vaginal
      infections. However, this has not been examined in pregnant women, the information regarding
      oral treatment is scarce, and the mechanisms in which oral ingestion of probiotics induce
      vaginal lactobacilli proliferation are not well established. In the present study we will
      examine if oral probiotics are effective in prevention and eradication of vaginal infections
      by migration of lactobacilli from the digestive system to the vagina in pregnant women.

      During pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis (BV), abnormal vaginal flora (AVF) and vulvovaginal
      candidiasis (VVC) are associated with serious complications and discomfort. Yet, treatment
      options are limited. Lactobacilli administration was suggested to treat and prevent vaginal
      infections. However, this has not been examined in pregnant women, the information regarding
      oral treatment is scarce, and the mechanisms in which oral ingestion of probiotics induce
      vaginal lactobacilli proliferation are not well established.

      Working hypothesis: Oral probiotics will be effective in prevention and eradication of
      vaginal infections by migration of lactobacilli from the digestive system to the vagina in
      pregnant women.

      Type of research and methods of data collection: randomized placebo-controlled trial.
      Pregnant patients with symptoms consisted with vaginal infection will be examined and vaginal
      smear will be obtained, according to which the patients will be allocated to the following
      groups:

      Normal vaginal flora (primary prevention) Positive for AVF/BV- those will be treated with
      oral antibiotic. Following treatment, another smear will be taken according to which the
      patients will be divided into: (1) patients with normal vaginal flora (secondary prevention).
      (2) patients with persistent AVF/BV (eradication).

      Positive for VVC- those will be treated with vaginal clotrimazole after which, patients with
      eradication will be included (secondary prevention).

      In each group the patients will be divided into two subgroups, which will receive one capsule
      twice a day of either the Probiotic capsules or placebo.

      At the initial examination and once a month all the study groups will be tested for the
      presence of AVF/BV, candida and semi-quantitative assessment of vaginal lactobacilli.
      Additional vaginal samples will be taken to evaluate the presence of lactobacilli from the
      capsule.
