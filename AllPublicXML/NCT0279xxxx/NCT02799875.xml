  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants, less than 37 weeks gestation with respiratory distress syndrome, who remain
      ventilated between 7 and 14 days after birth will be randomized to a ventilator strategy of
      either a higher level of permissive hypercapnia or of a lower level of permissive hypercapnia
      to determine if either strategy will increase the number of alive ventilator-free days in the
      28 days after randomization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      22.0 to 36.6 weeks gestational age preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome, who
      remain ventilated between 7 and 14 days after birth will be randomized to one of two
      ventilator strategies: 1) a higher level of permissive hypercapnia or 2) a lower level of
      permissive hypercapnia to determine if either strategy will increase the number of alive
      ventilator-free days in the 28 days after randomization.

      After parental consent obtained, intubated, mechanically ventilated infants will be
      randomized by use of sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes to the treatment
      assignment. Randomized infants will be stratified by gestational age at delivery (&lt; 26 weeks,
      ≥ 26 wks but less than 29 weeks, and ≥ 29 weeks). Multiple births will be randomized to the
      same group. The envelope will be opened only on days 7-14 when infant meets criteria.
      Clinicians will follow pre-specified algorithms of extubation and reintubation criteria to
      wean infants from mechanical ventilation. The ventilation algorithms may be set aside until
      the infant is deemed stable enough to allow resumption of the study algorithm.

      Infant will be extubated within 24 hours of meeting extubation criteria and documented on a
      single blood gas. A trial of extubation per attending physician is allowed independent of the
      trial protocol.All other care is per unit standard.

      Reports of routine follow-up after discharge in babies &lt; 27 weeks gestation will be obtained
      to determine neurodevelopmental impairment on this subset of babies.
