  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an ascending dose first-time-in-human study to determine the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacodynamic (PD), and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of GSK1795091 in
      healthy subjects. The results will support the design of future clinical trials of GSK1795091
      administered to subjects with advanced malignancies in combination with immune system
      modulators.

      Part 1 will be a randomized, double-blind (sponsor-unblinded), placebo-controlled, single
      center, single dose escalation, sequential group evaluation of intravenously administered
      GSK1795091 to evaluate the safety and tolerability in healthy subjects. Part 2 will be an
      open-label, parallel group evaluation of 2 doses of GSK1795091 administered, either 1 week
      apart (Part 2, Cohort 1) or 2 weeks apart (Part 2, Cohort 2). In Part 2, on Day 1, subjects
      will receive intravenous GSK1795091 at a dose determined by results from Part 1. The total
      duration of this study is approximately 10 weeks from screening to the last study visit.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests,
             vital signs and 12-lead ECG. (A subject with a clinically insignificant abnormality or
             laboratory parameter(s) may be included only if the Investigator documents that the
             finding is unlikely to represent a safety risk and will not interfere with the study
             procedures.)

          -  Body weight 55-95 kilogram (kg) and body mass index within the range 19-30 kg/meter
             (m)^2 (inclusive).

          -  Male or Female of non-childbearing potential:

        Males: Male subjects with female partners of child bearing potential must comply with the
        pre specified contraception requirements.

        Females: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed
        by a negative serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin test), not lactating, and is
        either of non-reproductive potential or reproductive potential. If of reproductive
