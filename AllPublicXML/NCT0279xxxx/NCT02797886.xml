      The goal of the study is to explore the effect of combined training involving functional
      electrical stimulation (FES) of the ankle dorsal flexor with simultaneous maximal-effort
      voluntary contraction of the same muscle to correct or improve foot drop in chronic stroke
      patients. Participants will be assessed for functional motor ability and neurological
      function during their first visit and then again after five and then ten weeks of training.
      Functional motor ability is broken down into dorsiflexion strength and general gait analysis.
      Dorsiflexion strength is measured by use of a dynamometer. Gait is assessed via recordings of
      electromyography, pedobarography, kinematic, and various functional variables during 10
      walking trials. The neurological assessment will include electroencephalographic (EEG)
      analysis of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), somatosensory evoked potentials
      (SSEP), and M-wave response to stimulation. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      three groups: 1) FES + volitional movement (VOL), 2) FES alone, and 3) VOL alone, which will
      determine their training regimen. The training sessions involve roughly 20 minutes of
      repeated muscle contractions (with appropriate breaks to avoid fatigue). The participants
      assigned to the FES+VOL group will receive electrical stimulation to the peroneal nerve in
      concert with volitional dorsiflexion, whereas the other groups will either dorsiflex
      voluntarily with no stimulation or receive stimulation while being asked to do nothing.
