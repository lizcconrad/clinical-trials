  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted intervention designed to improve the
      safety of opioid prescribing. The specific aims of this study are to: (a) evaluate whether a
      multifaceted intervention (Improving the Safety of Opioid Prescribing; ISOP) enhances opioid
      safety, (b) assess whether participation in ISOP impacts the clinician-patient relationship,
      and (c) explore to what extent ISOP is associated with changes in pain and pain-related
      function.

      The investigators will randomize primary care providers (PCPs) at the VA Portland Health Care
      System to either ISOP or the control condition; patients will be nested by clinician status.
      All PCPs who enroll will participate in either a two-hour educational workshop or the
      two-hour educational workshop + nurse care manager (NCM). The NCM will maintain a registry of
      enrolled patients, track opioid medication-related events from the medical record, and
      provide decision support to PCPs for issues related to prescription opioid safety. The NCM
      will also meet individually with enrolled participants to discuss strategies for
      preventing/reducing opioid side effects, preventing diversion, and providing rationale for
      screening for prescription opioid misuse. The investigators will recruit patients who are
      already prescribed chronic opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain. Participants will be
      enrolled for one year. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after
      enrollment.

    <description>Primary care providers and PACT nurses will participate in the same workshop as those randomized to the control condition (or academic detailing for those unable to attend the workshop). Clinicians randomized to the intervention will additionally collaborate with a nurse care manager (NCM) who will maintain a registry of enrolled patients, track UDT administrations and results, query prescription drug monitoring databases, monitor other evidence of potential problems, and collaborate with expert consultants to provide decision support when patients have evidence of prescription opioid misuse or abuse. The NCM will also meet with patients to discuss methods to reduce opioid adverse effects, prevent misuse, and provide rationale for prescription opioid adherence monitoring.</description>
