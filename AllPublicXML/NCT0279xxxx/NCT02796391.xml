      STUDY 1: INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to
      help people stop smoking by using very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes. This
      developmental pilot study (n=20) will determine the feasibility of the treatment approach and
      methodology using a targeted intervention, and lead to refinements for a subsequent
      randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      STUDY 2: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL The purpose of this study is to see if a targeted
      intervention will help people to stop or reduce smoking better than a standard intervention
      using very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes, and to determine the optimal nicotine
      tapering schedule (gradual vs. immediate) during a 5-week pre-quit period. About 208
      participants will take part in this phase of the study at Moffitt Cancer Center.

  <detailed_description>

      The current project will (1) develop a theory-based, user-friendly, and efficient set of
      targeted cessation materials to facilitate extinction during pre-quit VLNC smoking, (2)
      establish the feasibility of recruitment and measurement strategies to be used in the RCT,
      (3) determine whether immediate vs. gradual pre-quit nicotine tapering in combination with
      the targeted behavioral intervention has beneficial effects (on cessation-related and
      intermediate outcomes) for eventual comparison with validated cessation methods (e.g., NRT),
      and (4) examine several potential moderators and mediators of treatment efficacy.
