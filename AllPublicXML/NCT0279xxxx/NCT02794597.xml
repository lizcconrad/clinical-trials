  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests that women with substance use disorders may be at a higher risk of
      unintended pregnancy. There is a paucity of interventions specifically focused on this
      population. Through using mixed methods, this study proposes to develop a brief peer-led
      intervention (based on the Health Belief Model) to prevent unintended pregnancies among women
      entering opioid medication-assisted treatment; to assess acceptability, feasibility and the
      initial efficacy of the behavioral intervention; and to conduct exploratory analyses to
      identify the HBM constructs that are most influential on use of long-acting reversible
      contraception methods. Future research would include testing the intervention in a larger
      scale trial and with other populations.

      This study aims to develop a reproductive health intervention to support dual protection
      against STI/HIV and unintended pregnancy for women of child-bearing age in opioid
      medication-assisted treatment (OMAT). It will be conducted in two phases. The first formative
      phase will employ individual interviews and focus groups with women between the ages of 18
      and 44 and in OMAT to better understand: pregnancy desires/motivation and perceived
      susceptibility and severity, contraceptive knowledge, perceived benefits/barriers,
      self-efficacy, social norms, behaviors, and access to contraception and family planning
      services, especially related to LARCs. This information, coupled with prior evidence and
      theory, will be used to develop a brief peer-led behavioral intervention.

      In the second phase, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the
      acceptability, feasibility and the initial efficacy of the developed intervention. Women will
      be recruited from two OMAT facilities and once they have consented and the baseline survey is
      completed they will be randomized to either the behavioral intervention or usual care.
      Participants will complete a baseline, three and six-month post-baseline follow up survey. At
      the end of each interview or focus group, participants will receive an educational sexual
      health pamphlet.

      The first session will occur immediately post-consent and baseline, and the second will occur
      2-4 weeks post-baseline. A trained peer-educator will deliver the behavioral intervention
      that will provide accurate, unbiased information about Long Acting Reversible Contraception
      (intrauterine devices and subdermal implants) and all other contraceptive methods (including
      effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages), help women assess their needs (pregnancy
      desires compared to behavior), and utilize motivational interviewing to empower them to make
      an informed decision regarding their sexual health. For those that are interested in birth
      control, the peer-educator will also connect women to a DH Community Health Clinic or a
      clinic of their choosing to further explore appropriate birth control methods. The medical
      clinic will assess the woman and determine and dispense the most appropriate method.
