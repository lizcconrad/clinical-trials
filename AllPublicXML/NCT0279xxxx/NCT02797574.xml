  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate stress response pathways in tissues and
      melanocytes from patients with vitiligo. Investigators are collecting evidence of UPR and
      stress response activation in tissues and melanocytes from patients with vitiligo.
      Individuals with vitiligo will have punch biopsies to study stress response UPR activation
      and NF-κB signaling to test our hypothesis. In order to characterize differences between
      disease and normal states, a second arm of control individuals (Arm 2) will be recruited.

      Identifying a role for NF-κB signaling in vitiligo may improve therapies for this disfiguring
      disorder. Current treatments vary in effectiveness and may not always be long lasting cases.
      The NF-κB pathway and IL-6 itself are the target of several FDA approved drugs, thus opening
      new therapeutic avenues.
