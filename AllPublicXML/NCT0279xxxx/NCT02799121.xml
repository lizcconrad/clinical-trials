    <textblock>
      This prospective case series is to gain additional clinical experience in the treatment of
      diabetic foot ulcers, by documenting and relating patient history (including baseline wound
      characteristics) and clinical outcomes (incidence of healing, rate of healing, and patient
      and physician satisfaction) in a group of study participants for whom the ReGenerCell™
      Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (ReGenerCell™) is used in combination with conventional
      therapy for the closure of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Participants will receive
      ReGenerCell™ treatment in addition to standard care (debridement, cleansing, dressings,
      offloading).
