  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Watson
      Laboratories, Inc.'s Pimecrolimus Cream, 1% to those of Valeant Pharmaceuticals North America
      LLC's Elidel® (pimecrolimus) Cream, 1%, and to demonstrate the superior efficacy of the two
      active creams over that of the placebo (Vehicle of test product), in the treatment of mild to
      moderate atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pimecrolimus cream, 1% is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant. Pimecrolimus inhibits T
      cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. Pimecrolimus cream, 1% is
      indicated as second-line therapy for the short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of
      mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised adults and children 2 years of
      age and older who have failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments,
      or when those treatments are not advisable. This study is being conducted to evaluate the
      clinical bioequivalence of sponsor's formulation of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%, the Test product,
      and Elidel Cream, 1%, the Reference product. A vehicle control arm is included to demonstrate
      that the Test and Reference products are active and to establish that the study is
      sufficiently sensitive to detect differences between products.

          -  Non-immunocompromised male or female aged 12 years or older.

          -  A clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis that has failed to respond
             adequately to other topical prescription treatments for atopic dermatitis, or subjects
             for whom the use of those other treatments is deemed inadvisable.

          -  A diagnosis of atopic dermatitis for at least 3 months.

          -  A baseline Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of disease severity of mild or
             moderate (score of 2 or 3).

          -  An affected area of atopic dermatitis involvement of at least 5% of the body surface
             area (BSA) at Visit 2/Day 1 (Baseline), as defined by the criteria of Hanifin and
             Rajka (1980).

          -  Treatment with a bland emollient for at least 7 days prior to Visit 2/Day 1
             (Baseline).

          -  Agree to adhere to protocol-specified requirements and concomitant therapy
             restrictions.

             evaluations.

          -  Willing and able to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, apply
             the study medication as instructed, return for the required study visits, comply with
             therapy prohibitions, and complete the study.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential (excluding women who are surgically
             sterilized [hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral ovariectomy] or have
             been postmenopausal for at least 1 year) must have a negative urine pregnancy test and
             must be willing to use a medically accepted method of contraception during the study.
             The following are considered acceptable methods of birth control for the purpose of
             this study: oral contraceptives, contraceptive patches, contraceptive implant, vaginal
             contraceptive, double barrier methods (e.g., condom and spermicide), contraceptive
             injection (Depo-Provera®), intrauterine device (IUD), hormonal IUD (Mirena®), Essure®

             are on hormonal contraceptives must have been on the method for at least 90 days prior
             to the study and continue the method for the duration of the study. Subjects who had
             used hormonal contraception and stopped must have stopped no less than 90 days prior

             2/Baseline that would interfere with the study evaluations.
