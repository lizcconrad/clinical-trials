  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous Thromboembolic Disease (VTE) in SCI patients is very common, its prevalence is 60 to
      80% against 10-20% in the general population.

      The risk of VTE is very important in the first weeks after spinal cord injury, and then
      declines with a prevalence of VTE slightly higher than the general population after 12 weeks.
      However there is no prospective study of incidence of VTE in SCI patients after 3 months. The
      investigators wish to conduct such a study during the year following spinal cord injury with
      performing venous Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs 6, 9 and 12 months of the initial
      injuryassociated with a standardized clinical assessment, to know the incidence of VTE and
      determine prognostic factors for VTE.
