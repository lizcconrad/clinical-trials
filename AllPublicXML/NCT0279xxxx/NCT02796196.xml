      This research trial studies prescribed physical activity in improving sleep and physical
      performance in patients undergoing stem cell transplant. A wearable physical activity monitor
      can be used to record minutes of activity and sleep. Gathering data over time using a
      physical activity monitor may help doctors learn if prescribed physical activity helps
      improve sleep and physical performance in patients undergoing stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate whether prescribed physical activity, as part of standard care, improves sleep
      and functional outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (stem cell
      transplantation) patients during a typical 30-day hospitalization period.

      OUTLINE:

      Data including demographics, type of HCT (e.g., allogeneic or autologous), preexisting
      physical conditions (e.g., chronic joint injury), chronic renal failure (CRF), steroid use
      data, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores
      are collected from patients' medical charts at time of enrollment. Patients are prescribed
      participation in a primarily self-directed physical activity program which encourages them to
      spend 6 hours out of bed daily and to perform 30 minutes of light-to-moderate daily aerobic
      activity. Patients who are able to maintain independent mobility undergo physical therapist
      assessment 2 times a week until hospital discharge. Patients wear a physical activity
      monitoring device and daily activity and sleep data are collected continuously during
      hospital length of stay (LOS).

    <description>Will use interval-censored regression to estimate distributions of activity from one day to the next. This repeated-measures analysis with a polynomial model will generate average curves for activity, each spanning average LOS (i.e., activity duration plotted on day one, day two, day three, etc.). Will also run diagnostics to verify the assumptions of a linear model (e.g., statistical independence of observations and lack of undue influence of outliers on model fit).</description>

This repeated-measures analysis with a polynomial model will generate average curves for sleep, each spanning average LOS (i.e., sleep duration plotted on day one, day two, day three, etc.). Will use multiple linear regressions to control for potential confounders in predicting sleep duration. Will also run diagnostics to verify the assumptions of a linear model (e.g., statistical independence of observations and lack of undue influence of outliers on model fit).</description>
