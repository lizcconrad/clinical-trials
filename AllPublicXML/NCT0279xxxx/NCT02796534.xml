  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 1 diabetes have poorer glycemic control that could lead to macrovascular
      or neuropathic complications; in addition to an optimal treatment, prevention of diabetes
      complications requires to control associated risk factors, such as hypertension or
      dyslipidemia. Sleep apnea syndrome is a public health problem due to its high prevalence and
      marked morbidity and mortality, one increasingly interesting aspect is its relationship with
      metabolic disorders, specifically diabetes.Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome seems to be
      underestimated in this population. In this context, it appears to be important to estimate
      the prevalence of sleep respiratory diseases in patients with type 1 diabetes.
