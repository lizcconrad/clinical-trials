  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine treatment therapy that will reduced regimen-related toxicity and
      relapse while promoting rapid immune reconstitution with limited serious
      graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and also improve disease-free survival and quality of life.
      The investigators propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of selective naive T-cell
      depleted (by TCRɑβ and CD45RA depletion, respectively) haploidentical hematopoietic cell
      transplant (HCT) following reduced intensity conditioning regimen that avoids radiation in
      patients with hematologic malignancies that have relapsed or are refractory following prior
      allogeneic transplantation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate engraftment by day +30 post-transplant in patients who receive
           TCRɑβ-depleted and CD45RA-depleted haploidentical donor progenitor cell transplantation
           following reduced intensity conditioning regimen without radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the safety and feasibility of the addition of Blinatumomab in the early
           post-engraftment period in patients with CD19+ malignancy.

        -  Estimate the incidence of malignant relapse, event-free survival, and overall survival
           at one-year post-transplantation.

        -  Estimate incidence and severity of acute and chronic (GVHD).

        -  Estimate the rate of transplant related mortality (TRM) in the first 100 days after
           transplantation.

      Blood progenitor cells will be obtained from a partially matched adult family member (donor).
      After processing and filtration using the CliniMACS device, cells will be infused into
      participants meeting eligibility criteria.

      Prior to transplant, participants will receive a conditioning treatment of rabbit ATG,
      cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, thiotepa, melphalan, and rituximab. Mesna will be given to
      help prevent side effects of cyclophosphamide. Tacrolimus will be given to help reduce the
      risk of GVHD. G-CSF will be given after transplant to help the donor progenitor cells make
      white blood cells faster so that the immune system is better able to fight infection.

      Blood progenitor cells will be given in two infusions on Day 0 and Day +1. Progenitor cells
      then move through the blood stream to the bone marrow space where they should begin to grow.
      Participant blood will be monitored for 100 days to assure that the progenitor cells begin to
      grow. If the growth is low, additional progenitor cells may be given.

      Blood tests will be monitored for up to one year to observe how well the donor cells grow and
      their effect on the infection-fighting system.

    <description>The mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products). These can then be separated in a magnetic field using an immunomagnetic label specific for the cell type of interest, such as CD3+ human T cells.</description>
