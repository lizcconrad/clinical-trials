      Phase 1a/1b multicenter dose-escalation study of ARC-521 Injection in normal healthy
      volunteers and patients with chronic hepatitis B. Eligible participants who have signed an
      Ethics Committee (EC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent form and
      have met all of the protocol eligibility criteria will be enrolled as follows:

        -  Normal healthy volunteers will enroll sequentially into a total of 6 escalating dose
           levels (6 subjects per dose level), randomized to receive a single dose of ARC-521
           Injection or placebo. The maximum study duration for NHVs is approximately 21 weeks.

        -  HBeAg negative CHB patients will enroll sequentially into 3 dose levels (8 patients per
           dose level) to receive multiple doses of open label ARC-521 Injection. For each CHB
           patient the maximum study duration is approximately 37 weeks.

      Patients will undergo the following evaluations at regular intervals during the study:
      medical history, physical examinations, vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate,
      respiratory rate, and temperature), weight, adverse events assessment (AEs), concomitant
      medications/therapies assessment, electrocardiograms (ECGs), telemetry [NHVs only], measures
      of hepatic fibrosis [CHBs only], blood sample collection for hematology, coagulation,
      chemistry, Pharmacokinetics (PK) [NHVs only], metabolic analysis [NHVs only], exploratory
      Pharmacodynamic (PD) measures, urinalysis, HBV serology, immunogenicity, Follicle Stimulating
      Hormone (FSH) testing (post-menopausal females) and pregnancy testing for females of
      childbearing potential. Clinically significant changes including AEs will be followed until
      resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until
      the patient is lost to follow-up. Prior to enrollment there is a 60 day screening period.
