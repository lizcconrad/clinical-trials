      The main purpose of this trial is to investigate the effects of a new class of drugs that
      help the patient's immune system attack their tumor (glioblastoma multiforme - GBM). These
      drugs have already shown benefit in some other cancer types and are now being explored in
      GBM. Both tremelimumab and durvalumab (MEDI4736) are &quot;investigational&quot; drugs, which means
      that the drugs are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Both drugs are
      antibodies (proteins used by the immune system to fight infections and cancers). Durvalumab
      attaches to a protein in tumors called PD-L1. It may prevent cancer growth by helping certain
      blood cells of the immune system get rid of the tumor. Tremelimumab stimulates (wakes up) the
      immune system to attack the tumor by inhibiting a protein molecule called CTLA-4 on immune
      cells. Combining the actions of these drugs may result in better treatment options for
      patients with glioblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the T-cell changes that occur in glioblastoma (GBM) treated with tremelimumab
      and durvalumab (MEDI4736) as single agents and in combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of either tremelimumab or MEDI4736 alone and in combination in
      patients with GBM.

      II. To determine the time to progression for patients treated with either tremelimumab or
      MEDI4736 alone and in combination of both, post-surgery.

      III. To determine the overall survival for patients treated with tremelimumab or MEDI4736
      alone and in combination of both post-surgery.

      IV. To assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in patients treated with either
      tremelimumab or MEDI4736 alone and in combination of both post-surgery.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate T-cell changes and programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) expression with patient
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM 1: Patients receive tremelimumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 2: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 2
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM 3: Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 then, after a gap of 1 hour for
      the first cycle, durvalumab IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks
      with tremelimumab for up to 7 courses and every 2 weeks with durvalumab for up to 14 courses.
      Patients then receive both tremelimumab and durvalumab IV over 1 hour every 12 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients undergo surgical tumor resection on day 14.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 8-16 weeks for 2 years.

          -  Patients must have had radiographic evidence of tumor progression by brain MRI or
             computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast

          -  Patients must be &gt; 12 weeks from completion of radiation therapy unless there is
             tissue confirmation of tumor recurrence or there is progression outside the radiation
             treatment field

          -  Prior therapy with gamma knife or other focal high-dose radiotherapy is allowed, but
