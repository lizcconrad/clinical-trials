  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intraocular tumor of childhood. Recurrent or
      refractory disease following therapy most often occurs due to persistence of vitreous disease
      and/or retinal reactivation of the main tumor mass. With this treatment protocol,
      investigators seek to identify a less invasive method of local drug delivery that does not
      disrupt the eye's integrity.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To determine the safety and toxicity profile associated with intravitreal carboplatin
           for the treatment of recurrent or progressive intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous
           seeding.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To estimate the ocular salvage rate after treatment with intravitreal carboplatin in
           patients with recurrent or progressive intraocular retinoblastoma with vitreous seeding.

        -  To evaluate the effects of intravitreal carboplatin therapy on the histopathology of
           eyes enucleated for progressive or recalcitrant disease while on therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The eye(s) will be sterilized prior to injection. Aqueous fluid (0.1-0.15ml) will be
      withdrawn and sent for pathology review. Carboplatin diluted in normal saline will be
      administered via intravitreal injection under anesthesia once to each eligible eye
      approximately every 14 days. Following the injection, triple freeze/thaw cryotherapy is
      applied to the injection site and the eye is washed with water. The eye is gently &quot;shaken&quot; in
      all directions to evenly distribute the drug.

      This trial will use a traditional phase I design for dose de-escalation with two dose levels.
      The first 6 patients will be enrolled at dose level 1 and will be observed for dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) throughout the treatment period up to approximately 5 months after start of
      therapy. If 0-2 (of the first 6) participants experience DLT, a second cohort of 6 patients
      will be enrolled at the same dose level 1. Study accrual would be completed at 12.

      However, if 3 or more of the first 6 patients experience DLT at dose level 1, the dose level
      would be de-escalated to level -1 and 6 patients enrolled at this level (dose -1). If 0-2
      patients experience DLT at dose level -1, a second cohort of 6 patients will be enrolled at
      dose level -1, and the study accrual would be complete. If 3 or more patients experience DLT
      at dose level -1, accrual would also be complete.

    <description>DLTs are defined as any of the following: uveitis, sterile or infectious endophthalmitis, retinopathy or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, massive vitreous hemorrhage that obscures direct visualization of the retina/tumor, and/or cataract that threatens the visual axis or view by treating physician.
Grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions should lead to discontinuation of intravitreal carboplatin injections. Patients who have grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions will not be evaluable for this objective and will be replaced.</description>

    <intervention_name>Carboplatin</intervention_name>
    <description>Carboplatin will be given intravitreally. Participants are eligible to receive up to 8 injections per eye (once approximately every 14 days) based on lack of toxicity and evidence of tumor response. An injection of consolidation will be given once a complete response is observed. If further regression of &quot;stable&quot; seeds is noted, additional injections (up to 8 maximum per eye) will be provided at the discretion of the treating team. Injections could be repeated if vitreous recurrence occurs from another source (and patient has not reached 8 max limit per eye).</description>
