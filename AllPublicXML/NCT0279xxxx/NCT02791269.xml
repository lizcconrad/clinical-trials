  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access, multicenter, national, open-label, and non-randomized study to
      analyze the safety of peginterferon alfa-2a in participants with hepatitis B e antigen
      (HBeAg) positive and HBeAg negative chronic HBV infection. All participants will receive 48
      weeks treatment of peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy, followed by a 24 week treatment-free
      follow-up period.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) Seroconversion</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48 (end of treatment) and Week 72 (end of follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>HBsAg seroconversion was defined as the absence of HBsAg (a negative result for HBsAg) and the presence of anti-HBs (a positive result for anti-HBs). Both HBeAg positive and negative participants were HBsAg positive at baseline and absence of HBsAg (seroconversion) was analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Normalization of Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48 (end of treatment) and Week 72 (end of follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>ALT is an enzyme found mainly in liver and is measured to check if the liver is damaged or diseased. In case of liver damage or disease, the liver releases ALT into the blood stream and the ALT level increases. Normal ALT level = less than upper limit of normal (40 units per liter).</description>
