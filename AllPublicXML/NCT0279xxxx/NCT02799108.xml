  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent data published by various laboratories as well as our preliminary data tend to prove
      that near-infrared spectroscopy can be used to determine the lateralization of language as
      part of the preoperative assessment for drug-resistant epilepsy. The reference test used up
      until very recently was the Wada test, which consisted of injecting an anaesthetic (generally
      amobarbital sodium) into one of the internal carotid arteries (right or left) in order to
      determine the predominant cerebral hemisphere for language. This invasive test has been
      progressively replaced by fMRI, which is nevertheless difficult to perform in children under
      the age of 7 years. NIRS therefore appears to be a useful alternative, which, in contrast
      with fMRI, can be easily repeated and allows simple investigation of the various facets of
      language (e.g. expressive, receptive). In the GRAMFC unit, the investigators have acquired a
      unique know-how in the field of high-resolution NIRS, both in epilepsy and in the development
      of language structures.
