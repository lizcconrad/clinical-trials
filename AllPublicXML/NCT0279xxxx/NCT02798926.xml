  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Particular attention is paid to thermal management of preterm neonates in neonatal intensive
      care units because of the major risk of morbidity associated with hypothermia. Percutaneous
      central venous catheter placement is essential to ensure adequate caloric intake and
      intravenous administration of treatments, but this procedure can cause major body temperature
      variations, responsible for complications in these neonates, as convection incubator function
      is impaired during opening of the incubator, which can be prolonged (30 minutes to 2 hours)
      depending on the technical difficulties encountered during catheter placement.

      In parallel, the use of a polyethylene bag or sheet in the delivery room and for neonatal
      transport is now clearly defined and ensures stability or even a considerable temperature
      gain during transfer immediately after birth. In the light of several clinical cases, the use
      of a polyethylene bag during central venous catheter placement appears to be effective to
      prevent body temperature loss in preterm neonates. No data are currently available concerning
      the value of this method of prevention of hypothermia during this type of procedure.

      Preliminary studies conducted by our team on a dummy suggest that a polyethylene bag or sheet
      could be useful during this procedure by significantly reducing heat loss caused by
      convection and evaporation. However, compensation phenomena such as generalized
      vasoconstriction to cold in preterm infants are very poorly described, but can induce a
      functional conflict between mechanisms ensuring maintenance of homeostasis and those involved
      in maintenance of blood pressure.
