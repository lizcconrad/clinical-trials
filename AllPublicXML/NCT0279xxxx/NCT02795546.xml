      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the bone formation potential of 400µg
      alendronate(ALN) delivered in β-TCP in the treatment of periodontal intra-osseous defects.

      Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with periodontal defects were randomly assigned to
      400µg ALN + β-TCP + saline (test) group and β-TCP + saline (active-control) group. Clinical
      parameters like clinical attachment level (CAL) gain, probing depth (PD) reduction,
      post-operative gingival recession (GR) were assessed from the baseline, 3 months and 6 months
      recordings. Radiographic parameters like linear bone growth (LBG), percentage bone fill
      (%BF), change in alveolar crest height (ACH) were assessed from baseline and 6 months
      radiographs.
