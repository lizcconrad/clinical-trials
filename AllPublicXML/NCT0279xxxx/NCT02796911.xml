    <textblock>
      Objective: Periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics(PAOO) will minimize treatment
      time. The current study will be carried to evaluate the effectiveness of different bone
      grafts with a modified, less invasive corticotomy technique in the treatment of adult
      patients with moderate crowding.

      Subjects and Methods: Thirty orthodontic patients will be selected. Patients were randomly
      classified into three groups. Group I will be treated with a modified technique of
      corticotomy, whereas group II will be treated with the same technique combined with PAOO
      using bovine derived xenograft, and group III will be treated with the same technique
      combined with PAOO using with bioactive glass. The total duration of active orthodontic
      treatment will be estimated. Probing depth, bone density and root length will be also
      evaluated. The measurements will be recorded.

      Objective: Periodontally accelerated osteogenic orthodontics(PAOO) combines periodontal
      therapy with orthodontic therapy, which will minimize treatment time. The current study will
      be carried to evaluate the effectiveness of bovine derived xenograft versus bioactive glass
      with a modified, less invasive corticotomy technique in the treatment of adult patients with
      moderate crowding.

      Subjects and Methods: Thirty orthodontic patients will be selected. Patients were randomly
      classified into three groups. Group I will be treated with a modified technique of
      corticotomy on the labial side only, whereas group II will be treated with the same technique
      combined with PAOO using bovine derived xenograft, and group III will be treated with the
      same technique combined with PAOO using with bioactive glass. The total duration of active
      orthodontic treatment will be estimated from the time of starting the active orthodontic
      treatment, immediately following the corticotomy procedure, to the time of debonding. Probing
      depth will be evaluated clinically whereas bone density and root length will be evaluated
      radiographically. The measurements will be recorded at day of surgery (baseline) (T1),
      post-treatment at time of debonding (T2), and 9 months post-treatment (T3).
