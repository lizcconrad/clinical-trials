  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prophylactic probiotics have been shown to decrease the incidence of Necrotizing
      Enterocolitis (NEC) in premature neonates. However, there is some resistance to giving live
      bacteria to small babies. Based on animal data, the investigators hypothesized that heat
      inactivated probiotics would also reduce NEC.

      Preterm neonates, &lt;1500 gm birth weight will potentially be candidates for study and will be
      recruited when they begin enteral feeding. The infants will be prospectively and randomly
      assigned to one of two groups:

        1. Treatment group - to receive daily inactivated probiotic prophylaxis starting with the
           initiation of feeds. 1 tsp powder will be diluted in 2 cc of mother's milk when possible
           or in Similac Special Care formula 24 cal when mother's milk is not available; and

        2. Control group - to receive 2 cc/day of placebo similarly diluted. Supplements will be
           continued until the infant tolerates enteral feeds of 100 cc/kg/day or reaches 35 weeks
           post conceptual age (whichever comes LAST). Biotikid, a probiotic mixture, will be
           heated to 100 degrees C for 10 minutes. Babies will be followed clinically for signs of
           NEC, and with urine intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and fecal calprotectin
           levels.

      The investigators primary aim is to demonstrate that premature neonates who are treated
      prophylactically with heat inactivated probiotics will have less necrotizing enterocolitis
      when compared to age matched infants given placebo.

      The investigators secondary objectives are to demonstrate the following:

        -  That the decrease in NEC will coincide with improved intestinal barrier integrity, as
           reflected by levels of:

        -  I-FABP in urine

        -  Fecal Calprotectin
