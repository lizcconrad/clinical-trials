  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the radiographic and clinical outcomes after short
      versus conventional plaster cast fixation time in reduced distal radius fractures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Displaced distal radius fractures treated with closed reduction and plaster cast fixation are
      radiographed 10 days (range 8-13 days) after reduction and randomized to one of two study
      arms; immediate removal of plaster cast or continued fixation in plaster cast for another 3
      weeks. Radiographic and Clinical outcome measurements at 1, 4 and 12 months
