      The present study is designed to determine whether adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      improves overall survivals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in gallbladder carcinoma (GBCA) or extrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) is unknown. A retrospective study suggested that chemoradiotherapy
      provides greater benefit than chemotherapy alone in GBCA patients. SWOG S0809, a phase II
      study showed that adjuvant chemoradiotherapy has promising efficacy in GBCA or EHCC. The
      present phase III clinical trial is designed to compare adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      with chemotherapy alone.

    <description>Patients in arm 1 will receive adjuvant chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patients will receive four cycles of gemcitabine (1,000mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8) and capecitabine (1,500mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 14) every 21 days followed by concurrent capecitabine (1,330mg/m2 per day) and radiotherapy (50.4Gy/28fx to regional lymphatics with or without tumor bed)</description>
