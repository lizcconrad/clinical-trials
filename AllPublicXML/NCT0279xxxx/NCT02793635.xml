  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the use of Indego as a gait training tool for subjects
      with complete or incomplete paraplegia as a result of spinal cord injury (SCI) who have
      preserved lower extremity function. It is hypothesized that subjects with complete or
      incomplete paraplegia who have preserved their lower extremity function will experience
      functional improvements after gait training with the Indego exoskeleton.

      Subjects will complete a total of fifteen (15) sessions which include a combination of the
      following; Physical Therapy Evaluation, Indego Training, Mid-Way Assessment, and
      Post-Assessment.

      The aim of this study is to measure the impact of gait training with the Indego device on
      body structure, function, and participation. Additionally it will assess the perceptions of
      physical therapists and subjects with SCI on the effectiveness of gait training with the
      Indego exoskeleton in subjects with preserved limited function.
