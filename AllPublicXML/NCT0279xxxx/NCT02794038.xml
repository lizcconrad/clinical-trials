      This study scope is to validate the accuracy and usability of the Soberlink Cellular Device
      in comparison to a predicate device, BACtrack S80 Pro.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this accuracy and usability study is to validate the performance of Soberlink
      Cellular Device in the hands of the intended (lay) users - untrained study participants who
      have consumed alcohol and use the Soberlink Cellular Device to measure their blood alcohol
      content (BAC) in comparison to a predicate device.

      The purpose of this document is to define how the human factors environment impacts the
      actual user interface design as well as how usability engineering evaluates user interface
      via usability objectives and usability tests. This accuracy and usability study will be
      performed on Soberlink Cellular Device in order to comply with FDA's Draft Guidance for
      Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, titled: Applying Human Factors and Usability
      Engineering to Optimize Medical Device Design, IEC 60601-1-6 (collateral standard for
      usability engineering of medical electrical equipment), and IEC 62366 (application of
      usability engineering to medical devices).

    <measure>Validate the accuracy of the Soberlink Cellular Device in comparison to a predicate device, BACtrack S80 Pro and assessed by linear regression.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Performance validation will occur by evaluating the accuracy of the Soberlink Cellular device in the hand of intended users - untrained study participants who have consumed alcohol and use the device to measure their blood alcohol content (BAC). 40 adults will be recruited who have recently consumed alcohol. The only assistance to be provided is the labeling. No additional coaching, either written or verbal, will be provided to study participants. Participants should obtain a BAC reading with the Soberlink Cellular device, and a second BAC reading with a comparator device. The second measurement will be taken within 5 minutes of the first. A linear regression line for the comparison between results of the Soberlink Cellular device and a comparator will be made.</description>

    <description>Performance validation will occur by evaluating the usability of the Soberlink Cellular device in the hand of intended users - untrained study participants who have consumed alcohol and used the device to measure their blood alcohol content (BAC). 40 adults who have recently consumed alcohol will be asked to evaluate the Soberlink Cellular device. The only assistance provided is the labeling. No additional coaching, either written or verbal, will be provided to study participants. Participants should obtain a BAC reading with the Soberlink Cellular device, and a second BAC reading with a comparator device. The second measurement should be taken within 5 minutes of the first. Following the second measurement a questionnaire will be administered to study participants to evaluate the ease of use of the Soberlink Cellular device.</description>
