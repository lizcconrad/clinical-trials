    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate bioequivalence between the test drug product,
      fulvestrant Injection, 50 mg/mL, and the Reference Listed Drug, Faslodex® Injection, 50
      mg/mL.

    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to establish bioequivalence between sponsor's test product
      [fulvestrant Injection, 50 mg/mL (Manufactured for Fresenius Kabi, USA)] and reference listed
      drug [Faslodex® Injection, 50 mg/mL, (Distributed by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, USA] after
      intramuscular administration of a 250 mg dose (5 mL injection) into the upper outer quadrant
      of the right buttock to normal, healthy, nonsmoking post-menopausal female subjects.

      The order of receiving the test product (T) or reference listed drug (R) for each subject
      during the study will be determined according to a randomization schedule.

      Subjects will be allocated with a ratio of 1:1 to both treatment groups (i.e. T and R).

          -  A history of allergic or adverse response(s) to fulvestrant, castor oil, benzyl
