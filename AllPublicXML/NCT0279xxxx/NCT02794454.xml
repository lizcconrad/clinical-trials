  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexual function is a part of a normal healthy life and considered to be essential for mental,
      physical and marital well-being. Any derangement in normal function though is a distressing
      situation for the individual, is often not reported due to embarrassment or due to social
      stigma. Sexual disorders in men are categorized according to the stage of sexual response
      affected in terms of disorders of erectile function, ejaculatory function or libido, albeit
      there is considerable potential for overlap amongst the disorders. The use of current
      intervention has many side-effects and has been prohibited in cardiovascular condition and
      also to be taken with caution with other medical condition.

      This has led to the development of multiple alternate therapies which are helpful for a
      limited number of cases but the major concern for all these therapies is their late onset of
      action and not having a sustained effect.

      Enovate Biolife is trying to improvise further their already marketed product HeezOn® by
      adding new botanicals thus naming it HeezOn Ultra. HeezOn®has been studied on 148 subjects
      and has proven to be beneficial for subjects with mild to moderate ED. The previous study
      fell short to capture the data for subjects who were also suffering from PE and their overall
      quality of life-related to sexual health. Therefore, the trial is designed to study the
      speedy and sustained effect of the improvised formula on different aspects of sexual
      dysfunctions.
