  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in which a total of 120 patients
      will be selected from a broad spectrum group of typical Americans (all demographics including
      various races and both genders as well as ages from 25-90) who have confirmed Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus and suffer from mild to moderate lower extremity Peripheral Neuropathy. All patients
      will meet inclusion and/or exclusion criteria.

      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in which a total of 120 patients
      will be selected from a broad spectrum group of typical Americans (all demographics including
      various races and both genders as well as ages from 25-90) who have confirmed Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus and suffer from mild to moderate lower extremity Peripheral Neuropathy. All patients
      will meet inclusion and/or exclusion criteria.

      Randomization and Application of HL Device The placebo controlled group of 60 patients will
      be randomized from the group of 120 patients by one designee who selects the placebo vs
      treatment groups based on acceptable statistical standards for determining placebo vs
      treatment arms of research studies. There will be two different HL Devices. There will be the
      HL-NIR device that includes NIR diodes and performs Near Infrared therapy and an identical
      appearing second device, the HL-SHAM device, that is used as the placebo device and although
      appearance is identical, this device does not perform Near Infrared treatment. Both placebo
      group and treatment group subjects will have the NIR or sham device applied to both lower
      extremities for a short duration three times a week over the course of several weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on oral hypoglycemic medication, and/or
             injectable insulin

          2. Hg A1C 5.7 or above ((Pre-Diabetes is 5.7 to 6.4%) (Diabetes is above 6.5%)), Hg A1C
             below 9.1

          3. Peripheral Neuropathy of the feet, or feet and legs

          4. If the patient has a lower extremity ulceration that is not showing any signs of
             infection, and this patient has ABPI and TBPI above 55 mm of Hg, they may be included
             in the study, at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI). If the patients
             infection is localized (not osseous in nature) and the infection can be treated and
             cleared and remain uninfected for 30 days, the patient could be reevaluated and
             included in the study at the discretion of the PI.

          5. If the patient has an area of injury or erythema or induration, they may still be
             included in the study if they have ABPI and TBPI above 55 mm of Hg, at the discretion
             of the PI

          9. Current injury or trauma

         10. Skin ulceration

         11. ABPI and TBPI measurements will be measured and if the patient has an open ulceration

         21. Pregnancy or planned pregnancy (If a patient has begun our research study and does not
             know that they are pregnant or they become pregnant during the study, they will not be
             dropped from the study) (Reasoning: there is no evidence for or against using
             HealthLight therapy in pregnant individuals.)

         22. Active osteomyelitis or positive for osteomyelitis within the past six months
