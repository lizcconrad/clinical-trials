    <textblock>
      The study is conducted to evaluate the potentially improved patient handling of the ELLIPTA
      Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI). Therefore, the study aims to evaluate errors encountered by subject
      with asthma during handling ELLIPTA DPI relative to two metered dose inhalers (MDI), a GSK
      MDI and the AstraZeneca (AZ) MDI. It is a randomised, multi-centre, open-label, cross-over
      study comparing placebo ELLIPTA DPI with placebo MDI (GSK and AZ) to assess correct inhaler
      use. No active drug will be used in this study in order to prevent any drug-related effects.
      Approximately, 152 subjects will be randomized to receive ELLIPTA DPI inhaler and 152 will be
      randomized to receive one of the MDI inhalers, for use during the first period (P)
      (approximately 28 days). At Visit 2 (Day 28) all subjects previous receiving the ELLIPTA DPI
      will be randomized to receive one of the MDI inhalers and all subjects who received a MDI in
      the previous period will receive the ELLIPTA DPI for use during second period (approximately
      28 days). Subjects will continue taking their asthma maintenance treatment and limited rescue
      albuterol MDI during the entire 56-day study period.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Zero Errors in ELLIPTA DPI Versus GSK MDI and AZ MDI After 28 Days of Use in Each Treatment Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>A checklist for correct use of each inhaler was developed based on the steps identified in the package insert. Baseline assessment was conducted when the par were dispensed the inhaler and were guided by a trained healthcare provider (HCP) to demonstrate correct use of the assigned inhaler. A second assessment was conducted after each 28 day dosing period without instruction by HCP. The Correct Use Check list was completed by HCP at each visit. Percentage of par with zero errors in inhaler use at Day 28, was analyzed using a Mainland-Gart test for each ELLIPTA versus MDI comparison separately (Sub-study 1: ELLIPTA vs GSK MDI and Sub-study 2: ELLIPTA vs AZ MDI). For each ELLIPTA vs MDI analyses, only par who made no error in any of the inhalers and at least one error on the other inhaler (discordant cases) were included in the analysis. NA indicates that par did not receive the inhaler in that particular sub-study.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of each type of error while using ELLIPTA inhaler was evaluated based on the information collected in the Correct Use Checklists. The number of errors for each type of inhaler was assessed at Visit 2 and Visit 3. The par were counted more than once depending on the reasons for incorrect use. Only par who made at least one error was included in the summary (represented by the number of Participants).</description>

    <description>The occurrence of each type of error while using GSK MDI in Sub-Study 1 and AZ MDI in Sub-Study 2 was evaluated based on the information collected in the Correct Use Checklists. The number of errors for each type of inhaler was assessed at Visit 2 and Visit 3. The par were counted more than once depending on the reasons for incorrect use. The number of errors is reported as NA for the type of error which was not applicable to the particular inhaler type.

    <description>The number of errors per par for each inhaler (ELLIPTA and GSK MDI or AZ MDI) was evaluated based on the information collected in the Correct Use Checklists.

      <recruitment_details>This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label, cross-over study comparing Placebo ELLIPTA Dry Power Inhaler (DPI) with either Placebo GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) or Placebo Astra Zeneca (AZ) MDI to assess correct inhaler use. A total of 20 sites in the United States (US) participated in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 329 participants (par) were screened out of which 324 were randomized to sub-study 1 and sub-study 2 in a ratio of 1:1. Each par received at least one-dose of placebo from at least one study inhaler. These par comprised the intent to treat (ITT) population. Par were randomized on the same day as screening.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Par were randomized to treatment sequence 3 or 4. In treatment sequence 3, the par were dispensed Placebo ELLIPTA DPI at Visit 1 for treatment period 1 and Placebo GSK MDI at Visit 2 for treatment period 2. In treatment sequence 4, the par were dispensed Placebo GSK MDI at Visit 1 for treatment period 1 and Placebo ELLIPTA DPI at Visit 2 for treatment period 2. ELLIPTA was a two strip inhaler with one placebo strip containing lactose monohydrate and a second placebo strip containing lactose monohydrate blended with magnesium stearate. GSK MDI contained propellant (1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane). ELLIPTA DPI was taken as one inhalation, once daily and GSK MDI was taken as two inhalations, twice daily. Par continued taking their asthma maintenance treatment and limited rescue albuterol MDI during the entire 56-day study period.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Zero Errors in ELLIPTA DPI Versus GSK MDI and AZ MDI After 28 Days of Use in Each Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>A checklist for correct use of each inhaler was developed based on the steps identified in the package insert. Baseline assessment was conducted when the par were dispensed the inhaler and were guided by a trained healthcare provider (HCP) to demonstrate correct use of the assigned inhaler. A second assessment was conducted after each 28 day dosing period without instruction by HCP. The Correct Use Check list was completed by HCP at each visit. Percentage of par with zero errors in inhaler use at Day 28, was analyzed using a Mainland-Gart test for each ELLIPTA versus MDI comparison separately (Sub-study 1: ELLIPTA vs GSK MDI and Sub-study 2: ELLIPTA vs AZ MDI). For each ELLIPTA vs MDI analyses, only par who made no error in any of the inhalers and at least one error on the other inhaler (discordant cases) were included in the analysis. NA indicates that par did not receive the inhaler in that particular sub-study.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Zero Errors in ELLIPTA DPI Versus GSK MDI and AZ MDI After 28 Days of Use in Each Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>A supportive post-hoc analysis on the primary endpoint was performed to address possible concerns due to the exclusion of data from a large number of participants who made no errors or at least one error on either inhaler tested in the primary analysis (only discordant cases involved in the analysis). For each ELLIPTA versus MDI comparison separately (Sub-study 1: Ellipta vs GSK MDI and Sub-study 2: Ellipta vs AZ MDI), the percentage of par having zero errors in inhaler use at Day 28 was analyzed using a Conditional Logistic Regression adjusting for treatment (inhaler) and treatment period. NA indicates that the par did not receive the inhaler in that particular sub-study.</description>

ELLIPTA was a two strip inhaler with one placebo strip containing lactose monohydrate and a second placebo strip containing lactose monohydrate blended with magnesium stearate. GSK MDI contained propellant (1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane). ELLIPTA DPI was taken as one inhalation, once daily and GSK MDI was taken as two inhalations, twice daily. Par continued taking their asthma maintenance treatment and limited rescue albuterol MDI during the entire 56-day study period.</description>
