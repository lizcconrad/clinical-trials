  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies show that incontinence is relatively common during pregnancy and after
      delivery. Experiencing incontinence during pregnancy or in the first year after delivery
      increases the risk of long term incontinence. There is scarce documentation of the long term
      prevalence of anal incontinence (AI) in Norway. This study aims to explore prevalence and
      risk factors for incontinence approximately six years after delivery among the 1718 who
      participated in two previous studies exploring the prevalence and predictors of anal
      incontinence in late pregnancy and during the first year after first delivery, and the effect
      of pelvic floor muscle exercises as treatment for anal incontinence after delivery. Increased
      awareness and knowledge about risk factors and long term prevalence of anal incontinence
      among health professionals as well as pregnant and parous women may give indications about
      which women to target for preventative measures to reduce the risk of new onset of postpartum
      AI during pregnancy and after delivery. Further, increased knowledge may aid in planning
      individualized follow-up during pregnancy and the first year as well as in the long term
      among women with existing AI symptoms.
