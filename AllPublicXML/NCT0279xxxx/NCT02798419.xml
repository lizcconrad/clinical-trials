        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects, any gender or race, must be in good general health as determined by the
             Investigator with a clinical diagnosis of common warts.

          2. Subjects must have at least 1 visible, discrete, common wart with at least a 3 mm
             longitudinal diameter on the hands, feet (excluding soles) and palms (in that order of
             priority).

          3. The warts must have been present for at least the past 12 weeks, but not more than 3
             years

          4. Subjects must agree to only use the study products and to not use any other
             wart-removing product (prescription, OTC or occlusion) during the course of the study.

          5. Subjects must be free of any systemic or dermatologic disorder, which in the opinion
             of the Investigator, will interfere with the study results.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use contraception during the
             study. All women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             at Screening and Baseline and at 4, 8 &amp; 12 weeks visits.

          7. Subjects are physically able to apply study product to all affected areas or can
             obtain help.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Women who are pregnant or nursing or planning to become pregnant during the study.

          2. Subjects who have been treated for warts within the 30 days prior to the Baseline
             Visit (e.g. salicylic acid, azelaic acid, cryotherapy).

          3. Subjects who have participated in a trial involving any investigational product in the
             30 days prior to the Baseline Visit.

          4. Subjects with chronic or active liver disease, renal impairment, cutaneous or systemic
             lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder, immunosuppression, or any other disease
             or medical condition that would interfere with the study or place the subject at
             unacceptable risk, as determined by the investigator.

          5. Subjects on immunosuppressive agents that would impact their immune response e.g.
             cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, etc.

          6. Subjects who use or have used local/systemic steroids or any other immunosuppressive
             medication within the 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit.

          7. Subjects who use or have used systemic or topical retinoids within the 30 days prior
             to the Baseline Visit.

          8. Subjects who are unable to comply with study requirements.

          9. Subjects with other skin diseases like molluscum contagiosum that may confound the
             evaluation of common warts.

         10. Subjects who have received treatment for any type of cancer within 5 years of the
             Baseline Visit, except skin cancer and cervical cancer (in situ) are allowed if at
             least 1 year before the Baseline Visit.

         11. Subjects unable to comply with study requirements
