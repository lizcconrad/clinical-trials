  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a major source of handicap, for which physical treatments are often
      underutilized with respect to chemical or surgical treatments. Yet, dopaminergic treatments
      alone prove unable to stop or control the gradual worsening of motor disability after a few
      years.

      The training program that this study sets out to evaluate aims to restore balance between
      agonist extensors and antagonist flexors in Parkinson's disease.

      There is indeed in Parkinson's disease an imbalance between weak flexors and weaker
      extensors, with excessive predominance of the flexors. The hypothesis of the study is that a
      motor strengthening program targeting extensor muscles specifically will improve body posture
      and restore motor function better than a conventional physical therapy program, in mild to
      moderate Parkinson's disease.

      This is a parallel-group, single blind, randomized trial (investigators will be kept unaware
      of the physical treatment followed by study subjects).

      The duration of patient participation is 5 months: 2-month intervention and 3-month follow-up
      following the intervention.

    <description>In the Asymmetric Motor Strengthening program, the principle is to concomitantly reinforce the &quot;body openers&quot; and stretch the &quot;body closers&quot;. One alternates two types of practice during a session. Active exercises consist of fatiguing series of rapid alternating movements against light weights working on movements of extension/abduction/external rotation/supination. Stretch postures consists of short 1-2 minutes bouts of flexor/internal rotator/adductor/pronator stretch. The duration of rehabilitation program is 8 weeks.</description>
