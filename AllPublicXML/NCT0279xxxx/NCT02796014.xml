  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Dermatological Diseases Family Impact Scale (DeFIS) was developed to assess different
      aspects of health-related quality of life in the relatives of the patients with various skin
      diseases. The preliminary validation of this instrument was performed for the Turkish
      population. In the pilot study, this 15-item-questionnaire was shown to be easy to complete
      and score, and reliably help to evaluate the family members' quality of life.

      Psoriasis is a chronic disease which can be expected to have a significant impact on the
      quality of life of the patients and parents/family members alike. In line with this
      assumption, previous studies demonstrated that psoriasis psychosocially affects not only the
      patients, but also their close relatives. The psoriasis family index has been developed in an
      effort to objectively measure the health-related quality of life of the family members of
      patients with psoriasis. Nevertheless, data regarding the health-related quality of life of
      the parents of pediatric patients with psoriasis in the Turkish population are relatively
      scarce.

      In study, the investigators primarily aim to utilize DeFIS to assess the impact of childhood
      psoriasis on the quality of life of the patients' parents. Further, the investigators attempt
      to investigate the relation between the quality of life of the patients and their parents,
      and reveal disease characteristics which might influence the quality of life.
