  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single site, mechanistic study of asthmatic subjects and healthy,
      non-asthmatic controls involving a baseline characterization visit and a research
      bronchoscopy visit. We will identify differences in airway epithelial epigenetic enhancer
      signatures in asthma, by analyzing freshly isolated airway epithelial cells from healthy
      controls and from well-characterized subjects with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The airway epithelium is critical for normal lung function and changes in the epithelium are
      central to the development of asthma. Precise regulation of gene transcription is essential
      for airway epithelial cell differentiation and transcription changes lead to many
      abnormalities seen in asthma. Despite the dominant role of enhancers in regulating
      transcription, little is known about how these DNA regulatory elements control airway
      epithelial cell transcription or about how enhancer activity differs in asthma compared to
      health. Closing this knowledge gap will have a major impact on our understanding of normal
      epithelial development and asthma. In addition, enhancer-based approaches for reprogramming
      the airway epithelium promise to be powerful tools for dissecting mechanism that will set the
      stage for developing a new class of precisely targeted treatments for asthma. Our overall
      goals are to identify enhancers that are important in regulation of key airway epithelial
      cell genes, to determine how enhancer activity changes in asthma, and to develop approaches
      for targeting the activity of these enhancers.

    <description>We previously identified changes in epithelial gene expression in individuals with asthma.

          4. No history of allergic rhinitis/seasonal allergies

        Inclusion Criteria (Asthmatic participants):

          1. Male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 70 years

          2. Ability to provide written informed consent and ability to comply with the
             requirements of the study

          3. History of asthma

          4. No use of oral or inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma during the past
             6 weeks

          5. Hyperreactivity to methacholine (PC20 FEV1 Methacholine &lt; 8 mg/ml)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The same exclusion criteria will apply to both Sub-studies.

          1. Current smokers, defined by (a) &gt;5 cigarettes smoked in past 12 months, and (b) ≤ 8
             weeks since last time smoking; or former smokers who have a total smoking history ≥10
             pack-years
