    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of non-operative antibiotic
      management of clinically diagnosed acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children. Enrolled
      patients will be randomised and an allocation ratio of 1:1 will be made via weighted
      minimisation, where half of the patients will receive non-operative management with
      intravenous Piperacillin with Tazobactam, while the other half will have an appendicectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Appendicectomy for acute appendicitis is one of the most commonly performed paediatric
      emergency operations in Australia. This standard treatment of acute uncomplicated
      appendicitis (AUA) has remained largely unchallenged since its introduction in the late
      nineteenth century, under the assumption that AUA progresses to perforation and thus
      complications should an operation be withheld. However, appendicectomy via laparoscopic or
      open approach is not without its risks.

      Non-operative management (NOM) with antibiotics has been increasingly accepted as mainstay
      therapy for many intra-abdominal infections. In fact, children with appendicitis complicated
      by perforation, abscess or phlegmon formation are often preferentially treated
      non-operatively with antibiotic therapy, with or without percutaneous drainage. Systematic
      reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that antibiotics are a safe and effective
      treatment for AUA in adults and there is growing evidence that NOM is safe and effective in
      children.

      Primary objectives:

      To determine the safety and efficacy of non-operative antibiotic management of clinically
      diagnosed likely AUA in children.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To compare the safety and efficacy of NOM of clinically diagnosed likely AUA with
           operative management (OM) in children.

        2. To assess the cost-effectiveness of NOM of clinically diagnosed likely AUA against OM in
           children.

        3. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of NOM of appendicitis in children.

      This study will enrol 226 patients, age 5-16 years, with acute uncomplicated appendicitis at
      two tertiary children's hospitals. Allocation ratio of 1:1 will be made via weighted
      minimisation using the following criteria: age (5-8 years or 9-16 years), gender (male or
      female), and duration of symptoms (&lt;48 or &gt;48 hours).

    <description>Children in the NOM group will receive intravenous Piperacillin with Tazobactam (Tazocin) 100mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for at least 24 hours, and they will be observed and reassessed within 24 hours after randomisation. A further 24 hours of intravenous Piperacillin with Tazobactam therapy will be offered to children in invariable condition. A clinical decision will be made by the attending surgeon to offer OM if a patient's condition deteriorates at any time, or if a patient has failed to improve after 48 hours of intravenous antibiotic therapy. Once the patient is clinically improving and tolerating oral intake, the antibiotic regimen will be changed to oral Amoxicillin plus Clavulanic acid (Augmentin) 22.5mg/kg/dose twice per day to complete a total seven day course of antibiotics. Oral Ciprofloxacin 15mg/kg/dose twice daily and oral Metronidazole 10mg/kg/dose twice daily will be offered to children who are known to have an intolerance or allergy to Amoxicillin or Clavulanic acid.</description>

    <description>Children allocated to OM may receive preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis as clinically indicated. Appendicectomy will be performed laparoscopically, or via open surgery according to the surgeon's standard practice. Postoperative antibiotic treatment will be determined on the basis of intraoperative findings in accordance with the institutional practice. The appendix specimen will be examined by a paediatric pathologist, and the formal histopathology report will be recorded.</description>
