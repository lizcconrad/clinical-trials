  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Cooling Bolero is a a vest filled with a new material (not ice or a gel) that provides
      controlled cooling by absorbing heat. The vest is manufactured by Nanohealth. It intended to
      provide moderate cooling (~15C/59F) through indirect contact with the skin. The material in
      the device is safe, non-toxic, and eco-friendly.

      Recent anecdotal studies of women with common peri-menopausal and menopausal symptoms (hot
      flashes, night sweats, flushing/sweating of face and neck, and intermittent sleep
      disturbances) have shown a reduction in both the frequency and intensity of those symptoms
      after using the Cooling Bolero. Specific (moderate) temperature cooling of the neck and upper
      torso appears to target and mitigate these common menopausal symptoms. This pilot study
      attempts to collect additional data on the effects of the Cooling Bolero.

      Participants who have consented for this study will first be asked to complete a Baseline
      Assessment of their menopausal symptoms, including documentation of their baseline weight. If
      the assessment indicates that the participant has at least 'moderate' menopausal symptoms,
      then she will then enter the Run-In Period.

      During the two-week Run-In Period, participants will use a Symptom Diary for to document the
      frequency and severity of their menopausal symptoms. At the start of Week 3, participants
      will return their completed Run-In Period Symptom Diary and receive their Cooling Bolero with
      instructions on how to use the product during the Treatment Period.

      During the Treatment Period, participants should use the Cooling Bolero at least two times
      per day (morning and evening) for one hour. As feasible, the participant should start to wear
      the product 30 minutes prior to meal time for these two applications. The participant may
      also wear the product at additional times, as desired. All applications of the Cooling Bolero
      during the four-week Treatment Period are to be documented in the Product/Symptom Diary.
      During the Treatment Period, the participant will also continue to document the frequency and
      severity of their menopausal symptoms in the Product/Symptom Diary.

      At the end of Week 6, the participant will stop using the Cooling Bolero. She will be asked
      to complete a Product Assessment and have her weight documented.

      Participants will be contacted at Week 10 to ask about the status of menopausal symptoms
      after four weeks of not using the Cooling Bolero.
