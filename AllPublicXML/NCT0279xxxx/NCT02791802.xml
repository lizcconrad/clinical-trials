  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter multinational prospective two-arm matched-pair observational study aims to
      establish a prospective comparison of active lipoprotein apheresis treatment approved and
      conducted according to German guidelines for the indication of elevated Lp(a) versus a
      maximum tolerated lipid-lowering therapy as standard care. Due to the prospective character
      and the inclusion of a control arm, this will be the first clinical study that can confirm
      the relevance of the established approach to use lipoprotein apheresis in those subjects and
      its effects to reduce the individual cardiovascular risk. The optimized management of
      subjects in the control group (not receiving lipoprotein apheresis) will also help to clarify
      the controversial issue, to which extent intensive medical care per se can influence the
      occurence of subsequent cardiovascular events. Primary objective of the trial is to evaluate
      the clinical benefit of Lp(a) reduction using lipoprotein apheresis on myocardial infarction,
      PCI, CABG and death from cardiovascular disease. The primary objective of this study
      evaluates the clinical benefit of weekly lipoprotein apheresis in subjects with progressive
      cardiovascular disease, as accepted by the German Federal Joint Committee as indication for
      subjects with elevated Lp(a). Comparator will be matched subjects under maximum tolerated
      lipid lowering therapy without access to lipoprotein apheresis treatment. The clinical
      benefit will be defined as the reduction of the composite endpoint of major adverse
      cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as either myocardial infarction, PCI, CABG or death
      from cardiovascular disease over a period of at least 2 years after completion of visit 1b
      and until at least 60 events of the primary end-point occurred in group B. If the number of
      at least 60 documented primary endpoint events within 2 years of the completion of enrolment
      did not occur, the study will continue until this number of primary endpoint events has
      accumulated.

A stable and maximum tolerated statin therapy has to be used for a minimum of 12 months prior to enrolment. Additional lipoprotein apheresis is established following enrolment using the following established systems: Dextran-sulfate adsorption (DSA) from plasma and whole blood, Heparin-induced LDL precipitation apheresis (HELP®), Polyacrylate adsorption from whole blood and simple DFPP (DALI® and Monet®), ApoB100-immunoadsorption (TheraSorbLDL®, Temperature-optimized double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP).</description>

      <textblock>
        All participants have to be 18 years or older and need to be intellectually capable to
        understand and follow the study protocol. All subjects have to present with progressive
        cardiovascular disease and need to fulfill the criteria fixed in the recommendations by the
        German Joint Federal Committee (in German: &quot;Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss&quot;; see section 1.2).
        In addition, a TEC has to verify presence of the treatment indication and will be blinded
        with respect to subject's group assignment. Apheresis subjects (group A) will be included
        in chronological order, since this will most likely reflect the natural distribution of
        disease in the general population. Control subjects (group B) will then be matched to the
        lipoprotein apheresis subjects entering the study.
