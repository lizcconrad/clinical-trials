      This randomized controlled pilot study will evaluate the effects of Transcendental Meditation
      Â® (TM) on female offenders with trauma. Twenty-two inmates at the Coffee Creek Correctional
      Facility in Wilsonville, Oregon, with at least four months left of incarceration, will be
      enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either a TM (n=11) or a
      wait-list control group (n=11). Subjects will be measured at baseline and four-month
      posttest, using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian version (PCL-C) Twenty
      of the subjects (10 in each group) will take part in their treatment assignment and complete
      post-testing.
