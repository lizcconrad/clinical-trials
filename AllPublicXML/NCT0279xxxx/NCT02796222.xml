  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recombinant factor VIII Fc (rFVIIIFc) and recombinant factor IX Fc (rFIXFc) are extended
      half-life coagulation factors approved by Health Canada in 2014 for the treatment of severe
      hemophilia A and B, respectively. The objectives of this observational study is to describe
      the change in annual factor consumption, clinical and patient-reported outcomes for patients
      who switch from recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) and recombinant factor IX (rFIX) to
      rFVIIIFc/ rFIXFc in Canada, and to explore clinicians' and patients' reasons for switching or
      not switching.
