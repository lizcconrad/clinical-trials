  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerance of generic travoprost with
      its brand name formulation. In this open label, randomized, crossover study, the primary
      outcome will be intraocular pressure and the secondary outcome will be tolerance to the
      drops, as measured by a subjective questionnaire. Patients will be randomized to receive
      either brand name or generic travoprost during the first visit. At the second visit 3 weeks
      later, their intraocular pressure will be measured and a questionnaire will be completed on
      the tolerance of the medication. Patients will then receive the other formulation of
      travoprost. At the third and final visit, another 3 weeks later, their intraocular pressure
      will be measured and a questionnaire will be completed on the tolerance of the second
      medication.

    <description>Depending on the arm, either brand name or generic Travoprost will be administered by the patient. After 3 weeks, the intraocular pressure will be measured and a crossover will happen. Patients having taken brand name Travoprost will be switched to generic Travoprost and vice versa. At 6 weeks, the intraocular pressure will be measured. Questionnaires on the comfort and intolerances of the drops will be administered at the visits of 3 and 6 weeks.</description>
