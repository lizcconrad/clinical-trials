  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is defined as a loss in skeletal muscle mass and function (strength and/or
      performance). There is a high prevalence in elderly and in patients with cancer. Several
      mechanisms are known to explain sarcopenia (inflammation, neurodegenerative process, hormonal
      disorders, lack of exercise, malnutrition). The consequences were analysed in several studies
      where sarcopenia appeared to be an independent factor of mortality, and associated with
      cancer-related fatigue, nosocomial infections, cardio-vascular diseases, and chemotherapy
      toxicities.

      Diagnosis is based on the measure of the muscle mass performing an abdominal
      computed-tomography (CT) scan, and on the measure of the muscle strength using the handgrip
      test with a &quot;JamarÂ®&quot; hydraulic hand dynamometer. CT scan is more invasive and less easy to
      reach than handgrip test. This test is used to be performing in elderly but not in cancer
      patients having chemotherapy. Present prospective study explored the feasibility of
      systematic handgrip strength testing and short-term changes in muscle strength in digestive
      cancer patients treated by chemotherapy.
