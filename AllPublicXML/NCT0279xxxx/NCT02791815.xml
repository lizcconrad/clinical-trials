  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of repeated doses of selexipag on
      the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of midazolam (i.e., how long and how much
      midazolam is present in the blood)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to exclude an inductive effect of selexipag in the gastrointestinal tract, this
      study aims at investigating the effect of selexipag on the PK of midazolam, a sensitive
      substrate of both hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).

    <time_frame>From pre-dose up to 24 hours after midazolam admisnitration for each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is the maximum observed plasma concentration and is directly derived from the individual plasma concentration time curves of midazolam</description>

    <time_frame>From pre-dose up to 24 hours after midazolam admisnitration for each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>AUC(0-inf) is the area under the plasma concentration-time curves of midazolam, calculated from time 0 (pre-dose) to the extrapolated infinite time</description>

    <time_frame>From pre-dose up to 24 hours after midazolam admisnitration</time_frame>
    <description>tmax is the time to reach Cmax of midazolam and its metabolite (1-hydroxymidazolam), respectively</description>

    <time_frame>From pre-dose up to 24 hours after midazolam admisnitration</time_frame>
    <description>t½ is the terminla half-life of midazolam and its metabolite (1-hydroxymidazolam), and corresponds to the period of time required for the concentration levels of midazolam and its metabolite to be reduced by one-half, respectively</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trough concentration of selexipag and its metabolite ACT-333679 at steady-state</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 4, 7, 10,12 and 13</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Up to 39 days (from Day 1 of Period 1 to end of study of Period 2)</time_frame>
    <description>A treatment-emergent AE is any AE temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment</description>
