      This randomized controlled trial uses administrative public health screening data to test
      whether the Healthy Apple program (HAP), designed to support local implementation of national
      Let's Move! Child Care guidelines in San Francisco (SF), improves child care center nutrition
      and physical activity practices and child weight change.

    <textblock>
      In the USA, First Lady Michelle Obama started a nationwide child care initiative called
      'Let's Move! Child Care' which aims to improve nutrition and physical activity practices in
      child care centers to promote healthy weight for children ages 0-5y.

      The San Francisco Child Care Wellness Collaborative, including the San Francisco Department
      of Public Health (SFDPH) and SF Children's Council, developed a citywide Healthy Apple
      Program (HAP) to support local implementation of the Let's Move! initiative.

      The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDH) has an existing Child Care Health
      Program (CCHP) which provides nurse consultation and health education materials for child
      care centers and annual health screenings for children.

      The aim of this analysis is to see whether child care centers offered the HAP in addition to
      usual CCHP services can improve child care center nutrition and physical activity practices
      and child weight change better than usual CCHP services alone.

    <description>This group of child care centers receives standard services from the San Francisco Department of Public Health Child Care Health Program. CCHP offers services to child care centers annually. The standard services include nurse consultation, health education, monitoring of nutrition and physical activity resource need, vision, hearing, oral health, and height and weight screenings.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This group of child care centers receives all the standard services plus invitation to participate in the voluntary Healthy Apple Program (HAP). The Healthy Apple program involves child care provider self-assessment, followed by an iterative process of goal setting, technical assistance/training, and re-assessment.</description>
