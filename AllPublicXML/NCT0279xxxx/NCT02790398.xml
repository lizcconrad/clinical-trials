      The aim of this study is to assess the differential effect of two transdiagnostic treatment
      protocols for emotional disorders (ED) (depression and anxiety disorders) using a randomized
      pilot study design: a) a transdiagnostic treatment protocol (TTP) based on the Unified
      Protocol; and b) a version of this protocol that also includes a specific component to
      address the regulation of positive affect (TTP+PA). Another aim was to assess the
      acceptability of both treatments by patients. It was hypothesized that the intervention would
      result in significant differences in favor of the TTP+PA protocol in all measures. Regarding
      acceptability, it was hypothesized that both treatments (TP and TP+PA) would be well-accepted
      by the two groups of participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ED are highly prevalent mental disorders and one of the main causes of disability worldwide.
      Currently, there is evidence showing the efficacy of transdiagnostic treatments for anxiety
      disorders, and for comorbid depression and anxiety disorders. An important line of research
      within the transdiagnostic treatment of ED was initiated by D. H. Barlow. Barlow's theory of
      triple vulnerability emphasizes the underlying vulnerabilities that are common to ED and help
      to explain the comorbidity among these diverse conditions. A central aspect within this
      theoretical perspective is the role of emotion regulation in ED. The regulation of negative
      emotions in ED has received a great deal of attention in cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)
      research, and more recently in transdiagnostic ED models like the UP developed by Barlow's
      team. However, although Barlow underscored the role of low PA in the onset and maintenance of
      ED, the main objective of the treatment components in the UP is to train patients in negative
      affect (NA) regulation, but less attention has been paid to the inclusion of treatment
      components to directly target PA regulation. Moreover, literature has shown that higher
      levels of PA are associated with better physical and psychological health, healthier
      lifestyles, and better general functioning. Consequently, an important treatment goal from a
      transdiagnostic treatment approach would be to increase PA while decreasing NA.

      The aim of this study is to compare the differential effect of two transdiagnostic treatment
      protocols for ED using a randomized pilot study design: a) a transdiagnostic treatment
      protocol (TTP) based on the Unified Protocol; and b) a version of this protocol that also
      includes a specific component to address the regulation of positive affect (TTP+PA). Another
      aim is to assess the acceptability of both treatments by patients. It was hypothesized that
      the intervention would result in significant differences in favor of the TTP+PA protocol in
      all measures. Regarding acceptability, it was hypothesized that both treatments (TP and
      TP+PA) would be well-accepted by the two groups of participants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) at pre-, post-intervention (up to 4 months) and at 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS consists of 20 items that evaluate two independent dimensions: positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). The range for each scale (10 items on each) is from 10 to 50. The Spanish version has demonstrated high internal consistency (α = 0.89 and 0.91 for PA and NA in women, respectively, and α = 0.87 and 0.89 for PA and NA in men, respectively) in college students.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) at pre-, post-intervention (up to 4 months) and at 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI-II is one of the most widely used questionnaires to evaluate the severity of depression in pharmacological and psychotherapy trials. It consists of 21 items about the different symptoms characterizing the major depression disorder, summed to obtain the total score, which can be a maximum of 63 points. The instrument has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.76 to 0.95) and a test-retest reliability of around 0.8.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) at pre-, post-intervention (up to 4 months) and at 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The OASIS consists of a 5-item questionnaire, rated from 0 to 4, that assesses the frequency and severity of the anxiety symptoms. The instrument also provides measures of avoidance, as well as work, academic, social and everyday life impairment related to anxiety symptoms. A psychometric analysis of the OASIS scale found good internal consistency (α = .80), test-retest reliability (k = .82) and convergent validity for this instrument.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Quality of Life Inventory (QLI) at pre-, post-intervention (up to 4 months) and at 3-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QLI is a brief self-report questionnaire that assesses perceived quality of life in different life-related areas. The questionnaire includes 10 items, rated on a scale from one to 10, that assess physical well-being, psychological well-being, self-care and independent functioning, occupational functioning, interpersonal functioning, social emotional support, community and services support, personal fulfillment, spiritual fulfillment and overall quality of life. The QLI has shown excellent internal consistency (between .90 and .92), test-retest reliability (.87) and discriminant validity. The Spanish validation of the QLI has also demonstrated good test-retest reliability (α = .89) and discriminant validity.</description>
