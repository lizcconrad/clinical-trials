  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to compare two types of advance directives forms available in English and Spanish
      to determine which is more easy to use for patients.

      Step1: Any adult participant who is interested in completing advance directives and able to
      read and write in English and or Spanish will be eligible to participate in the study

      Step 2:

      Online Stanford consent form will be presented before the participants. Only after they read
      the consent and click on the participation link will they be able to enter the study.Those
      who are willing to participate will be randomly assigned to either the letter or traditional
      advance directives in Spanish and study measures. They will also answer questions as to how
      much they liked and understood the documents.

      Step 4: The investigators will collect data until the investigators reach an n=1000

      Step 5: The investigators will analyze the results and submit for publication.

      In this protocol, we are assessing whether patients prefer the traditional advance directives
      or the letter directive. As it is just an questionnaire based study, there no risk for
      patients.
