  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to prospectively assess the use of a modified tracheal balloon
      dilator that allows gas flow (oxygenation and ventilation) through the device while inflated
      during dilatation.

      The primary aim is to determine the incidence of, and time to, arterial desaturation (defined
      as peripheral plethysmography below 90%). Secondary aims include quantitative and qualitative
      (waveform) end-tidal capnography levels throughout the procedure, quantitative assessment of
      dilatation, and incidence of adverse events.
