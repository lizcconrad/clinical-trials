  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to better characterize the risk linked to metformin use during pregnancy,
      using a prospective multicentric cohort design enabling a large sample size, in evaluating
      the rate of birth defects after first trimester exposure, as well as several other pregnancy
      related outcomes.

        Patient from the European Network of Teratology Information Services (ENTIS) Cohort. This
        cohort is composed with patients, seeking counseling on the safety and risks regarding
        medication exposures in the reproductive age by themselves or through their healthcare
        provider. Each center gathers structured information on the exposure (medication, time of
        exposure, dose), maternal demographics, as well as medical and obstetric histories is
        collected prospectively. After the estimated date of birth, follow-up information on
        pregnancy outcome, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, congenital anomalies and
        neonatal complications is gathered through structured telephone interviews and/or mailed
        questionnaires sent to the mothers or their healthcare providers.
