    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to specify the psychological, cognitive, neuro-functional and
      genetic profile associated with binge drinker behaviors among young adults. Results will help
      identifying more precisely vulnerability factors associated with this pattern of alcohol
      consumption and guiding prevention efforts.

      Binge drinking behavior is characterised by speed of drinking on a particular occasion,
      frequency of drunkenness during the most recent six month period, and the percentage of times
      getting drunk when drinking. The prevalence of weekly binge drinking among European Union
      drinkers in 2009 was reported to be 28% of the student population, and 33% among all young
      people aged 15-24. The consequences of this behavior are multiple and often dramatic, they
      include: academic failure, violent acts, rape, domestic or road accidents. The study aims to
      identify vulnerability factors associated with binge drinking. The protocol explores the
      psychological (personality), neuropsychological (executive functions, memory), genetic (snp
      polymorphisms) and neuro-anatomical (fMRI) patterns associated with binge drinking behavior.
