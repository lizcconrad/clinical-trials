      The aim of the study is to follow a group of preschool children from early permanent
      dentition to determine the prevalence and incidence of caries malocclusions and to
      investigated the related risk factors as age, gender, ethnic origin and non-nutritive sucking
      habits, breathing disturbances, allergies, Dietary habits, oral hygiene status and dental
      care.

      Once a year a clinical examination were performed. Data were collected with a questionnaire,
      that was filled out by the parents before the clinical examination, which included questions
      on child's clinical history, the type of feeding, the use of baby-bottle, the history of
      non-nutritive sucking habits (dummy-sucking and digit sucking) and the consent to the
      clinical examination. Two World Health Organization (WHO) calibrated examiners carried out
      the clinical examinations. They were blinded to the information collected from the parental
      questionnaires. Dental examinations were performed in a classroom environment under natural
      light, using gloves and masks in compliance with the infection control protocol, mouth
      mirrors and disposable paper rulers to measure overjet and overbite (in millimeters). The
      occlusion was assessed in centric occlusion and was classified according to Foster and
      Hamilton criteria [Foster and Hamilton, 1969] Radiographic examination was not performed.
