  <brief_summary>

      Background: Electronic health records contain a vast amount of data about diseases and
      treatments. Researchers could use this data to test their ideas, but they would need to use
      records from more than just their own group of patients. But access to those records is
      restricted to ensure patient privacy.

      U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) has created a computer tool called NLM Scrubber. This
      program recognizes and deletes personal information from health records. The researchers who
      developed this program now need access to the original records. This will allow them to see
      how well the program removes personal information from patient records and how they can make
      it more accurate.

      Objectives:

      To find ways to improve clinical text de-identification.

      Eligibility:

      No new participants. Researchers will review data that have already been collected.

      Design:

      Researchers will collect a random sample of reports. These will be from different doctors in
      different fields.

      Researchers will manually remove personal information from the records.

      Researchers will also automatically remove personal information from original records using
      NLM-Scrubber.

      Researchers will compare the results of the computer program versus the manual changes. They
      will note when the program has not been removing personal information correctly. They will
      also note when the program has been deleting nonpersonal health information incorrectly.

      Researchers will use the results to revise the program. They will keep testing it until the
      de-identification process is complete.

      This study is about the quality assessment, improvement, and monitoring of an automatic
      clinical text de-identification software application called NLM Scrubber, which has been
      developed at the National Library of Medicine (NLM). The application has been developed so
      that clinical reports can be used in secondary scientific studies (i.e., for secondary use)
      without breaching patient privacy. Research on methods for protecting patient privacy and on
      the development of NLM Scrubber have been conducted by following the guidelines of and in
      compliance with HIPAA and the Privacy Act.

      In order to further develop and improve NLM Scrubber and assess its de-identification
      performance effectively, the investigators require the original / unredacted samples from all
      potential clinical report types and sources. To this end, NLM investigators have been

      collaborating with entities within NIH, namely, NIH Clinical Center, BTRIS, and NCI as well
      as outside entities, Kentucky State Registry administered by University of Kentucky and
      researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, who stated their interest in integrating NLM

      Scrubber to their application called Text Information Extraction System. These entities
      collect samples of various types of clinical reports for assessing and improving NLM Scrubber
      performance. However we also need access to the original data in order to assess

      potential problems and improve the accuracy of NLM Scrubber.

    <time_frame>01/01/2017-01/01/2020</time_frame>
    <description>HIPAA Privacy Rule defines 18 types of personally identifying information, that need to be de-identified, which include personal names, addresses, significant dates, numeric identifiers (such as socialsecurity number). Our annotators label those words and numbers creating a gold standard and NLM-Scrubber tries to recognize andeliminate all of them. The rate of de-identification of PII refers to success of this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>The rate of erroneously redacted clinical information</measure>
    <time_frame>01/01/2017-01/01/2020</time_frame>
    <description>While NLM-Scrubber tries to eliminate only PII elements while preserving nonidentifying study data, it inadvertently deletes some ofthe non-identifying study data elements (non-protected health information) as well. The rate of erroneously redacted clinical information refers to the failure of NLMScrubber in preserving nonidentifying health information.</description>
