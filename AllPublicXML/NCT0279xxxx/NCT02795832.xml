      This study will be a randomised, adaptive design, double blind (3rd party open), placebo
      controlled, sequential group study in both healthy volunteers and patients with moderate to
      severe AD. This study will be divided into 3 separate, sequential cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1 will assess safety, toleration and pharmacokinetics (PK) with intensive
           monitoring as in-patients over 7 days of dosing in healthy volunteers.

        -  Cohort 2 will assess safety, toleration and PK with intensive monitoring as in-patients
           over 7 days of dosing in moderate to severe AD patients.

        -  Cohort 3 will assess efficacy, safety, toleration and PK as out-patients over 14 days of
           dosing in moderate to severe AD patients.

      Subjects will receive 1.0% (w/w) ZPL-5212372 or matched placebo ointment topically, twice
      daily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy males or females, aged between 18 and 55 years, inclusive (healthy is defined
             as no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full
             physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG
             and clinical laboratory tests).

        or

        Males and females aged 18-65 years inclusive with physician documented history or diagnosis
        of atopic dermatitis for at least 6 months prior to screening. AD should be diagnosed by
        the Eichenfield revised criteria of Hanifin and Rajka.

        For Atopic Dermatitis Patients:

        Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) of ≥9 and &lt;48 at Screening and an EASI of ≥12 and &lt;48
        at Day 1.

        An Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score ≥ 3 at both Screening and Day 1.

        Atopic dermatitis affecting between ≥10 to &lt;40% BSA at Screening and ≥10% to &lt;50% BSA on
        Day 1.

        All Subjects:

        Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent form, indicating that the
        subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For Healthy Subjects

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant haematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Have tattoos covering areas of skin to be dosed with study ointment.

          -  Subjects who are hirsute in areas of skin to be dosed with study ointment.

          -  Subjects who have received treatment with an investigational drug within 3 months
             prior to screening.

        For Atopic Dermatitis Patients:

          -  AD of such severity (EASI &gt;48) that the subject could not comply with the demands of
             the study and/or the subject is not a suitable candidate for a placebo-controlled
             study.

          -  Have concomitant skin disease or infection (e.g. acne, impetigo) or presence of skin
             comorbidities in the study area to be dosed that may interfere with study assessments.

          -  Have received phototherapy (e.g. UVA, UVB or PUVA therapy), or systemic therapy (e.g.
             immunosuppressants [such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate], cytostatics)
             known or suspected to have an effect on AD, within 4 weeks of the start of the study.
             All other biologics should not have been used within 3 months of the start of study.

          -  Have received systemic corticosteroids (e.g. oral, intravenous, intraarticular,
             rectal) within 4 weeks of the start of the study. Subjects on a stable maintenance
             dose (over the preceding 3 months) of inhaled or intranasal CS may participate.

          -  Patients treated with oral antihistamines or topical calcineurin inhibitors or topical
             steroids within 7 days of starting study; intranasal antihistamines for the treatment
             of allergic rhinitis are acceptable.
