    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe current rescue treatment pattern for nucleot(s)ide
      analogue (NA) resistance and assess the real-world treatment outcomes and health resources
      utilization of rescue treatments for drug resistance in a clinical cohort of Chinese patients
      with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, decompensated cirrhosis, and/or
