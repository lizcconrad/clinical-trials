  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of BF-200 ALA (Ameluz) in the
      treatment of actinic keratosis (AK) with photodynamic therapy (PDT) compared to Metvix.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, observer-blind, multinational, comparator and placebo-controlled
      parallel group, (3:3:1 ratio) study to compare the efficacy and safety of BF-200 ALA with the
      comparator Metvix® (methyl-[5-amino-4-oxopentanoate]) and placebo, for the treatment of AK
      with PDT.

The cosmetic outcome is rated as very good if the sum score of the previously mentioned ratings (all ratings for each sign added up) has improved by at least 2 points as compared to baseline; as good if the sum score has improved by at least 1 point as compared to baseline; as satisfactory if the sum score is identical to the one at baseline; as unsatisfactory if the sum score has worsened by 1 point compared to baseline and as impaired if the sum score has worsened by at least 2 points compared to baseline.</description>

TEAEs are considered from subjects who received only one PDT or subjects who received 2 PDTs (initial Treatment (PDT-1) and retreatment (PDT-2) due to remaining lesions 12 weeks after first photodynamic therapy.
The safety set consists of all patients treated at least once with investigational product. Treatment with investigational product consists of application of study drug followed by illumination. This excludes one patient from the safety set; for this patient the investigational product was applied on the skin but it was not illuminated. Patients are treated according to actual treatment.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>616 patients with actinic keratosis (AK) were planned to be randomized in a 3:3:1 ratio allowing for 20% of non-evaluable patients excluded from the per-protocol set. Due to the low drop out rates, recruiting was stopped after 600 patients were screened. Of those, 571 patients were randomized and 29 patients were screening failures.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The cosmetic outcome 12 weeks after the last PDT (12 weeks after 1st PDT for subjects who are completely cleared at this time point, 12 weeks after 2nd PDT for subjects retreated due to remaining lesions 12 weeks after 1st PDT) will be calculated on the basis of the skin quality assessment (skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled or irregular pigmentation, degree of scarring, and atrophy) upon visual examination (scale: 0= none, 1= mild, 2= moderate, 3=severe). The cosmetic outcome is rated as very good if the sum score of the previously mentioned ratings (all ratings for each sign added up) has improved by at least 2 points as compared to baseline; as good if the sum score has improved by at least 1 point as compared to baseline; as satisfactory if the sum score is identical to the one at baseline; as unsatisfactory if the sum score has worsened by 1 point compared to baseline and as impaired if the sum score has worsened by at least 2 points compared to baseline.</description>
