  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory changes in aortic blood velocity have been described as an indicator of fluid
      responsiveness when measured in the left ventricular outflow tract by trans esophageal
      echography. A threshold value of 12% allowed discrimination between responders and
      nonresponders with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 89%. The suprasternal window is
      already used to measure cardiac output. The primary endpoint of this study is to determine
      the predictive value of the respiratory variability in aortic blood velocity measured by
      suprasternal view (âˆ†VpicSS) as an indicator of fluid responsiveness. The secondary endpoint
      is to compare maximum velocity and velocity time integral measured by suprasternal and
      transthoracic view.
