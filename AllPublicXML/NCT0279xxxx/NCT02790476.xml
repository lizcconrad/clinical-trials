  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In collaboration with the San Diego Medical Examiner's Office and the State of California's
      controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES), the investigators
      propose to review opioid poisonings over the past 12 months and will send letters to
      prescribers in California when at least one of the provider's prescription(s) was filled by a
      patient who died of an opioid poisoning in San Diego County. The letters will be
      non-judgmental and factual, explaining that a patient of the provider who was being treated
      with prescription narcotics died of an opioid poisoning. The letter will also encourage
      judicious prescribing including use of the CURES system before prescribing. The investigators
      will evaluate physician prescribing practices over 24 months 12 months pre- and 12 months
      post-letter using data from the CURES database. The investigators' hypothesis is that letters
      will make the risk of opioids more cognitively available and that physicians will respond by
      prescribing opioids more carefully. This will result in fewer deaths due to misuse and more
      frequent use of the CURES system.

    <description>The letters will be factual and nonjudgmental, signed by the County Medical Examiner, and would state that a patient they had treated with controlled substances died of an opioid poisoning. The letter will encourage judicious prescribing, and will provide information developed by an advisory group: how to identify and taper unsafe regimens (high dose, polypharmacy, or use of multiple prescribers); how to identify addiction and compassionately refer patients for medication-assisted treatment; and recommendations to avoid bad outcomes (e.g. &quot;do not fire your patient for signs of addiction.&quot;) The letter would also encourage use of the CURES system before prescribing, as well as co-prescribing of naloxone.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The investigators will not be enrolling subjects. This is an evaluation of a public health
        intervention involving sending prescriber's factual and nonjudgmental letters, signed by
        the County Medical Examiner, that would state that a patient the provider had treated with
        controlled substances died of an opioid poisoning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prescribers in California for whom at least one of their prescription(s) was filled by
             a patient who died of an opioid poisoning in San Diego County

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prescriber is licensed outside the State of California and does not hold a California
             license, but the prescription was filled in California

          -  The prescriber does not have a CURES report on record

          -  The prescriber has issued only one opioid prescription in the last 12 months since the
             time of the deceased death (and the prescription was to the deceased)

          -  Prescriptions with unknown DEA
