  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if a remote cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation
      program delivered via a smartphone application and regular telephone calls will lead to
      improved patient outcomes as measured by functional capacity, improved patient compliance in
      monitoring symptoms and medication adherence, improved self-efficacy and knowledge in
      managing disease and, a decreased rate of hospitalization and re-admissions.

    <textblock>
      This project aims to determine if a smartphone-delivered cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program
      could show similar clinical outcomes to in-person programs at a low cost in a large
      population of patients. Investigators will also assess the feasibility of tailoring a virtual
      CR program to a small sample of COPD participants who also stand to benefit in the absence of
      an established pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program.

      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial of participants at the Atlanta Veterans
      Affairs Medical Center with an applicable diagnosis for cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation
      versus usual care during the study period. The study team plans to simultaneously recruit two
      cohorts of participants referred for CR (Cohort A) and PR (Cohort B) to take part in an
      in-home, virtual rehabilitation program. To compare this intervention to traditional CR,
      investigators will perform an observational cohort study of patients who are already enrolled
      through the CHOICE program in conventional CR. Furthermore, to better understand the
      potential impact of this intervention, investigators will perform a retrospective chart
      review of patients referred for CR over the past 5-years.

      Investigators seek to address the following:

        1. Determine whether a home-based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program delivered
           through smartphones is feasible and improves functional status.

        2. Determine if education and lifestyle counseling lead to increased adherence with
           prescribed follow-up, pharmacotherapy, quality of life, self-efficacy and lifestyle
           changes.

        3. Determine if a home-based cardiac or pulmonary rehabilitation program reduces health
           system utilization, including ED visits and readmission rates.
