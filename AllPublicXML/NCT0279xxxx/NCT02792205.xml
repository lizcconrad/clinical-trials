  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Von Willebrand Disease (VWD) is defined as an inherited bleeding disorder that is caused by
      deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a plasma protein that mediates the
      initial adhesion of platelets at sites of vascular injury and also binds and stabilizes blood
      clotting factor VIII (FVIII) in the circulation. The most severe forms of VWD are usually
      easy to diagnose (obvious hemorrhagic symptoms and major VWF deficiency), whereas the mild
      forms of the disease are still difficult to confirm. It is indeed reported that about 1% of
      the population carry mild biological VWF deficiency without any bleeding tendency and any
      &quot;actual disease&quot;. On the contrary, some patients with severe bleeding history can carry a
      true VWF abnormality, well-confirmed by genetic studies, without any VWF deficiency when
      evaluated with standard biological methods, such as Ristocetin Cofactor activity (VWF:RCo).
      However, in these patients, the use of alternative methods, such as PFA-100 (Platelet
      Fonction Analyzer-100), the study of Factor VIII (FVIII:C) to VWF (FVIII:C/VWF) ratio or the
      evaluation of VWF activity using more specialized methods such as VWF:CB (VWF-Collagen
      Binding) assay can detect the VWF deficiency and possible hemorrhagic predisposition.

      In this project, the investigators plan to assess the performance of VWF:CB in the diagnosis
      of VWF deficiency in patients with unexplained bleeding history.

        This study plans to enroll 200 patients (100 per Center) in a 2-year period. The
        recruitment will occur in standard consultation activity of the 2 Hemostasis Centers of
        Dijon and Nantes. As each Center carries out about 1200 consultations/year, this projection
        appears as feasible, since a majority of them are induced by hemorrhagic profile. Such a
        number of patients will allow reliable statistical analysis.
