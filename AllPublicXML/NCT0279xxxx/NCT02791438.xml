  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and
      pharmacokinetics of long-term administration of TAK-536 once daily for 52 weeks in pediatric
      patients aged 6 to less than 16 years with hypertension. The study consists of a 2-week
      Run-in Period, a 52-week Treatment Period (Treatment Period I, 12-week; Treatment Period II,
      40-week), and a 2-week Follow-up Period (56 weeks in total).

      Participants eligible at screening will initiate to receive the placebo in a single-blinded
      fashion at the start of the Run-in Period.

             requirements.

          2. The participant's parent or the participant's legal guardian is capable of signing and
             dating a written, informed consent form on behalf of the participant prior to the
             initiation of any study procedures. Written informed assent is also obtained from the
             participant as much as possible.

          3. The Japanese participant who has a diagnosis of hypertension. A participant is
             eligible if he/she is deemed hypertensive according to the Reference Blood Pressure
             Values of Children by Gender and Age; office sitting diastolic or systolic blood
             pressure ≥ 95 percentile for essential hypertension without concomitant hypertensive
             organ damage, and ≥ 90 percentile for secondary hypertension with concomitant CKD,
             diabetes mellitus, heart failure or any hypertensive organ damage.

        In addition, participants need to meet the following criteria:

          1. If currently treated with any antihypertensive drugs at the start of the Run-in
             Period:

             sitting diastolic or systolic blood pressure meeting the above criteria at the end of
             the Run-in Period (Week 0).

          2. If currently untreated with any antihypertensive drugs at the start of the Run-in
             Period:

        Participant who meets the above criteria on 3 separate time points including screening and
        the end of the Run-in Period (Week 0). In addition, participant with essential hypertension
        without concomitant hypertensive organ damage still maintains hypertension with
        non-pharmacotherapy including foods or exercises for at least 3 months within 1 year prior
        to the start of screening.

        4. The participant is male or female and aged 6 to less than 16 years at the time of
        informed consent.

        5. The participant weighs at least 20 kg at screening. 6. The participant is capable of

        7. A participant who has undergone kidney transplantation is eligible if he/she underwent
        the transplantation at least 6 months earlier at screening, and the graft has been
        functionally stable (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) for
        at least 6 months with evidence (eg, Doppler echography, CT scan [computed tomography] or
        MRI [magnetic resonance imaging]) excluding grafted kidney arterial stenosis. A participant
        on immunosuppressive therapy with a stable dose at least 30 days prior to screening is
        eligible.

        8. A female participant of childbearing potential who is sexually active with a
        nonsterilized male partner agrees to use routinely adequate contraception from signing of
        informed consent through 1 month after the completion of the study, and proves negative in
        the pregnancy test at screening.

        9. The participants judged by the investigator or subinvestigator that he/she can
        discontinue the therapy with RAS inhibitors for 2 weeks (acceptable range, 1 to 4 weeks) in
        safe prior to the Treatment Period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The participant has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to
             screening or is participating in another clinical study or a post-marketing clinical
             study.

             Note: This does not apply to participants participating in observational studies
             without interventional or invasive therapy.

          2. The participant previously received therapy with azilsartan. Note: This does not apply
             to participants participating in single dose pharmacokinetic studies of TAK-536.

          3. The participant has poorly controlled hypertension indicated by an office sitting
             systolic blood pressure higher by at least 15 mmHg and/or an office sitting diastolic
             blood pressure higher by at least 10 mmHg than the 99 percentiles of the Reference
             Blood Pressure Values of Children by Gender and Age.

          4. The participant has a diagnosis of malignant or accelerated hypertension.

          5. The participant was noncompliant (&lt; 70% or &gt; 130%) with the study drug during the
             Run-in Period.

             hematological, immunological, urinogenital, psychiatric disease, cancer, or any other
             disease that adversely affects participant's health, or, in the opinion of the
             investigator or subinvestigator, potentially confounds the study results.

          8. The participant has hemodynamically significant left ventricular outflow obstruction
             due to aortic stenosis or aortic valvular disease, or is scheduled to undergo a
             medical procedure affecting blood pressure during the study (eg, correction of
             arterial anomaly).

          9. The participant has a history of or concurrent clinically significant abnormality of
             12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator or subinvestigator, disqualifies
             the participant for participation in the study.

         10. The participant has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus indicated by HbA1c &gt; 9.0% at
             screening.

             (AST) level ≥ 2.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN), or a total bilirubin level ≥ 1.5
             × ULN at screening, severely impaired hepatic function, any active liver disease
             (regardless of the cause), or jaundice.

         12. The participant has hyperkalemia exceeding ULN at screening.

         13. The participant has a history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) infection at screening.

         14. The participant has a known hypersensitivity or allergy to any ARBs.

         15. The participant needs treatment with any of the excluded medication.

         16. If female, the participant is pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant
