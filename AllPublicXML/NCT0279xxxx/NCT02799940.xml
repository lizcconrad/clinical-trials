      The objective of the study is to determine the correlation between the physiological
      variables and the degree of consolidation in lung computed tomography in patients with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involves respiratory failure from different
      causes, but with a common pathologic manifestation in the form of inflammatory pulmonary
      edema. Histopathological examination of tissue obtained from patients with ARDS suggests that
      the pathology is heterogeneous and involves 3 phases: exudative, inflammatory, and
      fibroproliferative. Such alterations are associated with a decreased lung compliance leading
      to an increased pressure in the airways under mechanical ventilation (MV) that becomes more
      pronounced with increasing severity of ARDS, so that the consequent respiratory mechanics has
      thus been shown to be determinant of patient outcomes. In addition, computed tomography (CT)
      has revealed a heterogeneous pattern of lung injury, with areas of normal lung interspersed
      with morphologically altered regions, among which abnormalities the ground-glass
      opacification and consolidation are the most frequent. It has been performed quantitative
      assessments of ARDS by means of CT, thus enabling a correlation of such pathologic details
      with physiologic and clinical parameters as well as with patient outcomes. From the above,
      the investigators hypothesize that in patients with ARDS, a greater involvement in
      oxygenation and higher mechanical alterations will be correlated with a more advanced
      consolidation in the CT scan. Therefore, the primary objective of the study will be to
      determine the correlation between the extent of oxygenation (assessed by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio)
      and the degree of consolidation (total CO) in the CT scan. The secondary objectives will be:
      (1) to determine the correlation between the driving pressure and the total CO as evidenced
      by CT; (2) to determine the correlation between the static pressure and the total CO; (3) to
      determine the correlation between the static compliance and the total CO; (4) to determine
      the correlation between oxygenation index and the total CO; (5) to determine the correlation
      between the lung injury score (LIS) and the total CO; (6) to determine the correlation
      between ventilator free days and the total CO; (7) to determine the independent variables
      associated with total CO; (8) to determine differences in the CT with respect to the total
      lung-disease score [total CO plus total value of ground-glass opacification (total GC)]
      between survivors and nonsurvivors.
