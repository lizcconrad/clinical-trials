      ABSORB BTK Study: A prospective, multicenter, controlled clinical evaluation of the use of a
      bioresorbable drug eluting stent in the arterial vasculature below the knee
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a bioresorbable vascular scaffold
      coated with the drug Everolimus. This will be used to treat short length blockages of up to
      55mm (5.5cm) in arteries below the knee.

      This will be performed to treat patients who have severe leg pain or have developed skin
      ulcers or gangrene which are not healing due to insufficent blood supply. The ABSORB
      Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold works on similar principles of drug
      eluting stents which have been used for a considerable time in treating blocked arteries.
      However this product consists of a scaffold coated with a drug so rather than leaving a
      metallic stent in the blood vessel, this product primarily delivers the drug, gives
      mechanical support to the blood vessel and once it is no longer needed the scaffold absorbs
      into the body leaving no permanent metallic implant.

      This same device has been used safely and effectively in the arteries which supply the heart
      both in clinical trials and current practice and has also been evaluated in the leg arteries
      in a single-centre pilot study. This study aims to evaluate it's use in a larger number of
      patients in multiple centres and compare that to a historical control group of metal drug
      eluting stents. The study will evaluate both ultrasound and angiographic derived patency in
      those arteries out to a 36 month follow-up time point. This data will be collected in
      patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria and who are then treated and followed over time.
