    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study of investigational agent CFI-402257 in patients with advanced cancer.
      The purpose of this study is to see how safe and tolerable CFI-402257 is in cancer patients
      as well as the pharmacokinetics (PK). This study is the first time that CFI-402257 is given
      to humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CFI-402257 is an oral drug that blocks TTK protein kinase (also known as Monopolar spindle 1
      [Mps1]) activity. TTK is a protein that is important in regulating cell growth, and cell
      death, and ensuring proper division. Many tumors are shown to make too much TTK. When there
      is too much TTK produced, it is believed to contribute to uncontrolled cancer cell growth and
      division leading to additional mutations in cancer cells. Therefore, it is believed that
      blocking this protein from working will lead to cancer cell death, stopping tumors from
      growing or shrinking them.

      This study will have two parts: dose escalation and dose expansion.

      The dose escalation part will test different dose levels of study drug in groups of patients
      to find the highest dose of study drug that can be given safely to patients (called maximum
      tolerated dose or MTD).

      The expansion part will further assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of the MTD found in
      the escalation part of the study in additional group of patients.
