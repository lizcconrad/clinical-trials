  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most common complaints in emergency department (ED) and is still often
      poorly managed. A major prospective multicenter study reported that 74% of patients that had
      a pain complaint at ED triage are discharged in moderate to severe pain. Accordingly,
      physicians frequently prescribed analgesic after discharged for these patients, and opioid is
      given in 29% of ED visits involving pain complaints. However, few studies evaluate pain
      management after ED discharge: the frequency and length of opioids prescriptions, the opioids
      quantity taken by the patients, are the patients relieved and satisfied by these pain
      treatments, what are the adverse effects associated with the use of these medications, and
      what are the chances of developing addiction?

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the required minimal opioids prescription for
      patients treated for acute pain after being discharge from the ED. Secondary objectives
      include: 1) monitor the patients' adverse events during opioids treatment; 2) evaluate the
      patients' level of pain relief associated with their respective opioids treatment; 3)
      determine the patients' level of addiction following post-ED opioids treatments.

      The design of the project is a prospective observational cohort study. A cohort of
      consecutive ED patients aged 18 or more with an initial pain at triage of 4 or more and
      discharged from the ED in less than 48 hours with a prescription of opioid will be asked to
      participate in the study. Patients will be excluded if there is ongoing treatment for a
      pre-existing chronic pain condition or if they used opioid drugs in the past year. Research
      nurses will contact the patients by phone at three follow-up time points (1 week, 1 month,
      and 3 months). Follow-up phone interviews will evaluate pain intensity as well as pain
      treatment satisfaction (0-10 NRS), monitor adverse events, and investigate possible opioids
      addiction (SOWS: subjective opioid withdrawal scale). During these interviews, the nurses
      will also question the patients about their daily opioids usage and if they were relieved
      from pain.

      This study will provide the base for future guidelines regarding the prescription of opioids
      treatment for specific pathology encountered in ED. It will also give indications on how to
      adjust the treatments according to adverse events and the level of addiction experienced by
      patients.

        A cohort of consecutive emergency department patients aged 18 or more treated for an acute
        pain diagnosis present for less than two weeks, with an initial pain at triage of 4 and
        more on a 0-10 points NRS and discharged with a prescription of opioids.

        The study will take place in an emergency department of a tertiary (trauma specialized
        center) academic urban hospital with an annual census of approximately 60,000 ED visits.
