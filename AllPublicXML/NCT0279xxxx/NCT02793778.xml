  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate CROWN's efficacy in supporting the repair and
      maintenance of the intestinal mucosa of patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's
      Disease receiving anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) therapy (infliximab, adalimumab,
      certolizumab)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an orally administered
      nutritional intervention (CROWN) in subjects with Crohn's Disease (CD) to support Standard Of
      Care (SOC) treatment in the repair and maintenance of the intestinal mucosa over a 24 week
      period. SOC is defined as having been on a stable maintenance dose of an anti-Tumor Necrosis
      Factor (TNF) agent within 24 weeks of its initiation.

          5. Anticipated need for gastrointestinal surgical therapy in the next 6 months

          6. Current treatment with a systemic corticosteroid at dose greater than 20 mg of
             prednisone (or equivalent) at screening

          7. Change in any antimetabolite therapy within 8 weeks prior to randomization

          8. Current treatment with antibiotics for CD (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole) at screening

          9. Current ostomy

         10. Serious infection, neoplasia or other medical conditions which would interfere with
             participation in the study, in the opinion of the Investigator
