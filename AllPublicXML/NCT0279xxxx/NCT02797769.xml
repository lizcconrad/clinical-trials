  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective cohort study will analyze data from multiple large U.S. health insurance
      claims databases to compare use of tocilizumab to other biologic disease-modifying
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in real world patients with RA. Using the date of dispensing as
      the index date, the analysis will compute the time to first event for several cardiovascular
      outcomes.
