    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the multiple dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of three
      gefapixant (AF-219) formulations; to assess the effect of Omeprazole on the multiple dose PK
      of three gefapixant formulations; and, to assess the safety and tolerability of gefapixant.

    <description>Plasma gefapixant concentration versus time profiles will be plotted for each subject; similar summary plots will be constructed for each treatment period. Plasma gefapixant PK parameters will be calculated using noncompartmental methods and summarized using descriptive statistics by each treatment.</description>
