      The primary aim of this research is to evaluate a community-based exercise (CBE) intervention
      for adults living with HIV within the community with the goal of reducing disability and
      enhancing health (cardiopulmonary, strength, weight and body composition, and neurocognitive
      outcomes) and contextual factor outcomes (social support, stigma, mastery, coping) for adults
      living with HIV.

      Investigators will use the RE-AIM Framework to evaluate the community-based exercise (CBE)
      intervention. The RE-AIM Framework includes criteria to evaluate the impact and translation
      of an intervention at both individual and organizational-levels in order to promote uptake,
      transferability and ultimately enhance the public health impact of health promotion
      interventions.

      Specific study objectives are: 1) To determine the extent (proportion of sessions attended,
      frequency, intensity, time, type) to which adults with HIV participate in a CBE intervention;
      2) To assess the effect of a CBE intervention on disability and health outcomes and intrinsic
      and extrinsic factor outcomes for people living with HIV; 3) To assess engagement in CBE for
      adults with HIV over time (adherence, level of physical activity); and 4) To evaluate the
      process (strengths and challenges; feasibility; accessibility, long term sustainability) of
      implementing a CBE intervention within the community from the perspective of recreation
      providers (fitness instructors; managers) and people living with HIV.

      Investigators will conduct a prospective longitudinal study using mixed methods to evaluate a
      CBE intervention in the community with people living with HIV. They will use an interrupted
      time series (ITS) design in combination with qualitative interviews to assess outcomes at
      baseline (pre-testing phase), during (intervention phase) and after the CBE intervention
      (post-testing phase) to evaluate the short- and long-term effect of CBE.

    <description>Intervention Phase (6 months): The HIV Community-Based Exercise (CBE) intervention is a 6-month exercise program at the Central Toronto YMCA. Participants will meet the fitness instructor to establish an individualized exercise program that will include a combination of aerobic, resistive, neuromotor and flexibility training. Participants will attend exercise sessions for ~1.5 hour, 3 times per week for 24 weeks. Sessions will be supervised weekly by a fitness instructor.
Post-Intervention Phase (8 months): At the end of the 24 week intervention, participants will be encouraged to continue to engage in unsupervised exercise 3 times per week. As per usual practice at the YMCA, a fitness instructor will be available to monitor participants monthly.</description>
