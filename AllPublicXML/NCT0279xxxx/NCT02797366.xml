      Open label, multi-centre prospective study. Adult patients with primary central nervous
      system tumours fulfilling the inclusion criteria according to the study protocol. The study
      consists of 2 sequential cohorts evaluated consecutively for the feasibility, safety and
      toxicity, as well as long-term survival data, when using spot scanning proton beam therapy.

      Open label, multi-centre prospective phase II study. Adult patients with primary central
      nervous system tumours full-filling the inclusion criteria according to the study protocol.
      The study consists of 2 sequential cohorts evaluated for the feasibility, safety and
      toxicity, as well as long-term survival data, when using proton beam therapy.

        -  Part I: To assess the feasibility of using pencil beam scanning and evaluating the
           treatment safety in all aspects, and to assess acute toxicity in a smaller cohort of CNS
           patients. All toxicity data, QoL and survival data will also be included in the part II
           cohort.

        -  Part II: The second part of the trial consists of all CNS patients that are referred to
           the Skandion Clinic after the safety data from the first part has been evaluated by the
           study steering committee.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  The patient must be at least 18 years old

          -  World Health Organization (WHO)/ Eastern Cooperative OncologyGroup (ECOG) performance
             status 0-2, Karnofsky score ≥60.

          -  The patient must be able to understand the information about the treatment and give a
             written informed consent to participate in the trial.

          -  Adequate follow-up study must be possible; this will exclude a patient who is
             uncooperative.

          -  Must have a life expectancy of at least 3 years based on age and co-morbidities as
             well as diagnosis. For patients considered for re-irradiation the life expectancy must
             be estimated to minimum 6 months.

          -  Must have a pathology proven CNS tumour or if not possible, the radiology findings
             must be evaluated at a multi-disciplinary conference at a university hospital.

             during therapy such as an intrauterine device or condom. Pregnancy IS not an
             ineligibility criteria if radiotherapy is indicated and can-not be postponed.

          -  Prior CNS radiotherapy is not an ineligibility criteria but re-irradiated patients

        hospitals in Sweden and found candidates for radiotherapy and one of following diagnoses:

          -  Whenever craniospinal irradiation (CSI) is indicated

          -  Whenever re-irradiation of CNS is considered

          -  Concomitant or previous malignancies. Exceptions are adequately treated basal cell
             carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ carcinoma of the cervix
             uteri with a follow-up time of at least 3 years, or other previous malignancy with a
             disease-free interval of at least 5 years.

          -  Not able to understand information or manage tests according to study protocol. If
             necessary, only authorized interpreters may be used to assist in the translation.
