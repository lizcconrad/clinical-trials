  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the specific setting of the evaluation of corticosteroids, pentoxifylline of their
      combination in severe alcoholic hepatitis, only meta-analysis combining individual data is
      able to provide detailed information from each individual with severe alcoholic hepatitis
      assessed by a DF ≥ 32. The need for such an approach is confirmed by the fact that in both
      univariate and multivariate analyses, truth survival is lower for conclusions from
      meta-analysis of the literature than for conclusions derived from non-meta-analyses.

      The present study is a meta-analysis of individual data from RCTs restricted to patients with
      a DF ≥ 32. The primary endpoint will be to compare 28-day survival of patients receiving
      either corticosteroids, or pentoxifylline or their combination to those of patients not
      receiving them adjusted on the independent prognostic factors at baseline.

      The secondary endpoints will be: a) assessment of response to the assigned treatment using
      the Lille model; b) analysis of 6-month survival according to allocated therapy.
