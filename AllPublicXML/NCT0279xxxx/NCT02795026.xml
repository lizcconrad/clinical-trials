  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) are around 10% of gynaecology referrals.Non-relaxing pelvic floor
      dysfunction (NRPFD) is an under-appreciated cause for CPP with dyspareunia where no other
      pathology exists. The effectiveness of manual therapy in studies have shown statistically
      significant pre and post treatment differences.However no study has reviewed the efficacy of
      inclusion of trans- perineal trigger point dry needling used with manual therapy for NRPFD.
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of trans-perineal trigger point dry needling
      used with manual therapy techniques for CPP.

      This study will investigate the effectiveness of inclusion of trans-perineal trigger point
      dry needling with manual therapy treatment for chronic pelvic pain with dyspareunia and
      associated pelvic floor dysfunctions.The use of trigger point dry needling (TrptDN) for
      chronic low back pain has proved beneficial.This study will evaluate the treatment outcomes
      of trans-perineal trigger point dry needling and manual therapy to only manual therapy for
      CPP.

      The outcomes will evaluate the number of treatment requirements between the dry needling with
      manual therapy group and the manual therapy group and review which group has faster
      resolution in pain and other associated pelvic floor symptoms.

    <description>Trigger point dry needling is a treatment technique involving the use of a single, disposable, fine filament acupuncture needle. Here the tight muscle is palpated and the acupuncture needle is directed towards the trigger point. The insertion of the needle is not felt, however the twitch reflex elicited to ease off the trigger point can be felt . This can be sore, but lasts only for a few seconds. Trans-perineal trigger point dry needling is an effective dry needling technique for the pelvic floor muscles done externally, targeting the trigger points in the pelvic floor muscles.</description>
