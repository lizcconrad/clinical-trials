    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study of INC280 and PDR001 is to characterize the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and antitumor activity of PDR001 administered
      i.v. as a single agent or in combination with INC280 administered orally in adult patients
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically documented locally advanced recurrent or metastatic
             HCC or for patients with cirrhosis according to the American Association for the Study
             of Liver Diseases (AASLD) criteria. Current cirrhotic status of Child Pugh Class A
             (5-6 points), with no encephalopathy and/or ascites.

          2. Patients must have received prior systemic sorafenib treatment for HCC with documented
             progression during or after discontinuation of sorafenib treatment (for France only:
             patients must have received at least 8 weeks of prior sorafenib treatment), are
             intolerant to sorafenib (defined as documented Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that led to
             sorafenib discontinuation).

          3. ECOG Performance Status ≤ 1.

          4. Willing and able to swallow and retain oral medication. Other protocol defined
             Inclusion criteria may apply.

                  (INR) ≥ 1.7

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1.5 x 109/L

                  grade 2 serum amylase at the beginning of the study must be confirmed to have no
                  signs or symptoms suggesting pancreatitis or pancreatic injury (e.g., elevated
                  P-amylase, abnormal imaging findings of pancreas, etc.)

               -  Serum lipase &gt; ULN

               -  Potassium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, total Calcium (corrected for serum albumin)
                  outside of normal limits (patients may be enrolled if corrected to within normal
                  limits with supplements during screening)
