  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A structural leg length discrepancy (SLLD) is a common clinical problem. Its prevalence has
      been estimated at 40-70%. Those who have been suffered from limping for a long time may lead
      to follow-up low back pain and lower limb musculoskeletal disorders. Although lower limb
      triple view of x-ray is considered to be the current technique for determining LLD, it is
      costly and time consuming that not every hospital can afford it, and in case of radiograph,
      the patient is exposed to radiation. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a rapid clinical
      assessment method by gathering exterior parameters to build up a Regression model for
      measuring the discrepancy and determining LLD accurately.

      While using shoe lifts to correct discrepancy is the easiest conservative intervention for
      LLD, there are still many controversies on how much height should be added clinically and
      academically. The optimal height should be added depends on feedbacks from users and gait
      performance. The best gait performance can be measured from kinematic performance of center
      mass of body during walking. Therefore, this project wants to compare treatment responses
      between two kinds of shoe lift height correction methods for LLD: given 80% discrepancy in
      shoe lift height correction through triple view of x-ray and given optimal shoe lift height
      correction through analyzing kinematic performance of center mass of body.

    <description>Pain fields of every participant in two groups will be recorded by APP every day for six month continually. The pain fields include：bilateral cervical, trunk, upper limb, lower limb, and foot regions, totally 10 regions.
The score of each region is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The total score may range from 0-1000.</description>

    <description>GAITRite Walkway, CIR Systems, Havertown, PA, USA. The GaitRITE system was developed in response to the need for an objective way to quantify gait and ambulatory status. The GAITRite System measures spatio-temporal parameters of gait such as cadence, step length, step width, velocity, and toe-out angle, providing clinically relevant information that is useful in devising treatment plans and evaluating treatment outcomes. The system tracks parameters over time and can be used to generate progress and status reports.</description>
