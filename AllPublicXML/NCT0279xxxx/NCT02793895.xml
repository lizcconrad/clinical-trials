  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the SEARCH-AF trial is to evaluate a novel diagnostic tool for detecting
      post-operative atrial fibrillation or flutter (POAF/AFL) in cardiac surgical subjects during
      the early, sub-acute post-operative period. The population includes cardiac surgical subjects
      who have either developed or are at risk for developing new onset POAF/AFL and who are at
      risk for stroke, as determined by their CHA2DS2-VASC (congestive heart failure, hypertension,
      age ≥75 years (2 points), diabetes mellitus, previous stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)
      (2 points), vascular disease, age 65-74 years, sex class (female)) score. These subjects must
      not have had a history of AF/AFL before cardiac surgery.

      The intervention group will undergo 30 days of continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with an
      adhesive, patch-based monitor (Medtronic SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system). The control
      group will receive usual care, which does not involve planned cardiac rhythm testing within
      the first 30 days after study randomization. The primary outcome is documentation of
      sustained atrial fibrillation or flutter within the first 30 days after randomization. In
      addition, subjects in both groups will undergo 14 days of continuous cardiac rhythm
      monitoring with the Medtronic SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system at 6±1 months after their
      index cardiac surgery.

      The aim of the SEARCH-AF trial is to evaluate a novel diagnostic tool for detecting
      post-operative atrial fibrillation or flutter (POAF/AFL) in cardiac surgical subjects during
      the early, sub-acute post-operative period. Its primary objective is to test whether enhanced
      cardiac rhythm monitoring with an adhesive, continuous monitor results in higher rates of
      atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) detection at 30 days after randomization for
      post-cardiac surgical subjects who are at risk for developing post-operative atrial
      arrhythmias, when compared to usual care.

      The study design is an open-label, two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a
      strategy of enhanced cardiac rhythm monitoring vs. usual care in 396 post-cardiac surgical
      subjects who are at risk for developing POAF/AFL.

      The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with a cumulative AF/AFL burden of ≥6
      minutes or documentation of AF/AFL by a 12-lead ECG within 30 days after randomization.
      Clinical endpoints will be adjudicated by an independent committee of physicians.

      The study population involves post-cardiac surgical subjects at high risk of stroke, defined
      as having a CHA2DS2-VASC score of ≥4 or CHA2DS2-VASC of ≥2 with additional risk factors for
      developing POAF/AFL. These subjects must not have a history of AF/AFL pre-operatively.

      Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the
      following 2 arms: (i) Enhanced cardiac rhythm monitoring (intervention group) or (ii) Usual
      care (control group). Subjects in the intervention group will receive 30 days of continuous
      cardiac rhythm monitoring with the Medtronic SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system.
      Monitoring will begin on the day of randomization. Subjects in the usual care group will not
      undergo protocol-mandated cardiac rhythm monitoring during the first 30 days after
      randomization.

      All subjects will have a follow-up visit at 45-52 days after hospital discharge and at 6±1
      months after surgery. At 6±1 months, all subjects will undergo 14 days of continuous cardiac
      rhythm monitoring with the SEEQ™ mobile cardiac telemetry system. A telephone follow-up will
      be performed for all subjects at 9±1 months after surgery.

    <description>The SEEQ™ system consists of a wearable sensor which is a single-lead, low-profile, peel-and-stick device applied over the anterior left chest wall of the subject. The wearable patch is designed for one-time use only and cannot be re-applied if removed. Each sensor provides up to 7.5 days of monitoring. Subjects randomized to the intervention group will undergo 30 days of continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with the SEEQ™ device at the time of randomization.
