  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the time to prostate cancer progression
      (pathological or therapeutic progression) between patients treated with enzalutamide versus
      patients undergoing active surveillance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open label exploratory study, conducted in the US and
      Canada, evaluating the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide for extension of time to prostate
      cancer progression (pathological or therapeutic) in patients with clinically localized,
      histologically proven prostate cancer that is categorized as low risk or intermediate risk
      and who are under AS.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate diagnosed (with ≥10 core biopsy)

          -  Prostate cancer categorized (as determined by central pathology review) as low risk is
             defined as T1c-T2a, PSA&lt;10, N0, M0 (or presumed N0, M0 if CT/bone scan not done due to
             low risk of metastases), GS ≤ 6, ECOG status ≤2 and estimated life expectancy &gt;5 years
             OR intermediate risk is defined as T2b-T2c, PSA&lt;20, N0, M0 (or presumed N0, M0 if
             CT/bone scan not done), GS ≤7 (3+4 pattern only), ECOG status ≤ 2 and estimated life
             expectancy &gt; 5 years. Prostate cancer categorized (as determined by central pathology
             review) to the very low risk category (T1c, GS ≤6, PSA &lt;10 ng/mL, fewer than 3
