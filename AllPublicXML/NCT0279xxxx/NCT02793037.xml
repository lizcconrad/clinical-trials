      Trial Design - Objectives and Purpose The aim of this study is to perform a proof of concept
      for the successful retention and outcome measures of zirconia RBBs for the replacement of
      missing canine or posterior teeth (6-8mm span) and that they will exhibit similar survival
      rates (95%) as metal ceramic RBBs over 3 years and short term (Botelho 2006).

      The use of monolithic extra-coronal zirconia RBBs in the posterior region does not appear to
      have been reported in the literature (A search pf Pub Med and Google Scholar has not shown
      any similar studies that have been published - pubmed.gov; Keywords: &quot;zirconia&quot;, &quot;resin&quot;,
      &quot;clinical&quot; assessed on 17/10/2015 AND google scholar; Keywords: &quot;zirconia&quot;, &quot;resin bonded
      fixed partial denture&quot;, &quot;resin bonded fixed dental prosthesis&quot;, &quot;Maryland&quot;, &quot;resin bonded
      bridge&quot; &quot;posterior&quot;, &quot;clinical&quot;) In addition, currently there appear to be no clinical trials
      planned or finished in this area (clinicaltrial.gov; Keywords: &quot;zirconia&quot;, &quot;resin&quot; assessed
      on 17/10/2015) using zirconia RBBs in the posterior region. This reveals that there is a gap
      in the literature on the use of zirconia for replacing posterior teeth with such prostheses.

      The primary outcome measures would be: success ie. prosthesis retention ie. does not fall out

      The secondary outcome measures would be:

        -  complications of the prosthesis such as tipping, drifting or fracture.

        -  patient centered outcomes (satisfaction and oral health related quality of life) on the
           RBBs The hypothesis is that 2-unit cantilevered zirconia RBBs will be as successful as
           current data on 2-unit cantilevered metal-ceramic RBBs from this centre and that there
           will be no difference in the patient centered outcomes.

      The Primary review appointments will be at 1, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. However, longer term
      follow up will be performed and this centre has experience of such long term studies (9.5
      years - Botelho 2014).

      A randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing to metal-ceramic RBBs will NOT be performed as
      the 5-year success rate of both metal-ceramic (Botelho 2006) and anterior zirconia (Sasse
      2014) prosthesis were higher than 95% and this small differences would mean an unattainable
      large sample size in an equivalence test (Burns 2001).

      Significance and implications Zirconia has significant strength and greater stiffness than
      base metal alloys and displays clinical outcomes comparable to metal-ceramic conventional
      crowns and bridges (Heintze 2010, Sailer 2007). Well polished zirconia has been observed to
      have lower wear rates than porcelain (Stober 2014) Zirconia RBBs for posterior tooth
      replacement will offer an esthetic and biocompatible treatment option to patients over the
      traditional ceramic-metal RBBs. It is anticipated that patient demand for this would be high
      as these prostheses should be as successful (retentive).

      These results would re-write established dental prosthodontics textbooks and this would be
      the first centre to report on the routine use of a 2-unit extracoronal all-zirconia RBB for
      the replacement of missing posterior teeth.

      Research plan and methodology The sample pool would be obtained from patients presenting at
      the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, University of Hong Kong and who request and need
      replacement of one or more missing teeth.. They will be clinically assessed for eligibility
      and invited to participate with written consent in the study. After treatment they will be
      reviewed up to a 3rd year endpoint of the study. Further review beyond this will be
      undertaken.
