      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of
      VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) and VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS) in the serum and mucosa of
      healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      This study will evaluate two experimental human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs):
      VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) and VRC-HIVMAB080-00-AB (VRC01LS). VRC01LS is designed to have a
      longer half-life than VRC01. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of VRC01 and VRC01LS in the serum and mucosa of
      healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

      This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults into five groups. At various time
      points during the study, participants in Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive intravenous (IV)
      infusions of VRC01, and participants in Groups 3 and 5 will receive IV infusions of VRC01LS.
      Participants in Groups 1, 2, and 3 will attend 13 to 14 study visits over about 1 to 1 ½
      years; participants in Groups 4 and 5 will attend 7 to 9 study visits over about 6 months to
      1 year. At certain time points, study visits will include physical examinations, blood
      collection, urine collection, and interviews and questionnaires. At other time points,
      depending on group assignment and gender, visits will also include collection of
      cervicovaginal secretions, rectal secretions, and semen; and cervical, vaginal, and rectal
      biopsies.

        A volunteer who was born female must:

          -  Agree to consistently use effective contraception (see the protocol for more
             information) for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days
             prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit. Effective
             contraception is defined as using the following methods:

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicide,

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide,

                  Team (PSRT)

               -  Successful vasectomy in the male partner (considered successful if a volunteer
                  reports that a male partner has [1] documentation of azoospermia by microscopy,
                  or [2] a vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite
                  sexual activity postvasectomy);

          -  Or not be of reproductive potential, such as having had a bilateral oophorectomy, or
             tubal ligation;

          -  Or be sexually abstinent.

        South Africa:

        A volunteer who was born female must:

          -  Agree to consistently use effective contraception (see the protocol for more
             information) for sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy from at least 21 days
             prior to enrollment through the last required protocol clinic visit. Effective
             contraception for participants in South Africa is defined as using 2 methods of birth
             control.

        ONE barrier contraceptive method:

          -  Condoms (male or female)

          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap

        PLUS ONE of the following methods:

          -  Hormonal contraception, or

          -  Successful vasectomy in the male partner (considered successful if a volunteer reports
             that a male partner has [1] documentation of azoospermia by microscopy, or [2] a
             vasectomy more than 2 years ago with no resultant pregnancy despite sexual activity
             postvasectomy), or

          -  Any other contraceptive method approved by the HVTN 116 PSRT

        Or not be of reproductive potential, such as having had a bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal
        ligation;

        Or be sexually abstinent.

          -  Volunteers who were born female must also agree not to seek pregnancy through
             alternative methods, such as artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization until

                  high risk HPV testing was performed), the volunteer must be willing to undergo a
                  Pap smear with the result reported (verified by medical records) as normal or
                  ASCUS prior to sample collection.

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (e.g., factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema

          -  For those undergoing rectal biopsies, a rectal condition, such as an active infection
             or inflammation of the colorectal area (e.g., an HSV-2 outbreak or inflamed
             hemorrhoids or colitis/diarrhea), internal hemorrhoids, or any other condition noted
             during screening rectal exam via anoscope or in medical history that in the opinion of
             the clinician represents a contraindication to mucosal sampling

          -  For those undergoing vaginal and cervical biopsies, any condition noted during pelvic
             exam via speculum or in medical history that in the opinion of the clinician
             represents a contraindication to mucosal sampling

          -  An active genital tract condition, such as an active infection or inflammation of the
             genital tract (e.g., genital sores or ulcers, penile or abnormal vaginal discharge,
             genital warts that are symptomatic or requiring treatment) or any other condition that
             in the opinion of the clinician represents a contraindication to mucosal sampling

          -  Hysterectomy

          -  Menopause
