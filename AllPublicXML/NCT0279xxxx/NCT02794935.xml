    <textblock>
      This research aims to evaluate the effects of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on apnea
      hypopnea index, sleepiness, sleep quality, cognitive function, motor task, executive
      function, quality of life, chemoreflex sensitivity and vagal modulation of heart rate in
      patients with heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

      Patients with heart failure will be selected through the Outpatient of the Rio Grande do Sul,
      for convenience. Subsequently, patients will be subjected to test respiratory muscle strength
      (manometer), respiratory muscle endurance, portable polysomnography, sleepiness, sleep
      quality, cognitive function (mini-mental state examination), motor task (execution of a
      sequence of digital movements), executive function, quality of life (SF-36), maximum exercise
      testing, chemoreflex sensitivity (peripheral chemoreflex by transient hypoxia and central
      chemoreflex by hypercapnic hyperoxia) and vagal modulation of heart rate (spectral analysis)
      before the start of the training protocol. Patients will be randomized to inspiratory muscle
      training or control group. Inspiratory muscle training will be performed for 30 minutes a
      day, 7 days a week, for 12 weeks with muscle training device (PowerBreathe). There will be a
      weekly monitoring in the Clinical Research Center of the institution where the maximal
      inspiratory pressure (MIP) and respiratory training techniques will be reassessed and
      readjusted (30% of MIP). The control group will be submitted to respiratory training
      techniques with muscle training device (PowerBreathe) without load. After this period, all
      initial tests will be reassessed. A group study with 15 heart failure patients without
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome will be included.

    <description>Participants will be submitted to a linear pressure resistance (PowerBreathe) with an inspiratory load of 30% of maximal inspiratory pressure (adjusted weekly), seven days a week, session duration of 30 minutes for 12 weeks. During training, participants will be instructed to maintain diaphragmatic breathing with a breathing rate of 15-20 cycles/min. Inspiratory load will be set at 30% of maximum static inspiratory pressure, and weekly training loads will be adjusted to maintain 30% of MIP. Each week, six training sessions will be held at home and a training session will be supervised in the research center.</description>
