      The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BF-200 ALA (Ameluz) used with
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) in patients suffering from actinic keratosis.

      The treatment comprised of one PDT session. If 12 weeks after PDT all lesions were cleared
      the patient entered the follow-up period. In case of remaining lesions or not completely
      cleared lesions the patient received a second PDT on the same day. The final assessment was
      performed 12 weeks after the last PDT and the patient moved to the follow-up phase.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were willing and able to sign informed consent form.

          -  Men and women aged between 18 and 85 years inclusive.

          -  Subjects had a general good and stable health condition as confirmed by a physical
             examination and by medical history.

          -  Subjects with clinically stable medical conditions including, but not limited to the
             following diseases were allowed to be included into the study, if the medication taken
             for the treatment of the disease did not match the criteria of the excluded or
             disallowed medications listed in points 7, 10, 11 and 12 of the exclusion criteria:

               -  controlled hypertension

               -  diabetes mellitus type II

               -  hypercholesterolemia

               -  osteoarthritis

          -  Subjects accepted to abstain from sunbathing and the solarium during the study.

          -  Subjects had at least 4 but not more than 8 clinically confirmed actinic keratosis
             (AK) target lesions of mild to moderate intensity within the face or bald scalp
             (excluding eyelids, lips and mucosa), i.e. AK grade I and II according to Olsen et.
             al. 1991.

          -  To document and confirm the diagnosis of the investigators:

               -  Photodocumentation of a representative lesion had to be evaluated and confirmed
                  by an independent expert.

               -  A pre-study biopsy had to be taken from a second representative AK lesion and was
                  histopathologically evaluated by a dermato-pathological expert.

          -  If the evaluation of the photo by the independent reviewer could not confirm the
             diagnosis of the investigator, then the biopsy result decided whether the subject was
             eligible for the study.

          -  The AK lesions had to be discrete and quantifiable; the distance from one lesion to
             its neighbor lesion was greater than 1.0 cm

          -  The diameter of each AK lesion was not less than 0.5 cm and not greater than 1.5 cm.
             The size of each baseline AK lesion was recorded by measuring the two largest
             perpendicular diameters. To describe irregular lesions (ellipsoidal) investigators
             measured the major and minor axis. Both axes had to be above the minimum of 0.5 cm and
             less than 1.5 cm.

          -  The subjects were free of any significant physical abnormalities (e.g., tattoos,
             dermatoses) in the potential treatment area that might cause difficulty with
             examination or final evaluation.

          -  The subjects were willing to stop using moisturizers and any other topical treatments
             with anti-aging products, vitamin A, vitamin C, and/or vitamin E containing ointments
             and creams, and green tea preparations during the study within the treatment area.
             Sunscreens were allowed, but were not to be applied in the treatment area within
             approximately 24 hours before a clinical visit with lesion count.

          -  Women of childbearing potential were only allowed to participate in this study, if
             they used a highly effective method of contraception and had a negative serum
             pregnancy test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had inherited or acquired coagulation defects.

          -  Had received medication with hypericin or systemically acting drugs with phototoxic or
             photoallergic potential such as psoralens, tetracyclines, nalidixic acid, furosemide,

             rose, acridine within 8 weeks prior to treatment with study drug and photodynamic
             therapy (PDT).

The outcome measure describes the mean difference between total lesion size at baseline and 12 weeks after the last PDT. Negative values indicate a reduction in the total lesion area size compared to baseline.</description>

        <description>Overall Cosmetic Outcome (CO) 12 weeks after PDT (12 weeks after 1st PDT or 12 weeks after 2nd PDT). The cosmetic outcome at the end-of-study visit was calculated on the basis of skin quality assessment: skin surface, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, mottled/irregular pigmentation, degree of scarring, and atrophy. The CO was rated as very good if the sum score of the previously mentioned ratings (all ratings for each sign added up) has improved by at least 2 points as compared to baseline; the CO was rated as good if the sum score at a given visit has improved by at least 1 point as compared to baseline; the cosmetic outcome is rated as satisfactory if the sum score at a given visit is identical to the one at baseline; the cosmetic outcome is rated as unsatisfactory if the sum score at a given visit has worsened by 1 point compared to baseline, the cosmetic outcome is rated as impaired if the sum score at a given visit has worsened by at least 2 points compared to baseline.</description>
