  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small-incision vitrectomy techniques have become increasingly popular, with a number of
      advantages over the older 20-gauge instrumentation. The beveled wounds created by the 23- and
      25-gauge trocar systems theoretically do not require sutured closure. However, a certain
      fraction of cases, 1% for 25-gauge systems, and 4-38% for 23-gauge systems, do require suture
      placement. Poor wound closure puts the patient at increased risk of post-operative hypotony
      and is associated with increased risk of endophthalmitis. Currently, surgeons are divided as
      to which suture is the best for sclerotomy closure. The current standard of care is 8-0
      polyglactin 910 (Vicryl, Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH). This suture is soft and easy to work with;
      however, it triggers a robust inflammatory response. The alternative is 6-0 plain gut suture,
      which is more difficult to manipulate and thicker, but causes less tissue inflammation1. The
      purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate these two options for sclerotomy closure.
      The results of this study will enable us to minimize patients' post-operative discomfort
      while maximizing safety outcomes.
