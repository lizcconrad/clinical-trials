    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information on patients who have heart failure and are
      eligible for one of the following two procedures: 1) mechanical support, i.e. ventricular
      assist device (VAD) or 2) heart transplant. the study seeks to determine which patient
      populations benefit from heart transplant or ventricular assist device. This will allow to
      offer the state-of-the-art care to the patients in heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiogenic shock (CS) develops in the end stage of various etiologies of heart failure and
      continues to hold high mortality; ranging from 50 to 80%. Expert consensus recommends use of
      more powerful mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) in this patient population;
      however, scientific evidence has been anecdotal relying on mostly single-center small case
      series and, more fundamentally, because there is no unified definition to grade the severity
      of the highly heterogeneous condition CS. Well-designed studies are warranted to precisely
      characterize the various &quot;phenotypes&quot; of CS as well as the role of MCSD in this condition
      with still excessive mortality.

      This multicenter registry will be the first multicenter large-scale registry focused on
      mechanical circulatory support (MCS) therapy for CS. The fundamental goal of RESCUE is to
      advance the understanding and application of MCSD in order to improve the persistently dismal
      survival of patients with CS with the following intents:

        1. Elucidate current indication and outcomes of MCSD use in CS.

        2. Redefine CS with better description of this disease entity, which will allow better
           prediction of outcomes, selection of treatment strategy, and comparison and design of
           studies.

        3. Facilitate the refinement of patient selection to maximize outcomes with current and new
           device options.

        4. Improve and expedite new device clinical trials by providing historical control data.

        5. Develop consensus &quot;best practice&quot; guidelines to improve clinical management by reducing
           short and long-term complications of MCSD therapy.

        Potential subjects include all adult patients who underwent evaluation for MCS for
        cardiogenic shock. Each adult patient who receives an MCSD at an institution will be
        screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below.

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients who receive any MCSD including Veno-Arterial Extracorporeal Membrane
             Oxygenation (VA ECMO), surgical VAD, and percutaneous VAD, used to treat CS on or
             after 9/30/10. Intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) is not considered an MCSD in this
             Registry.

          -  Adult patients who have signed informed consent. For patients who are too ill to give
             informed consent the health care proxy of the patient or next of kin will be
             approached for the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients younger than 18 years of age.
