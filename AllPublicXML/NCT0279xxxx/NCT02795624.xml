      Specific Aim 1. Characterize the long-term effects of secondhand smoke (SHS) on vascular
      health in pre-ban flight attendants (FAs). Investigators will measure arterial stiffness
      (pulse wave velocity and augmentation index) and endothelial dysfunction (reactive hyperemia
      index) in the pre-ban FA cases, and compare to the cardiovascular risk-factor matched
      Framingham controls.

      It is hypothesized that pre-ban FA cases have increased arterial stiffness (higher pulse wave
      velocity and higher augmentation index) and increased endothelial dysfunction (lower reactive
      hyperemia index) compared to Framingham controls.

      Specific Aim 2. Determine the extent in which remote pre-ban SHS exposure (hours) is
      associated with increased arterial stiffness or endothelial dysfunction.

      Investigators hypothesize that pre-ban SHS exposure is positively associated with both
      increased arterial stiffness and increased endothelial dysfunction.

      Specific Aim 3. Investigators will calculate the cardiovascular risk scores (Framingham,
      Reynolds, and ASCVD) by using subjects' age, blood pressure, family history, lipid panel, and
      highly sensitive C-reactive protein. Investigators will explore the association of the risk
      scores with measures of vascular aging (arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction).
      These scores do not include SHS exposure. Investigators will also test the additive value of
      SHS exposure in increasing arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction using the risk
      scores as an adjustment value.

      It is hypothesized that the cardiovascular risk scores are associated with vascular aging
      (arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction), and that the association between SHS
      exposure and vascular aging remains significant after adjusting for the cardiovascular risk
      scores.

      The significance of this proposal and impact will be (1) mechanistic insights into how remote
      SHS exposure leads to hypertension and vascular stiffness, (2) increased understanding of how
      SHS exposure can increase risk of cardiovascular disease, which is the number one cause of
      death in the United States.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a cohort study, in which investigators will assess for evidence of
      accelerated vascular aging in 300 pre-ban FAs with pre-ban SHS exposure, and compare their
      vascular measures of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction to those of age and
      risk-factor matched Framingham controls. It is hypothesized that pre-ban FAs have increased
      arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction compared to the Framingham subjects, related
      to SHS exposure.
