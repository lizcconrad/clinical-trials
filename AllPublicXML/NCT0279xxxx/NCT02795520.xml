      The purpose of Phase I of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of the
      investigational drug, OTS167, and that of Phase II of this study is to confirm the potential
      response benefit of OTS167.

      OTS167 is a maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) inhibitor which demonstrated
      antitumor properties in laboratory tests. It is being developed as an anti-cancer drug. In
      this study OTS167 will be administrated to patients with AML, ALL, advanced MDSs, advanced
      MPNs, or advanced CML.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory AML, ALL, acute biphenotypic leukemia (assigned to
             the appropriate group by the treating physician and pathology/cytogenetics), advanced
             MDS defined as ≥10% bone marrow blasts, advanced MPN, MDS/MPN overlap syndrome with
             ≥10% bone marrow blasts, or advanced CML after failure of at least 3 TKIs

          2. Age ≥18 years

          3. No prior antineoplastic drug therapy for at least 14 days, with the exception of
             hydroxyurea, prior to starting OTS167. Patients with rapidly proliferative disease may
             continue to receive hydroxyurea.

          4. Patients with a diagnosis of advanced CML must have been treated with 3 prior TKIs,
             and the last therapy must have been discontinued 14 days prior to starting OTS167.

          5. Adequate organ function as defined below:

               -  Liver function (total bilirubin &lt;2mg/dL and aspartate aminotransferase and/or
                  alanine aminotransferase &lt;3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or &lt;5 × ULN if related
                  to leukemic involvement)

               -  Renal function (creatinine &lt;1.5 × ULN)

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2

          7. Negative urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 for each woman of
             childbearing potential

          8. Able to understand the potential risks, benefits, and requirements of the study and
             are willing to provide informed consent; an informed consent form for this study that
             is signed by the patient or his/her legally authorized representative is required
             prior to enrollment
