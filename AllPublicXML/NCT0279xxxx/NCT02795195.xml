  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation
      using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) with the fraction size of 3 GyE in the treatment of
      locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment
      at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose regimens to evaluate
      the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subactue toxicity observed during and
      within 4 months after the completion of CIRT. Once the MTD for locally recurrent NPC is
      determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to patients fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria in the Phase II part of the trial.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of re-irradiation
      using carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) with the fraction size of 3 GyE in the treatment of
      locally recurrent nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) and to evaluate the efficacy of such treatment
      at the MTD. Participants will be treated with CIRT with escalating dose starting from 54GyE
      (3GyE/daily fraction) to potentially 63GyE (3GyE/daily fraction) to evaluate the maximal
      tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of acute and subactue toxicity observed during and within 4
      months after the completion of CIRT. The classic 3+3 method is used for the phase I dose
      escalating part of the trial and approximately 4-18 patients will be accrued. Once the MTD
      for locally recurrent NPC is determined, the MTD will be used as the recommended dose to
      patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria in the Phase II part of the trial. The Phase II
      part of the trial will be a single phase single arm study.

    <description>Four dose levels (54GyE, 57GyE, 60GyE, 63GyE) are planned within the Phase I part. Daily fraction of 3 GyE will be delivered for all dose levels. After the recommended dose (RD), i.e., MTD, is determined or if the treatments to 63 GyE are safely delivered, the recommended dose (or 63 GyE) will be the prescribed dose in the Phase II part of the study. Ninty-five percent (95%) of the isodose line should cover the GTV+3~5mm.</description>
