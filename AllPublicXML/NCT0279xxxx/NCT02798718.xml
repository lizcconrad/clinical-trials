  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Milk is the source of high-quality protein, calcium, and other vitamins and minerals.
      Epidemiologic studies have linked high consumption of milk with risk of metabolic syndrome,
      T2DM, hypertension and obesity, which are independent risk factors of cardiovascular disease.
      However, milk contains disaccharide lactose, which may cause gastrointestinal problems in
      those adults with poor digestion. Recent studies have shown that subjects with intolerance to
      lactose tend to reduce their consumption of milk. Actually, consumption of 12g lactose (240ml
      milk) per day produces negligible symptoms in lactose intolerant. Furthermore, a dairy-rich
      diet could improve lactose intolerance because of colonic adaption to it. Lactose
      maldigestion would not be a restricting factor in milk intake. In general, the undigested
      lactose will be fermented by colonic bacteria into hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and short-chain
      fatty acids (SCFA: acetate, propionate, and butyrate). The SCFAs may have beneficial effects
      on human glucose and lipid metabolism, and the lactose fermentation may change the intestinal
      flora profile. But there are few studies evaluating effect of milk intake on health of people
      with lactose malabsorption or intolerance.This trial intend to study the effect of whole milk
      on cardio-metabolic risk factors of healthy person with or without lactose maldigestion.
