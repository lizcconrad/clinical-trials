  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has prompted a search for a thorough
      understanding of the biology of one of its major causative agents, the hepatitis C virus
      (HCV). HCV particles acquire via budding and encapsidation cellular proteins. There is
      mounting evidence on several viral species that virion-bound proteins are prone to be
      involved either at the replication, budding/egress or entry/release steps of the viral cycle.

      Identifying such targets may yield ideal candidates for gaining insight on the dependence of
      HCV upon a restricted subset of host proteins, therefore providing refined sets of
      genetically stable targets for therapy. This project's goals are to set up adequate
      conditions for robust and reproducible purification of HCV virions in clinical samples,
      followed by the identification of their HCV-bound host proteins and the characterization of
      their functions. Proteomics profiling of HCV particles purified from clinical samples will be
      overlaid with proteins identified and characterized in cell culture grown HCV particles
      during my post-doctoral training, using clinical biomarker discovery grade criteria. Targets
      identified in both samples sets will be subjected to in vitro investigations using
      HCV-replicating cells. Conventional biochemical and imaging methods will be used in order to:
      (i) ascertain their physical association with HCV virions; (ii) define the modalities of
      their interaction with HCV proteins; (iii) decipher the topology and subcellular localization
      of their association with HCV proteins and virions; (iv) quantitatively assess their
      functional involvement in particle budding, egress or secretion and infectivity. A candidate
      that yielded satisfactory results in these experiments will be disclosed and further
      investigated at the level of structural biology, in collaborative research programs.
