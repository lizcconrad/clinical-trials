    <textblock>
      The Creative Arts Diabetes Initiative will offer facilitated art therapy with a
      group/peer-support environment to two groups of youth/young adults, one with type 1 diabetes,
      and one with type 2 diabetes. This environment intends to &quot;meet youth where they are&quot;,
      promote universality, hope and self-understanding, has the potential to be therapeutic and
      allows youth to express and learn about themselves and each other while developing healthy
      coping skills and address their fears and concerns.

      The Creative Arts Diabetes Initiative will offer facilitated art therapy with a
      group/peer-support environment to two groups of youth/young adults, one with type 1 diabetes,
      and one with type 2 diabetes. This environment intends to &quot;meet youth where they are&quot;,
      promote universality, hope and self-understanding, has the potential to be therapeutic and
      allows youth to express and learn about themselves and each other while developing healthy
      coping skills and address their fears and concerns.

      As much of diabetes management is about meeting physical health goals - it is the vision of
      this study that offering additional support in the form of art therapy will have positive
      effects for bringing awareness and avenues for self-care to the other often neglected
      dimensions of patients' mental, emotional and spiritual health as part of a more holistic
      health process.

      Engaging in art therapy has the potential to decrease diabetes related distress by giving
      youth a means and opportunity to identify, understand and express their feelings about having
      diabetes. Improved self-awareness and self-reflectiveness can help youth integrate their
      feelings and learn how this can motivate, influence and impact their behaviors and life
      choices.

      Youth will have the opportunity for engaging in peer support, and to build relationships that
      are meaningful, thus increasing their sense of belonging and positively affect their level of
      self-confidence, purpose and wellbeing.
