  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is an epidemic and is a major burden on the US healthcare system. The most
      common cardiovascular endpoint is HF. Thus, novel interventions to prevent HF in CKD are
      highly desirable. This study will assess: the variability in the response to ISMN therapy;
      the degree of change in central hemodynamics and cardiac endpoints through analysis of
      changes in LV mass, diffuse myocardial fibrosis, and myocardial systolic and diastolic
      function.

      This is a open label, parallel arm, randomized study of ISMN with or without vitamin C to
      improve exercise capacity and LV remodeling in CKD. Twenty subjects with CKD will be enrolled
      in this study and three different daily doses of SR-ISMN will be administered over time
      accompanied by a random administration of vitamin C in half of the subjects (500 mg three
      times daily). Before administration of SR-ISMN, baseline assessments will be performed. These
      include arterial tonometry, Doppler echocardiography, reflection magnitude measurements, a
      bicycle exercise test, activity monitoring, cardiac MRI, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring,
      and blood drawing. After these assessments, a dose of 30 mg of SR-ISMN will be administered
      daily (either with or without vitamin C) for the first week, 60 mg SR-ISMN for the second
      week, and 120 mg for the third week. After each week, blood pressure and central hemodynamics
      will be assessed. The third week visit also includes the bicycle exercise study and
      initiating the long term dose (60 or 120 mg) of SR-ISMN. In the long-term phase, blood
      pressure and hemodynamics are assessed at 12-weeks post initiation of the study
      medication(s). After 24 weeks we will perform the final assessment, which includes the same
      tests performed during the baseline assessment. Enrollment will take place at the Hospital of
      the University of Pennsylvania and the Penn Presbyterian Medical Center.
