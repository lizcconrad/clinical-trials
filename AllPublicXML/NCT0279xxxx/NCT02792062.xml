  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 clinical pharmacological study of TAK-385 in Japanese premenopausal healthy
      adult women.

      Using an open-label crossover design, food effects on the pharmacokinetics and safety of
      TAK-385 will be evaluated in participants receiving a single oral dose of TAK-385 40 mg in
      fasted condition without breakfast, before breakfast, or after breakfast.

      Participants determined to be eligible will be randomly assigned to one of Groups A to F
      prior to study medication administration in Period 1; subsequently, participants will receive
      one TAK-385 40 mg tablet in fasted condition without breakfast (following a minimum 10-hour
      overnight fast), before breakfast (30 minutes before starting breakfast), or after breakfast
      (30 minutes after starting breakfast) in Periods 1, 2, and 3.
