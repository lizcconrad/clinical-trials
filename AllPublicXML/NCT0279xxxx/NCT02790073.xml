        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with either newly diagnosed CUA OR recurrent CUa that has been dormant with
             no skin lesion involvement for at least 90 days from study start (new or recurrent
             diagnosis must be made within 5 weeks of study start)

          2. Patients who signed the written informed consent to participate in this clinical trial
             (prior to any clinical trial-related procedures being performed), after reading the
             Patient Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form (ICF), and who had the opportunity
             to discuss the clinical trial with the Investigator or designee

          3. Males or females aged â‰¥18

          4. Patients on maintenance haemodialysis

          5. Patients with at least a minimum level of pain on VAS scale or on pain-killers
             stronger than NSAIDs

          6. Females of child-bearing potential should use a highly effective contraceptive measure
             throughout the study AND have a negative serum pregnancy test at entry. Male patients
             having sexual relationship in which pregnancy can occur should take adequate
             contraceptive precautions (wear a condom)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. BMI &gt;35 and central(abdominal) ulcers

          3. History of bisphosphonate treatment within 12 months before entering into the study

          4. Severely ill patients without reasonable expectation of survival for &gt; 6 months
             according to the treating physician

          5. Patients with scheduled parathyroidectomy during the run-in or study period

          6. Female patients who are either intending to get pregnant or are undergoing treatment
             to get pregnant, as well as breast-feeding females

          7. Participation in another clinical trial with an experimental drug within 90 days prior
             the inclusion

          8. Any psychological, emotional problems, any disorders or resultant therapy that is
             likely to invalidate informed consent, or limit the ability of the patient to comply
             with the Clinical Trial Protocol requirements

          9. Patients who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are considered unsuitable for any
             other reason
