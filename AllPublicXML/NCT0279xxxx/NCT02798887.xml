    <textblock>
      Thirty patients will be treated using the principles of bone grafting for ridge preservation.
      Fifteen test patients will receive a flap technique with an intrasocket cancellous cortical
      particulate allograft plus a facial overlay graft using a bovine xenograft without a membrane
      where only the exposed intrasocket allograft will be covered with a piece of Alloderm GBR.
      The positive control group of fifteen patients will receive a flap technique with an
      intrasocket cancellous cortical particulate allograft plus a facial overlay graft using a
      bovine xenograft plus Alloderm GBR membrane. Approximately, four months post-surgery, a
      trephine core will be taken from the grafted site immediately prior to implant placement and
      submitted for histologic processing.
