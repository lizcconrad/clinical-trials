  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amblyopia is a significant health problem, affecting up to 4% of the population in the United
      States. Amblyopia, commonly known as &quot;lazy eye,&quot; is a developmental visual disorder in which
      one or both eyes suffer from poor vision as a result of being disadvantaged in early life.
      Strabismus, or eye misalignment, such as crossed eyes (esotropia) or wandering eyes
      (exotropia), and anisometropia, or a power difference between the eyes, are the most common
      causes of amblyopia. If conventional treatment, such as patching the better seeing eye, is
      not initiated during the critical period of visual development, lasting visual impairment may
      persist throughout life. This critical period of visual development has been thought to end
      around age 10. However, recent research has demonstrated that the critical period of visual
      development can be extended into adulthood. Complete light deprivation in animal models has
      restored plasticity in the visual cortex and has demonstrated drastic recovery of vision in
      amblyopic eyes. The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the impact of complete light
      deprivation on visual function in a cohort of human adults with severe amblyopia from
      anisometropia.
