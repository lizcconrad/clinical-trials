  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As people grow older skeletal muscle gradually becomes smaller and weaker, causing reduced
      mobility and quality of life. To understand and reverse this negative process investigators
      need to find new ways of improving the ability of muscle to perform physical activity. There
      is some evidence that supplements may improve how the mitochondria work, and investigators
      want to explore this idea in more detail, by measuring how the muscles work and respond to
      exercise before and after taking the supplement. This will give us the basic information
      investigators would need to see if this is a useful idea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A defining feature of ageing is loss of muscle mass ('sarcopenia') and associated functional
      weakness ('dynapenia'). A common characteristic of dynapenia is lowered mitochondrial content
      and metabolic function, causing reduced aerobic capacity, increased sensations of effort and
      impaired lipid oxidation (with resultant glucose intolerance). Exercise training improves
      mitochondrial and muscle function in ageing populations, however such adaptations remain
      below that of young counterparts, suggesting alternative approaches are required.
      Pre-clinical studies show that dietary supplementation with precursors of nicotinamide
      adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) restore mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in ageing
      rodents and diabetic humans. However, whether NAD+ precursors rejuvenate mitochondrial
      capacity and, ultimately, muscle function in older humans is unknown. This pilot project will
      therefore investigate the efficacy of NAD+ precursor supplementation for increasing muscle
      performance in normally active older men, combined with examination of the molecular and
      metabolic mechanisms regulating physiological responses.

    <description>The active supplement will contain the prescription drug Acipimox (250 mgs) , a nicotinic acid precursor traditionally used to lower blood lipid levels. The supplement will be administered 3 times per day, for a 14 day period.</description>
