  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Membrane microparticles are submicron fragments of membrane vesicles shed from various cell
      types. Circulating endothelial microparticles have been proposed as markers of endothelial
      injury. However, which mechanical forces contribute to their release is not clear.

      In a first series subjects (50% hypertensives) with and without arterial hypertension and no
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) (n=50) will be recruited. MP subpopulations will be
      discriminated by flow cytometry according to the expression of established surface antigens
      including CD31+/41-, CD144+, and CD62e+. Besides office and ambulatory 24h blood pressure
      measurements, pulse wave analysis will be performed to determine central blood pressure,
      augmentation index (AIX), and pulse wave velocity. Endothelial function (Flow-mediated
      dilation, FMD), arterial pulsatile stretch (fractional diameter changes, FDC), and
      wall-shear-stress (WSS) will be measured in the same segment of the brachial artery (BA) by
      ultrasound. In a second series, the investigators will take measurements in subjects with
      hypertensive crises (SBP&gt;180 mmHg) (n=20) before and after 4h and normalization of arterial
      BP by urapidil. In a third series, the investigators will take measurement in subjects with
      stable CAD (n=10) before and after transfemoral coronary diagnostic angiography.
