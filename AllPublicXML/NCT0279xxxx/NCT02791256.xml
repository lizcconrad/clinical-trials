  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      increasing the dose of peginterferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) in participants with Genotype 1/4/5/6
      CHC and an early non-response to a standard course of peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin.
      The study will consist of screening (4 weeks), treatment (32 weeks), and follow-up (24
      weeks).

          -  Participants had to have been receiving their first treatment for chronic hepatitis C
             (i.e. previously naive to any therapy) consisting of peginterferon alfa-2a plus
             ribavirin for 16 weeks (+/- 10 days), without reaching a negative or 2-log drop of
             Serum Hepatitis C Virus Ribonucleic Acid (HCV-RNA) at Week 12 of therapy as compared
