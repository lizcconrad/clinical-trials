  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore the activity of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating
      factor (GM-CSF) signaling pathway in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the potential
      impact of inhibition of this axis by GSK3196165, and to evaluate whether there are any
      differences in the GM-CSF axis between subjects with early RA compared with those with more
      established disease. This study also aims to establish the potential impact of GSK3196165 on
      inflammatory structural joint damage in the hand/wrist using magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI). This is a randomized Phase IIa, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      parallel group study. Approximately 40 subjects with active RA despite treatment with
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (including conventional or biologic) will be
      randomized into the study, following a screening period of up to 6 weeks. The total treatment
      period is up to 10 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up period after the last dose (Week 22).

             risk.

          -  A history of malignancy.

          -  Contraindication to MRI scanning.
