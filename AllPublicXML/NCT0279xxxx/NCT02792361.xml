  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial where patients who present to the neurosurgery service in need of a
      procedure that requires a pterional craniotomy will be screened, and if eligible, enrolled
      for the randomization in the placement of a drain at the surgical site. At present, there is
      not a protocol for whether or not to use a drain following this procedure. There is some
      debate on whether it serves any real benefit for the patient or if it may actually be
      detrimental in cases where infection occurs. This study aims to answer this question by
      randomizing patients to drain placement and then comparing patient outcomes between the two
      groups. These include the following: infection rate, length of hospital stay, self-reported
      patient pain and discomfort, the amount of time before patients are able to open their eye
      ipsilateral to the side of operation, change in forehead circumference post-op days 1-3, and
      any unforeseen post-operative complications. This will be accomplished through using a
      patient-administered survey, recording physical measurements, and a patient chart review.
      Statistical analysis will then be used to identify any differences that may exist.

    <description>An overall assessment comparing complications between the two study groups will be performed. This will include looking things such as hospital acquired pneumonia, the development of any new neurological conditions or deficiencies, and other unforeseen complications that may arise which are not be directly related to the drain but may potentially still be influenced by it.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that have been scheduled for surgery requiring the use of a pterional
             craniotomy approach

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in need of a surgical intervention requiring a pterional craniotomy due to
             reasons of physical injury

          -  Patients who need a pterional craniotomy with a orbitozygomatic approach

          -  Patients who have noticeable physical injury to their skull

          -  Patients with a prior surgical history of a craniotomy

          -  Patients with a pathological condition deemed severe enough by the screening physician
             to possibly influence the healing process of the procedure (blood clot disorder,
             cirrhosis, severe nutrient depletion, congestive heart failure etc.)
