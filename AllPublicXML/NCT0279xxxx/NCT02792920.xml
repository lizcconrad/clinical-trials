  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare early and late clinical outcomes with everolimus-eluting cobalt-chromium stent in
      patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction, as well as identify the
      characteristics and efficacy of CoCr-EES.

      Also, OCT sub-analysis will be conducted

          1. Patients with STEMI who are able to undergo CoCr-EES implantation.

          2. Patients with no history of PCI in the target vessel

          3. Patients who are 20 or older at the time of informed consent

          4. Patients who provided written informed consent by himself/herself

          5. Patients who are judged by their treating physician to be able to undergo PCI with
             CoCr-EES

          6. Patients for whom thrombus aspiration prior to CoCr-EES implantation can be
             recommended

          7. Patients who meet all the following vascular inclusion criteria i.Patients with target
             lesion in native coronary artery ii.Patients with visual maximum vessel diameter of
             the target stent site in target lesion

          8. Patients were obtained finally revascularization of TIMI 3 by visual observation in
             the target vessel

          9. Patients who are able to treat with CoCr-EES the diameter 2.5mm or more and 3.5mm or
