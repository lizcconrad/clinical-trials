      In this randomized controlled study, patients at age 5 to 14 and enrolled in obesity
      treatment, were randomized to either usual care according to regular routine or to telephone
      consultation.The randomization was done at the start of individual treatment and lasted for
      18 months. We also studied working time required for the Health care, and the families'
      experience of the Telephone coaching.
