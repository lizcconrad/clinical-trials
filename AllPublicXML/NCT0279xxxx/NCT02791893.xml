  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers propose studying Gulf veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI), characterized by
      a problem with widespread pain. Besides their pain, the researchers will also assess the
      effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in alleviating migraine headache, another complaint
      of Gulf veterans, which is common in the presence of widespread pain. Importantly, the
      researchers are partnering with a company that has made a hand-held device that allows for
      stimulation of the vagus nerve without the need for surgery; it works by the patient putting
      it on the skin overlying the vagus nerve in their neck and then turning it on for 120 second
      periods three times a day. The device is programmed to deliver only 6 bouts of stimulation
      per day - one to each side of the neck three times a day; it is then inactive until the next
      day. The fact that this device can be used without surgery and is non-invasive makes it
      extremely practical for use.

      After collecting pre-treatment measurement of pain severity and headache severity, veterans
      will receive either the actual active VNS device or an inactive device, which does not
      stimulate the nerve. Veterans will use their device for ten weeks - providing similar
      information periodically over this period by responding to questions about the severity of
      their pain and headaches, They will then return to the Center for the final phase of the
      study where all veterans will receive active devices. Ten weeks later, they will return to
      the Center to provide information to allow the investigators to gain further knowledge as to
      the effectiveness of actual VNS in relieving pain - both throughout the body and in the head.
