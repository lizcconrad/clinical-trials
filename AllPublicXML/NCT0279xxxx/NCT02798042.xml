      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, but significant complication after elective surgery

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common, but significant complication after elective surgery
      which is associated with an increased risk of mortality, major adverse cardiac events,
      prolonged length of hospital stay, and increased cost per episode of care. Obese patients are
      at increased risk of postoperative AKI when compared to normal weight patients; however
      current methods to assess preoperative renal function in this patient population (such as
      measurement of serum creatinine and calculation of the estimated glomerular filtration rate)
      have previously been demonstrated to overestimate their true renal function. , Preoperative
      proteinuria has previously been determined to be predictive of the development of
      postoperative AKI in patients of all weights undergoing cardiac surgery. Published reports on
      the prevalence of proteinuria in obese patients span a wide range: from 8- 43%. The
      investigators aim to determine the predictive value of preoperative proteinuria on the
      development of postoperative AKI in patients presenting for elective laparoscopic bariatric
      surgery at NYULMC. The investigators hypothesize that preoperative proteinuria will be
      associated with an increased incidence of AKI within 48 hours after elective laparoscopic
      bariatric surgery. Furthermore, since there is a wide range of reported prevalence of
      proteinuria in the bariatric patient population, part of the value of the study will be to
      provide a more definitive assessment of the prevalence of proteinuria in this surgical
      population.
