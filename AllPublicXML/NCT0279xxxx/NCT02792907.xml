    <textblock>
      Compressive stockings ameliorate functional outcome and quality of life in patients after
      elective orthopedic foot and ankle surgery. In this randomized controlled trial the
      investigators want to analyze the effect of compressive stockings after foot and ankle
      surgery. Additionally the investigators want to evaluate the compliance of the compressive
      stockings Treatment. Therefore an electronic chip device is implanted into the compressive
      stockings to monitor wearing time.

    <textblock>
      Pain and swelling are typical sequelae following surgical procedures at the foot and ankle.
      While it is known that compressive stockings treatment decreases swelling and improves
      overall ankle function and quality of life in patients after ankle fracture, the
      investigators hypothesize that compressive stockings could also ameliorate functional outcome
      and quality of life in patients after elective orthopedic foot and ankle surgery.

      Reduced compliance in wearing compressive stockings after foot and ankle surgery might
      probably be a limiting factor of this postoperative adjuvant compressive therapy. Therefore
      the investigators want to evaluate patient´s compliance by using an electronic chip device to
      monitor wearing behavior.

      All patients who will be operated on their feet and ankle are randomized and blindly assigned
      into either the compressive or control-group. Each group consists of 80 patients (160
      patients in total). The compression group includes patients who receive postoperative
      compression stockings. The control group does not receive any stockings. Regular checks at 6
      weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively will be performed in order to assess the following
      parameters:

        1. Foot and Ankle Scores

        2. Pain

      2. Swelling of the foot and lower limb 3. Wearing compliance by electronically recorded
      wearing time.

      The Information about the implanted sensor, which records the stockings wearing time will be
      given to the patients after the compressive stockings therapy (6 weeks), so that the patients
      are not influenced by the fact, that their wearing behaviour had been measured.

      After this information, the patients decide if the sensor information may be evaluated by the
      study team or not.
