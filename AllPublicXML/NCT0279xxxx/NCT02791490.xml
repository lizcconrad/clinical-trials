  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to evaluate, in adult participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) and inadequate glycemic control on sub-maximal metformin mono-therapy (1000 mg/day),
      the effect of up-titration of metformin plus the addition of sitagliptin compared to
      up-titration of metformin alone on glycemic control. The primary hypotheses of this study are
      that up-titration of metformin to 2000 mg/day (1000 mg, twice daily [b.i.d]) plus the
      addition of sitagliptin 100 mg/day provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1C (A1C)
      compared to metformin up-titration alone and that this treatment is safe and well-tolerated.
