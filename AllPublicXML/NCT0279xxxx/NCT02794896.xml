  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia depth affects the proliferation of lymphocytes to NK-cells and memory T-cells
      effect and the phagocytosis activity of macrophages in healthy patients. ASA 1-3 subjects
      undergoing extended shoulder surgery under continuous regional anesthesia randomly were
      assigned to a deep or a shallow anesthesia level (BIS &lt;35 or &gt;55) for more than an hour.
      Immune response is measured by lymphocyte proliferation as well as neutrophil and monocyte
      phagocytosis activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood samples were taken under minimal stress prior to anesthesia induction (T0), recovery
      (T1) and 12 weeks following hospital discharge (T2) from the respective anesthesia depth
      level. Bispectral index monitoring (BIS) was performed from the awake state to complete
      recovery in all subjects.

      Hemoglobin concentration, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined by routine
      automated laboratory techniques. Lymphocyte proliferation was analyzed by SASPA flow
      cytometry analysis. In brief, 100 µl EDTA blood were stirred with 10 µl FITC and PE marked
      antibody mixture containing CD3, CD4, CD8, CD 16, CD45, CD28, CD27, CD 56.

      Monocyte and neutrophil phagocytosis activity was measured separately in macrophages of fresh
      heparinized whole blood using flow cytometric test kits.

      Proteomics of monocytes was done synchronously.

    <description>Standard anesthesia with fentanyl, propofol for shoulder surgery together with a interscalene plexus block was performed. The anesthesiologist only was informed about the group allocation by the study director and tried to control best for maintenance on target anesthesia level BIS 45 (group 1, deep anesthesia). Anesthesia depth was measured by BIS monitors (BIS Vista, Aspect) for every minute and the minutes below or equal to a BIS level of 45 were counted.</description>
