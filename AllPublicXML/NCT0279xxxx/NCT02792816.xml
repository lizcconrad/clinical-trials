      Efficacy and safety of the artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria patients in Myanmar and artemisinin molecular markers analysis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators assessed the efficacy and safety of the ACT in uncomplicated falciparum
      malaria in different sentinel sites in Myanmar. The recruited patients were follow-up until
      day 28 or day-42 based on the ACTs. Day-0 samples were analysed for artemisinin molecular
      markers, (K13 kelch propeller, Pfmdr2, Pffd and Pfarps10).
