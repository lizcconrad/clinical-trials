  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study fills a notable gap in the transdiagnostic literature by evaluating whether an
      evidence-based transdiagnostic treatment for emotional disorders such as the Unified Protocol
      for Children (UP-C) is effective for treating childhood behavior problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By participating in the study, child participants will learn emotion regulation skills and
      have opportunities to interact and practice skills with other children who have similar
      problems. In addition, parent participants will learn effective parenting skills, including
      appropriate limit-setting, use of praise and consequences, and empathy, that may help them
      effectively navigate the challenges of caring for a child with behavior concerns (1). Parents
      will also have the opportunity to interact with other parents who face similar challenges,
      providing validation and support. Upon completion of the study, investigators plan to share
      these findings at professional conferences and submit manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals.
      Collectively, this study will add to the literature in the pediatric mental health field and
      may also serve as a model for other outpatient clinics regarding implementation and provision
      of a transdiagnostic approach to treat children with behavior problems. Thus, the main goals
      of the current study are to examine the effectiveness of the UP-C group treatment in reducing
      childhood behavior problems, evaluate parents' satisfaction with this treatment, and
      determine the feasibility of implementing this treatment in a pediatric outpatient setting.
