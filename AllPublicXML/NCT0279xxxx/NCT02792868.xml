    <textblock>
      Study a sample of patients in primary prevention, moderate cardiovascular risk (n = 83
      patients), with normal, non-diabetic renal function. The investigators quantify the
      phophocalcic intake and excretion, realizing a food examination and a urine collection of 24
      particular. The investigators will measure plasma levels of FGF23 serum calcium,
      phosphatemia, the investigators will calculate the tubular reabsorption of phosphate. The
      investigators will conduct a quantitative assessment of coronary calcification by a
      non-injected CT scan, measuring semi automated way Agatston calcium score. There will be an
      analysis of collinearity. An adjustment will be made for confounding variables in a
      generalized linear regression model.
