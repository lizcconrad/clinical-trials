  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many individuals with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) have difficulty using their hands and
      arms. MyndMove is a non-invasive medical device that uses short, low energy electrical pulses
      with surface electrodes to cause muscle contractions to produce a full range of reaching and
      grasping movements, which the patient is unable to perform by him/herself.

      By using MyndMove therapy to help the individual move their arms and hands as he/she attempts
      to carry out typical reaching and grasping movements, the individual improves their ability
      to perform these tasks voluntarily.

      The purpose of this study is to study the effectiveness of MyndMove therapy in improving the
      ability of individuals to move their arms and hands.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is no control group for this study. Participants from both treatment groups:

        -  Early treatment group = 10 days to 6 months post tSCI and

        -  Late treatment group = 6 months plus one day post tSCI

      will receive one session (60 minutes) of MyndMove therapy, 3 to 5 times per week (only once
      per day), to gain 20 hours of intervention (total treatment duration will be 4 to 7 weeks).

      Each 1 hour session includes therapy for single-arm or bilateral (left and right upper
      extremities) as clinically indicated for each study participant. Over the course of 20 one
      hour sessions, participants will progress through the various movement sequences aimed at
      regaining natural, unassisted voluntary movement in the affected limb(s). The MyndMove
      therapy will be in addition to the conventional upper limb rehabilitation therapy the
      participant will be prescribed to undertake at their local institution.

      From previous experience, the first signs of function recovery may be expected to emerge two
      to four weeks after the onset of the MyndMove therapy program. As soon as the participant
      shows signs of recovery of either the voluntary extension or flexion in a stimulated muscle
      group, s/he will be encouraged to make an effort to voluntarily produce the movement that was
      previously facilitated by FES. As the participant demonstrates improved strength and range of
      motion, the FES for that muscle group will be phased out, and moved to another muscle group
      that is still paralyzed and needs to be &quot;reactivated&quot;. The order in which muscle groups will
      be sequentially &quot;reactivated&quot; will be patient dependent.

      Muscle reactivation milestones will be monitored and recorded during MyndMove therapy. The
      number of MyndMove treatments required to reach each milestone will be recorded. In addition,
      the overall time required to reach each milestone will be recorded.

      Total duration of study participation, including a follow-up assessment, will be
      approximately 4 to 5 months.

    <description>This is a disability scale that has been specifically developed to evaluate the functional outcomes of patients with traumatic and non-traumatic SCI. The SCIM assesses function in three core areas: 1) Self-care, which includes feeding, bathing, dressing and grooming; 2) Respiration and sphincter management; and lastly 3) Mobility.</description>

    <description>This is a multi-modality test designed to assess the integration of sensorimotor hand and upper limb impairment and function. This test combines the features of several other tests that have been used to assess hand and upper limb function in the peripheral hand population.</description>

    <description>A test developed to evaluate improvements in the gross motor function of the unilateral grasp due to FES for reaching and grasping treatment. Hand functions that will be tested with the TRI-HFT are: lateral or pulp pinch, and palmar grasps.</description>
