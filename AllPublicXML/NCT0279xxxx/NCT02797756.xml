  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using an active cohort of children in whom Airway and gastrointestinal endoscopy will be
      performed, investigators will conduct a chart review to obtain relevant clinical data and the
      investigators will use an aliquot of airway sample obtained during the clinically indicated
      bronchoscopy for microbiome analysis. A case-control study design will be used to study
      whether subjects with CC with GER have a distinct lung microbiome and increased inflammation
      as compared with subjects with CC without GER and to determine whether the microbiome and
      degree of inflammation is related to the type of GER (acidic versus nonacidic).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children (Age 0 - 24 years) referred to the NYU Pediatric AeroDigestive Center to
             evaluate for CC (&gt;4weeks).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Antibiotic or steroids (inhaled or systemic) use within the prior one-week. Rationale:
             Antibacterial drugs and immune-modulators are confounders that may impact the
             microbiome and inflammation. While longer period free of Antibacterial drugs and
             immune-modulators would be desired, it would be unethical and it is not the usual
             standard of care to withdraw treatment for longer periods of time.

          -  Interstitial Lung Disease or pneumonia on X-ray

          -  Cystic fibrosis

          -  Primary ciliary dyskinesia

          -  Immunodeficiency syndromes

          -  Major airway abnormalities

          -  Proton pump inhibitor/H2-receptor antagonist therapy within the prior 2 weeks
