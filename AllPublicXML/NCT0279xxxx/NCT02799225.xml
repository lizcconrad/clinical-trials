  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enterobacteria constitute a family of Gram negative bacilli of the gastrointestinal flora.
      These micro-organisms are frequently responsible for nosocomial or community-acquired
      infections, for which treatment is essentially based on the use of beta-lactam antibiotics.
      This class of antibiotics comprises penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams and carbapenems.
      Carbapenems have the advantage of possessing a broad antibacterial spectrum and the capacity
      to resist the hydrolytic action of a large number of beta-lactamases, widespread inactivating
      enzymes.

      However, new enzymes, called carbapenemases, able to confer resistance to carbapenems either
      alone or in combination with additional resistance mechanisms such as loss of membrane
      permeability or overexpression of efflux systems, are currently emerging all over the world.
      Carbapenemases represent a major public health problem because of the risk of therapeutic
      impasse and their high epidemic potential.

        patients undergoing bacteriological samples as part of routine clinical practice during
        their hospital stay in one of the 6 participating centres. Patients in whom the results of
        bacteriological examinations reveal the presence of an Enterobacteria strain with reduced
        susceptibility to carbapenems will be included in this project

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in whom the results of bacteriological examinations reveal the presence of an
             Enterobacteria strain with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems

          -  Control : patients ( infected or colonized ) a strain of Enterobacter sensitive to
             carbapenems immediately isolated after a strain of Enterobacter having decreased
             susceptibility to carbapenems from the same service and same hospital ( 2 strains
             susceptible strain with reduced sensitivity).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Duplicate : same strain to a first strain of reduced sensitivity in isolated the same
             patient during the study period ( same bacterial species , even after characterization
             resistance mechanism).
