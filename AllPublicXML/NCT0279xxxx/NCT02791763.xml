  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study to
      compare the efficacy and safety of GSK1278863 administered for 52 weeks versus epoetin beta
      pegol in approximately 286 Japanese ND and 50 PD subjects with renal anemia. The study will
      consist of three cohorts. Cohort 1 and Cohort 3 will consist of ND subjects
      (Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent [ESA] users and ESA non-users) randomized to receive
      GSK1278863 or epoetin beta pegol in a ratio of 1:1. PD subjects will be enrolled into Cohort
      2 and will receive GSK1278863. This study consists of a 4-week screening phase, a 52-week
      treatment phase (including primary efficacy evaluation period [Weeks 40 to 52]), and a 4-week
      follow-up phase following the treatment phase. The primary objective of this study is to
      demonstrate non-inferiority of GSK1278863 to epoetin beta pegol based on mean hemoglobin
      (Hgb) during the primary efficacy evaluation period in ND subjects. ESA non-users from Cohort
      1 will be excluded from the primary efficacy analysis. Study results will be used as pivotal
      study data for an NDA submitted for GSK1278863 for the treatment of renal anemia in Japan.

    <description>Primary efficacy evaluation period in this study is defined as time period between week 40 and week 52, during the treatment period. Mean Hgb during the primary efficacy evaluation period, will be analyzed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of GSK1278863 to epoetin beta pegol in ND subjects, including Cohort 1 (ESA users only) and Cohort 3 (ESA users and ESA non-users). The primary efficacy population is the Intent to Treat (ITT) Population which consists of Cohort 1 subjects (ESA users) and Cohort 3 subjects (ESA users and ESA non-users) who are given randomization number with Hgb measurement at both Baseline and at least one scheduled visit following Baseline. A mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) will be used to estimate the mean Hgb during the primary efficacy evaluation period and its 95% confidence interval by treatment groups.</description>

A logistic regression model including treatment group, Baseline Hgb, and current ESA therapy (presence or absence) as covariates will be used.

          -  Myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or transient ischemic attack:
             Diagnosed within 8 weeks prior to screening or during a period from screening to Day
             1.

          -  Heart failure: Class IV heart failure, as defined by the New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) functional classification system

          -  QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) (screening verification only): QTc &gt;500
             milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt;530 msec in subjects with bundle branch block Note: QT
             interval corrected using the Bazett's formula (QTcB) will be used, and
             Electrocardiogram (ECG) can be mechanically or manually read.

        Other disease-related criteria

          -  Liver disease (if any of the following occurs):

               -  (Screening verification only) Alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;2 times upper limit of
                  normal (ULN)

               -  (Screening verification only) Bilirubin &gt;1.5 times ULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5
                  times ULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin is
                  &lt;35%)

               -  Current unstable active liver or biliary disease (generally defined by the onset
                  of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal/gastric
                  varices, persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis) Note: Stable liver disease (including
                  asymptomatic gallstones, chronic hepatitis B/C, or Gilbert's syndrome) is
                  acceptable if the subject otherwise meets entry criteria..

          -  Malignancy: History of malignancy within 2 years prior to screening, or currently
             receiving treatment for cancer, (PD subjects only) complex renal cystic &gt;3 centimeters
             (cm) (II F, III or IV based on the Bosniak classification) Note (ND subjects and PD
             subjects): The only exception is squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin
             that has been definitively treated &gt;=8 weeks before screening.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, Hgb increase to the target range (11.0-13.0 g/dL)
             is medically risky.

        Concomitant medication and other study treatment-related criteria

          -  Iron: Planned use of intravenous iron during the screening phase or during a period
             from Day 1 to Week 4 Note: Oral iron is acceptable. However, the same dose regimen
             must be used throughout the screening phase and from Day 1 to Week 4.
             Antihyperphosphatemic agents containing iron (e.g., ferric citrate hydrate) are also
             acceptable only if used for at least 12 weeks prior to screening. However, they must
             be continued throughout the screening phase from Day 1 to Week 4.

          -  Severe allergic reactions: History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or
             hypersensitivity to excipients in the investigational product or epoetin beta pegol

          -  Drugs and supplements: Use or planned use of any prescription or non-prescription
             drugs or dietary supplements that are prohibited during the study period (prohibited
             medications: strong inducers and inhibitor of Cytochrome P450 2C8 [CYP2C8])

          -  Prior investigational product exposure: Use of an investigational agent within 30 days
             or five half lives of the investigational agent (whichever is longer)

          -  Prior treatment with GSK1278863: Any prior treatment with GSK1278863 for a treatment
             duration of &gt;30 days

        General health-related criteria

          -  Other conditions: Any other condition, clinical or laboratory abnormality, or
             examination finding that the investigator (or subinvestigator) considers would put the
             subject at unacceptable risk, which may affect study compliance or prevent
             understanding of the aims or investigational procedures or possible consequences of
             the study.
