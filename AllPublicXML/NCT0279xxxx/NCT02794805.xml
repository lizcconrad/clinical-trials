  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An Octanoate breath test will be used to assess the presence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in
      subjects with risk. The gold standard will be MRI.

      1. Informed consent will be obtained from all patients prior to enrollment.

        2. The trial will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, with GCP standards, and
           the applicable regulatory requirements.

        3. This study will be cross-sectional, where patients will be enrolled on a walk in basis.
           Once one arm is completed the other one will be enriched in order to obtain at least 50
           positive and at least 50 negative HCC subjects as defined by MRI.

        4. All patients will undergo AFP and US if they do not have results within the past three
           months.

        5. If the patient undergoes liver FNA, the biopsy results will be evaluated for the
           presence of HCC.

        6. For all patients, a case report form will be completed.

        7. All patients will undergo a physical examination, and their medical history/concomitant
           medications, weight, height and age will be recorded. Furthermore, recent (past 3
           months) blood test results, if available, may be recorded.

        8. If relevant (woman of child bearing age), a pregnancy test will be performed to rule out
           pregnancy when performing the breath test.

        9. All MRI negative patients with low OBT results will undergo additional MRI within 6 to
           12 months post OBT to rule out HCC occurrence.

       10. If available, all additional MRI/CT/US results will be recorded within the patient's
           CRF.

    <description>Breath testing utilizing 13C is a safe, non-invasive means for measuring a certain pathway's metabolic rate. 13C is a stable, non-radioactive isotope which can be incorporated into a specific location within a test substrate so it would be released when the compound is metabolized by the liver. Hepatic metabolism of the compound is assessed by measuring the ratio of 13CO2/12CO2 in exhaled breath.</description>
