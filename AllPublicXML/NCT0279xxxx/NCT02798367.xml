  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National clinical trials, phase III/II, combined in two stages, randomized, double-blind,
      controlled, parallel, study of superiority, in which two hundred fifty-six (256) participants
      of both sexes, aged equal or more than 55 years will be randomly allocated to one of three
      treatment groups. In the first stage. The group 01 will use Melatonin 3mg plus CBT-I, the
      group 02 will use Melatonin 5mg plus CBT-I and the group 03 will use CBT-I plus placebo.

      Based on the results of an interim analysis will be making a decision on whether to proceed
      with the study and, if so, on which the doses will be selected for the second stage of the
      study, to be better studied. The final analysis of the treatments, melatonin in the selected
      dose plus CBT-I versus CBT-I alone and placebo, will include participants from both stages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of insomnia disorder can be accomplished through pharmacological and
      nonpharmacological approaches. Behavioral techniques of Sleep Hygiene and Stimuli control are
      the most used. The Sleep hygiene is a psychoeducational intervention that teaches patients to
      prevent external or environmental factors generate adverse effects and harmful to sleep. The
      stimulus control technique is based on five instructions that encourages the patient to
      establish a proper sleep-wake rhythm and strengthens the links between the way for a quick
      sleep and well established. Melatonin is a hormone that participates in the regulation of the
      sleep-wake cycle, which is produced and secreted primarily by the pineal gland in the dark
      period and prepares the individual to sleep. Melatonin is involved in the induction of sleep
      and has proven therapeutic action in insomnia disorders, and may also play a role in the
      circadian timing system of mammals and serve as a marker for &quot;biological clock&quot;.
