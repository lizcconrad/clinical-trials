  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabotegravir is being developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1
      infection. Specifically, it is being developed as a component of a 2-drug maintenance regimen
      (post-induction of viral suppression) that includes rilpivirine. Rilpivirine requires food
      for optimal absorption; therefore the recommended intake of cabotegravir in the planned Phase
      3 treatment studies is with food regardless of fat or calorie content, when administered
      along with rilpivirine. This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover
      study in healthy adult subjects to assess the effect of a high fat meal on the single dose
      pharmacokinetics of CAB 30 mg. Approximately, 24 subjects will be enrolled in the study and
      will be screened for 30 days. Twelve subjects with at least 10 hours of fasting will be
      randomized to receive a single dose of cabotegravir orally (Schedule 'A'). The remaining 12
      subjects will receive a single dose of cabotegravir orally along with high fat meal (Schedule
      'B'). After 15 days, the subjects earlier undergoing 'Schedule A' will be switched to
      'Schedule B' and those undergoing 'Schedule B' will undergo 'Schedule A'. All the subjects
      will be followed up to 30 days from the day of receiving first dose of cabotegravir to
      evaluate the effect of a high fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of cabotegravir.
