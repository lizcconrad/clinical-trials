  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational, non-interventional, retrospective, multicenter, national study focuses on
      collecting information about the effectiveness and safety of bortezomib re-use at first
      relapse in MM patients already treated in their first line with a bortezomib-based regimen,
      re-challenged with the same drug according to current clinical practice and/or Italian
      SIE/SIES/GITMO, IMWG and/or NCCN Guidelines/Treatment Recommendations.

      Data will be collected retrospectively from approximately 25 haematologic/oncologic sites in
      Italy. Approximately, data of up to 100 patients will be collected.
