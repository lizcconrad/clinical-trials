        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and females 18 - 74 years of age inclusive

          -  Fungal toenail infection of one or both of the large (great) toenails

          -  The nail infection must be due to a dermatophyte, (mixed infections [dermatophyte and
             non-dermatophyte] are not allowed)

          -  Willingness not to have professional pedicures or application of any nail polish
             product or nail cosmetics to the toenails after the screening visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any significant chronic fungal disease other than onychomycosis or
             immunocompromised condition

          -  Any abnormalities of the nail or previous surgery of the toenail that could prevent a
             normal appearing nail if clearing of infection is achieved

          -  Significant confounding conditions as assessed by the study doctor

          -  Participation in any other trial of an investigational drug or device within 30 days
             or participation in a research study concurrent with this study

          -  No administration of systemic antifungal medications within 6 months prior to
             screening visit

          -  No application of prescription topical antifungal medications for toenail fungus
             within 3 months or other commercially available topical medications for toenail fungus
             applied directly to the toenails within 1 month prior to screening visit

          -  Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) that would require systemic treatment

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
