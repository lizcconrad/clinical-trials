      The primary objectives of this study are to identify what outcomes related to the management
      of neutropenia are most important to children with AML and their caregivers. Patients who
      have completed treatment for AML and their caregivers will be interviewed in order to better
      understand the impact of neutropenia management on children with AML and their families. The
      primary outcome of these interviews is to identify patient-centered outcomes related to
      neutropenia management to include in a subsequent comparative-effectiveness analysis.
      Investigators will use these data to develop a structured survey for administration to
      prospectively identified patients in subsequent studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involves intensive chemotherapy regimens
      that result in periods of profound neutropenia leaving patients susceptible to severe
      infectious complications. There are little clinical data to inform whether management of
      neutropenia post AML chemotherapy should occur in an outpatient or inpatient setting.
      Further, no studies have been conducted that assess the impact of neutropenia management
      strategy on the quality of life of pediatric patients with AML. Given that infectious
      complications are the leading cause of treatment related mortality among AML patients, it is
      important to identify the neutropenia management strategy that will lead to the best
      clinician- and patient- identified outcomes in order to improve the care of these patients.

      This is a qualitative interview study where in person interviews of patients and/or
      caregivers will be performed. Participants will be patients 18 years of age or younger at
      diagnosis (and their caregivers) receiving or having received Induction II chemotherapy for
      AML from eight participating pediatric hospitals across the United States. Participants
      (children and caregivers) will be interviewed in an effort to develop a survey that captures
      patient- and caregiver- identified outcomes related to neutropenia management.

    <description>One qualitative, semi-structured in-person interview will be conducted. Each interview will last approximately 30-45 minutes and may be audio recorded (if consent is provided). Interviews will consist of several open-ended questions focusing on having the participant reflect upon past experiences with neutropenia management and the impact of the participant's illness and treatment. Several close-ended questions regarding participant's thoughts on potential outcomes will also be included.</description>
