  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in North American men older than
      50 years. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a unique membrane bound glycoprotein,
      which is overexpressed manifold on prostate cancer cells and is well-characterized as an
      imaging biomarker of prostate cancer. Positron emission tomography / computer tomography
      (PET/CT) is a nuclear medicine procedure based on the measurement of positron emission from
      radiolabeled tracer molecules. 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA (DKFZ-11) (abbreviated 68Ga-PSMA) is a
      tracer for prostate cancer PET imaging. The strength of functional imaging methods is in
      distinguishing tissues according to metabolism rather than structure. Studies have shown that
      PET/CT imaging with 68Ga-PSMA can detect prostate cancer lesions with excellent contrast and
      a high detection rate even when the level of prostate specific antigen is low.

      Study Objectives:

      The objective of this study is to evaluate if the patient-wide SUVmax on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in
      locoregional and metastatic prostate cancer correlates with histopathologic Gleason score at
      initial biopsy. It is hypothesized that SUVmax will correlate positively with Gleason score.
      This is of interest because non-invasive risk stratification may be possible in the future.

      This will be a single-site JGH-only open label study in which one (1) 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT will
      be performed on study participants. A PET/CT scan takes 2-3 hours.
