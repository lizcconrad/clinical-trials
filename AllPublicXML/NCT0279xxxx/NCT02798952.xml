  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term persistence of immunity to hepatitis B
      in adolescents aged 14-15 years who were vaccinated with four doses of Infanrix™-Hexa in the
      first two years of life and to assess the anamnestic response, immunogenicity, safety and
      reactogenicity of a single challenge dose of the hepatitis B vaccine Engerix™-B Kinder.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who, in the opinion
             of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject prior to
             performance of any study specific procedure.

          -  In addition to the informed consent that will be signed by the parents/LAR(s), written
             informed assent of the subject will be sought.

          -  A male or female between the ages of 14 to 15 at the time of vaccination.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Subjects with documented evidence of previous vaccination with four consecutive doses
             of Infanrix hexa as part of routine vaccination in Germany: three doses of primary
             vaccination received by 9 months of age and one booster dose received between 11 and
             18 months of age.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
                  hysterectomy or ovariectomy.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

          -  Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make
             intramuscular injection unsafe.

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during
             the period starting six months prior to the vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this
             will mean prednisone ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are
             allowed.

          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs at any time during the study

             HBV vaccine administration with the exception of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria
             toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine, which can be given as part of routine
             vaccination practice. Seasonal or pandemic influenza vaccine can be given at any time
             during the study, and according to the Summary of Product Characteristics and national

             tests.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting
