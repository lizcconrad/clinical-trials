      The body surface area(BSA) on the date of every treatment cycle may be used as the same value
      of baseline BSA, if change of body weight is within 10% of baseline body weight. But, if
      there is a change of body weight more than 10% that of baseline, BSA should be recalculated.
      It will be repeated every 21 days. But the change of starting date of subsequent cycle and
      laboratory or radiologic tests may be allowed within 4 days from the scheduled date or delay
      due to toxicities. The RD-RCHOP treatment will be continued up to 6-8 cycles (or 3 cycles in
      case of stable disease(SD) or progressive disease(PD) after the first 3cycles) with duration
      of 21 days. Visit windows ± 4days in Treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed CD20 positive DLBCL

          2. Age ≥ 65 years

          3. Ann Arbor stage II, III and IV

          4. No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for DLBCL

          5. Performance status (ECOG) ≤ 2

          6. At least one or more bidimensionally measurable lesion(s)

               -  2 cm by conventional CT

               -  1 cm by spiral CT skin lesion (photographs should be taken) ≥ 2 cm measurable
                  lesion by physical examination ≥ 2 cm

          7. Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 50 % as measured by MUGA or 2DECHO without clinically
             significant abnormalities

          8. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine level &lt; 2 mg/dL (177 μmol/L)

          9. Adequate liver functions:

             Transaminase (AST/ALT) &lt; 3 X upper normal value (or &lt; 5 x ULN in the presence of DLBCL
             involvement of the liver) Bilirubin &lt; 2 X upper normal value (or &lt; 5 x ULN in the
             presence of DLBCL involvement of the liver)

         10. Adequate BM functions: hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/μL
             and platelet count ≥ 75,000/μL, unless abnormalities are due to bone marrow
             involvement by lymphoma

         11. Life expectancy more than 6 months

         12. A negative serum or urine pregnancy test prior to treatment must be available both for

             skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of cervix uteri
