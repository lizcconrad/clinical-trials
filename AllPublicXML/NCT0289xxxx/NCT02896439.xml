  <brief_summary>

      Pelvic fractures in which integrate the acetabulum fractures represent a risk of traumatic
      injury to the sciatic nerve trunk by stretching or section (1): Judet and Letournel reported
      a complication rate of around 6% (1). Fractures of the acetabulum strictly speaking are also
      providers of neurological complications with rates, significant, have recently been precisely
      detailed by a cohort study published by Lehmann et al. (2): In a series of 2073 patients, the
      authors reported an overall complication rate of neurological related to the initial trauma
      of the order of 4%. In this series, 1395 patients were operated with a rate of iatrogenic
      neurological complications of 2 to 3%. Regarding the first routes (and therefore the types of
      fractures), the Kocher-Langenbeck path is the path that leads to the greatest number of
      neurological complications: 3 to 4% in this series (2). However, this cohort study does not
      specify what truncal achievement it is. Obviously violations posterior acetabular are
      preferentially providers of sciatic injury while violations prior acetabular are more
      providers of obturator or femoral lesions. But this is not always the case. Moreover, this
      study does not specify the type or severity of neurological involvement.

      Methodology Design: This is an interventional study in routine care, prospective,
      single-center.

      Main objective / secondary:

      Primary objective :

      To evaluate the sensitivity of the neurophysiological monitoring combining two specific new
      procedures to detect intraoperative complications on the sciatic trunk (by measuring
      potential with somatosensory storied collection of P15 and electromyographic recording with
      the potential of sciatic nerve in the popliteal fossa).

      secondary objectives

      Frequency of neurophysiological changes on the interventions of the acetabulum.

      An anomaly being retained as:

        -  Interval prolongation N8-P15&gt; 10%

        -  And / or decrease in the amplitude ratio P15 / N22&gt; 50%

        -  And / or elongation of the latency of nerve potential&gt; 10% of the value-operative Opré

        -  And / or reducing the amplitude of the nerve potential&gt; 50% Correlation between the
           impact of changes neurophysiological intraoperative and

        -  The occurrence of postoperative neurological deficit:

             -  motor deficit

             -  and / or sensory deficit

             -  territory of the sciatic trunk

      Correlation between the incidence of intraoperative neurophysiological modifications and:

        -  The type of surgery

        -  The type of fracture
