  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to facilitate the dissemination and implementation of patient
      centered outcomes research using mHealth technology to improve self-management of adverse
      symptoms in persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). Symptom management in PLWH is especially
      important because the US HIV epidemic continues to exact a huge toll, especially among Agency
      for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) priority populations including racial, ethnic, and
      sexual minorities and low-income persons. The incorporation of HIV symptom management
      strategies into patients' lives through the use of mHealth technologies has the potential to
      advance the effective dissemination and implementation of patient centered outcomes research
      findings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV has changed from an acute illness to a chronic disease. The success of HIV medications
      and treatments has significantly altered the course of the disease. While AIDS-related
      illnesses are no longer the primary threat, a new set of HIV-associated complications have
      emerged, resulting in a chronic disease that for many will span several decades of life. The
      ability to self-manage adverse symptoms of HIV illness has been shown to improve
      patient-centered outcomes. In response to this need, a team at University of California, San
      Francisco (UCSF) developed a paper-based symptom management manual with self-management
      strategies for 21 common HIV/AIDS adverse symptoms (PCOR evidence). The efficacy of the
      manual was demonstrated in a 775-person randomized controlled trial (RCT) over three months
      at 12 sites. However, subsequent use of these strategies has been very limited; mHealth
      offers an ideal platform for the implementation and dissemination of evidence-based
      strategies for HIV symptom management. Due to the high incidence of HIV among racial and
      ethnic minority populations, it is appropriate to develop mHealth tools tailored to the needs
      of these populations. mHealth technology has the potential to address many of the healthcare
      needs of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) including symptom management. In response to
      these current issues, this study seeks to inform the development and testing of a mHealth
      application that will incorporate findings from PCOR studies to improve the outcomes of PLWH.
      To improve outcomes for those most in need, study activities are focused on communities with
      the greatest burden of HIV in the US, including racial and ethnic minorities and those of low
      socioeconomic status.

    <description>The PROMIS-29 includes seven health related quality of life domains (Physical Functioning, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Social Functioning, and Pain), and the pain domain has two subdomains (interference and intensity). Each of the 7 domains has four 5-level items (i.e., 16 decrements each). In addition to these items, pain intensity is assessed using a single 11-point numeric rating scale anchored between no pain (0) and worse imaginable pain. Raw scores are transformed using the T-score metric based on the item response theory calibrations in which scores have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 for the general population in the US. T-scores can be estimated using the scoring tables listed in the PROMIS manuals. A higher PROMIS T-score implies more of the concept being measured; for instance, a higher PROMIS score on physical function indicates better functioning, whereas a higher score on depression indicates more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>12-Item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-12) is a health survey to measure health-related quality of life. SF-12 measures eight concepts: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality (energy/fatigue), social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems and mental health (psychological distress and psychological wellbeing). Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores (PCS &amp; MCS) are computed using the scores of 12 questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scale and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>

    <measure>Change in Engagement with Health Care Provider Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement with Health Care Provide scale is a 13-item scale in which subjects rate their interactions with their health care providers on a four-point scale with 1=always true and 4=never true. A low score indicates greater provider engagement.</description>

    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measures adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). VAS asks subjects to indicate a point on a line that shows their best guess about how much of each drug they have taken. 0% means they have taken no drug, 50% means they have taken half their drugs, and 100% means they have taken every single dose.</description>

    <description>Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale (Health-ITUES) will be used to measure usability. Health-ITUES consists of 36 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree: actual usage, intention to use, satisfaction, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived performance speed, learnability, competency, flexibility/customizability, memorability, error prevention, information needs, and other outcomes. Higher scale value indicates higher perceived usability of the technology.</description>
