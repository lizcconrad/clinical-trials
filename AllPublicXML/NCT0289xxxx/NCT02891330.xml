  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postprandial dumping syndrome is a frequent consequence of Roux-en-Y Gastric ByPass due
      to the rapid emptying of the stomach remnant in to the intestinal lumen. Dumping-related
      symptoms occur very early after eating (within 30 minutes), are not associated with
      concurrent hypoglycemia, and are most prominent in the early postoperative period. This
      syndrome very debilitating for the patient can be improved by dietary and nutritional
      recommendations. We hypothesize that a personalized approach based on dietary and nutritional
      recommendations conducted by a nurse would likely to decrease the frequency of dumping
      syndrome and improve the postoperative quality of life of patients in the early postoperative
      period.

      The Roux-en-Y Gastric ByPass is considered the gold standard of weight loss surgery and is
      the most commonly performed bariatric procedure worlwide.The postprandial dumping syndrome is
      a frequent consequence of gastrojejunal anastomosis due to the rapid emptying of the stomach
      remnant in to the intestinal lumen. Dumping-related symptoms occur very early after eating
      (within 30 minutes), are not associated with concurrent hypoglycemia, and are most prominent
      in the early postoperative period. The symptoms of dumping syndrome include nausea, abdominal
      cramps, diarrhea, dizzy spells, weakness and cold sweats either with or after eating.This
      syndrome very debilitating for the patient can be improved by dietary and nutritional
      recommendations. We hypothesize that an individualized approach based on dietary and
      nutritional recommendations and monitoring of patients conducted by a nurse in the first
      three months after surgery would likely to decrease these problems and improve the
      postoperative quality of life of patients.
