        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects

             -- Male and white subjects between 45 and 79 years of age with a body mass index
             between 18 to 34 kg/m*2 (both inclusive).

          -  Patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Part 1)

             -- Patients with documented liver cirrhosis confirmed by histopathology, e.g.,
             previous liver biopsy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, or fibroscan and with moderate hepatic
             impairment (defined as Child Pugh class B).

          -  Patients with severe renal impairment (Part 1)

             -- Patients with severe renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate
             15-29 mL/min/1.73 m*2, who are not on dialysis and are not expected to start dialysis
             in the next 3 months (Stage 4).

          -  Healthy subjects

             -- Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on

             rate 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m*2 (Stage 3).

          -  Patients with mild renal impairment (Part 2)

             -- Patients with mild renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate
             (eGFR) 60-79 mL/min/1.73 m*2 (Stage 2).

          -  Patients with mild hepatic impairment (Part 2)

             months prior to dosing, congestive heart failure of New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             grade III or IV.

          -  Subjects with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass
             graft less than 6 months prior to study drug administration.

          -  Strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors or strong CYP3A4 inducers within 28 days
             or 5 drug half-lives (if drug half-life in patients is known), before start of study
             treatment.

          -  Known BCRP (breast cancer resistant protein) and OATP (organic anion-transporting
             polypeptide) substrates not specifically mentioned in the protocol within 28 days or 5
             drug half-lives (if drug half-life in patients is known), before start of study
             treatment.

          -  Smoking more than 20 cigarettes daily.
