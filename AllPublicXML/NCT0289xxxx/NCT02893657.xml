  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is the evaluation of the occurrence and effect of hepatic
      dysfunction on outcome following cardiac surgery, as well as the monitoring of changes in
      liver haemodynamics in the early postoperative period.

      Prospective, consecutive study of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in Heart and Vascular
      Center, Semmelweis University, Budapest.

      Registered data:

        -  Anamnestic and demographic data

        -  Liver dysfunction prior surgery, etiology of liver dysfunction

        -  Perioperative clinical data: laboratory tests, imaging, haemodynamic measures

        -  risk prediction score of the American Society of Anesthesiologists(ASA), EUROpean System
           for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroScore), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
           Evaluation II (APACHE II), Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II), Canadian
           Cardiovascular Society grading of angina pectoris (CCS)

        -  Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), MELD excluding International Normalised Ratio
           (INR) (MELD-XI), modified MELD score (modMELD), Child-Pugh

      The occurrence and etiology pattern of hepatic impairment are going to be evaluated according
      to age and type of cardiac illness. Correlations between perioperative haemodynamical
      alterations and structural, functional changes in hepatic status will be investigated.

      The impact of hepatic impairment on surgical outcome is going to be examined by multivariate
      regression models.
