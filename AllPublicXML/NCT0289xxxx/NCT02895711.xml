    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the radiation exposure from diagnostic testing and
      surgical treatment during routine endourologic procedures for symptomatic urolithiasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine endourologic procedures will be performed at the Childrens Hospital of Pittsburgh by
      one of the investigators listed on this study. Fluoroscopic radiation exposure during these
      procedures is used to guide the surgical devices that are used to treat the stones. The
      investigators will be measuring the radiation effective skin dose by two methods. First, the
      investigators will place two &quot;Microdot&quot; thermal leak detectors (TLD) on the patient. These
      devices which are the size and thickness of a dime will be within plastic bags taped to the
      patients body within the central focus of the fluoroscopy image. At the completion of the
      procedure the TLD's will be transferred to the Radiation Safety Office in Oakland to be read
      and the dose recorded.

      Second, a flat chamber that is integral with all fluoroscopy machines used at Children's
      Hospital will measure the dose-area product (DAP) for each case which will allow us to
      calculate the effective dose. This device is a component of the colimeter on the arm of the
      x-ray machine used for fluoroscopy. It measures the radiation that is returned to the x-ray
      machine and calculates the dose delivered to the patient by comparing the amount delivered to
      the patient to the amount returned to the machine. Its use is automatic when any x-rays are
      delivered and does not involve any manipulation of the patient or alteration of normal
      procedure.

      No additional procedures or change in duration is necessary for this study

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible subjects will be male and female volunteers of 0-18 years of age with
             documented urolithiasis who is undergoing a urologic procedure that utilizes
             fluoroscopy radiation.

          -  The racial, gender and ethnic characteristics of the proposed subject population
             reflect the demographics of Pittsburgh and the surrounding area and/or the population
             of the University of Pittsburgh.

          -  We shall attempt to recruit subjects in respective proportion to these demographics.
