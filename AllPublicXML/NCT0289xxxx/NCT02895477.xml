    <textblock>
      Goal of this study is to determine the benefit of an improved feature on a new hearing aid
      platform.

      To investigate the improvements of this feature is compared on a new and older hearing aid
      platform. The obtained results will be used for future improvement for this feature. This
      feature should improve the speech understanding and speech recognition of the hearing aid
      user.
