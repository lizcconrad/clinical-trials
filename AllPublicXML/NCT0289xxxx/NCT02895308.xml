      The aims of this study are to experimentally investigate and compare whether motivation
      variables can predict adherence to a prescribed assignment in face-to-face and online
      interventions using a psychotherapy analogue model.

      A total of 100 participants are included in this study and randomized to either a
      face-to-face or online intervention. Participants in both groups receive a psychoeducation
      session and are given an assignment for the subsequent week.

      The aims of this study are to investigate (1) participants' different forms of motivations to
      complete a typical psychotherapy assignment, (2) participants' subsequent adherence to the
      prescribed assignment and the associations between motivations and adherence and (3) any
      differences regarding motivations, adherence and their associations between the face-to-face
      and online conditions.

      The hypotheses are that participants in the face-to-face condition will report higher
      motivation as well as higher adherence to the assignments compared to participants in the
      online condition, that adherence to the assignment will be positively associated with both
      autonomous motivation and externally regulated motivation and that adherence to the
      assignment will be more weakly associated with autonomous motivation in the face-to-face
      compared to the online condition.

      To investigate the association between motivation and adherence to assignments in
      face-to-face and online settings, this study have a longitudinal randomized design with two
      conditions. The two conditions are face-to-face psychoeducation with a therapist and online
      psychoeducation with therapist support. A psychotherapy analogue model with a one-session
      intervention for a non-clinical population is used. Data is collected at baseline and at
      seven to nine days follow-up.

    <description>The online intervention consists of a psychoeducation component taken from affect focused psychotherapy. In this model, emotions are physiological patterns that are shaped mainly in the context of previous relations. By using the model, patients are helped to better understand their current emotions, behaviors and cognitions. The aim of the intervention used in this study is to provide information about the six basic affects and how they may influence everyday behaviors and well-being in recurring patterns.</description>
