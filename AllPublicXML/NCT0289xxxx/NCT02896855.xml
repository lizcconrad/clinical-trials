    <textblock>
      This Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial in
      China will evaluate the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab + trastuzumab + docetaxel compared
      with placebo + trastuzumab + docetaxel in participants with previously untreated
