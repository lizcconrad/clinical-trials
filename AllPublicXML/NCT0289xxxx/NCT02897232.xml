  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a minimal risk, anonymous, convenience sample, social behavioral study using
      qualitative descriptive survey methods. It is to ascertain community member, physician,
      resident and medical student perspectives regarding Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection,
      associated diseases and to identify barriers which prevent these groups from ensuring that
      males 9-26 receive the three-shot vaccine series to prevent HPV infection.

      The research is focused on these questions:

      Do community members understand the ease of transmission of the HPV virus in males 9-26? Do
      community members, physicians, residents and medical students have knowledge of the
      associated diseases that may occur with the HPV virus infection in males age 9-26? Do
      community members, physicians, residents and medical students know the ages in which males
      should receive the HPV vaccine three-shot series? What barriers prevent community members and
      physicians, residents and medical students from ensuring that males 9-26 receive the
      three-shot vaccine series to prevent HPV infection?
