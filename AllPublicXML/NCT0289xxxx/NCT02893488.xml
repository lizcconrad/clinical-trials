  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, crossover study in healthy adult subjects with 5 treatment
      groups over 5 dosing periods. This study will evaluate pharmacokinetic parameters and
      relative bioavailability of a dispersible, fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet of TRIUMEQ™
      ([abacavir, ABC]/[dolutegravir, DTG]/[lamivudine, 3TC]) when dispersed and consumed under
      four different dosing conditions in comparison to an oral dose of TIVICAY™ (DTG) + EPZICOM™
      (ABC/3TC) non-dispersible tablets administered in the fasted state. Approximately 20 subjects
      will be randomized, each to one of 5 treatment groups. The total duration of participation of
      a subject in this study will be approximately 10-11 weeks. It will include a screening visit
      within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug, five treatment periods each with a
      single dose of study drug per treatment period and a follow up visit within 7 10 days after
      the last dose. There will also be a washout of at least 7 days between doses in each
      treatment period. TRIUMEQ, EPZICOM, and TIVICAY are trademarks of the GlaxoSmithKline group
      of companies.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male or female aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing

          -  Healthy as determined by the investigator or medically qualified designee based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests
             and cardiac evaluation (history and ECG). A subject with a clinical abnormality or
             laboratory parameter(s) which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or
             exclusion criteria, outside the reference range for the population being studied may
             be included only if the investigator agree and document that the finding is unlikely
             to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kilogram (kg) for males and &gt;=45 kg for females and body mass index
             (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/m^2 (inclusive).

          -  Male or female

          -  Females of non-reproductive potential defined as pre-menopausal females with
             documented tubal ligation, documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with
             follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, documented
             bilateral oophorectomy, postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
             (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone
             [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with menopause). Females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
             the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during
             the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.

          -  Female of reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the
             Modified List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of
             Reproductive Potential (FRP) from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication
             and until 2 weeks after dosing with study medication and completion of the follow-up
             visit. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to
             properly use these methods of contraception.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol.

          -  Documentation that the subject is negative for the human leukocyte antigen
             (HLA)-B*5701 allele.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  ALT and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt;450
             milliseconds (msec). The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility
             and discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to initiation
             of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate
             the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or
             discontinue the subject from the trial.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription (i.e., dofetilide) or non-prescription
             drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort)
             within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives
             (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the
             opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere
             with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is
             equivalent to 12 gram of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of
             wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products within 1 month prior to screening.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or Medical
             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Creatinine clearance (CrCL) &lt;60 mL/min

          -  Presence of HBsAg, positive hepatitis C antibody test result at screening or within 3
             months prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood product in
             excess of 500 mL within 56 days.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.
