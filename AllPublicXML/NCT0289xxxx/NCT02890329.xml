    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ipilimumab when given together
      with decitabine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia
      that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting
      certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. Giving ipilimumab and decitabine may work better in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      combination decitabine and ipilimumab for relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) or relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients who are post
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HCT).

      II. To determine the MTD or RP2D of combination decitabine and ipilimumab for relapsed or
      refractory MDS or relapsed or refractory AML in patients who are transplant naive.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate
      (ORR) including complete remission (CR) and complete remission with incomplete count recovery
      (CRi) for AML following 2003 International Working Group (IWG) response criteria.

      III. To determine the ORR including CR, partial remission, marrow CR, hematologic improvement
      for MDS using 2006 IWG criteria.

      IV. To determine the overall survival and progression free survival at 1 year. V. To
      determine the duration of remission. VI. To determine the incidence and severity of acute
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the post allo-HCT cohort.

      VII. To determine the incidence and severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in
      the post allo-HCT cohort.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) prior to treatment and during treatment.

      II. To evaluate the genome for evidence of clonal evolution among longitudinal samples (prior
      to treatment, during treatment, and at relapse if relevant) from individual patients.

      III. To evaluate the histopathologic findings of immune response using immunohistochemistry.

      IV. To determine the immune response in the AML tumor microenvironment by using flow
      cytometry and single cell mass cytometry to evaluate T cell subsets.
