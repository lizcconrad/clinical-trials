  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of reliable and objective evaluation methods is required for natural
      upper-extremity tasks. Three-dimensional imaging measurement techniques are a powerful tool
      for quantitative assessment of multijoint movements.

    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mayo Wrist Score: On a scale from 0-100 points, 91-100 points is a excellent result, 81-90 a good results, 65-80 a satisfactory result and less than 65 points a poor result Krimmer Wrist Score: On a scale from 0-100 points, more than 80 is a excellent result, 65-80 a good result, 50-65 a satisfactory result and 0-50 a poor result.
QuickDASH: At least 10 of the 11 items must be completed for a score to be calculated. The assigned values for all completed responses are simply summed and averaged, producing a score out of five. This value is then transformed to a score out of 100 by subtracting one and multiplying by 25. This transformation is done to make the score easier to compare to other measures scaled on a 0-100 scale. A higher score indicates greater disability.</description>

        The study population consists of healty persons, patients with tendon pathologies,
        arthrosis and dupuytren disease. In the future the new findings should assist the decision
        of surgical procedures.
