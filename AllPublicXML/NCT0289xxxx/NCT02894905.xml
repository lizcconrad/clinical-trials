  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral dose of
      AL-335 in participants with various degrees of impaired renal function (mild, moderate, and
      severe) compared to participants with normal renal function.
