      The purpose of the study is to find out if hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) and
      coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure outcomes are similar. HCR is a combination
      of surgery and catheter procedures to open up clogged heart arteries. CABG is a surgical
      procedure to open up clogged heart arteries.

      Currently, it is not clear how the outcomes of hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR)
      compare with other treatments. The purpose of the study is to find out if HCR and coronary
      artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedure outcomes are similar. HCR is a combination of surgery
      and catheter procedures to open up clogged heart arteries. CABG is a surgical procedure to
      open up clogged heart arteries.

      This study will collect information about the medical care participants receive during their
      planned procedure. No new testing or procedures will be done. Participants will have only the
      tests or procedures already planned by their doctor. The investigators will look at how well
      participants do after the procedure by assessing the outcomes of interest 30 days after
      surgery and, potentially, one year after surgery (funding dependent).

For the purpose of this trial, the components of MACCE include (1) all-cause mortality, (2) repeat revascularization, (3) stroke, and (4) myocardial infarction.</description>

    <measure>Comparison of stroke between groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence and severity of strokes experienced between the groups will be assessed at 30 days and at one year after the index procedure, using the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The NIHSS is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. A trained observer rates the patent's ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items. The single patient assessment requires less than 10 minutes to complete.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to one year</time_frame>
    <description>Angina will be assessed at Baseline (prior to surgery), 30 days after the procedure, and at one year after the index procedure.
The Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Grading Scale will be used to categorize angina:
Class I - Ordinary physical activity does not cause angina, such as walking and climbing stairs. Angina with strenuous or rapid or prolonged exertion at work or recreation
Class II - Slight limitation of ordinary activity. Walking or climbing stairs rapidly, walking uphill, walking or stair climbing after meals, or in cold, or in wind, or under emotional stress or only during the few hours after awakening
Class III - Marked limitation of ordinary physical activity. Walking one or two blocks on the level and climbing one flight of stairs in normal conditions and at normal pace
Class IV - Inability to carry on a physical activity without discomfort - angina syndrome may be present at rest</description>

    <description>The Duke Activity Scale Index (DASI) will be administered at Baseline (prior to surgery), 30 days after the procedure, and at one year after the index procedure. The DASI is a 12 item survey that asks about a patient's functional capacity in order to estimate peak oxygen uptake. Respondents answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to questions about their ability to do activities of different intensity levels.</description>

    <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D will be administered at Baseline (prior to surgery), 30 days after the procedure, and at one year after the index procedure. The EuroQol EQ-5D is a 6 item survey that asks about how a patient is feeling on the day of the survey in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression, and how they rate their health on a scale of 0 to 100 (where 0 is the worst health imaginable and 100 is the best health imaginable).</description>

    <description>Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) is a combination of surgery and catheter procedures to open up clogged heart arteries. HCR is the intentional combination of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The HCR strategy combines grafting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) coronary artery using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) with PCI of non-LAD coronary stenoses. Drug-eluting stents are substituted for saphenous vein grafts (SVG) for non-LAD coronary targets, and the surgical LIMA to LAD bypass is performed, ideally through a minimally invasive, limited access, sternal-sparing approach.</description>

    <description>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a surgery to create a new path for blood flow to the heart. A healthy section of vein or artery from elsewhere in the patient's body will be attached to the coronary artery just above and below the area of concern, to create a way for blood to bypass the blocked part of the coronary artery.</description>
