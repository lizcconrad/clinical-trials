  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Care in ambulatory surgery (CA) is growing in France, despite lagging behind other countries
      in North or US Europe. Arthroscopic knee surgery is a minimally invasive surgery eligible for
      CA. Currently 71.8% of knee arthroscopy are made in this context. However ligamentoplasties
      anterior cruciate are still carried out predominantly in conventional hospitalization (HC)
      with a median of 3 to 5.5 days of stay.

      Two recent prospective studies French single-operator shows the feasibility of reconstruction
      of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in ambulatory: no serious events were recorded, the
      risks are comparable to those of a HC.

      However, this support requires a structure and a coordinated network between different
      medical and paramedical (surgeons, anesthetists, nurse frame, City nurse, doctor,
      physiotherapist).

      The objective of the study is to evaluate (i.e. EPP or &quot;feasibility&quot;) ACL reconstruction in
      CA in hospitals, multi-operator.

      II. objectives

      at. primary objective

      Rating (or &quot;feasibility&quot;) of a management protocol HDJ of ACL reconstruction in a hospital
      structure on a multi-operator series.

      Evaluation criteria (absence of EG)?

      b. secondary objectives

      i. Evaluation of the acceptance rates of ambulatory care patients eligible

      ii. Evaluation of the rate and type of complication in our series

      iii. Evaluation of early postoperative results (postoperative pain, analgesic consumption,
      sleep, satisfaction)

      IV. Methodology and duration of the research

      This is a consecutive series single-center multi-operator prospective regarding the
      evaluation of surgical practice cited in goal.

      The inclusion of patients will take place over a period of 4 months.

      The management of ACL reconstruction in outpatient will be proposed in consultation with the
      surgeon.

      After an explanation of the course of treatment a fact sheet on the protocol will be provided
      to the patient and his doctor to the patient to decide its support AC or HC.

      Clinical data will be collected by telephone the first 4 days and in consultation with J45.
      The revision sheet is provided.

      Patients are aware of the use of their data for medical research through oral information
      provided by the doctor at the signing by the patient's consent related to the surgery.

      The data collected as part of the research are anonymous and unidentifiable (for each subject
      is assigned a number); the name of the surgeon is also anonymized.
