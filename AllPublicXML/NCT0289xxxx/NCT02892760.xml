    <description>During the 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT), infrared light emitting diode markers will be attached to bilateral lower extremities. The marker data will be recorded using the NDI Optotrak Certus motion capture system.

    <measure>Change in metabolic expenditure during walking</measure>
    <time_frame>week 5, week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Change in metabolic expenditure during walking will be indicated by energy expenditure. Energy Expenditure will be measured by the K4 b2 Cosmed as follows: Oxygen cost will be calculated from oxygen consumption as the product of gait speed and body weight. Oxygen consumption will be collected on a breath-by-breath basis measured by a portable metabolic system (K4 b2 Cosmed). Prior to the testing, the system will be calibrated using room air and reference gas mixture. During the testing, the subject will wear a face mask and a heart rate monitor at all times and will be asked to breathe normally.</description>

It uses an ordinal scale for scoring of 17 items for the lower limb component and 7 items on the Balance component of the F-M scale (0: cannot perform; 1: can perform partially; 2: can perform fully).</description>
