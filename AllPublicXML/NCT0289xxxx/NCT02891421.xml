  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project partnered with U.S. military veterans with a premier accredited therapeutic
      riding center for six weeks. The veterans interacted with horses by grooming and learning
      about them, as well as riding them for one hour per week during which they gained a variety
      of skills. We hoped the veterans would experience a reduction in Post Traumatic Stress
      Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, depression, and loneliness, while improving their social and
      emotional health and self-efficacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Large numbers of post-deployed U.S. veterans diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD) and/or Traumatic Brain Injury make effective interventions urgent, to reduce symptoms
      and increase veterans' coping. PTSD includes anxiety, flashbacks, and emotional numbing.
      Symptoms expand health care costs for stress-related illnesses making veterans' civilian life
      difficult.

      The proposed study used a randomized experimental design with repeated measures and waitlist
      control group testing the efficacy of a 6-week human-horse interaction and systematic
      therapeutic horseback riding program in: decreasing PTSD symptoms, increasing coping self
      efficacy, emotion regulation, and social engagement. The Riding Group spent one hour weekly
      interacting with and riding the same horse at one of two PATH-accredited riding centers in
      Mid-Missouri supervised by an Occupational Therapist, Profession Association of Therapeutic
      Horsemanship (PATH) International-certified instructor, leader and side walkers as needed.
      Riding was directed by a systematic lesson plan. Data collection occured at baseline, 3
      weeks, and 6 weeks. The Control Group was assessed at the same intervals and again 3 weeks
      and 6 weeks after joining the Riding Group.

    <description>Veterans were matched to a horse for best fit and the same horse was ridden each week. The warm-up exercises involved various repeated physical movements while the horse was walking or standing steady, such as head rotations, lifting arms, rotating ankles, flexing toes. The exercises began with riding at a walk during the early weeks, learning reining skills and riding positions, and progressed to light trotting. Veteran participants were able to build on skill sets related to grooming, tacking, mounting, and riding that were introduced in prior weeks. Skill progression was based on individual abilities and safety as determined by certified riding instructor and occupational therapist.</description>
