      The main purpose for holding this survey is epidemiological surveillance, it must provide the
      indicators that contribute to the evaluation of the plan &quot;improvement of the quality of life
      in chronic diseases&quot; and monitoring the goal of 81 health law public in August 2004. This
      survey is intended to be renewed during the implementation period of the public health law to
      provide plan monitoring indicators.

      The main objective is : To describe the quality of life of patients with major end-stage
      renal disease treated with dialysis method for at least one year.

      The seconds objectives are :

        -  To contribute to the knowledge of the key determinants of the quality of life among
           chronic renal failure patients.

        -  To study the influence on way of giving a questionnaire about assessment of level of
           quality of life

      The proposed scheme is that of a repeated cross-sectional survey, with prevalent patients
      dialysis for at least 1 year, by self-administered questionnaires using standardized
      instruments and passed among a representative sample of subjects included in the nine
      participating regions kidney system. The first study in 2005, it is required to be repeated
      during the plan period (theoretically in 2007, 2009 and 2011).

      Three studies will be carried out between 2005 and 2010. The progress of each study is the
      same.

      The random draw of eligible patients, according to a stratification by region and age group
      is carried out by the Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Service of the Necker Hospital in
      Paris, responsible for basic SIMS-REIN, for data center in the regions Champagne-Ardenne,
      Languedoc-Roussillon, Limousin and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. For Auvergne, Bretagne,
      Lorraine and Rhône-Alpes, which operate independently for the collection of data REIN, the
      random draw of patients is done by each epidemiological center responsible for this
      collection.

      The Biostatistics and Medical Informatics Service of the Necker Hospital, and epidemiological
      centers of Auvergne, Bretagne, Lorraine and Rhône Alpes must submit the list of selected
      patients Clinical Research Associate (CRA) national.

        The source population is all patients included in the REIN system at the time of the survey
        in the nine participating regions currently in the system: Auvergne, Bretagne, Centre,
        Champagne Ardennes, Languedoc Roussillon, Limousin, Lorraine, Provence Alpes Côte d 'Azur,
        Rhône Alpes.

        The patients selected to participate in the study were selected by random draw on all of
        the base, from those whose annual spot date falls during the investigation period.

        The random draw is stratified by region and age group with a sampling fraction proportional
        to the size of the original population.
