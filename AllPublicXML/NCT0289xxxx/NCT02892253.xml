    <textblock>
      This Randomized Controlled Trial evaluates the clinical impact of parathyroid
      autofluorescence visualization using near infrared light (NIR) during total thyroidectomy
      (TT). It compares patients who undergo TT associated or not with lymph node dissection (LND)
      with NIR vs without NIR use during surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total thyroidectomy (TT) is responsible for postoperative hypocalcemia in 20-30% of patients,
      which is definitive in 1-4% of operated patients (1). This complication is mainly due to
      surgery-induced parathyroid dysfunction, which could be improved by a better intraoperative
      identification of the parathyroids. Intraoperative parathyroid auto-fluorescence
      visualization (without any dye injection) using near infrared light (NIR) is an emerging
      technique, which allows correct identification of normal parathyroids in almost all cases
      (2), but the clinical impact of NIR is unknown.

      The aim of this prospective, comparative randomized study, is to compare 2 groups of
      patients: patients operated with NIR (NIR+) vs patients operated without NIR (NIR-).

      The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of intraoperative use of NIR camera
      on postoperative hypocalcemia. Secondary objectives are to assess the impact of NIR on the
      visualization, autotransplantation and inadvertent resection rates during TT.

    <description>Surgical field is examined with NIR, during a few minutes (&lt;5') with room lights switched off, to avoid parasite lights, then open thyroidectomy is resumed conventionally. Real-time images, evocative of autofluorescent parathyroids, are checked visually. NIR consists of a 750 nm class 1 laser excitation, with a power &lt;20mW/cm2 (5 times less than the limit of 100mw/cm2, fixed by the international standard IEC 60601-2-41). It is provided by the Fluobeam® camera, which is inserted into a sterile cover and hold at a 15-20 cm distance from the patient. The system has an FDA 510(k) authorization for clinical use in parathyroid surgery and a European Community certification (Class 2A device).</description>
