  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial investigates the use of VPA (Valproic Acid) for the treatment of adult patients
      with biopsy proven idiopathic focal segmentel glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or minimal change
      disease (MCD).

      VPA used as an add-on to steroids might induce clinical remission in a first category of
      patients and potentially reduce the dose of maintenance immunosuppression required to
      maintain remission thereafter.

      In a second category of patients VPA might allow the reduction or even cessation of
      immunosuppression while clinical remission is maintained.

      Idiopathic MCD to treat diseases with a considerable associated morbidity and mortality.
      Current treatment options are limited, have limited efficacy and a considerable side effect
      profile. Recent findings in a murine model suggest that VPA treatment in an early phase of
      renal disease could halt or even prevent the development of proteinuria and the progression
      of kidney damage. VPA is a commonly used and easy available oral antiepileptic agent with a
      favorable side effect profile compared to the current standard of care agents for
      podocytopathies.

      This trial investigates wether

        1. VPA on top of or in substitution of standard of care agents is effective in remission
           induction in patients with FSGS or MCD with proteinuria resistant to first line therapy
           with corticosteroids.

        2. VPA is effective in remission maintenance allowing reduction and cessation of chronic
           immunosuppression without relapse in patients with frequently relapsing FSGS or MCD.

    <description>Patients will start study treatment on Day1 and will be treated with a dose of 250mg twice daily of the valproic acid slow release formulation (Depakine Chrono© - Sanofi Pharma Belgium).
Control of valproic acid serum levels after 4 to 7 days. The dose will be progressively increased targeting valproic acid serum levels in the target range for use of the drug as an anti-epileptic (50-100µg/ml).
During the study, visits will be performed every month and at the end of treatment. The duration of the study is 12 months. Continuation of valproic acid after completion of the study will be at the investigators discretion.</description>
