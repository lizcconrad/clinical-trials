  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to establish a database of people with varying levels of
      hepatic fibrosis and various etiologies of liver disease for use in future research
      protocols.

      The Fibroscan device will determine liver stiffness as well as the amount of fat through
      another application on the machine called controlled attenuation parameter or Controlled
      Attenuation Parameters (CAP). The liver stiffness measurements are then translated into a
      score that tells how much liver fibrosis or fat is present. Patients identified with
      potential for fatty liver or specific liver-related diseases causing fibrosis would be
      approached for a voluntary FibroScan measurement. From these patients, the investigators will
      collect information related to demographics, disease history, medical comorbidities, social
      history, laboratory and radiologic parameters. This information, along with clinical data
      associated with the patient will be placed in a database for use in identifying potential
      subjects for future trials.

    <description>Once on the examination table, the subject will be instructed to place the right arm under their head and to cross their right ankle over the left ankle. The subject will then be asked to slightly bend to the left side to open the intercostal space. Subsequently, a handheld probe is placed in the intercostal space overlaying the right hepatic lobe. The velocity of returning shear waves, measured at a depth of 25-65 mm, is converted into a liver stiffness measurement (LSM). The LSM obtained from a given VCTE exam is the median value of at least 10 successful measurements. This information, along with clinical data associated with the patient will be placed in a database for use in identifying potential subjects for future trials.</description>
