  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorders (NMOSD) is characterized by the pathogenic anti-AQP4
      antibody, which can be produced by specific plasma cells. The patients who are not responsive
      to rituximab treatment may be due to the presence of short-lived and long-lived plasma cells.
      Previous studies confirmed that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade®, approved for
      therapy of multiple myeloma) eliminated both plasmablasts and plasma cells by activation of
      the terminal unfolded protein response. Treatment with bortezomib may help deplete plasma
      cells producing auto-antibodies. Therefore, the rationale for using bortezomib in NMOSD is in
      that bortezomib may help eliminate autoreactive plasma cells and reduce anti-AQP4 antibodies
      titers. It is noted that bortezomib may protect astrocytes from NFκB-dependent inflammatory
      damage in early events in NMOSD pathogenesis.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the drug bortezomib contributes to reduce the
      average relapsing rates (ARRs) and alleviate neurological disability in NMOSD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown in some scientific studies that the the antibody marker specific for
      neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), known as AQP4-IgG, causes inflammation in
      brain tissues by activating NF-κB pathway. Bortezomib has already been shown to be effective
      in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

      The overall objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of bortezomib as add-on therapy to
      oral steroids,azathioprine or others for treatment of relapsing NMOSD, which have not reduced
      average relapsing rate (ARR) effectively.

      The primary (most important) objectives of this study are to determine:

      Whether bortezomib reduces relapse frequency in patients with relapsing NMO. The number of
      attacks during the one year treatment period will be compared to the number of attacks that
      occurred prior to initiation of bortezomib treatment.

      The secondary objectives are to determine:

      The safety profile of bortezomib in patients with NMO. Whether bortezomib maintains or
      improves walking, visual function and quality of life as measured by a variety of established
      disability scales. We will also assess the severity of an individual attack and the degree of
      recovery.

      Depending on our preliminary investigations we may evaluate patient cerebrospinal fluid in
      the laboratory to see how effective eculizumab is at getting into the cerebrospinal fluid
      from the blood stream, and to see if the drug reverses the biological effects of the NMO-IgG
      antibody.
