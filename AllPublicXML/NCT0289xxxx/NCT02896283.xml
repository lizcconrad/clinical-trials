  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized split-mouth design clinical trial is to clinically evaluate the
      effectiveness of diode laser in the healing of donor site of palate in free gingival graft.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Free gingival graft is the most predictable and successful method for increasing the width of
      keratinized tissue around teeth/dental implants and vestibular deepening. However, patient
      discomfort during the healing time is a major disadvantage of this procedure. Several methods
      have been introduced to accelerate the healing time and reduction of patient's pain during
      first days after surgery. Low-level lasers have shown promising results in biostimulation of
      cell growth and differentiation in cultures. However, there are lack of well designed double
      blind placebo controlled randomized controlled clinical studies evaluating the effects of
      Low-level laser therapy in acceleration of wound healing and pain relief of patients
      undergoing free gingival grafts.
