  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new version of the DiAs artificial pancreas (AP) system has been developed in view of wide
      scale outpatient trials. Denominated as inControl , it includes improved user interface and
      communication modules while closed-loop algorithms remain similar. During this pilot study,
      the investigators will evaluate this new version of AP for a two-week period during which the
      patients will use it for closed-loop insulin delivery 24/7 The main goal is train the
      clinical team with the new system and collect patient opinions on system acceptance from
      questionnaires. If this trial is conclusive, a randomized 6-month multicentre study including
      240 patients will be initiated. A total of 5 patients will be included in this training study
      over a 4-week period.
