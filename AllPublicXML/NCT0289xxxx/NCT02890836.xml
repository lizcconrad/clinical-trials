      Aim: First, to investigate the prevalence of a) confirmed hypertension, b) white coat
      hypertension and c) normal blood pressure in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.
      Second, to explore the prevalence of preeclampsia and preterm delivery in women with
      pre-existing diabetes with a) confirmed hypertension, b) white coat hypertension and c)
      normal blood pressure before entering the third trimester of pregnancy. Third, to explore the
      influence of lifestyle, gestational weight gain and mental well-being on confirmed
      hypertension and preeclampsia in pregnant women with diabetes.

      Design: A prospective multicentre observational study where approximately 400 pregnant women
      with pre-existing diabetes are offered measurements of office blood pressure (BP) and home BP
      for three days three times during pregnancy as well as when the routinely measured office BP
      exceeds 135/85 mmHg. The prevalence of confirmed hypertension (office BP &gt;135/85 mmHg and
      home BP &gt;130/80 mmHg) and white coat hypertension (office BP &gt;135/85 mmHg but home BP ≤130/80
      mmHg) will be determined. Women with confirmed hypertension are offered antihypertensive
      treatment mainly with methyldopa. In women with a) confirmed hypertension, b) white coat
      hypertension, and c) normal blood pressure before entering third trimester of pregnancy, the
      prevalence of preeclampsia and preterm delivery will be evaluated. Possible side effects of
      antihypertensive treatment including impaired fetal haemodynamics and lower infant birth
      weight will be recorded. The women will complete food diaries and questionnaires on lifestyle
      and mental health three times in pregnancy in order to evaluate the influence of these
      parameters on hypertension and preeclampsia.

          -  Sufficient Danish language skills to read and understand the patient information sheet
             and to converse.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for both study groups:

        • Women diagnosed with severe diseases that could possibly bias BP measurements or
        pregnancy outcome. This is judged by the principal investigators.
