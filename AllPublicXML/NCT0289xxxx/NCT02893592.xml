  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The photorefractive keratectomy was the first correction mode refractive laser. It's a
      photo-ablation of a predetermined thickness of anterior corneal stroma. Debridement of
      epithelium can be done either mechanically (m-PRK) or by laser (trans-PRK). Trans-PRK has a
      lot of interests: facility and speed of procedure as well as suppression of human variable.
      Very good results are obtained by m-PRK. The aim of this study is to show equivalence or non
      inferiority of trans-PRK over conventional m-PRK in terms of safety and refractive efficiency
