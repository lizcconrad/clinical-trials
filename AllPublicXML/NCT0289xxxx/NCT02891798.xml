  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After total joint replacement, early hospital discharge to home (with patients capable of
      continuing a home-based rehabilitation program) is a cost- effective management strategy.
      This project will use improved local anesthetic nerve block techniques to enhance technical
      capability and clinical practice by (i) reducing pain and other morbidities during recovery,
      (ii) improving weight-bearing achievement during in-hospital physical therapy to allow for
      earlier return home, and (iii) continued rehabilitation as an outpatient at home when
      feasible (versus in an extended care facility).

      Patients will have spinal anesthesia for their hip or knee replacement surgery. They will
      also receive the nerve blocks described above

          4. Have a BMI â‰¤ 40 kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current participation in another orthopedic/Physical Therapy/rehab/anesthesiology
             interventional clinical trial.

          2. Are at significant behavioral risks or have refractory major psychiatric disorders.

          5. Have been diagnosed with clinically significant neuropathy with its origins in either
             diabetes or other causes; have neuromuscular disease that would influence data
             collection.

          6. Have a surgically-fused lumbar spine, or a spinal cord simulator, or other condition
             that would contraindicate or prohibit the conduct of spinal anesthesia.

             substance abuse withdrawal symptoms (alcohol, cocaine, enrolled in methadone or
             buprenorphine opioid withdrawal programs, etc.)

          8. Are undergoing Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)/Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) for a tumor.

         11. Have a known hypersensitivity to bupivacaine hydrochloride or to any local anesthetic
             of the amide-type or to other components of bupivacaine hydrochloride solutions.

         12. Have a known or suspected buprenorphine hypersensitivity (not including nausea and/or
             vomiting).

         13. Have a gastro-intestinal (GI) obstruction.

        Veterans will not be excluded from participation based on smoking status, diagnosis of
        obstructive sleep apnea, or baseline monitored consumption of therapeutic opioids for
        documented medical indications; instead, these variables will be codified and quantified
        for subsequent covariate statistical analysis.
