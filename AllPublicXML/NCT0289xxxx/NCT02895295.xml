    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether providing Medicare beneficiaries with a
      web-based patient-centered decision tool to help them choose among prescription medication
      coverage plans improves outcomes for patients including a greater likelihood of changing a
      plan, better coverage for prescribed drugs, less decisional conflict when choosing plans, and
      greater satisfaction with the choice process relative to current practice.

      In this study, the investigators will test the effectiveness of two versions of a web-based
      tool (called CHOICE) to help people choose among Medicare Part D plans (Treatments A and B)
      relative to each other and relative to standard care (Control). Both treatment arms will
      incorporate simplified design and automated importation of an individual's prescription drugs
      relative to standard care. The treatment arms vary based on whether they provide expert
      guidance on recommended plans. In the control arm, study participants will be directed to the
      existing, publicly available Medicare.gov website and will receive instructions on how to
      download their drugs from the Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF) patient-facing online
      personal health portal (myhealthonline). Our study sample will include PAMF patients who were
      enrolled in Part D plans (not Medicare Advantage) during the 2016 enrollment period. Prior to
      the 2017 open enrollment period (October 15 to December 7, 2016), we will invite a subset of
      PAMF patients enrolled in Part D plan, age 66-85, and in 4 counties served by PAMF to
      participate in a study examining the effectiveness of decision tools that provide
      personalized information on the financial implications of enrolling in different Part D
      plans. The primary study outcomes will include 1) Plan switching, 2) Decisional conflict 3)
      Satisfaction with the choice process, and 4) Change in generosity of coverage of prescription
      drugs. The investigators will measure the primary study outcomes using a combination of
      administrative data and a post open enrollment survey administered to all study participants.
      The investigators will also collect information on individual characteristics at the time of
      enrollment in the study and implement a survey examining use of the intervention tool to
      assess patient experience at the time of use.
