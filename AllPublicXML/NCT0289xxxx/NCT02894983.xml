  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus about the best conservative treatment for patients with dorsally
      displaced distal radius fractures. The previous studies that have examined the most valid
      method for cast immobilization have lacked uniform and patient-rated outcome measures, proper
      randomization and sufficient study population. The aim of this study is to compare functional
      position cast to flexion-ulnar -deviation with dorsally displaced distal radius fractures in
      patients aged 65 years or older. The conservative treatment is performed in clinical practice
      by various health care professionals with different techniques of reduction which are not
      limited to any specific technique in this pragmatic, randomized controlled trial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) measure is the primary outcome measure of wrist pain and disability in the study</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PRWE comprises 15 questions to measure wrist pain and disability in daily activities. In PRWE patients rate wrist pain and disability from 0 to 10 and it consists three subscales: Pain, Function and Cosmetics.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability of the wrist measured with the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The QuickDASH is self-reported questionnaire and shortened version of DASH outcome measure to measure physical function and symptoms in people with any or multiple musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb in 11 dimensions in 1-5 scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life measured with the 15-D.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The 15D is a validated, generic, self-administered instrument for assessing the health related quality of life among adults. It combines the advantages of a preference-based and single index measure on a 0-1 scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain measured in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 1 year, 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is derived by health care professional question of pain in scale 0 to 10 in which 0 implies no pain and 10 the worst possible pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion (ROM) is measured with a goniometer</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ROM of the wrist is measured on both hands with a handheld goniometer in degrees.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Grip strength is measured with a dynamometer</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Grip strength is measured with a dynamometer in kg as the mean of three measurements. It will be numbered in percentage of the uninjured side.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The pain catastrophizing scale (PCS) is measured with a self-administered questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS is designed to measure person's willingness to catastrophize the pain while they are experiencing it. In the questionnaire patients answer questions about how they feel and think when they are in pain and it can be taken while they are not experiencing pain.</description>

    <description>The group will be treated with closed reduction and flexion-ulnar deviation position cast. This will take place under local anaesthesia by means of local infiltration commonly used in Finland. There is no preferable method for performing the reduction. Additional radiographs will be taken to verify the success of the reduction one week after the reduction and after two and five weeks of casting if treating health care professional it requires. The cast will be disposed after 5 weeks.</description>
