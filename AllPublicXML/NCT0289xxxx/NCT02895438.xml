    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very frequent condition in children. Its management is
      difficult, often resulting in a persistence of chronical abdominal pain.

      In adults, many patients affected by IBS improve under a gluten-free diet, even in the
      absence of Celiac Disease (CD) or wheat allergy. This condition is called Non Coeliac Gluten
      Sensitivity (NCGS). However, it is still not clear how to diagnose and manage NCGS, and the
      pathophysiological mechanisms also remain elusive.

      The aim of this study is to determine if NCGS exists in children with IBS and to identify the
      clinical, serological, and histological characteristics, which could distinguish patients
      with NCGS from conventional IBS and CD patients.

      This is a prospective cohort study in a population of children affected by a moderate to
      severe IBS for more than 6 months. All children had a Gluten Free Diet (GFD) for 6 weeks.
      Then, children who improved under GFD were randomized in two groups for a double-blind
      placebo-controled trial. One group had a reintroduction of gluten followed by a wash-out
      period, then a placebo reintroduction, whereas the other group had the placebo first, then
      the wash-out and the gluten reintroduction.
