      The aim of the study is to characterize and monitor the microbiome of premature infants born
      in the investigators facility until discharge from the NICU. The investigators will also
      examine the relationship between mode of delivery and the microbiome of the infant, while
      exploring various possible factors that may affect it. In addition, the investigators will
      compare the microbiome of premature infants to the microbiome of term babies born at the same
      time in the same facility.
