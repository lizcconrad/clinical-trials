      The Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network
      has been established by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
      (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to focus on a broader approach to the
      study of Interstitial Cystitis (IC)/ Bladder Pain Syndrome (BPS) in men and women, and
      Chronic Prostatitis (CP)/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) in men, than previously
      undertaken. Patients with IC or CP are being recruited for a new study called the &quot;Trans-MAPP
      Study of Urologic Chronic Pelvic Pain: Symptom Patterns Study (SPS). This research study will
      recruit Control Participants to better understand the symptoms of individuals with some form
      of IC or CP. As with many chronic pain disorders, IC and CP are poorly understood, and
      treatment is often not helpful. The goal of this study is to better understand how pain is
      felt in people with IC or CP and the investigators hope that this study will lead to
      improvement in the treatment of IC and CP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndromes (UCPPS) are characterized by pelvic pain with
      concurrent urinary symptoms. Broadly, UCPPS comprise Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder
      SyndromeBladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) in men and women, and Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic
      Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) in men. IC is a debilitating bladder disorder characterized by
      urinary urgency, frequency, and pain. The presentation of symptoms can be quite variable
      among patients, suggesting that IC is a multi-factorial syndrome with several proposed
      etiologies, some of which may be interrelated.1 BPS as defined by the International
      Continence Society, is &quot;the complaint of suprapubic pain related to bladder filling,
      accompanied by other symptoms, such as increased daytime and night-time frequency, in the
      absence of proven urinary infection or other obvious pathology.&quot;2 BPS is a clinical
      description of disease based on the patient's symptoms, and does not depend on urodynamic or
      cystoscopic findings. These symptoms may be related to IC, although diagnostic criteria are
      still lacking for this entity, and the relationship between BPS and IC is not clear. After
      the initiation phase for the MAPP SPS Study, it became clear that many of the hypotheses
      being proposed required well-characterized healthy &quot;normal&quot; controls that lack urologic pain
      as well as other study related symptoms/conditions. This second phase is enriched with
      pre-defined subgroups and a longer follow-up period which will allow further investigation of
      clinical and biologic factors associated with worsening and/or improvement of reported
      urinary and non-urinary symptoms.

        A clean-catch midstream urine specimen (VB2) will be obtained from all male and female
        participants during the initial and 6 month study visits, so that a urine dipstick analysis
        can be done for all participants, and a urine pregnancy test can be conducted for females

             withdrawn from study participation. A positive dipstick at the 6 Month visit will also
             result in the participant being treated and withdrawn. (Must be documented on Urine
             Culture Result - UCR form). We will keep all specimens and data collected from both
             eligible and in-eligible participants unless participant request that his/her data be
             destroyed, and not utilized for the study.
