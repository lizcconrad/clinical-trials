      The efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) in primary prevention of sudden
      cardiac death (SCD) is well demonstrated but pivotal studies have been published more than 10
      years ago and implantation's conditions tend to change.

    <textblock>
      The clinical efficacy of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) as method of primary
      prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is well demonstrated today. Unfortunately, selection
      criteria of patients deemed at risk lacks of specificity. For asymptomatic patients with a
      left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF), current guidelines support implantation of ICD if the
      LVEF is ≤35%. This target population corresponds to the one studied in the Sudden Cardiac
      Death in HEart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT). This trial is 10 years old. The proportion of
      patients with LVEF &gt; 30% was low (17%) and the analysis of this subgroup showed no decrease
      in mortality (hazard ratio = 1.08 [0.57-2.07]). That is why the usefulness of ICD in this
      segment of the population remains a subject of controversy. Moreover, SCD-HeFT did not offer
      resynchronization therapy despite the fact that more than 40% of patients included had a QRS
      signal duration ≥120ms.

      Conditions for implantation have since changed considerably. The &quot;routine&quot; nature of the
      implantation procedure and the desire to maximize patient's protection leads us to address
      for an implantation more easily. As for the resynchronization, it must be attempted in
      patients with severe heart failure, LVEF ≤35% and QRS sufficiently prolonged.

      This suggests that the implanted population is very different nowadays from those from the
      pivotal studies in terms of mean LVEF and implanted material. However, these two factors are
      significantly correlated with the risk of SCD... Therefore, the analysis was done on samples
      of patients who received ICD in primary prevention setting. This study focused on the effect
      of resynchronization and LVEF at implantation and the subsequent outcome. The results were
      broadly compared with those of SCD-HeFT.
