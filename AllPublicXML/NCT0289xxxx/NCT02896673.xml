  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome remains a serious condition, with a mortality rate of
      between 30 and 50%. The use of mechanical ventilation with small tidal volumes, and by
      limiting the plateau pressure in the respiratory tract below 30 cm H2O has been shown to
      reduce mortality by approximately 10%, probably by reducing pulmonary hyperinflation and
      pulmonary lesions induced by mechanical ventilation. It is therefore now established that the
      respirator settings influence patient prognosis. However, around 30% of patients with ARDS
      ventilated with these settings supposedly protective continue to present signs of pulmonary
      hyperinflation on tomodensitometry, suggesting an additional reduction in the tidal volume
      could be required in certain patients. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a new imaging
      technique that gathers functional pulmonary information at bedside.

      This technique also allows a regional analysis, allowing the complexity of the spatial
      distribution of ARDS pulmonary lesions to be understood. The hypothesis is that EIT is a
      reliable method to detect at-risk situations of lesions induced by mechanical ventilation
      among patients with ARDS.

Time A: measure under basal conditions (TVbasal=6ml/kg of predicted weight), basal PEP, basal inspiratory time / total time = 30%)
Time B: different PEP are applied for 4 minutes: 5, 10, 15, 20 cm of H2O conserving the basal TV
Time C: different TV are applied for 4 minutes: 4, 7, 10 ml/kg of predicted weight conserving the basal PEP and the basal inspiratory time
Time D: recruitment in continuous positive airway pressure at 45 cm of H2O is performed for 30 seconds
