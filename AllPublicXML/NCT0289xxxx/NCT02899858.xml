  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord neural circuitry exists in the lumbar enlargement that makes it possible to stand
      and create synergistic, rhythmic stepping activity in the lower limbs. In the past 20 years,
      clinicians have tried to reengage such these circuits for standing and walking in the lower
      spinal cord of paralyzed humans through novel paradigms of physical therapy, pharmacological
      stimulation of the spinal cord, or recently - epidural stimulation of the spinal cord.
      Although standing and stepping with these maneuvers are rudimentary at best, these human
      studies offer promise to restore controlled, lower extremity movement to the spinal cord
      injured (SCI) individual. Evidence from animal data suggests that more focal activation of
      intraspinal circuitry (IntraSpinal Micro-Stimulation - ISMS) would produce more fatigue
      resistant, natural standing and stepping activity in humans. To date, there has been no
      direct confirmation of such circuitry in the spinal cord of bipedal humans who have been
      paralyzed. Furthermore, mapping of such circuitry would provide the basis of a novel
      intraspinal neuroprosthetic that should be able to restore control of standing or walking in
      a manner that is much more physiologically normal and tolerable than by stimulating each
      individual muscle group. Proof of the existence of these spinal circuits in man, and the
      ability to activate and control these circuits by first mapping the spinal cord is the basis
      of this proposal.

    <textblock>
      Two study volunteers who are completely paralyzed (T2-8 region) to undergo an evaluation of
      ISMS during an otherwise normal thoracic spinal surgical procedure.

      The potential volunteers will be asked to review and sign a screening consent form prior to
      initial screening. This is to ensure that the ideal two patients are selected for this study
      and that foreseeable issues are identified and risks minimized for the volunteers. The
      subjects must have a stable, complete spinal cord injury involving their upper thoracic
      spinal cord (T2-8 region), and are otherwise planning to undergo a spine surgery involving
      the lower thoracic spinal cord.

      Subjects who have volunteered for this study will undergo their intended spinal surgery by
      the clinical team. The usual indications for undergoing such a surgery is either to correct a
      deformity involving the lower thoracic region, or stabilizing the lower thoracic region due
      to chronic instability from degenerative disease. The surgery intended for clinical treatment
      must involve exposure of the T9-T12 spinal lamina. However, exposure of the spinal cord
      through a dural opening would not normally be performed in this clinical scenario. The
      experimental portion of the surgery begins then, with a laminectomy of T9-T12 and exposure of
      the spinal cord through a durotomy using standard neurosurgical techniques for spinal cord
      exposure. The spinal cord in this region will then be mapped and stimulated using ISMS and
      the effects on the legs measured to determine if the circuitry exists to potentially allow
      standing or walking through the use of ISMS. The research requests subjects to specifically
      allow 2 hours of extra time during the routine spinal surgery to perform this study.
