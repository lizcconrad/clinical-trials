    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best way to give hyperthermia and high dose
      rate radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that has come back after
      prior radiation treatment. Radiation therapy, such as high dose rate brachytherapy, uses
      radioactive material placed directly into or near a tumor to kill tumor cells. Hyperthermia
      therapy may make tumor cells more sensitive to the effects of radiation therapy by heating
      them to several degrees above normal body temperature. Giving hyperthermia and high dose rate
      radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with recurrent prostate cancer after
      radiation.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of combined single fraction high dose rate (HDR)
      brachytherapy followed immediately by interstitial hyperthermia treatment of radio-recurrent
      prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess long-term toxicity. II. To provide a preliminary assessment of efficacy. III. To
      obtain blood for future analysis of immune response to combined radiation therapy and
      hyperthermia.
