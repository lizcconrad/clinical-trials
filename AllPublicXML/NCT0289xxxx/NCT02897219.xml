    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to confirm efficacy of ASP1941 based on the changes in HbA1c
      and to assess its safety in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving ASP1941 once
      daily in combination with insulin for 24 weeks. This study will also assess the
      safety/efficacy of long-term treatment (52 weeks).

      This study consists of two parts. In Part 1, ASP1941 or placebo will be administered orally
      in a blind manner. In Part 2, the long-term safety and efficacy of ASP1941 will be evaluated
      in patients who have participated in the study and completed the Part 1.
