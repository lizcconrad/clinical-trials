  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer related mortality. Among them, non small cell lung
      cancer accounts for 85%. Only part of patients could be treated with radical surgery, and
      some patients were unfit for surgery due to the poor cardio-pulmonary function or refuse
      surgery. For those patients, microwave ablation (MWA) could be an alternative treatment.
      Several small sample retrospective studies verified that MWA could be an efficacy and safe
      treatment.

      Patients with stage I non small cell lung cancer unfit for or refused surgery will be treated
      with MWA in the primary tumor sites.
