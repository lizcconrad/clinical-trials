      The study T2HD &quot;Thrombosis and Haemorrhage in chronic hemodialysis patients&quot; is a study of
      pharmacoepidemiology observational, retrospective cohort, multicenter including 12 dialysis
      centers for adults Lorraine.

      The main objective is to :

      Describe the prescribing practices of drugs anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents in chronic
      hemodialysis patients in the Lorraine region.

      The second objective is to :

      Study the impact of these practices on the survival and the occurrence of major clinical
      events, thrombotic and hemorrhagic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All adult patients aged 18 and over who started a new hemodialysis replacement therapy in
      Lorraine between 01/01/2009 and 31/12/2010 are identified from the registry REIN
      (Epidemiology and Information Network in nephrology). The latter are included in the study
      T2HD to the initiation of dialysis and followed until the date point 30/06/2013.

      The outcome was survival without major clinical event. Are considered major clinical events:
      acute coronary syndrome, acute limb ischemia, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis,
      pulmonary embolism, thrombosis First, ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, the digestive
      hemorrhage, and severe bleeding.

      Statistical analysis will compare event-free survival of patients in 4 groups. Patients will
      be censored at the time of the occurrence of a kidney transplant, a dialysis method of
      change, a dialysis withdrawal, a move outside Lorraine, or date point if they are still alive
      . To minimize bias maximum indication, patients of different groups will be matched on
      propensity score (probability for a given patient to be treated by antiplatelet and / or
      anticoagulant).
