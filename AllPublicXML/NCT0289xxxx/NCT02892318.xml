  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase Ib study of atezolizumab in combination with
      immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of participants with AML (relapsed/refractory and
      treatment-naive, elderly participants unfit for induction chemotherapy). The study has been
      designed with the intent, over time, to study multiple combinations of atezolizumab with
      different immunomodulatory agents in participants with AML. The study will begin with the
      evaluation of the combination of atezolizumab and guadecitabine (Arm A). In the future,
      additional arms may be added.

    <description>An initial safety evaluation of the combination will be performed in 9 participants with relapsed/refractory AML. All participants will receive atezolizumab (840 milligrams [mg] IV on Days 8 and 22 of every 28-day cycle) administered in combination with guadecitabine (60 milligrams per square meter [mg/m^2] subcutaneously [SC] on Days 1-5 of every 28-day cycle). Treatment with both study drugs will continue until loss of clinical benefit (except in participants who achieve a CR, CRp, or CRi), evidence of unacceptable toxicity, voluntary withdrawal from the study, study termination, or death, whichever occurs first. Participants who achieve a CR, CRp, or CRi will receive an additional six cycles of the combination as consolidation treatment.
