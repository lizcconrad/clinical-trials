    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationship between
      mindfulness and stress habituation. The investigators propose to measure the effect of
      mindfulness on stress habituation by randomly assigning participants to a 6-week
      mindfulness-based stress reduction group intervention, a cognitive-behavioral skills group
      comparison intervention, or a waitlist control condition followed by repeated acute
      psychosocial stress testing (2 laboratory sessions on 2 separate days). Saliva will be
      collected from participants throughout both laboratory testing sessions to measure HPA axis
      activation (an essential stress-responsive system), along with other measures of
      physiological and psychological stress (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, emotions).
      Mediators and moderators of treatment outcome will be examined. The cognitive-behavioral
      skills group condition is an appropriate comparison group due to the well-documented efficacy
      of cognitive-behavioral interventions on stress.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-weeks after baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>A 10-item self-report measure that examines perceived stress. The measure produces one total score. The investigators will measure the change in total score from baseline to the 6-week assessment.</description>

    <measure>Salivary cortisol response to repeated acute psychosocial stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (approximately 7-14 weeks after baseline assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>4 saliva samples will be collected before and after a psychosocial stressor task, which will be administered on two separate occasions separated in time by at least 48 hours. All saliva samples will be assayed for salivary cortisol using enzyme-linked immunoassays. The investigators will measure the change in cortisol stress profiles from the first stressor exposure to the second.</description>
