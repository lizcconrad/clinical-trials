      The purpose of this study is to develop and test a 12-month Integrative Medicine intervention
      based on Ayurvedic medicine in recent breast cancer survivors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer associated symptoms and impaired quality of life remain significant problems for
      patients despite advances in cancer treatment. Few effective treatment options exist for
      these symptoms. Integrative medicine is rising in popularity in the United States; however,
      few integrative medicine modalities have been rigorously studied. Ayurveda, a whole system of
      medicine that originated in the Indian subcontinent, has its own system of diagnostics and
      therapeutics, and among its strengths are wellness and prevention. The investigators aim to
      perform a prospective single arm clinical study of a manualized Ayurvedic approach in breast
      cancer survivors with impaired quality of life. Specifically, the investigators aim to refine
      the manualized Ayurvedic intervention; to assess feasibility; and to determine whether
      clinically meaningful effects can be achieved with the intervention.
