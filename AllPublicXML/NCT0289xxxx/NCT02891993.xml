      The purpose of this research study is to address the challenge of symptom management for
      hospitalized patients with cancer.

    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer may experience a considerable symptom burden, often requiring
      hospitalizations for symptom management. This study will pilot test an electronic symptom
      monitoring intervention, &quot;Improving Management of Patient-Reported Outcomes Via Electronic
      Data (IMPROVED),&quot; versus usual care in hospitalized patients with cancer.

      The goal of this study is test a model where patients' symptoms are monitored during their
      hospital admission electronically via tablet computers. The investigators are studying
      whether patients whose clinicians receive their patients' detailed symptom reports each day
      have improved symptom management compared to those whose clinicians do not receive their
      patients' detailed symptom reports each day.

      The study takes place at Massachusetts General Hospital and involves participating in a study
      for as long as the participants are admitted to the hospital. The information the
      investigators collect will help them determine if electronic symptom monitoring improves the
      care of patients with cancer.
