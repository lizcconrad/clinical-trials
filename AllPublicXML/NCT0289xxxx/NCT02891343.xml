  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early assessment of new symptomatic drugs for Alzheimer disease remains difficult because
      of the lack of predictive end-point. The use of a battery including different parameters
      could improve this early development. In healthy volunteers, to test the reverse effect of
      symptomatic drugs, it is necessary to induce transient and reversible cognitive impairment
      and cerebral activity changes by a challenge test. In this context, a transient hypoxia could
      be relevant.

    <description>During this period, the FiO2 will be set on 21% (normoxia condition). A filter will be put between the mask and the tubes connecting it to the machine generating hypoxia (equipment reference = Altitrainer NP190). On that filter a gas analyser will monitor the FiO2 and a capnography monitor (Capnostream 20, ORIDION) will also be installed.</description>
