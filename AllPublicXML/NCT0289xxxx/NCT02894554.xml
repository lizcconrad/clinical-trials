  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection rate among renal transplant recipients was reported
      from 3% to 20.9%. And patient survival and graft survival rates following renal
      transplantation may be worsen in HBsAg-positive carriers than in HBsAg-negative recipients.
      Due to viral replication in asymptomatic HBV carriers induced by post-transplant
      immunosuppression, liver-related complications, such as liver failure and bleeding, account
      for 37% to 57% of the mortality cases in HBsAg-positive renal allograft recipients.

      Since the late 1990s, Lamivudine has been recognized as an effective and well-tolerated
      antiviral drug for chronic HBV infection. Lamivudine treatment among HBsAg-positive renal
      allograft recipients has significantly improved patient survival rates during short-term
      follow-up. Telbivudine is another approved nucleoside antiviral agent for patients with
      chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Recently, it was shown that eGFR was improved in HBV-related
      decompensated cirrhosis patients after 52 weeks Telbivudine treatments. Additional eGFR
      increase was also observed in Lamivudine experienced CHB patients after switch to Telbivudine
      treatment.

      However, limited results were known about the renal function affected by oral anti-HBV drugs
      when patients received kidney transplantation. Therefore, we would like to conduct this study
      to evaluate the renal function of Lamivudine long term used HBsAg positive patients received
      kidney transplantation after switch to Telbivudine treatment. The clinical and virological
      outcomes will provide valuable insights of clinical practice.
