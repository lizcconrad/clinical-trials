    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of yoga (including breathing
      exercises) on the quality of life in patients, diagnosed and undergoing standard treatments
      for non-small cell lung cancer.

      This clinical trial studies yoga in improving quality of life in patients with non-small cell
      lung cancer undergoing treatment. Yoga may help improve quality of life and pulmonary
      functional capacity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

    <measure>Change of the score of the Trial Outcome Index (TOI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure health related quality of life (HRQOL), the TOI will be used,sum of the scores on the Lung Cancer Subscales (LCS) and the physical well-being and functional well-being subscales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) scale. Frequencies, means and standard deviations of the patient characteristics will be compared between groups at baseline to assess the success of the randomization, and whether any baseline values need to be controlled for in analysis. Differences between groups in the change in outcome scores on the FACT-L, LSC, and TOI will be assessed using analysis of covariance, where covariates will include the stratification variable as well as any variables found to differ between groups at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Measures of pulmonary function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Objective pulmonary function will be measured on a 3 measure spirometer ((FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)). Since there are 3 measures of pulmonary function, the two groups will be compared using mixed model methods.</description>

    <description>This is a 44-item self-report instrument which measures multidimensional HRQOL. There are 5 sections dealing with physical, family, emotional, and functional well-being and their relationship with the doctor. There are nine questions in a sixth subscale that are specific to lung cancer (LSC), including shortness of breath, cough, etc. The TOI is the sum of the scores on the LCS and the physical well-being and functional well-being subscales of the FACT-L scale. The FACT-L has been shown to be reliable and valid and sensitive. (Cella, Bonomi, Lloyd, DS, Kaplan, &amp; Bonomi, 1995). The instrument has been used with patients with lung cancer in the Massey Cancer Center.</description>
