  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrobulbar optic neuritis (NORB) is the damage to the optic nerve caused by inflammation. It
      causes a rapidly progressive and painful visual loss, often among young subjects. Diagnosis
      confirmation is important to start proper treatment, because a NORB is often the first
      symptom of multiple sclerosis. This diagnosis, based on a set of arguments, is difficult to
      define by a non-expert ophthalmologist.

      The pupillary light reflex is a way to test the visual afferent pathways. If it is subject to
      a large inter-individual variability, the dynamics of the pupillary light reflex and its
      latency are more reproducible. An easy way to study the dynamics of the pupillary light
      reflex is to study the pupillary cycle time (PCT). In the case of NORB, elongation of the
      conduction in the visual afferent pathways related to demyelination plate increases the
      latency of the pupillary light reflex and decreases the frequency of the PCT.

      Our hypothesis is that PCT dynamics measures would be a reliable indicator and easy to
      evaluate some pathologies affecting the integrity of the nerve. The validation of a decrease
      in the frequency of the PCT in NORB, compared to the frequency observed in subjects
      ophthalmological or neurological disease, could help developing methods to study the
      conduction of the visual pathways with portable devices used during the standard
      ophthalmologic consultation and quickly orientate patients to specialized centers.
