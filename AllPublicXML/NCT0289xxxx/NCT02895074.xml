  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) and
      conventional phacoemulsification surgery (CPS) on subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) in
      age-related cataracts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is not clear whether femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) alters retinal
      and choroidal thickness. The goal of the present study was to determine the changes of
      retinal and choroidal thicknesses in patients who have undergone FLACS compared to patients
      who have undergone conventional phacoemulsification surgery (CPS).

    <description>A femtosecond laser (Alcon-Lensx, Alcon-Lensx, Inc.) was used in this study. After pupil dilation and topical anesthesia, the laser was docked to the eye using a curved contact lens to applanate the cornea. With the integrated OCT imaging system, the locations of the cornea and the anterior and posterior surfaces of the crystalline lens were determined. A 5.0-mm-diameter capsulotomy was created by scanning a cylindrical pattern and followed by lens fragmentation. The laser was disconnected, and the remainder of the surgery was performed as phacoemulsification (InfinitiÂ® Vision System; Alcon, USA). Folded intraocular lenses (IOLs) were implanted in the capsular bags.</description>
