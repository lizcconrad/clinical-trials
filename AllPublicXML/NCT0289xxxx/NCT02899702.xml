    <textblock>
      IGHN2 is an international, multicenter, double blind, randomized controlled trial aimed at
      assessing the efficacy on organ dysfunctions of Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIG) treatment
      in the acute phase of streptococcal or staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome in children.

Isovolume - so dose of 0.8 g/kg We chose as placebo albumin diluted to 4% because this solution has the advantage of having a comparable osmolality.
The treatment of toxic shock will be standardized. It consists of antibiotics: Amoxicillin-clavulanate and clindamycin (or Rifampicin, Rifadine® if allergic). Antibiotics are not considered as experimental treatments for this study. All treatments essential for the treatment of acute condition will be allowed and are not considered as experimental treatments for this study.</description>
