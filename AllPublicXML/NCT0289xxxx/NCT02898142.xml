  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fasting and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) depends on increased production of
      intestinal triglyceride rich lipoproteins in patients with isolated fasting
      hypertriglyceridemia.

      The objective of this study is to compare the serum apoB48 rate after a standardized load
      test, among patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia and patients with metabolic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two major studies in 2007 showed that the occurrence of myocardial infarction and death was
      more frequent in subjects with the highest &quot;non-fasting&quot; triglycerides level. This is an
      important point that supports the hypothesis that the development of atheromatous lesions
      also depends on &quot;remnant&quot; of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) products such as
      chylomicrons in the intestine. The elevation of triglycerides in postprandial period depends
      on the intestinal production of TRL that can be excessively increased as has been shown in
      diabetes. Accordingly, it is necessary to distinguish between hepatic and intestinal
      production of TRL in hypertriglyceridemic patients particularly during postprandial period.
      TRL contain a single molecule of apolipoprotein B (apoB), apoB100 when produced by the liver
      or apoB-48 when they are produced by the gut. It is well known that apo B100 is the
      lipoprotein of the VLDL which is increased in hypertriglyceridemia. But preliminary works
      showed that fasting concentrations of apoB48 were correlated with triglycerides in some
      hypertriglyceridemic patients. These results suggest an intestinal part in fasting
      triglycerides levels. It therefore appears that the liver and intestine contribute to
      hypertriglyceridemia, but the intestinal part is not established particularly in isolated
      hypertriglyceridemia. The detection of abnormalities in the production of LRT would consider
      intestinal bowel as a target organ for the initiation of specific lipid-lowering therapy.
