  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most frequent complications of pregnancy,
      that affect between 1 to 14% of population around the world. The overall purpose of this
      study is to determine the efficacy of individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT)
      intervention to reduce and control the development of GDM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of women with gestational diabetes mellitus had been increasing. Maternal GDM has
      a great impact on both the health of the mothers and the offspring. Antenatal lifestyle
      interventions, in particular dietary intervention appear to be feasible to improve maternal
      GDM and weight gain. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no such trial examining the
      feasibility of MNT intervention in pregnant women in Hu'nan province. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the efficacy of individualized MNT intervention to reduce and control the
      development of GDM. This is a prospective study, 500 patients who meet inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be included. The changes of glucose and weight will be evaluated
      every two weeks.
