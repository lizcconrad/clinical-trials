          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus prior to informed consent.

          -  Chinese male or female patients who are pre-treated with insulin alone or in
             combination with metformin:

               -  With maximum insulin dose of &lt;= 1 unit/kg/day. Acceptable basal insulins could be
                  insulin glargin, insulin detemir or NPH (neutral protamin hagedorn) insulin with
                  duration of action up to 24 h; acceptable pre-mixed insulins could be
                  preparations with 25/75 or 30/70 ratio, with once or twice daily posology only.
                  The total insulin dose should not be changed by more than 10% of the baseline
                  value within the 12 weeks prior to randomisation (Visit 3). Both human insulin &amp;
                  insulin analogue are accepted.

               -  If the patient is taking metformin, stable dose (at least 1500 mg daily) must be
                  maintained for at least 12 weeks without dose adjustments prior to randomisation
                  (Visit 3).

          -  HbA1c fulfills the following criteria: &gt;= 7.5 % to &lt;= 10.0 % at Visit 1.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years at Visit 1.

          -  BMI &lt;= 45 kg/m2 (Body Mass Index) at Visit 1.

             of birth control per ICH (International Conference on Harmonisation) M3 (R2) that
             result in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and
             correctly. A list of contraception methods meeting these criteria is provided in the
             patient information.

               -  A woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP), i.e. fertile, following
                  menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile.

               -  Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and
                  bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent by date of Visit 1 in accordance with
             ICH-GCP (Good Clinical Practice) and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled hyperglycaemic with a glucose level &gt;240 mg/dl (&gt;13.3 mmol/L) after an
             overnight fast during placebo run-in and confirmed by a second measurement (not on the
             same day).

          -  Any other antidiabetic drug within 3 months prior to informed consent except those
             defined as background treatment via inclusion criterion 2.

          -  Indication of liver disease, defined by serum levels of either ALT (Alanine
             aminotransferase) (SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase )), AST (Aspartate
             aminotransferase) (SGOT (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase)), or alkaline
             phosphatase above 3 Ã— upper limit of normal (ULN (upper limit of normal)) as
             determined during screening and/or run-in phase.

          -  Any contraindications to metformin according to the local label for those patients
