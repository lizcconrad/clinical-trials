  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research focuses on the safety profile of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). The
      hypothesis is that safety issue, as regards to cardiovascular risk, is not homogenous across
      the spectrum of androgen-deprivation therapy modalities. Our study will encompass all ADT
      modalities including intermittent ADT.

      ADT is a cornerstone therapy in prostate cancer management. Decisions about ADT should weigh
      improvements in cancer-specific outcomes against potential increased risks for cardiovascular
      diseases. The potential for harm from ADT should be more precisely defined according to the
      type of ADT. Those potential risks underscore the importance of better understanding benefits
      of ADT, especially in contexts where data are still lacking.ADT is also indicated in sexually
      deviant behavior.

      Our study is a nationwide population-based prospective cohort on 4 years thanks to the French
      Health Reimbursement Agency database (Système National d'Information Inter-Régimes de
      l'Assurance Maladie, SNIIRAM) and French hospital discharge database (Programme de
      Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information; PMSI). A unique civil registration number has been
      assigned to all French residents and this number unambiguously links those two databases.
