      Managing distress and improving well-being is critically important for optimal survivorship
      care. Treatment of distress leads to better adherence to treatment, better communication,
      fewer calls and visits to the oncologist's office, and avoidance of development of severe
      anxiety or depression. Based on national guidelines, distress is typically managed with
      pharmacologic options (i.e. benzodiazepines), support groups, individual counseling, or
      chaplaincy services. To our knowledge, the role of a structured improvisational comedy
      (improv) program in reducing distress and improving well-being has never been evaluated in
      the oncology setting.

      With over 14 million cancer survivors today in the United States comes a unique constellation
      of challenges and opportunities for health care providers trying to optimize health at a time
      when many patients are struggling and open to learning new skills for strengthening their own
      resiliency and ability to cope. Not only does a significant subset of patients with cancer
      experience an increase in negative emotions, such as distress, anxiety and depression, but
      they often also experience a lack of positive emotions (Hart 2010). Managing distress and
      improving well-being is critically important for optimal survivorship care. Treatment of
      distress leads to better adherence to treatment, better communication, fewer calls and visits
      to the oncologist's office, and avoidance of development of severe anxiety or depression
      (Partridge, Wang et al. 2003; Carlson and Bultz 2004; 2014). Based on national guidelines,
      distress is typically managed with pharmacologic options (i.e. benzodiazepines), support
      groups, individual counseling, or chaplaincy services. To our knowledge, the role of a
      structured improvisational comedy (improv) program in reducing distress and improving
      well-being has never been evaluated in the oncology setting.
