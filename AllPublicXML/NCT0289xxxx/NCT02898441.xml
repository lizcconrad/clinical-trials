      The present study is a randomized controlled trial of LDCT screening for lung cancer versus
      usual care. 6000 high-risk subjects (age 45-70) were recruited and randomized to the Active
      arm (Baseline + 2 biennial repeated LDCT screening) or to the Passive arm, followed up in
      usual care (Baseline + 2 biennial repeated questionnaire inquiries). Follow-up for lung
      cancer incidence, lung cancer mortality and overall mortality was performed. Blood samples
      were stored from the Active arm in a Biobank. Management of positive screening test was
      carried out by a pre-specified protocol.
