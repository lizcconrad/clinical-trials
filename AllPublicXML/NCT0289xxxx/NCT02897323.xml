  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of congenital heart disease is about 8 per thousand live births. Thanks to
      advances in cardiac surgery, 90% of children born with heart defects reach adolescence and
      adulthood. Congenital heart defects are the leading cause of heart disease in young adults
      and expectant mothers in Western countries. The number of patients increases continuously as
      life expectancy increases. An increasing number of patients with complex heart defects
      survive to adulthood. The medico-surgical management of this highly specialized growing
      number of patients is difficult and requires a multidisciplinary collaboration. In France, an
      estimated 200,000 patients the number of carrier patients with congenital heart disease. Half
      of them will require monitoring, medical procedures, catheterizations and/or surgical
      re-intervention. No objective demographic data are currently available on the French
      patients. So, the investigators decided to set up an epidemiological project to better
      understand this cohort of patients. The main objective of this project is to obtain accurate
      epidemiological data needed to adapt the supply of care.
