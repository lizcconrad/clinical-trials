      Vascular complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising mainly
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), representing 2% extra-intestinal
      complications. In over 60% of cases, these vascular complications of deep venous thrombosis
      (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Several studies have shown that patients with IBD have a
      risk of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) increased from 1.5 to 3.5. This risk is closely
      related to disease activity.

      Vascular complications in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising mainly
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), representing 2% extra-intestinal
      complications. In over 60% of cases, these vascular complications of deep venous thrombosis
      (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Several studies have shown that patients with IBD have a
      risk of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) increased from 1.5 to 3.5. This risk is closely
      related to disease activity.

      However, the association between IBD and arterial thromboembolic events such as cases of
      myocardial infarction, stroke, aortic thrombus, mesenteric ischemia, peripheral arterial
      disease and members senior, was described less and remains a subject of debate. These
      arterial complications occur in young subjects accountability of IBD remains debated, and no
      clear pathophysiology. Here the investigators describe a series of 6 cases of patients with
      IBD who developed severe arterial complications, and whose cause was retained digestive
      inflammatory underlying disease.

      This study is report of six (6) cases that will be described
