    <textblock>
      The detection of tissue PD-L1 immunohistochemistry in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has
      an important role in guiding for the treatment of immune detection point. At the same
      time,tissue detection is time-consuming and laborious, liquid biopsy can reflect the
      information of tumor tissue,PD-L1 mRNA in plasma exosomes (pExo) is expected to be simple,
      rapid, non-invasive means of detection. The project is planned to explore the consistency
      analysis of PD-L1 expression level detected in cancer tissues and pExo.We have designed to
      detected the expression levels of PD-L1 mRNA and protein in cancer tissue and detected the
      expression levels of PD-L1 mRNA in pExo.By using variance analysis of repeated measures
      design information. Thus exploring the consistency analysis of PD-L1 expression level
      detected in tissues and pExo,guiding clinical practice of radiotherapy combining with
      immunotherapy.
