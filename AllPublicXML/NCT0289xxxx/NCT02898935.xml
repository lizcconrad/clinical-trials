  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reconstruction software allows visualization of cortical structure in 3 dimensions, showing
      on a single picture the position of all the electrodes. The EEG signal of each recording plot
      of the electrode is analyzed and compared with the underlying brain structure reconstructed
      by the software. It is therefore possible to visualize 1) ictogenic and epileptogenic areas
      using neurophysiological stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) data and 2) adjacent functional
      cortical areas with functional imaging and SEEG. Software makes it possible to determine the
      links between these areas. This study aims to show that using these software is an asset in
      surgical decision and in the choice of surgical strategy.

      Each patient has presurgical evaluation (usual care), including morphologic and (if
      necessary) functional MRI, EEG and SEEG. In this study, software will be used to analyze the
      processed data (FSL software, FMRIB laboratory, Oxford University and BrainVisa/Anatomist.
      The surgical decision will be taken according to the usual staff procedures, based on the
      usual examination results. After the decision making process, the staff will be asked to
      reconsider the surgical decision, according to the analysis provided by the software. The
      discrepancies between the decisions will be recorded.
