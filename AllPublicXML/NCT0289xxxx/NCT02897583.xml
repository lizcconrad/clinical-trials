  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of YAG vitreolysis versus sham for symptomatic Weiss ring due to posterior vitreous
      detachment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      52 subjects will be enrolled in the trial and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either YAG
      laser vitreolysis or sham laser for symptomatic Weiss ring due to posterior vitreous
      detachment. Subjects will follow up at one week, one month, three months, and six months
      after the procedure. Assessments will include a questionnaire regarding duration of floater
      symptoms prior to presentation, severity of floater symptoms, number of floaters, and
      activity most inconvenienced by presence of floaters; Medical, ocular history and
      demographics collected; ETDRS and Snellen visual acuity; Optos color photography; Heidelberg
      Spectralis Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and infrared photo; B scan ultrasound of Weiss
      ring with caliper measurement of nearest distance between Weiss ring and retina, Weiss ring
      and posterior lens capsule (only in phakic eyes); Slit lamp and indirect ophthalmoscopy with
      scleral depression of study eye; Applanation tonometry; Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25
      (VFQ 25). Qualitative change in Optos photography will evaluated by a masked physician.

    <description>A Karickoff lens with goniosol will be used to perform the YAG vitreolysis. The number of shots will be determined at the discretion of the treating physician. A focus offset may be used at investigator discretion. Single shot mode will be used. The maximum energy per pulse will be 7 mJ. The endpoint of treatment is the vaporization of the Weiss ring into gas, as well as the disruption of it into smaller fragments as well as any other vitreous opacities deemed visually significant by the treating physician. Only one treatment session will be performed.</description>

    <description>Sham laser treatment will be applied under the same procedure used for laser treatment but by turning the laser power down to 0.3 mJ and using a separate lens covered by a filter that absorbs the power, so no laser enters the eye.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptoms of floaters that correlate to the presence of a posterior vitreous detachment
             for at least 6 months

          2. Documented posterior vitreous detachment on clinical examination, OCT, and B scan

          3. Self-rating of visual disturbance by the floaters must be at least 4 on a 0-10 scale,
             with 0 being no symptoms to 10 being debilitating symptoms.

          4. Symptomatic Weiss ring (PVD) must be at least 3 mm away from the retina and 5 mm from
             the posterior lens capsule of the crystalline lens, as measured on B-scan. For
             pseudophakic patients, there is no minimum required distance from the intraocular
             lens.

          5. Able to position for the YAG laser procedure.

          6. Accept the risks of YAG laser including but not limited to retinal detachment,
             intraocular hemorrhage, retinal damage, cataract formation, optic nerve damage,
             inflammation, and irreversible loss of vision.

          7. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          8. If the patient has two symptomatic eyes, only one eye can be randomized and included
             in the study.

          9. Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Snellen best corrected visual acuity worse than 20/50 in the fellow eye

          2. History of retinal tear, retinal detachment, or uveitis in the study eye

          3. History of diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, retinal vein occlusion, or aphakia in
             the study eye

          4. History of glaucoma or high intraocular pressure defined as having a history of
             glaucoma surgery or currently taking two or more topical glaucoma medications in the
             study eye
