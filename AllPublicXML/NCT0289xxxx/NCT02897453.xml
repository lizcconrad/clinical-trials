  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an opportunity to gather long term safety and efficacy information from
      patients who have had their scoliosis treated via anterior vertebral body tethering (VBT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will have already been implanted with a vertebral body tethering
      device. Patients will be recruited for prospective follow-up to enable systematic data
      capture from the point of study entry to their 18th birth year or skeletal maturity
      (whichever is longer). Over the course of their follow-up clinical outcomes, patient reported
      outcomes, and radiographic outcomes will be tracked.
