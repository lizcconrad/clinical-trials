    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively reviewed all radionuclide shuntographic tests using
      (99m)technetium-pertechnetate (DTPA) performed between August 2005 and December 2015 in
      nuclear medicine department of Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. The results of shuntography
      were evaluated visually and qualitatively, and correlated with clinical follow-up. The tests
      were interpreted as normal and abnormal, including complete distal obstruction, partial
      distal obstruction or miscellaneous. Clinical outcomes within 30 days were defined based on
      subsequent need for revision, re-implantation or adjustment of shunt pressure. Then the
      investigators calculated the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value
      (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and overall accuracy.

      Introduction: Cerebrospinal fluid ventriculoperitoneal (V-P) shunts are often used in the
      treatment of hydrocephalus. Complications from shunts are not uncommon and can present with a
      variety of signs and symptoms, which could be evaluated by clinical examination and
      neuro-imaging. The radionuclide cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt study provides a simple,
      effective, and low-radiation-dose method of assessing CSF shunt patency. When a discrepancy
      between neurological examination and imaging, additional radionuclide shuntography can be
      helpful. The purpose of the study was to analyze in the imaging findings and clinical
      interpretation of a variety of shuntography results and to determine the applicability of
      shuntography in patients with suspected shunt malfunction.

      Materials and Methods: The investigators include all radionuclide shuntographic tests using
      (99m)technetium-pertechnetate (DTPA) performed between August 2005 and December 2015 in our
      department. No complications or discomfort were noted in the examinations. The results of
      shuntography were evaluated visually and qualitatively, and correlated with clinical
      follow-up. The tests were interpreted as normal and abnormal, including complete distal
      obstruction, partial distal obstruction or miscellaneous. Clinical outcomes within 30 days
      were defined based on subsequent need for revision, re-implantation or adjustment of shunt
      pressure. Then the investigators calculated the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive
      predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and overall accuracy. The
      investigators would also determine the correlation with operative findings and assessment of
      radionuclide shuntography.
