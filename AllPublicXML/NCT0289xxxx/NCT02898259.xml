      A Phase IB/II Trial of Lenalidomide (Revlimid®), Ixazomib and Rituximab (RIXAR) as Front-line
      Therapy for High Risk Indolent B cell Lymphoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of the combination of oral ixazomib and
      lenalidomide plus rituximab in patients with previously untreated low-grade B cell lymphoma
      having high tumor burden by GELF criteria or FLIPI 3-5

      Secondary:

        -  To determine overall response rate in an expanded cohort at the MTD for follicular
           lymphoma and for non-follicular low-grade B cell lymphoma

        -  Duration of response, time to progression, progression free survival, time to treatment
           failure and overall survival

        -  Create tissue microarray from paraffin embedded tissue for future studies.

        -  Assessment of baseline lymphocyte subsets as prognostic markers.

      Overview of Study Design:

      This study combines three classes of agents that have non-overlapping mechanisms of action
      and toxicity profiles, with each pair having demonstrated clinical evidence of benefit
      without unexpected toxicity. We use the lenalidomide-rituximab backbone, feasible and active
      in lymphoma, and add a novel oral proteasome inhibitor to potentially enhance efficacy,
      minimize toxicity and limit patient visits for treatment.

      Patients with previously untreated low-grade B cell lymphoma having high tumor burden by GELF
      criteria or FLIPI 3-5 will be treated with the combination of oral ixazomib + lenalidomide +
      rituximab.

      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicity of this
      regimen. The study will use a standard 3 + 3 design for determination of MTD during cycle 1.
      There will be three dose levels for escalation, followed by two expansion cohorts of 12
      patients each at the MTD, one cohort with follicular lymphoma and one cohort with
      non-follicular low-grade lymphoma (SLL, marginal zone, lymphoplasmacytic).

          -  Major surgery within 14 days before enrollment.

          -  Radiotherapy within 14 days before enrollment. If the involved field is small (single
             nodal area), 7 days will be considered a sufficient interval between treatment and
             beginning of protocol therapy.

          -  Known central nervous system involvement.

          -  Infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14
             days before study enrollment.

          -  Evidence of current uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including uncontrolled
             cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or
             myocardial infarction within the past 6 months.

          -  Systemic treatment, within 14 days before the beginning of protocol therapy, with
             CYP3A inducers (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenytoin,
             phenobarbital), or use of St. John's wort.

          -  Known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or excipients in the
             various formulations of any agent. Specifically, prior desquamating rash or erythema
             nodosum during prior thalidomide or other similar agents.

          -  Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the oral
             absorption or tolerance of ixazomib or lenalidomide including difficulty swallowing.

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years before study enrollment or
             previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any evidence of residual
             disease. Patients with non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of any type are
             not excluded if they have undergone complete resection.

          -  Patient has ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy on clinical examination during the
             screening period.

          -  Participation in other clinical trials, including those with other investigational
             agents not included in this trial, within 30 days of the start of this trial and
             throughout the duration of this trial.

          -  Any prior use of Revlimid® or Velcade®.

          -  Known seropositivity for, or active viral infection with, Human Immunodeficiency Virus
             (HIV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) (unless due to vaccination), or Hepatitis C Virus
             (HCV). HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with lenalidomide and
             ixazomib. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because lenalidomide has
             known teratogenic effects. Because there is an unknown, but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with lenalidomide,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with lenalidomide. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
