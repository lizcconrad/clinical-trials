    <textblock>
      Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is an acquired neuropathy
      characterized by an inflammatory multifocal segmental demyelination. Due to the clinical
      heterogeneity of this condition and the lack of specific marker that can reliably identify
      all patients, the diagnosis of CIDP remains difficult. Similarly, there are no clear factors
      predicting the evolution or the prognosis of the disease. Current treatments are the
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), corticoids and plasma exchange; IVIg therapy being the
      most commonly used. Responses of the patients to the treatments are variable. Thus, it is
      necessary to identify predictive markers of the therapeutic response of CIDP patients treated
      by IVIg.

      Several potential biomarkers have been proposed recently, but none of them has yet been
      validated as a predictive criterion for therapeutic response. It is therefore necessary to
      continue to investigate several biological parameters to identify a reliable biological
      marker.

      In electromyography, the Motor Unit Number Index (MUNIX) technique allows measuring the
      axonal loss by a precise count of functional motor units. This method, more sensitive than
      the measure of the Compound Muscle Action Potential (CMAP), is rarely used in CIDP. MUNIX
      might be a good tool to better characterize the patients and to follow the course of CIDP. It
      also might be a new sensitive and reliable marker predictive of the therapeutic response.

      Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) is increasingly used for the assessment of neuromuscular
      diseases. A recent study on CIDP patients reported a significant decrease of the muscle
      Magnetisation Transfer Ratio (MTR) compared to healthy subjects, correlated to clinical
      parameters. The use of advances MRI techniques could allow characterizing the structure and
      composition of muscle and nerve tissues of CIDP patients. It could also be a mean for
      identifying potential new markers, largely unexplored until now, that might be sensitive to
      disease course and/or IVIg response.

      The objective of this study is to identify predictive markers of the treatment response of
      CIDP patients receiving IVIg.

      This is a prospective observational exploratory study of a cohort of 30 CIDP patients treated
      with IVIg and followed-up during one year.
