  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), is a recent medical imaging technique where the X-rays
      are divergent, forming a cone.

      As a result, this technique is less irradiating that the scanner. The purpose of this
      exploratory study is to compare the performance of the scanner and the cone beam in the
      detection of anatomical structures of the ear.
