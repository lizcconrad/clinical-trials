      Phase I/II study enrolling up to 12 patients in a twelve-month, Open-label, Randomized,
      Parallel Active Control, Single and Repeat Dose, Dose-escalation Study of the Safety,
      Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK), Pharmacodynamics (PD) and Preliminary Efficacy of
      VAL-1221 Delivered Intravenously (IV) in Ambulatory and Ventilator-free Patients with
      Late-Onset GSD-II (Pompe Disease) Study

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will be enrolled in a consecutive manner and randomized to either treatment with
      VAL-1221 or positive control (rhGAA) in cohorts of 4 patients each:

      Part 1 Study Treatment:

      Cohort 1: VAL-1221 3 mg/kg IV (n=3) every other week or control (n=1) Cohort 2: VAL-1221 10
      mg/kg IV (n=3) every other week or control (n=1) Cohort 3: VAL-1221 30 mg/kg IV (n=3) every
      other week or control (n=1)

      Each patient randomized to VAL-1221 will receive 7 every other week IV infusions of VAL-1221
      over 12 weeks. VAL-1221 cohorts will be enrolled in a sequential fashion. Patients randomized
      to rhGAA will be maintained on their current dose and regimen of Myozyme or Lumizyme.

      The first patient in each cohort to receive VAL-1221 will be followed for any safety concerns
      (including infusion related reactions) for a minimum of 48 hours before the remaining
      VAL-1221-treated patients in the cohort receive infusions.

      Once all patients in a cohort have been enrolled and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
      has reviewed safety data from the first 2 infusions in all patients, the next cohort may
      begin enrollment and treatment. A final assessment will occur approximately 2 weeks after the
      last dose of VAL-1221 to collect additional safety data. Safety will be assessed continuously
      throughout the study.

      All patients who complete the study, including those maintained on rhGAA, will be offered
      inclusion in an extension study pending review of safety data by the DSMB and review and
      approval of the extension study by relevant authorities and ethics committees.

      Part 2 Study Design:

      Cohort 1 Patients Patients from Cohort 1 on Part 1of the study who were randomized to
      VAL-1221 will enter Part 2 of the study on the dose with which they were treated (3 mg/kg IV
      every other week). When all patients in Cohort 1 have completed dosing on Part 1 of the study
      and the DSMB has reviewed the Week 12 safety data from that study and determined that there
      are no significant safety issues, the control patient in Cohort 1 may begin treatment with
      VAL-1221 at a dose of 3 mg/kg IV every other week.

      Cohort 2 Patients Patients from Cohort 2 on Part 1 of the study who were randomized to
      VAL-1221 will enter Part 2 of the study on the dose with which they were treated (10 mg/kg IV
      every other week). When all patients in Cohort 2 have completed dosing in Part 1 of the study
      and the DSMB has reviewed the Week 12 safety data from that study and determined that there
      are no significant safety issues, the control patient in Cohort 2 may begin treatment with
      VAL-1221 at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV every other week.

      Cohort 3 Patients Patients from Cohort 3 on Part 1 of the study who were randomized to
      VAL-1221 will enter Part 2 of the study on the dose with which they were treated (30 mg/kg IV
      every other week). No dose increases are anticipated for Cohort 3.

      All patients who complete the study, including those maintained on rhGAA, will be offered
      inclusion in a further extension study pending review of safety data by the DSMB and review
      and approval of the extension study by relevant authorities and ethics committees.
