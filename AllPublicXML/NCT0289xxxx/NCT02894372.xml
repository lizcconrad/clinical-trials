      The purpose of the study was to assess the effectiveness of Faringomoss in reducing the
      throat discomfort and pain in patients with acute throat diseases and postoperative patients
      after throat surgeries.

      Study objectives were:

        1. To asses the symptoms of throat pain and discomfort after pharyngeal surgery in early
           postoperative period.

        2. To evaluate those symptoms also in outpatient subjects with acute throat pain and
           discomfort.

        3. To compare the data of different groups of patients who had received the topical throat
           spray with the placebo group.

        4. To estimate the gender, age and surgery impact on the results.

        5. To record the side effects of the topical sprays.

      Patients were selected from Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Ear-Nose-Throat
      department and Vita Longa Clinic outpatients.

      In random order research participants got a topical spray to use for 7 days after the surgery
      or from the start of acute throat infection. Neither the patient nor the investigator did not
      know if it was the medical device (Faringomoss) or the placebo. All the participants got a
      standard care and treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

      The intent was to investigate about 70 - 80 subjects.

      All the research subjects were tested using objective methods.

      The confidentiality of the participation was guaranteed. The names were anonymous. The
      results were summarized.

      Faringomoss is a topical spray, approved as a medical device. It is not harmful because it is
      made of vegetable oils.
