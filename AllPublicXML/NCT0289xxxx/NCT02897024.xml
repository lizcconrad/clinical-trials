  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ACHIEVE study is a comparison of the effectiveness of 2 intensities of physical therapy
      treatment for children with Cerebral Palsy in an outpatient physical therapy setting. High
      intensity periodic is 2 hours of focused and high intense treatment per weekday for 4 weeks.
      In comparison, usual weekly is considered standard of care; although both dosing models are
      used clinically for children with CP.

      The overall goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of high intense periodic and
      usual weekly therapy in treating Cerebral Palsy (CP) in children 2-8 years of age for motor
      rehabilitation. In this prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), 300 children ages 2 to
      8 years of age with CP will be enrolled and assigned to one of 2 service delivery models: 1
      hour per day, 1 x per week for 40 weeks (usual weekly); and 2 hours every weekday for two
      10-consecutive-weekdays (total 4 weeks), for a repeated &quot;periodic&quot; bout (high intense
      periodic). All patients enrolled in ACHIEVE will also have 1 hour per month of Physical
      Therapy Consultation (PTC) during the treatment period of 40 weeks (9 months). PTCs provide
      monthly motor skill monitoring, consultation, and home therapy program progression. Outcome
      evaluations will be performed by blinded evaluators at baseline (month 0, before treatment),
      month 9 for all patients to assess short term effects, and at months 12 and 18 for patients
      to assess long term effects. Parent surveys will be collected at 0, 4.5, and 9 months only
      (PC-2). Short-term and long-term effects will be analyzed to determine individual differences
      in children's response to intensity.

    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment) and 9 months 12 months, and 18 months following initiation of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>GAS creates patient, family, and clinical anchors as the external criterion for improvement by establishing activity or participation goals that reflect what an individual, family, and clinician consider meaningful or relevant.The GAS method allows for goals to be defined at different levels of mastery and assigned numerical values for score calculation, similar to a Likert scale. The scale will have 5 points representing different levels of mastery of the individual patient's goal. A score of -2 represents baseline, -1 less change than expected, 0 for the expected level of change, and +1 and +2 for achievement of more change than expected. To attempt to ensure ordinality, each level on the scale will be described and will reflect a single dimension of change that is measureable, achievable, and relevant</description>

    <description>Administered as a parent survey. The PEDI is a descriptive measure of a child's current functional performance and can track changes over time. The PEDI measures both capability and performance of functional activities in three content domains: self-care, mobility, and social function.It can be used as a comprehensive clinical assessment of key functional capabilities and performance in children between the ages of six months and seven years.</description>
