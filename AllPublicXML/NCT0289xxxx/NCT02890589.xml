    <description>The SYNERGY™ stent is a Device marked CE (European Conformity), platinum chromium coronary stent, currently developped by Boston Scientific™. This stent has been designed with the goal of providing optimal and rapid healing within the vessel using a bioabsorbable polymer to elute everolimus.</description>

    <description>The ABSORB Everolimus-eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS 1.1, Abbott Vascular, California, USA, CE approved) is Device marked CE, currently the most studied PLA (Polylactic acid) based scaffold. It consists of PLLA (Poly I-lactic acid) backbone with 1:1 PDLLA (Poly-DL Lactic Acid) drug surface coating and a total strut thickness of 156 μm.</description>
