      RATIONALE:

      The previous study resulted that the gait training using Functional Electrical Stimulation
      (FES) improved the ankle joint function and the walking ability for the chronic stroke
      patients with foot drop.

      In addition, the further exploratory study in multicenter obtained the result that the
      training with WA were especially good adaptation to the patients who have slight paralysis
      and can walk independently.

      PURPOSE:

      This multicenter prospective trial is studying to reveal whether the gait training with the
      WalkAide[R](WA) for chronic stroke patients who can walk independently is superior to gait
      training with a physical therapist.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To reveal whether gait training with the WA for chronic stroke patients who can walk
      independently (Functional Ambulation Classification [FAC] 5 or 6) is superior to gait
      training with a physical therapist.

      OUTLINE:

      This is a multicenter study. Patients continue gait training with WA or without WA for 4
      weeks. The effect of rehabilitation is evaluated by 6 Minute Walk Test without device.

             according to the Brunnstrom stage

          -  3)Patients whose spasticity of the plantar flexor muscle is estimated at 2 or less
             according to the Modified Ashworth Scale

          -  4)Patients whose ankle dorsiflexion range of motion is 0 degree or more

          -  7)Patients who agree to participate in this study and provide their written informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1)Patients whose ankle dorsiflexion is not induced by the WA due to peripheral
             neuropathy

          -  2)Patients who are contraindicated for the WA (e.g., patients with a metallic implant
             or implantable medical electrical equipment such as a cardiac pacemaker, and patients
             with a previous or suspected history of seizure)

          -  3)Patients who underwent Botox treatment in the lower extremities within 3 months of
             this study registry

          -  4)Patients who have nervous system (excluding stroke), cardio-respiratory system, or
             musculoskeletal system disorders, which may affect gait and training

          -  5)Patients who had fallen down within a week prior to the registry and are regarded to

               -  Definition of an alteration

                    1. Brunnstrom stage for the lower extremity: Confirm whether the stages of the
                       prior and initial assessments are the same value. If these stages are
                       different, this is considered to be an alteration, and the patient with this
                       alteration should be excluded from the study.

                    2. Lower extremity subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment: Confirm whether the
                       change in the score between the prior and initial assessments is 5 or less.
                       If the change is 6 or more, then this is considered to be an alteration, and
                       the patient with this alteration should be excluded from the study.

                    3. Functional Ambulation Classification: Confirm whether the categories of the
                       prior and initial assessments are the same value. If these categories are
                       different, then this is considered to be an alteration, and the patient with
                       this alteration should be excluded from the study.
