  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to conduct a study protocol to investigate the effects of repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) on sensory and motor performance of individuals with
      incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) . A double-blind randomized sham-controlled trial of
      patients with iSCI will be conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective rehabilitation programs for individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI)
      are required either in the acute or in the post-acute care. Rehabilitation techniques based
      on protocols that selectively stimulate specific pathways along the central nervous system
      have been considered effective in enhancing neurologic recovery thereby improving functional
      abilities. The rationale relies on the assumption that the stimulation of the corticospinal
      tract, primary motor cortex, and spinal cord might induce neuronal reorganization of
      structures that are largely involved in the control of voluntary movements. In this line of
      reasoning, protocols involving repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have been
      found effective in enhancing corticospinal synaptic transmission, attenuating neuropathic
      pain, improving spasticity and sensorimotor function after iSCI. However, controversial
      findings have also been reported, as other studies showed unaltered central pain, as well as
      cortical excitability and sensorimotor function. The lack of consistent results is probably
      associated with differences in stimulation parameters, number of sessions, site of
      stimulation, chronicity and levels of injury, and outcome measurements of the previous
      studies. Thus, it is clear that there are remaining gaps in our knowledge and the development
      of new studies, preferably prospective fully double-blind placebo-controlled trials, is
      necessary to complement the current knowledge about the effects of rTMS in patients with
      iSCI.

    <description>The ASIA Motor Score is derived from part of the assessment for the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. It involves testing the strength of ten key muscles on each side of the body in the supine position (e.g., elbow flexors, wrist extensors, hip flexors, quadriceps, dorsiflexors) on a scale of 0 = no contraction to 5 = normal resistance through full range of motion. Scores are summed to give a total possible score of 50 for the upper extremities and 50 for the lower extremities.</description>

    <description>The ASIA Sensory score is also part of the assessment for the International Standard for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury. It involves testing pinprick and light touch sensation at key points representing each dermatome. Pin-prick and light-touch sensation of each dermatome is separately scored on a 3-point scale (0, 1 and 2). Scores will be summed to give a total possible score of 224 where a higher score indicates better sensation than a lower score.</description>
