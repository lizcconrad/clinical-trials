  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the most common non-traumatic cause of neurologic disability in
      young adults, affects mobility and ambulation in the majority of patients. Nearly 50% of
      persons with MS will require an assistive device to ambulate within 10 years of diagnosis. A
      subgroup of MS is Primary Progressive MS, which manifests with gait disturbances over 80% of
      patients in the long term. In addition to altered gait, nearly 70% of patients will
      experience cognitive deficits during the course of the disease. Therefore, actions that
      facilitate patient involvement in finding solutions for personalized management of disease
      and disability are needed.

      Although immunomodulatory drugs offer some benefit in other types of Multiple Sclerosis,
      there is currently no effective treatment for Primary Progressive MS. A fundamental goal in
      the management of persons with MS is to maximize their ability to ambulate and perform safe
      and effective transfers in everyday life.

      In the last decade, research has increasingly centered on the effects of robot devices in the
      rehabilitation of patients with neurological diseases. This has led to the development of new
      robot-assisted gait devices engendered by virtual-reality systems, and several studies have
      demonstrated the positive effects that these devices have on gait endurance and quality of
      life in patients with neurological diseases and disability.

      The aim of this project is to develop and study the effects of a novel, cognitively intensive
      virtual-reality -based rehabilitation software application that simulates a real-world
      environment where a person can walk. The virtual-reality application is an upgrade version
      synchronized to a robotic device, the GEO System. The second aim is to compare the cognitive
      and motor effects of robot-assisted gait training with this application against training with
      robot-assisted gait training without virtual reality.

      The experimental group will receive robot-assisted gait training with the virtual-reality
      application and the control group will receive robot-assisted gait training All subjects will
      undergo training for 6 weeks (2 sessions/week) for a total of 12 sessions. Assessments before
      training, after training, and at follow-up will be performed using clinical and instrumental
      tests to compare the effects of training.

      Successful completion of the study may help patients to alleviate the impact of disability,
      increase their independence in activities of daily life, and improve their quality of life.
      Through new rehabilitative strategies that combine cognitive and motor training involving
      higher brain functions and motivation, patients will be stimulated to walk in a reality-based
      environment.

    <description>Tower of London assesses deficits in planning abilities and strategic problem solving. Two pictures are shown to the subject. Each picture shows three different colored balls arranged in different positions on three pegs. The subject has to transpose the three balls, starting from an initial position, to reach various final positions in a specific number of moves. The task comprises 12 problems with different target positions. For each problem, the participant earns three points if a solution is reached in only one attempt, two points if the solution is reached in two attempts, one point if the solution is reached in three attempts, and zero points if the solution is not reached in three attempts (range 0-36; higher scores=better performance)</description>
