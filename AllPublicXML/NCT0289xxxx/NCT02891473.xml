    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a rehabilitative approach using
      breathing and relaxation techniques, and specifically the elongation of the latissimus dorsi
      muscle according to the Mézières Method to improve balance and posture and relief pain in
      patients with Parkinson's disease.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Berg Balance Scale (BBS) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a widely used clinical tests to evaluate static and dynamic balance of a subject. The total score is 56 (&gt; 45 safe walking without aids/low tendency to fall, &gt; 35 safe walking with aids). The test lasts 15-20 minutes, and includes 14 simple tasks. The success in achieving each task is evaluated assigned a score from zero (dependent) to four (independent), and the final measure is the sum of all scores. The scale is considered the gold standard for providing useful information on the predictive estimation of the risk of falls.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a scale for the assessment of pain and it's based on a ten point scale, where 0 means no pain and 10 the greatest pain ever both at rest and during movements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of six parts made up of questions about the mental state, behavior and mood, ADL, motor functions, the complications of the advanced disease, the stage of the disease identified by the Hoehen and Yahr scale and the modification in the execution of the ADL trough the scale of Schwab and England. The scale is based on a metric scale from 0 (no disability) to 147 points (severe disability).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 10-items scale that measures walking balance activity and it was developed from the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI) to improve reliability and decrease the ceiling effect. Each item is scored on a 3 point-scale from 0 (severe impairment) to 3 (normal deambulation). The highest possible score is 30 (normal gait function).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Clinical Evaluation of Posture from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is the evaluation of the anterior flexion of the trunk by measuring the distance fingers-floor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of Modified Parkinson Activity Scale (MPAS) from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>consists of 14 items arranged into three domains, chair transfer, gait akinesia and bed mobility. Scores range from 0 (dependent) to 4 (normal) and the total possible score is 56.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire from baseline to 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is a multi-dimensional questionnaire for the evaluation of health status. It is divided into eight sub-categories that measure physical activity, limitations due to physical health and emotional state, physical pain, the perception of general health, vitality, social activities, mental health and changes in health status and two indices that summarize the overall assessment of the subject with respect to his/her physical (ISF) and mental (ISM) health.</description>

    <description>Sessions of home based exercises performed by the patients at their domicile after a training session about the exercise program made by a physiotherapy. The exercises aimed at promoting trunk control in static and dynamic position according to the specific guidelines for Parkinson's disease and proprioceptive exercises for the recovery of balance. An illustrated exercises booklet was given to the patient.</description>
