  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the perspective to better evaluate the efficacy of new treatment strategies for Alzheimer
      disease (AD), it appears important to develop experimental paradigms to precisely measure
      cognitive endpoints/biomarkers that may be used in healthy volunteers as tools to validate
      drug efficacy profile.

      The use of Electroencephalography (EEG) may be, therefore, a good candidate. The purpose of
      the present study is to use EEG to more precisely explore cognitive processes in healthy
      subjects, with a particular interest in episodic and working memory functions that are
      usually altered in both AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) as well as to better
      understand underlying neural mechanisms involved in these processes.
