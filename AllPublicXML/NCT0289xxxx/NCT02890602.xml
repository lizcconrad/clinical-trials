    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ⅱ study of erythropoietin for management of anemia caused by chemotherapy in
      patients with Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma. The investigators want to investigate
      hematopoietic response of darbepoietin alfa and the quality of life assessment of
      increasement of hemoglobin.

    <textblock>
      Darbepoietin alfa may cause the body to make more red blood cells. They are used to treat
      anemia caused by chemotherapy in patients with malignant lymphoma. Darbepoietin will be
      applied to R-CHOP(Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, Vincristine, Prednisolone)
      chemotherapy every 21days ± 2days with fixed 360㎍. It will be applied to chemotherapy until
      increment of hemoglobin 12.0g/dL. If the hemoglobin level exceeds 12.0g/dL, administration of
      darbepoietin will be temporarily stopped.

      And, the questionnaire of the quality of life will be conducted at the baseline, after 2th
      darbepoietin alfa administration, at study completion.
