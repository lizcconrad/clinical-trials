  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies how well ibrutinib and nivolumab work in treating patients
      with previously-treated kidney cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Ibrutinib
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Giving Ibrutinib and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with
      metastatic kidney cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To assess in a preliminary fashion the feasibility and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination
      with nivolumab in patients with previously-treated metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      To evaluate the safety of the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in patients with
      previously treated mRCC.
