      The purpose of this research study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      effectiveness of the use of a mobile pharmacist-led intervention that incorporates home BP
      monitoring and medication reminders with patients recruited from a primary care setting, as
      well as identify challenges and potential solutions to broader implementation of a mobile
      pharmacist-led home-based BP monitoring intervention in primary care clinics through key
      stakeholder interviews.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a smart phone compatible with mobile intervention

          -  Have been previously diagnosed with hypertension

          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 and/or diastolic blood
             pressure &gt; 90 on repeat measurement)

          -  Be under the care of a primary care physician at the recruitment clinic

          -  Be taking at least one antihypertensive medication

          -  Be English speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under the care of a clinical pharmacist for hypertension management, or under
             the care of a cardiologist

          -  Pregnant patients and anyone with the following unrelated, but serious medical
             conditions will also be excluded, as they may make blood pressure control difficult or
             necessitate frequent hospitalization: previous diagnosis of resistant hypertension;
             steroid dependent asthma or emphysema; cirrhosis or hepatic failure; stage C or D
             chronic heart failure; stage IV or V chronic kidney disease; and cancer (terminal or
             undergoing active chemotherapeutic or radiation therapy)

          -  Patients with other serious medical conditions (e.g., stroke, dementia) that may
             affect their ability to self-monitor blood pressure
