  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a haematological malignant disease characterized by an
      uncontrolled proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells. Over the last two decades,
      clinical trials have demonstrated an improved response rate in younger adult AML. Aggressive
      induction plus more potent intensification programs with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy
      plus stem cell transplantation (SCT) has improved treatment results. Advances in
      understanding disease biology, improvements in induction and consolidation program, and
      better supportive care have also all contributed. A number of clinical and laboratory
      characteristics influence the response to treatment and, thus, the survival of patients with
      AML. Among them, cytogenetic at diagnosis represents the most important prognostic variable.
      However, other factors may have a prognostic value and may influence patient's outcome.

      Anaemia and thrombocytopenia are cardinal manifestations of AML. Over the last decades, it
      has become apparent that the frequency of allogeneic blood transfusions can modify host
      immunity and clinical outcomes. Anaemia has long been recognized as an adverse prognostic
      factor in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which represents a pre-leukemic disease. Red blood
      cell (RBC) transfusion need was identified as a strong and independent risk factor for
      survival in MDS, for which the presence and severity of anaemia were attributed to a clonally
      advanced and biologically more aggressive disease.

      Based on these data, we retrospectively assessed the prognostic value of RBC and platelet
      transfusions at the time of diagnosis and the frequency of transfusions during the first
      induction course of chemotherapy in a large unselected group of patients with previously
      untreated AML.

        An observational, longitudinal, and retrospective study was conducted in 1067 patients (&gt;15
        years of age) fulfilling the clinical and laboratory criteria for diagnosis of AML.
        Patients were admitted at the Lyon University Hospital over two decades (fromMarch 1985 to
        December 2006) and enrolled onto 12 successive therapeutic trials according to age and time
        of enrollment. Diagnosis of AML was based on smears of bone marrow aspirates. Leukemic
        cells were classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria. FAB M3 AMLs
        were not included in the study. AML with 20 % or more myeloid marrow blasts, either de novo
        or evolving from a MDS, was eligible in the absence of (i)World Health Organization (WHO)
        performance status &gt;2; (ii) left ventricular systolic ejection fraction below the normal
        range; (iii) a creatinine or hepatic enzyme levels &gt;2 ULN, except ifAML-related; and (iv)
        uncontrolled severe infection. All participants gave their written informed consent
