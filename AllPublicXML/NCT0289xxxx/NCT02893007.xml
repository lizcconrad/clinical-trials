  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family interventions have been emphasized in the treatment of BPD and have benefits for
      patients' symptoms and health; however, the effects of family interventions on family
      function and caregivers' health-related outcomes have not been well investigated. This
      randomized controlled trial with 47 hospitalized patient-with-BPD/family-caregiver dyads at a
      medical center in northern Taiwan compared the effects of a brief family-centered care (BFCC)
      program with treatment-as-usual (TAU). The findings support both the feasibility of using the
      BFCC program for inpatients and its specific benefits for family function. An intensive
      family intervention during hospitalization has been suggested in psychiatric practice to
      support patients with BPD and family caregivers.

      All of the family caregivers in two groups were invited to attend a routine 60-minute family
      discussion group about violence and suicide prevention. The TAU group without specific family
      interview for patient and family caregiver dyad. In the BFCC group, four 90-minute BFCC
      program sessions were additionally provided twice a week for each hospitalized family dyad.
      It was hypothesized that family caregivers in the BFCC group could primary increase their
      family function, and secondary improve perceived health status and reduce caregiver's burdens
      compared to the TAU. The results showed family caregivers in the BFCC group significant time
      group interaction effects in overall family function (p=0.03) and subscale-conflict (p=0.04),
      communication (p=0.01), and problem solving (p=0.04), but there were no significant
      interaction effects on the caregivers' perceived health status and caregiver's burdens.

    <description>The Brief family-centered care (BFCC) program was developed and provided for hospitalized patients with BPD and their family caregivers.The BFCC protocol is outlined as 4 treatment sessions, specific goals, and example questions. Four 90-minute in-depth sessions for each dyad were initially held in a quiet interview room to assess family function, then to provide information about BPD, to support and empower the dyads to change communication styles and resolve conflicts, and to sustain or improve family function in the cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains.</description>

    <description>The therapist provided the 4-session BFCC program twice a week for each dyad. The core principles treated family as a single unit and provided individually tailored interventions to improve family function through psychoeducation, social and emotional support, and actively raising questions to facilitate constructive awareness and changes. It was initially held to assess family function, then to provide information about BPD, to support and empower the dyads to change communication styles and resolve conflicts, and to sustain or improve family function in the cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains.</description>
