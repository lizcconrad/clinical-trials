  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is 5th leading cause of cancer-related death in Korea. It has a dismal
      prognosis with very low 5-year survival rate, about 5%. Only 10% of pancreatic cancer
      patients is diagnosed in operable status. So, most of patients could not be treated with
      curative resection.

      Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is defined by defined as surgically unresectable
      due to vascular encasement (e.g. celiac trunk or superior mesenteric artery) by tumor, but
      have no evidence of distant metastases. In LAPC patients, systemic chemotherapy with/without
      radiotherapy was used as a standard therapy, but therapeutic response was very poor. Only
      less than 30% of patients showed treatment response, and median survival of LAPC patient was
      only 9 months. Thus, more effective treatment modality is needed for LAPC patients.

      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a soft tissue ablation technique using ultra short but
      strong electrical fields to create permanent and hence lethal nanopores in the cell membrane,
      to disrupt the cellular homeostasis. IRE does not cause thermally induced necrosis and has
      tissue selectivity, so adjacent tissue or vascular structures can be preserved.

      Several clinical trials using IRE were performed to liver, kidney or lung cancer patients. We
      will operate IRE procedure to LAPC patients who were previously received standard therapy but
      showed no response, using NanoKnife IRE device. We will investigate treatment response and
      safety of IRE.

    <description>IRE is operated to tumor under laparotomy or CT-guided percutaneous approach. Unipolar (19G) or bipolar (16G) electrode probe is inserted to around tumor. After insertion of probe, short duration (70-90„é≤) of electric current (25~45A) is generated by IRE device (NanoKnife IRE device, AngioDynamics, Queens bury, New York). It is possible to obtain a three-dimensional ablation zone using multiple electrode. IRE can cause apoptosis of tumor cells, without adjacent tissue damage.</description>
