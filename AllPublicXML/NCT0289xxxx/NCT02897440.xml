  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort study to compare full repairing and partial repairing of soft tissue
      surrounding the hip joint in anteriorolateral approaching arthroplasty concerning hip
      function. Patients admitted with a femoral neck fracture operated with a hip arthroplasty
      through an anteriorolateral approach were screened for inclusion. Patients with altered
      mental status SPMSQ &lt;7, pathological fractures, non-walkers were excluded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and non of the exclusion criteria were followed 2
      months postoperatively by clinical examination. Sample size were estimated to 15 patients in
      each group. Primary outcome variables were trendelenburg test, abductor strength measured
      with dynamometry. Secondary outcome variables were WOMAC, EQ-5D, and VAS scores.
