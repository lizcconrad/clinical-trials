    <textblock>
      This is a research study about monitoring diuresis in acute respiratory failure. Often,
      patients with respiratory failure have fluid building up in the lungs, which means less
      oxygen can reach the blood stream, which deprives the organs of oxygen. Managing the amount
      of intravenous fluids is crucial to the treatment of respiratory failure. Diuresis, the
      increased formation of urine by the kidney, is one way that fluid balance is maintained.
      Previous studies of respiratory failure suggest that diuretic therapy may be beneficial in a
      group of patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, (ARDS), which is a severe type of
      respiratory failure. Although protocols exist for managing fluid status in ARDS, all of them
      require invasive monitoring using a central venous catheter. This study will compare central
      venous catheter-guided diuresis to ultrasound-guided diuresis. Participants in this study
      will be randomized into one of three treatment arms:

        -  Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial-lite (FACTT-Lite) diuresis arm

        -  Echocardiography diuresis arm

        -  Central venous pressure &quot;CVP&quot; diuresis arm This research study will assess differences
           in clinical outcomes, number of ventilator free days, ICU free days, 60 day mortality,
           and incidence of acute kidney injury or new shock between the three treatment arms.

      The objective of this study is to compare two different central venous catheter guided
      protocols for diuresis to an ultrasound guided protocol for diuresis. The specific aims are:
      1) to compare the cumulative fluid balance over seven days among the groups; 2) to determine
      if the ultrasound protocol increases the number of ventilator free days and ICU-free days;
      and if it decreases 60-day mortality, incidence of acute kidney injury, or incidence of new
      shock; and if it speeds resolution of pulmonary edema; 3) to document the clinical situations
      and specific decisions where catheter guided diuresis and echocardiography guided diuresis
      recommend a different management decision.

      The study is a randomized control trial, comparing three treatment arms. The investigators
      will treat intubated patients from identification of hypoxemic respiratory failure, including
      ARDS, with one of three diuresis strategies for seven consecutive days. Their post-study
      course will be monitored for a period of 60-days or until death. The patients randomized to
      the &quot;FACTT-Lite&quot; guided diuresis arm will be treated using the Fluid and Catheter Treatment
      Trial-Lite (FACTT-Lite) protocol and will be used as the control group. The patients
      randomized to the echocardiography, or &quot;Echo&quot;, diuresis arm will be treated using a protocol
      developed for use in this study using daily or twice daily echocardiographic and ultrasound
      measurements. The patients randomized to the central venous pressure, or &quot;CVP&quot;, arm will be
      diuresed using a protocol similar to the &quot;Echo&quot; arm, substituting the central venous pressure
      threshold from FACTT-lite. Echocardiographic and catheter based markers of volume status will
      be compared following the study.

Following initial evaluation, at set times spaced every four hours apart, patients will have a central venous pressure transduced and the prior hour's urinary output will be used to determine placement in one of the FACTT-lite's protocol grid.</description>
