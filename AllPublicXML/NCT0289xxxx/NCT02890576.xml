  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients with cochlear implants increases every year, constituting an active
      queue increasingly important (60 new cases per year in Toulouse, active list in 2013: 380
      adult patients). The number of approved cochlear implant centers is limited by guardianships,
      and corresponds to the Hospitals University. It is not possible to create networks of
      correspondents. Teams of implantation centers must meet the needs of new patients and ensure
      continuity of care for patients already implanted: speech therapy monitoring, adjustment and
      rehabilitation.

      In case of malfunction of the implant, patients use in first-line reference center. The
      increasing number of patients leads to a lack of specialized teams that can not meet the
      demands of patients in a timely manner, while continuing to provide support for new patients.
      It is therefore necessary to find solutions to improve the service provided to patients who
      received a cochlear implant system to respond quickly and effectively to the request of
      troubled patients, while optimizing the workload of the teams . The introduction of a
      telemedicine platform is expected to achieve these goals, distinguishing minor malfunctions,
      not requiring a consultation in a center, and the most complex situations requiring
      consultation in a center.

      The strategy of the study is to establish contact with the patient at home in case of
      problems through the establishment of a daily continuously in service by telephone contact
      and video calling.

      There will be no change in the usual care of the patient. The monitoring center by health
      professionals (speech therapists, technicians and doctors ORL) in the cochlear implant center
      will operate a daily permanence of 5 half days on business days, to respond to a patient
      call.

      Are excluded from this research, emergency management such as meningitis, which passes
      through the usual emergency lane.
