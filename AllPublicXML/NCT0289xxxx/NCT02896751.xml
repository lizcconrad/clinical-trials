  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot study to look at the feasibility of creating a customized sleep mask
      for use with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) or other similar treatments for sleep
      apnea. The participant will have three dimensional (3D) pictures of the face taken by special
      cameras. The pictures will be sent to a 3D printer and a mask will be created based on the
      participant's face contours. The participant will use the mask for about 6 months. The study
      will measure the amount it is used during sleep and if there is an increase in reported
      comfort.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to improve adherence and effectiveness of noninvasive ventilation by
      decreasing the side effects commonly seen with noninvasive ventilation. Studies have shown
      that even though noninvasive ventilation (NIV) with positive airway pressure (PAP) is
      successful at treating obstructive sleep apnea and hypoventilation, individuals have poor
      compliance with therapy. The reasons for poor compliance are numerous, but one significant
      and continually reported reason is poor mask fit. A poor mask fit is not only uncomfortable,
      but frequently causes side effects such as dry eyes, congestion, skin irritation and
      breakdown, and ineffective ventilation from inadequate pressures due to air leaking around
      the mask. Pediatric patients tend to be especially difficult to fit with conventional masks
      because of their smaller facial features and the lack of masks developed for pediatric use.

      In this study, patients will be fitted with a custom made NIV mask following facial imaging
      with a 3D camera (Artec 3D Scanner). The facial image will be used to construct an NIV mask
      model using computer design software that will then be created by using a 3D printer.
