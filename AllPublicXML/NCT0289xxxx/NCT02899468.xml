  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a novel virtual
      reality (VR) therapeutic rehabilitative device (BrightBrainerTM) to treat patients with
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). These patients, service members with TBI, can be both with and
      without upper limb dysfunction and use uni- and bimanual virtual reality (VR) exercises to
      improve cognitive and motor function, as well as mood.

      Bright Cloud International Corp created BrightBrainer, a computerized virtual reality system
      that provides a combination of cognitive as well as motor skill training in an engaging and
      repetitive manner [1]. This project objective is to assess the feasibility and clinical
      benefit of utilizing the BBVR to augment the rehabilitation of service members with TBI. The
      BrightBrainerTM Virtual Reality (BBVR) Rehabilitation System is unique because it is designed
      to provide integrative, customized, intensive and self-guided therapy that simultaneously
      addresses the cognitive, emotive and motor deficits. Early evidence suggests that it has been
      effective for patients with cognitive deficits as the result of cerebrovascular accident or
      dementia, but has not yet been evaluated in a therapeutic intervention for patients with TBI.
      In addition to assessing the system's effect on patient's symptoms, we will also evaluate the
      feasibility of utilizing this system in a military environment by obtaining feedback from the
      patients and therapists, regarding system acceptance, reliability and ease of use.

For the purpose of this study, subjects will be presented with two boxes and asked to perform the assessment bilaterally.</description>

    <description>During the active treatment stage (3 sessions per week x 6 weeks), each BBVR therapy session will consist of a series of custom games targeting one or several cognitive domains of executive function, attention, short-term memory, working memory and language comprehension. In addition, the BBVR device incorporates uni- and bi-manual activities by having the subject manipulate hand-held devices, which are programmed to measure in real time the subject's 3D hand movement and index flexion/extension. Therefore, in addition to completing the cognitive tasks, subjects must manipulate virtual hands through a hand-held interface to also enhance visual-motor perception, hand-eye coordination, and upper limb function. In addition, wrist weights can be added to increase upper limb strength training.</description>
