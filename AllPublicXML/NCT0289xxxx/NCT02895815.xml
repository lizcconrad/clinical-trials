  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CNTO 2476 cells
      administered into the subretinal space by the suprachoroidal surgical approach and the
      subretinal access kit (SRAK-02) in participants with visual acuity impairment associated with
      Geographic Atrophy (GA) secondary to Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single subretinal
      administration of CNTO 2476 compared with the untreated control group, as well as to assess
      the safety and usability profile of the procedure and the device for cell therapy delivery in
      participants with visual acuity impairment associated with Geographic Atrophy (GA) secondary
      to Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). The duration of participation in the study for
      each participant is approximately 3 years. Efficacy will be evaluated at 6 month, 12 months
      and every 6 month thereafter. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.
