  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) is the third most common cause of cancer death in men. Most patients
      with localized PC will be cured with surgery or radiation therapy, but up to 35% of patients
      will have their PC return. Whether it has returned locally or distantly determines which type
      of treatment they will receive. Current conventional imaging modalities have limitations
      particularly at low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. This study proposes to use
      Fluorine-18-2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pen
      tanedioic acid (18F-DCFPyL) Positron Emission Tomography / Computer Tomography (PET/CT) scans
      which targets prostate-specific membrane antigens (PSMA) to detect where in the body the PC
      has recurred.

      This is a prospective single cohort study to evaluate the diagnostic utility of 18F-DCFPyL
      PET/CT in detecting sites of recurrent prostate cancer, in patients who have negative or
      equivocal findings on conventional imaging. Eligible subjects will undergo a 18F-DCFPyL
      PET/CT at the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) - Vancouver Centre.

      18F-DCFPyL- Each subject will receive an 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan at the BCCA - Vancouver
      Centre, as part of this research study. Each study subject will receive a bolus intravenous
      dose of 18F-DCFPyL. The subject will rest in a comfortable chair for 120 minutes and will
      then be taken to the PET/CT scanner for images. The PET/CT scan will take approximately three
      hours extra of patient time above and beyond the time needed for standard of care.

      Medical History Questionnaire- Demographic and medical history data will be collected either
      in person before the PET scan appointment or by mail or phone, whichever is the most
      convenient to the subject.

      Follow-up assessments- Positive 18F-DCFPyL findings should be investigated and correlated
      with other imaging modalities and/or biopsy whenever possible. These additional procedures
      are left at the discretion of the referring physician for the clinical management of their
      patient, and will not be mandated by the study. The results of such investigations will be
      captured during the follow-up period, to verify the accuracy of 18F-DCFPyL findings.

      24 hour follow-up All subjects will be requested to either return to the functional imaging
      department approximately 24 hours (acceptable range 16-28 hours) after the injection of
      18F-DCFPyL or agree to be contacted by phone. The subjects will be asked if they experienced
      any undesirable effects following the administration of 18F-DCFPyL, or in the intervening 24
      hours. The local site attending nuclear medicine physician will then make an assessment as to
      whether these effects are likely related to 18F-DCFPyL administration.

      12, and 24 and 36 month follow-up All subjects will receive up to three clinical follow-up
      evaluations at 12, 24 and 36 months following the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT exam to assess the
      presence of recurrence, once presence of recurrence is confirmed follow-up will be
      discontinued. The evaluation will include a chart review of available imaging, laboratory
      tests, and treatment along with review of any symptoms. The data required can be obtained
      from a review of the patient's paper and electronic charts, supplemented by telephone contact
      as needed to complete the information. The treating oncologist will fill out a survey to
      determine the clinical impact of the 18F-DCFPyL on clinical managements. This will be
      categorized into 'minor' (change in treatment site or dose) or 'major' (change in treatment
      modality).

        The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic utility of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in
        identifying sites of prostate cancer recurrence where conventional imaging has been
        negative or equivocal. Concordance with histology, imaging or follow up will be assessed.
        This study will also assess the clinical impact of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT on patient management.
