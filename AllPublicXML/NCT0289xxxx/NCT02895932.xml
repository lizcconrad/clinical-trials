      The purpose of this study is to determine if changes in brain serotonin affects the
      accumulation of amyloid in the brain. The investigators will use brain imaging methods to
      measure the amount of serotonin and amyloid in the brain of individuals with Parkinson's
      Disease (PD) and otherwise healthy older people. PD participants will undergo repeat brain
      imaging to assess amyloid accumulation two years after their first brain imaging session. All
      participants will undergo examinations to assess their motor function, and asked questions to
      assess their mood and thinking.

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common problem of older people often causing significant
      problems with thinking and memory. Abnormal accumulation within in the brain of a protein
      called amyloid is felt to contribute to impaired thinking and memory in PD. Excessive
      accumulation of this protein is also involved in Alzheimer disease (AD) and may influence
      thinking and memory in otherwise healthy older people. Recent evidence suggests that changes
      in the amount of another brain chemical, serotonin, influences the amount of amyloid
      accumulating in the brains of people with PD and otherwise healthy older people. The purpose
      of this study is to determine if changes in brain serotonin affects the accumulation of
      amyloid in the brain. The investigators use brain imaging methods to measure the amount of
      serotonin and amyloid in the brain of individuals with PD and otherwise healthy older people.
      PD participants will undergo repeat brain imaging to assess amyloid accumulation 2 years
      after their first brain imaging session. All participants will undergo examinations to assess
      their motor function, and asked questions to assess their mood and thinking.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons who have been diagnosed with Parkinson disease age 45 years and older are
             eligible to participate in this study.

          -  Healthy older individuals (ages 60-80) without neurologic problems are eligible to
             participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals using some drugs cannot participate. These include anti-depressant
             medications, buproprion, or St. John's Wort, as well as dopamine antagonist
             medications.

          -  Women of childbearing age may not participate.

          -  Individuals unable to have MRI scans because of a pacemaker or metal fragments may not
             participate.

          -  Individuals with a history of stroke may not participate. People with any
             contraindication of PET imaging such as previous participation in research procedures
             involving ionizing radiation may not be eligible to participate in this study.
