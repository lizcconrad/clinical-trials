  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonneoplastic epithelial disorders of skin and mucosa of vulva refer to a group of chronic
      diseases shown as female genital skin and mucosal tissue degeneration and pigmentation
      change. The main symptoms are vulval itching, squamous cell hyperplasia, vulval and perianal
      skin atrophy or thinning, hypopigmentation. The current treatments are primarily local drug
      or surgical treatments. However, the effect is not good enough, but the diseases often recur
      and severely affect patients' quality of life. In this study, the investigators combined the
      technology of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) (ultrasound device made by Mianyang
      Sonic electronic LLC, Mianyang China, registration number: 2005-2230099} with special drug to
      treat. The data from colposcopy and biopsy pathology were collected before and after
      treatment to create the objective identifying degree of the disease by with &quot;grading methods&quot;
      and evaluate the treatment effect. At the meantime, the standardized treatment procedure,
      methods and efficacy criterion were all stipulated to achieve satisfactory results, which
      could be used to clinical treatments. So far, the investigators have not seen similar study
      reported internationally.
