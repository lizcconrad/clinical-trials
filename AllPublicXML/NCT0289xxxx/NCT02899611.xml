    <textblock>
      Patients with medically refractory epilepsy will be treated by intracerebroventricular (ICV)
      delivery of valproate using an implantable drug pump system. The dose of valproate will be
      escalated weekly during a blinded-evaluation period through Day 64 to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). After Day 64, patients can continue for 52 weeks in the open-label
      evaluation period (non-blinded).

    <textblock>
      Epilepsy patients that are refractory to oral anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment have
      significantly higher mortality, higher morbidity, higher economic costs and diminished
      quality of life compared to those who suffer from epilepsy that can be adequately controlled
      with medical management. Current options for refractory patients include neurosurgical brain
      resection, responsive neurostimulation, and vagal nerve stimulation. None of these options is
      satisfactory due to the low applicability of surgery for patients with poorly localized or
      multifocal seizures and the limited success of currently available alternative treatment
      options.

      In this study, patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy will be treated with
      intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of valproate using an implantable drug pump
      system. This is a dose ranging study, with a randomized, double-blind dose escalation
      component, to establish the dose range of ICV valproate delivery. Clinical assessments,
      adverse events (AEs), seizure diaries, concomitant medications, blood samples and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be collected and reviewed at designated time points. Magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) will also be performed. Subjects
      will have their surgery, dose changes and pharmacokinetics performed in an inpatient setting.

      The ICV Valproate dose will be escalated stepwise from 3 mg/day to 60 mg/day through Day 64
      if tolerated, or stopped earlier upon establishment of a subject's maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD). The MTD for each subject will be determined based on the highest dose tolerated
      without experiencing a dose-limiting adverse event (AE). After establishing a subject's MTD,
      delivery of ICV Valproate will continue at the MTD through Day 64 of the blinded evaluation
      period. Subjects and assessing physicians will remain blinded to the treatment dose during
      the blinded evaluation period. Subjects can continue in the open-label evaluation period
      (non-blinded) for 52 weeks following the blinded evaluation period.

             brain weight or significant volume loss etc. and is approved to have surgery.

          3. Subject had onset of epilepsy after age 5, had normal brain development up to age 5,
             and has full scale IQ &gt; 70 by testing or functional assessment.

          4. Subject has brain volume which is not noted to be abnormally small due to atrophy by
             either the radiologist reading on MRI scan or the treating clinicians (the
             neurosurgeon) review of the MRI scan.

          5. Subject has had confirmed epilepsy for a minimum of 1 year, with diagnosis of focal
             seizures with temporal lobe onset, with or without secondarily generalized seizures,

             mobility.

          7. Subject has had a CT or MRI of the brain to rule out progressive structural lesions.

          8. Subject has had an EEG or video EEG or invasive monitoring within the past 3 yrs

             significant focal seizures of temporal lobe onset, with or without secondary

             should be counted. The subject should have no period longer than 30 days in the 3
             months prior to enrollment with less than 2 seizures. Seizures of hippocampal origin
             are preferred if the seizure origin is known or determined from imaging and seizure
             localization.

         13. Subject has seizures that are distinct, stereotypical events that can be reliably
             counted, in the opinion of the Investigator, by the subject or caregiver.

         19. Women of childbearing potential must be using a medically accepted method of
             contraception and have a negative qualitative β-human chorionic growth hormone (β-HCG)
             pregnancy test result from a urine or blood sample collected at Screening.

          1. Intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months

          2. Adequate barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm and foam), or an oral contraceptive in
             combination with another method (e.g., spermicidal cream). An oral contraceptive alone
