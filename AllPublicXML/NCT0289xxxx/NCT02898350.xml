  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, Randomized, Split lesion treatment with 4 study Arms: 1) treatment with pulsed
      dye laser (PDL) only, 2) treatment with CO2 laser only, 3) PDL and CO2 laser combined
      treatment, and 4) split scar combined lasers with an additional single CO2 laser treatment
      immediately post-surgery vs. no treatment.

          5. Use of Isotretinoin or other systemic retinoids within the past 6 months.

          6. Use of topical retinoids or therapeutic topicals in the treatment area in past 2

             immunosuppressive medications.

         10. Having any uncontrolled disease or disorder or one which per the investigator's
             judgment might make it unsafe for the subject to participate in this study.

             and sun exposure for the duration of the study.

         12. Participation in another investigational device or investigational drug study within
             30 days prior to enrollment, as per the investigator's clinical judgment.

         13. As per the Investigator's discretion, any physical or mental condition which might
             make it unsafe for the subject to participate in this study.
