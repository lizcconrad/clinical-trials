  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This joint research project between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of
      Defense (DoD) will demonstrate that the implementation of the Mobile Device Outcomes-based
      Rehabilitation Program (MDORP) will improve the quality of rehabilitative care at a decreased
      cost to the healthcare system and a reduced burden for service members (SMs) and veterans
      with lower limb loss. The development of the MDORP will be executed by a multisite
      translational clinical care team that will use web-based mobile computing devices designed to
      assess mobility, enable remote prescription of targeted exercise program, and provide
      continual measureable outcomes to document the continuum of care with the intent of
      maximizing prosthetic performance while minimizing adverse medical events. The information
      obtained from this web-based mobile device application will be used by clinicians to promote
      continuity of care from the DoD and VA facilities nationwide to the community and at home.

    <description>The investigators will recruit a total of 130 subjects (65 at WRNMMC and 65 at the Miami VA) with the goal of consenting and enrolling 100 subjects (50 and WRNMMC and 50 at the Miami VA) with lower limb amputation to utilize the ReLOAD system.</description>

    <intervention_name>Rehabilitative Lower-limb Orthopedic Accommodating-feedback Device (ReLOAD)</intervention_name>
    <description>The study will use a novel piece of technology, the ReLOAD, which is a data collector system that uses instrumented insoles, custom, miniature (1&quot;x1&quot;) microcontroller with accelerometer, gyroscopes, and geomagnetic sensors connected to a Bluetooth transceiver to collect and transmit gait kinematic data to mobile devices, such as an iPad and iPod. When a person walks or performs a specific activity, the ReLOAD system captures the movement, which can then be stored locally within the mobile device and/or encrypted and sent to a secured central server. This allows the patient or provider to access clinically relevant biomechanical data to help guide rehabilitation.</description>
