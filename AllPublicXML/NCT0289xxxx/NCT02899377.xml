  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot imaging study to determine whether molecular imaging with 18^F
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT),
      11^C-Methionine (MET) PET/CT, and salivary gland magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with
      Dotarem (gadoterate meglumine) have the potential to characterize and quantify disease
      manifestations in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) subjects. This will be achieved by
      assessing the associations and consistency between the imaging techniques studied, clinical
      assessments (salivary and tear flow and clinical scores), laboratory biomarkers, and
      histological findings on minor salivary gland biopsy.

      In this study, healthy volunteers will be enrolled in Group A and pSS subjects in Group B.
      The subjects will be required to undergo screening and baseline assessments including
      unstimulated and stimulated salivary flow and Schirmer's test; an imaging visit (Visit 1); a
      sample collection visit (Visit 2) for repeat of selected baseline assessments and a minor
      salivary gland biopsy for pSS subjects only; and a follow-up visit. The total duration of
      participation in the study will be up to 11 weeks.
