      The purpose is to perform an early investigation on the safety and performance of an
      Automated Glucose Control (AGC) algorithm using the OmniPod® Insulin Management System and
      gather clinical data that will be used to make improvements or modifications to the algorithm
      for subsequent studies in adults, adolescents and children with type 1 diabetes.
