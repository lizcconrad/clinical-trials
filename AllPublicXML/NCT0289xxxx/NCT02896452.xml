  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have documented a genetic predisposition for some astronauts to develop
      ophthalmologic issues (e.g., choroidal folds, cotton wool spots, optic disc edema). Women
      with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have several characteristics similar to those described
      in astronauts, including: higher homocysteine concentrations, increased incidence of
      intracranial hypertension, increased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, increased incidence
      of white matter hyperintensities on MRI, increased androgen concentrations (or androgen
      responses to space flight), and indices of altered carbohydrate metabolism. Women with PCOS
      have not been evaluated in detail regarding the occurrence of other anomalies observed in
      astronauts including choroidal folds, optic disc edema and cotton wool spots as well as
      changes in cycloplegic refraction, and optic nerve sheath diameter. While researchers have
      evaluated one-carbon metabolism pathway polymorphisms re: PCOS, and initial studies show an
      association with certain one-carbon polymorphisms, none have looked at the complete set of
      SNPs proposed here. This study will evaluate women with PCOS and/or idiopathic intracranial
      hypertension (IIH) to assess one-carbon biochemistry and genetics and their possible
      correlation with ophthalmologic findings. The investigators aim to clarify the relationship
      of one carbon metabolism and ophthalmic findings in astronauts and patients with PCOS and/or
      IIH.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from initial analysis of 5 SNPs in the one-carbon metabolism pathway suggests that
      one-carbon pathway genes may predict risk of ocular changes and possible vision impairment
      during and after long-duration space flight. It is not precisely known whether it is these
      particular genes, or a haplotype of genes that are linked to these genes, that influence
      risk. Furthermore, ancestry is a strong factor that predicts SNP occurrence in a population,
      and the association between one-carbon metabolism and the risk of vision-related issues may
      simply stem from the fact that one particular ancestry has a higher prevalence of these SNPs.

      The investigators propose that there are other SNPs in the one-carbon metabolism pathway that
      alter risk of ocular changes and potential vision impairment during long-duration
      spaceflight. To that end, extended studies of one-carbon genetics in astronauts have recently
      been initiated. The investigators hypothesize that the differences between genetic,
      biochemical, and ophthalmologic findings in PCOS and/or IIH patients and controls will mirror
      many of the differences found between astronauts who had ophthalmic issues during and after
      flight.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

      The key aims of this study are to: a) determine extensive one carbon pathway and related
      biochemistry, targeted metabolomics, and genetics (523 SNPs of the 85 major genes), and b)
      conduct ophthalmologic exams on patients in one of four treatment groups:

        1. women diagnosed with PCOS without IIH

        2. women diagnosed with PCOS and IIH

        3. women diagnosed with IIH without PCOS

        4. women without PCOS or IIH Participants will be matched by age and body mass index (BMI).
           Statistical analyses will be used to evaluate the independent and shared contributions
           of age, body mass (BMI), and genetics on biochemical, and ophthalmologic outcomes, with
           False Discovery Rate adjustments to account for multiple comparisons.

      A secondary aim is to combine the patient and control data from this study with ISS
      crewmember data in order to help inform us on whether or not these two cohorts (astronauts
      with ophthalmic issues, PCOS patients) share similar associations among one-carbon metabolism
      genetics and biochemistry and ophthalmologic data identified in the investigators' earlier
      analyses.

      The Mayo Clinic/NASA would like to keep the samples for future research. The subjects can
      still take part in the current study even if they don't want their sample to be used for
      future research. If the subject agrees to give their sample it will become the property of
      NASA. Some future studies may examine the DNA. The PI would contact the subject if there are
      findings which would be useful for the subjects' health care. The subject would be given
      general information on the potential risks, benefits, and costs of choosing to learn about
      the findings.
