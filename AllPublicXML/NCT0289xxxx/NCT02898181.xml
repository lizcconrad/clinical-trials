  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is
      associated with increased systemic inflammation. Previous studies have demonstrated increased
      levels of cytokines such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6
      (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) in patients with heart
      failure (HF). Increased activity of sympathetic nervous system in ADHF is linked to
      inflammation. Previous anti-inflammatory drug therapies in HF have demonstrated no
      significant impact on cardiovascular outcomes. Low-level vagus nerve stimulation (LLVNS) is a
      non-invasive way to modulate autonomic tone and thereby inflammation. Vagal nerve stimulation
      is thought to increase the parasympathetic activity and suppress the sympathetic activity.
      Clinical studies of vagal stimulation in chronic HF have been negative. Recent experimental
      and clinical data suggest that low level tragus nerve stimulation (LLTNS) may produce the
      same desired neuromodulator effect compared to LLVNS. It is however unknown if LLTNS in ADHF
      will directly lead to a reduction in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (CRP, IL-1,
      IL-6 and TNF-α) and an increase in the level of anti-inflammatory marker IL-10.The objective
      of this proposal is to determine the impact of LLTS on inflammatory cytokines in patients
      with ADHF.

      Patients will be randomized to either active or no stimulation(~8 hours daily). Serum
      collected will (post admission and on days 2, 3 and 4 post admission) will be used for
      cytokine measurement. This investigation will likely establish the first evidence of effects
      of LLTS on suppression of inflammation in patients presenting with ADHF.
