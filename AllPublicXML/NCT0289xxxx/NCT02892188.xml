      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the follow-up of the osteoporotic patient by a
      physician-pharmacist collaboration.

      Treatments allow decreasing the personal fracture risk from 48% to 85% provided that the
      treatment period is continued at least 3 to 5 years and that hygienic and dietary measures
      are applied: optimization of the dietary calcium intakes (much more efficient and less
      dangerous than the medicinal intakes), preservation of a physical activity, fall prevention.
      The ability of bisphosphonate for decreasing significantly the number of fractures was
      proved, but the lack of lasting adhesion (persistence) and of flanking measures leads to
      believe their efficiency may be enhanced: the hip-fracture rate decreases from 2.1% for the
      non-adherents to 1,3% for the patients with observance, which represents a one-half
      reduction.

      The cost of surgery for a femoral neck fracture is estimated at 8500 euros. So the prevention
      of only one femoral neck fracture entails a huge economy.

      However, 50% of women stop their treatment before a year and the implementation of hygienic
      and dietary measures leads to a lifestyle change, and faces long time ingrained habits. Only
      42% of patients continue their treatment after two years, and only 16% after three years.
