  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ectropion of the eyelid can lead to skin retraction, stenosis of lacrimal point, chronic
      watering, visual discomfort or low visual acuity, mostly when it occurs with ectropion of
      lacrimal point. The objective of the study is to compare two surgical strategies for eyelid
      ectropion combined with ectropion of the lacrimal point

      Were included patients underwent eyelid ectropion surgery in ophthalmology department from
      Oct 2014 to Oct 2015. The first procedure is lateral tarsal strip alone (group 1); the second
      one is lateral tarsal strip with three snips with or without diamond-shaped resection (group
      2). The authors focused on the alteration of the quality of life related to watering, before
      and after operation. Quality of life related to discomfort due to watering was evaluated
      before and after surgery using a questionnaire. Informations have been gathered via phone
      with a ten items questionnaire, each item is worth 0 (no or minim discomfort due to watering)
      or 1 (discomfort due to more than moderated watering)
