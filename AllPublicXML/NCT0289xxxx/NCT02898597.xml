  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As people with HIV/AIDS live longer, the burden of non-AIDS-related health problems such as
      cardiovascular diseases and cancers on these people have consistently increased. Smoking is
      one of the major contributing factors to these health problems and rates of cigarette smoking
      in this group are substantially higher than those of the general population: 40-70% vs.
      17-10%. Especially, women living with HIV/AIDS seem to be more susceptible to the negative
      consequence of smoking than their male counterparts. They are also less likely to see tobacco
      dependence treatment for dual stigma associated with both conditions: HIV infection and
      nicotine addiction. This is a pilot study to develop smoking cessation intervention for these
      women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women are at high risk of becoming HIV positive due to biological vulnerabilities, low
      socioeconomic status, dominant sexual practices of males and epidemiological factors [1-3].
      For example, the risk of being infected with HIV during unprotected sex is two to four times
      greater for women than for men [4]. With the use of combined antiretroviral therapies, these
      women now live longer than ever before which now faces the healthcare community with the need
      for evolving understanding of HIV and aging. However, the burden of non-AIDS related health
      problems such as cardiovascular diseases and cancers on people living with HIV/AIDS while
      aging has considerably increased [5, 6]. Smoking is one of the major contributing factors to
      these health problems. Rates of current cigarette smoking are substantially higher among
      people living with HIV/AIDS than the general population: 40-75% versus 19% [6]. Women smokers
      living with HIV have a 36% higher risk for developing AIDS and 53% higher mortality when
      compared to non-smoking women with HIV [6]. This study is a pilot randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) testing the feasibility and acceptability of a videoconferencing smoking cessation
      intervention (video arm) for women with HIV in comparison with a telephone-based smoking
      cessation intervention (telephone arm). Both arms will receive 8, 30-minute weekly cessation
      counseling sessions plus 8-week nicotine replacement therapy. Participants will be followed
      up at 1, 3 and 6 months from the target quit day. Self-reported abstinence will be verified
      with a saliva cotinine test using an Nicotine Alert test strip and the testing process will
      be monitored via mobile-phone video call.
