  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect initial data on what survivors of childhood,
      adolescent, and young adult cancer think of how information about statins is communicated.
      Statins are medications that lower cholesterol. The results of this study will be used to
      improve the communication about statins. This is to aid patients and their providers in
      making health care decisions together, also known as shared decision making.

    <description>This data will allow validation of the adapted tool in the cancer survivor population. Acceptability will be estimated using the tool describe which will be transformed to a 0 to 100 scale and summarized separately in the two populations using means and standard deviations.These preliminary statistics in both populations (intervention and usual care) will be utilized to design a future larger scale study powered to detect a difference between the two groups.</description>

    <description>In order to characterize the content of and variation in usual care, the first 25 patients enrolled in the study will complete a post-visit questionnaire that asks what their doctor told them (if anything) about their risk of cardiovascular disease, risk reduction and statins specifically, and how this information was presented</description>

    <description>The Statin Choice decision aid uses icon arrays to communicate the expected benefits of statins. This modified risk communication tool will maintain the components of the validated original. The adapted paper-based risk communication tool will describe modified risk profiles applicable to the survivors at increased risk for cardiac disease due to chest irradiation.</description>
