    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, multicenter study of Savolitinib administered orally once per
      day(QD) to locally advanced/metastatic PSC patients with MET Exon 14 mutation. The targeted
      population is the patients with MET Exon 14 mutation who have failed prior systemic therapy
      (ies), or are unwilling or unable to receive chemotherapy. Pathological diagnosis will be
      confirmed retrospectively by the central pathological laboratory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Savolitinib will be administrated 600mg once per day (QD). The treatment will be discontinued
      for the patients who experience disease progression, death or experience unacceptable
      toxicity, whichever occurs first. A cycle of study treatment will be defined as 21 days of
      continuous dosing.

    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response or partial response. The confirmation of response for patients who has PR or CR at first time should be performed by at least 4 weeks and in this study, it could be performed by the scheduled tumor assessment 6 weeks later</description>

    <measure>Progression free survival(PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1year</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the Progression free surviva of patients with complete response or partial response or stable disease. In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks.</description>
