      Main objective:

      To assess the impact of a structured program of preoperative cognitive remediation on
      postoperative social adaptation in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease profiting from
      bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation.

      Secondary objectives:

      To assess in the same patients the impact of structured program of preoperative cognitive
      remediation on quality of life, mood, anxiety, apathy and psychologic, social and
      professional functioning depending on psychiatric symptomatology after intervention.

      Prospective, longitudinal, controlled, multicentric, randomised, open study.

      Subjects: 3 groups of 40 patients (n=120): one group of patients profiting from a structured
      program of preoperative cognitive remediation (SICRPPD group: Specific Individual Cognitive
      Remediation Program in Parkinson's Disease), one group of patients profiting from a
      preoperative non structured accompaniment (ICM group: Intensive Care Management), one control
      group (CG group: Control Group).

      Required sample size: The sample size of 40 patients/group will allow to demonstrate with a
      significance threshold of 5% and a power of 80% a difference of evolution of the global SAS
      SR score of 0.75 SD between 2 of the 3 groups. For an intended SD of 0.2 units, the threshold
      corresponds to a difference of 0.15 units, minimal significant change.

      Intervention: The structured program of preoperative cognitive remediation is divided in 3
      parts: one interview with the patient to do a building of the subjective theories
      (difficulties due to the disease, hope relative to the intervention), a study meeting of the
      cognitive remediation possibilities and a cognitive remediation meeting with the patient. The
      spouse will be included in the program.

      Evaluation tools: Patients will be met before and after the intervention for clinical
      evaluations and scales making: For the psychiatric evaluation: Mini International
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory (M.I.N.I.), Starkstein Apathy Scale, Montgomery and Asberg
      depression scale (MADRS), global functioning evaluation scale (EGF) and Hamilton anxiety
      scale (HAMA)/ For the social adaptation evaluation: Social Adjustment scale Self Report (SAS
      SR)/ For quality of life evaluation: 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39)/ For
      the daily life activities, 'motor' symptomatology and treatment complications evaluation:
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, parties II, III, et IV).

      Main criteria: change in the global score of the SAS SR scale.

      Secondary Criteria: change in scores of the PDQ-39 (quality of life), HAMA (anxiety),
      Starkstein (apathy), MADRS (mood), EGF (psychologic, social, professional functioning, and
      depending on the psychiatric symptomatology) questionnaires.

      Statistics: parametric and non parametric tests will be done for p &lt; 0.05.

    <description>In this group, the structured program of the SICRPPD group will be replaced by 3 unstructured psychiatric interviews during which patients will be assessed for their perception of the disease and the upcoming surgery.
