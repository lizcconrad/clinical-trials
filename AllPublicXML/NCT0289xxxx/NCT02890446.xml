  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the effects of an internal versus an external focus of attention on motor
      training of the affected arm for individuals with stroke. Participants were randomly assigned
      to either the internal or external focus treatment groups and received 12 sessions of arm
      training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants were randomized to one of two treatment groups and received upper arm reaching
      training on the InMotion 2 shoulder robot (12 hourly sessions over four weeks). The external
      focus group received instructions specifically to pay attention to the task goal--hitting
      targets on the video game, while the internal focus group was instructed to pay attention to
      the movement of their arm motions (video game monitor was turned off). Both groups practiced
      the same arm reaching pattern and were matched for level of arm impairment and training
      dosage.

    <description>Participants received arm training using the InMotion2 robot under external focus practice conditions and instructions. Participants practiced arm reaching by playing a simple video game.
EF instructions: &quot;Focus on moving the yellow ball on the screen in a smooth, straight line at a constant speed&quot;; &quot;Move the yellow ball toward the blinking red/orange light&quot;; and &quot;Hit the center of the target and try not to overshoot the target&quot;</description>

    <description>Participants received arm training using the InMotion2 robot without the video game interface. Participants were instructed to think about how they were moving their arm while completing the arm training tasks.
IF instructions:
&quot;think about how you're moving your arm&quot;; &quot;push your arm away from you&quot;; &quot;pull your arm toward you&quot;; &quot;move your arm to the right/left&quot;</description>
