    <textblock>
      The dissemination of individual tumor cells is a common phenomenon in solid cancers.
      Detection of tumor cells in peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTC) in nonmetastatic
      situation is of high prognostic significance.

      The objective of our study was to detect circulating tumor cells in two different method in
      patient with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma .

    <description>Patients with stage III and IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma undergoing surgery were enrolled in this study
5 and 7.5 ml of peripheral venous blood will be taken before the surgery, just at the end of surgery and one week after surgery
Analysis was performed by RT-PCR and the CellSearch™ method using immunomagnetic and fluorescence approaches.
Patients will be followed every 3 months for two years.</description>
