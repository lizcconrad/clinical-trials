  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in a multicentric cluster randomized study the
      effect of the presence of dedicated nurses for training of ICU staff in preventing nosocomial
      infections. The rate of bloodstream infections per 100 admitted patients is used as the main
      endpoint. A sample of 4000 included patients in the 6 participating ICU is included with the
      objective to show a reduction of one third of the rate of ICU-acquired bloodstream
      infections. The study is currently at the end of the recrutimeent phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      15% of patients admitted to intensive care have an infection acquired in the service,
      including bacteremia is a serious form. Compliance with hygiene measures and recommendations
      in the use of invasive devices can reduce the incidence. The advantage of simple
      recommendations type &quot;bundle&quot; could, however, be insufficient because not associated with
      training and monitoring compliance with the recommendations. The aim of this study is to show
      that the daily intervention of a public health nurse on the basis of a half full-time
      equivalent, allows these actions and therefore a reduction in the bloodstream of the attack
      rate acquired in the ICU compared dissemination of simple recommendations.
