      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment procedure,
      intervention including compliance and the collaboration between in- and out patient clinics
      of preoperative home-based exercise in older people before colorectal surgery.

      The feasibility study will be conducted in order to evaluate the study design of a future
      RCT. Feasibility data will eg. consist of study flow description, number of eligible
      participants, included participants, patients and instructors satisfaction with the
      intervention, training compliance, reasons for drop-outs, and adverse events.

      Patients waiting for colorectal surgery will be recruited and included after informed
      consent. Physical and respiratory function will be assessed at the hospital before the
      intervention, the day before surgery and the day before discharge. Data on postoperative
      complications, length of stay and mortality will be collected during the hospital stay. At
      baseline and six months after surgery, the participants will receive three questionnaires
      about level of independence in daily living, physical activity and health related quality of
      life. The intervention will be performed in the older person's home and consists of a
      combination of high-intensity respiratory training and individually adjusted functional
      exercise. Both groups will receive physical activity advice and malnutrition will be screened
      to optimize their nutritional status.

    <description>The sessions will be led by a physiotherapist, in the older person's home. The sessions will consist of inspiratory muscle training with a resistance starting from 50% of their maximal capacity (30 breathes, 2 times/day). The training session will also consist of high-intensity individually adjusted functional strength and endurance training: chair-stand; stair climb/step up with weight belts, interval walking indoor and/or outdoor. This will be combined with functional task-exercises. The training will be conducted 2-3 times week, for at least two weeks or until they undergo surgery. During the remaining days, the participants will be instructed to follow the recommendation of 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day, as well as to perform inspiratory muscle training.</description>
