  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate and describe the surgical and overall outcomes of
      subjects who undergo pancreatectomy and hepatic resection/ablation for pancreatic cancer with
      low-volume hepatic metastases, as part of routine care. Subjects will be followed to
      determine operative risks and 90-day morbidity and mortality. In addition, survival outcomes
      will be compared to historical controls who did not undergo surgery. Secondary outcomes will
      include mortality and morbidity; operative time; blood loss and transfusion requirements; and
      oncologic outcomes such as: margin status, lymph node harvest, disease-free survival, and
      overall survival. Analysis of subject and tumor characteristics will help the investigator
      identify subjects who would benefit from this aggressive multimodal approach.
