    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity
      of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV
      administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects aged 18 - 45
      years.The study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics,
      metabolomics), antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, lymphoproliferative and plasmablast
      responses to MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of this study are:
      1) To Assess the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess responses to the
      study vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by transcriptomics.
      3) To assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study group to filovirus
      antigens.

      of two heterologous and two homologous prime-boost regimens using MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV
      administered in different sequences at Days 1 and 29 in healthy adult subjects aged 18 - 45
      years. The two heterologous prime-boost groups will also receive MVA-BN®-Filo at day 366.
      Sixty subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of four study groups (15 per group).Subjects
      and study staff will be blinded to a subject's study vaccine assignment within study
      vaccination schedule (e.g., enrollment into Group 1 or 4 versus 2 or 3 will be known). The
      study will evaluate the 'omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics),
      antibodies for immunogenicity, CMI, ADCC, lymphoproliferative and plasmablast responses to
      MVA-BN®-Filo and Ad26.ZEBOV vaccines. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) To Assess
      the safety and reactogenicity of each study group. 2) To assess responses to the study
      vaccination by study group after the first, second and third dose by transcriptomics. 3) To
      assess the peak antibody response to the study vaccination by study group to filovirus
      antigens. Secondary objectives are: 1) To assess antigen-specific cell-mediated immune (CMI)
      responses to the study vaccination by study group.2) To Assess antibody-dependent
      cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses to the study vaccination by study group.
