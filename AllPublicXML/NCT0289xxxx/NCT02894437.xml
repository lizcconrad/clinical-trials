    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Protocol is the prevention of pelvic pressure ulcers within a care network
      of SCI patients whose general organization refers to the medical literature and the
      recommendations of the ministerial circular of 18 June 2004. A conceptual framework for work
      (CFW) will be set up and semi-structured interviews will be conducted with patients and
      professionals. They will confirm or dismiss the CFW gradually with a refined coding As of
      domains and sub-domains of the skin preventing spinal cord injury related to the perceptions
      and behaviors of those involved in the sector. Quality control will be provided by experts in
      qualitative research and interviews will be stopped when the analyzes will further refine the
      domains and subdomains. A final framework will be validated to modulate our organization.
