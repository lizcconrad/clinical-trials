      The objectives of this study are to examine the effects of ethnicity, gender, and proton pump
      inhibitor (PPI, omeprazole), on the human gut microbiome. The investigators hypothesize that
      PPI therapy might perturb microbial communities and alter the gut microbiome. Young, healthy
      subjects of Chinese, Malay and Indian ancestry, were enrolled. They were required to provide
      a baseline stool sample (Day 1) and were then given a course of omeprazole at therapeutic
      dose (20 mg daily) for a duration of 7 days. Stool samples were collected again on Day 7 and
      Day 14 (one week after stopping omeprazole). The DNA samples were subjected to 16S ribosomal
      ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing.

      Background and Aim: The objectives of this study are to examine the effects of ethnicity,
      gender, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI, omeprazole), on the human gut microbiome. PPIs are
      commonly used for the treatment of acid-related disorders. The investigators hypothesize that
      PPI therapy might perturb microbial communities and alter the gut microbiome.

      Methods: Healthy subjects of Chinese (n=12), Malay (n=12) and Indian (n=10) ancestry, aged
      21-37 years old, were enrolled. They were required to provide a baseline stool sample (Day 1)
      and were then given a course of omeprazole at therapeutic dose (20 mg daily) for a duration
      of 7 days. Stool samples were collected again on Day 7 and Day 14 (one week after stopping
      omeprazole). Microbial DNA was extracted from the stool samples. This was followed by PCR,
      library construction, 16S rRNA sequencing using Illumina MiSEQ, and statistical and
      bioinformatics analyses.

          3. Chinese, Malay or Indian ancestry through three generations,

          4. Clinical laboratory assessment results within normal limits, unless the deviation is
             considered not clinically significant by the investigator,

          5. Subject is healthy with no clinically significant disease or condition as determined
             through their medical history, physical examination, and results from clinical
             laboratory tests that are performed within 2 weeks before the baseline visit at Day 1,

          6. Ability to communicate with the investigator and to understand and comply with all
             requirements of study participation.

          7. Female subjects must be in the first half of their menstrual cycle (i.e. 1 to 14 days
             after the end of the previous menstruation) at Research Study entry.
