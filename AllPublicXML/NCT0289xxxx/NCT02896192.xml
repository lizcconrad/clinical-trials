      The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of setmelanotide (RM-493) on weight and
      other factors in patients with pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency obesity due to rare
      bi-allelic loss-of function POMC or PCSK1 genetic mutations.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Bi-allelic, homozygous or compound heterozygous (a different gene mutation on each
             allele) genetic status for either the POMC or PCSK1 genes, with the loss-of-function
             (LOF) variant for each allele conferring a severe obesity phenotype.

          2. Age 12 years and above.

          3. If adult age ≥18 years, obesity with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2; if child or
             adolescent, obesity with weight &gt; 97th percentile for age on growth chart assessment.

          4. Study participant and/or parent or guardian is able to communicate well with the
             investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, and be able
             to understand and sign the written informed consent/assent.

          5. Female participants of child-bearing potential must agree to use contraception as
             outlined in the protocol. Female participants of non-childbearing potential, defined
             as surgically sterile (status post hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral
             tubal ligation) or post-menopausal for at least 12 months (and confirmed with a
             screening FSH level in the post-menopausal lab range), do not require contraception
             during the study.

          6. Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to a
             double barrier method if they become sexually active during the study. Male patients
             must not donate sperm during and for 90 days following their participation in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recent intensive (within 2 months) diet and/or exercise regimen with or without the
             use of weight loss agents including herbal medications, that has resulted in weight
             loss or weight stabilization. Patients may be reconsidered approximately 1 month after
             cessation of such intensive regimens.

          2. Prior gastric bypass surgery resulting in &gt;10% weight loss durably maintained from the
             baseline pre-operative weight with no evidence of weight regain. Specifically,
             patients may be considered if surgery was not successful, or resulted in &lt;10% weight
             loss compared to pre-operative baseline weight or clear evidence of weight regain
             after an initial response to bariatric surgery. All patients with a history of
             bariatric surgery must be discussed with, and receive approval from Rhythm prior to
             enrollment.

          3. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder or other Diagnostic
             and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) disorders that the investigator
             believes will interfere significantly with study compliance.

          4. A Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score of ≥ 15.

          5. Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
             (C-SSRS). Any lifetime history of a suicide attempt, or any suicidal behavior in the
             last month.

          6. Current, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiac, or oncologic disease, if these
             were severe enough to interfere with the study and/or would confound the results. Any
             such patients should be discussed with the sponsor prior to inclusion.

          7. History of significant liver disease or liver injury, or current liver assessment for
             a cause of abnormal liver tests [as indicated by abnormal liver function tests,
             alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, or
             serum bilirubin (&gt; 2.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for any of these tests)] for an
             etiology other than non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, any underlying
             etiology besides NAFLD, including diagnosed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
             other causes of hepatitis, or history of hepatic cirrhosis will be exclusionary, but
             the presence of NAFLD would not be exclusionary.

          8. History or presence of impaired renal function as indicated by clinically significant
             abnormal creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or urinary constituents (e.g.,
             albuminuria) or moderate to severe renal dysfunction as defined by the Cockcroft Gault
             equation &lt; 30 mL/min (Appendix 11.10).

          9. History or close family history (parents or siblings) of skin cancer or melanoma, or
             patient history of ocular-cutaneous albinism.

         10. Significant dermatologic findings relating to melanoma or pre-melanoma skin lesions,
             determined as part of a screening comprehensive skin evaluation performed by a
             qualified dermatologist. Any concerning lesions identified during the screening period
             will be biopsied and results known to be benign prior to enrollment. If the
             pre-treatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient may need to be excluded from
             the study.

         11. Volunteer is, in the opinion of the Study Investigator, not suitable to participate in
             the study.

         12. Participation in any clinical study with an investigational drug/device within 3
             months prior to the first day of dosing.

         13. Significant hypersensitivity to study drug.

         14. Inability to comply with QD injection regimen.
