  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll total 30 patients with medically intractable epilepsy. The patients
      will be fully assessed on the enrollment, and then seizure frequency will be counted for
      three months without changing medication. After three months, Omega-3 will be administered
      for next three months. Seizure frequency, questionnaires evaluating mood and QOL, and adverse
      events are evaluated at each visit.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with medically intractable, focal or generalized, epilepsy: Patients with
             localization-related partial onset or generalized tonic/clonic seizure according to
             the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) can be included. Medically
             intractable epilepsy means that recurrent seizures occur even though two or more
             anti-epileptic drugs have been used appropriately for over one year.

          -  Seizure frequency criteria: three seizures per one month for recent 3 months before
             enrollment

          -  Seizure criteria: simple partial, complex partial, or tonic-clonic seizures

          -  Subjects with normal cognitive function: patients who can perform normal daily life.
             If not definite, enrollment will be done with K-MMSE score over 27.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Poor general medical condition: comorbid with heart, lung, liver diseases

          -  Patients who have history of pseudo-seizure

          -  Anti-epileptic drugs has been changed in recent one month.

          -  Chronic alcoholic

          -  Seizure count cannot be done since seizures occur successively.

          -  Allergy to fish

          -  High risk of bleeding such as trauma or operation

          -  Liver function abnormality

          -  Pregnant or lactating women, or women who plans to have children

          -  Patients who have participated in the other clinical trial in recent one month
