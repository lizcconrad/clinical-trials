    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine the hypercoagulable phenotype by thrombinography associated to an
      increased risk of symptomatic and objectively confirmed first venous thrombotic event. This
      is a case-control study in a population with patients having systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE) and/or antiphospholipid antibodies (APL).

      Secondary purposes are:

        1. To determine the frequency of hypercoagulable phenotype in study population;

        2. To analyze the sensibility: consequences of variation of hypercoagulable phenotype
           threshold on the importance of risk;

        3. To identify (genetic and not) factors for hypercoagulable phenotype and their frequency
           in different groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Cases :

          -  Patients with SLE and/or APL and first documented deep vein thrombosis episode
             (minimum 6 months, maximum 6 years)

          -  Any weight and height

          -  Absence of current anticoagulant treatment but possibility of platelet function
             inhibitory treatment; actual guidelines suggest long-term anticoagulant treatment in
             patients with first episode of venous thrombosis and having APL; however, these
             patients can be studied if they are in one of these circumstances: 1/ &quot;inconvenient&quot;
             stop by patient, 2/ aspirin decided by doctor after prolonged treatment

        Controls:

          -  Patients with SLE and/or APL without thrombosis (venous or arterial)

          -  Any weight and height

          -  Possibility of platelet function inhibitory treatment (primary prophylaxis of arterial
             manifestations)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Cases and Controls :

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Refusal of consent

          -  Difficulty of follow-up (not sufficient motivation)
