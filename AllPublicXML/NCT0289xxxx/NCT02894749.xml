  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective monocentric study to evaluate the benefits of a 3D
      rotational acquisition (3DRA) to assess technical success after treatment of infra-renal
      aneurysm with bifurcated endograft. Patients will be randomized between the standard strategy
      (2D angiography at the end of the procedure and angioCT-scan before discharge) and the new
      strategy (3DRA at the end of the procedure). Expected findings are a reduction of radiation
      exposure and contrast medium used during the hospital stay, with a similar resolution between
      angioCT-scan and 3DRA to depict the main complications after EVAR (occlusion, kinking,
      endoleak). Furthermore, any complication depicted after 3DRA group could benefit from an
      additional procedure during the same operating time, and therefore avoid a second
      intervention for the patient.

    <description>New strategy - Patients benefit from a 3D rotational acquisition at the end of procedure, which offers CT-like reconstructions. If any technical issues is depicted on the 3DRA, it can be treated during the same operating time. A contrast-enhanced ultrasound is performed for each patient before discharge to confirm that no technical issue was missed by the 3DRA.</description>

    <description>3DRA allows CT-like reconstructions. It requires less X-rays and contrast medium than standard angioCT-scan. Furthermore, it can be performed in the operative room, during the procedure. Therefore, use of 3DRA should allow reduction of dose, contrast-medium and reintervention when compared to technical success assessment with angioCT-scan.</description>
