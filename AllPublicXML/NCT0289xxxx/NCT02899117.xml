    <textblock>
      The proposed project will examine feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a yoga intervention
      in the pediatric oncology unit at Connecticut Children's Medical Center (CCMC) and includes
      two parts: (1) a survey of children and parents regarding preferences (e.g., convenient
      days/times), experiences and expectations regarding yoga (including barriers and positive
      expectancies) and (2) an eight week clinical trial of a yoga intervention in 10 pairs of
      children and parents.

      The specific aims and hypotheses for this seed grant are to collect and assess data on:

      Aim 1 feasibility - perceived barriers/solutions, interest and accrual rates, attendance per
      session, participant retention, evidence of institutional support and resource commitment
      Hypothesis 1: A yoga intervention is feasible among pediatric oncology patients and their
      parents; (2) preliminary efficacy - including effect sizes for calculating power Hypothesis
      2a: A yoga intervention improves pediatric oncology patients' fatigue, QOL, and sleep.

      Hypothesis 2b: A yoga intervention improves parental QOL and caregiver burden.

      We will be using the following questionnaires and scales to help answer the quesitons related
      to the hypotheses and aims:

      PedsQL 4.0 PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module The Fatigue Scale SleepDiary Actigraphy data. Child Home
      Yoga Practice Diary Satisfaction survey

      Questionnaires noted below are given only to the parents:

      SF-12 Zarit Caregiver Burden Index Yoga Satisfaction Survey

      Study participants will have 4 yoga sessions and the questionnaires and surveys are done
      prior to the first yoga session and after the last yoga session.

      The yoga sessions are created with both the study participant and a certified yoga
      instructor. The patients are given the yoga routine to practice at home at their leisure.
