  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have highlighted a high incidence of burnout among surgeons. The aim of this
      study is in particular to investigate if this is the consequence of performing surgery (i.e.
      invasive procedures) or whether it is related to the cultural background of surgeons.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A mixed method approach (qualitative approach and quantitative approach) will be used to
      investigate surgeons, as well as gastroenterologists and radiologists who perform invasive
      procedures and gastroenterologists and radiologists who do not perform invasive procedures.
      The qualitative approach will rely on face-to face interviews with purposively sampled
      physicians of the 5 groups and will be continued until saturation. The quantitative approach
      will rely on a questionnaire that will be sent to physicians of the 5 groups.
