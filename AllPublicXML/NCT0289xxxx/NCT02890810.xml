  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this placebo controlled, patient and assessor blinded clinical trial, the investigators
      will administer electroacupuncture vs sham electroacupuncture to patients suffering from
      chronic low back pain, and monitor their symptoms as well as collecting objective outcome
      measures. The investigators objective is to identify predictors of pain reduction and
      functional improvement with electroacupuncture vs placebo.

    <intervention_name>Real Acupuncture with Electrical Stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>Acupuncture is a therapy commonly used in East Asian countries, where the practitioner insert thin needles at specific body sites in order to relieve pain and illnesses. Recent studies found low frequency electricity applied through acupuncture needles can lead to profound pain relief by increasing endorphin levels in the central nervous system. Electroacupuncture will thus be used as the active intervention to treat chronic low back pain in this clinical study.</description>

    <description>This intervention serves as the placebo control of the active intervention. Sterile acupuncture needles and the ITO electrical stimulators will be used in this intervention. But special care will be taken to have this intervention mimic the real treatment yet remaining as physiologically inert as possible.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 21-65

          2. English Fluency

          3. Chronic LBP for ≥ 6 Months

               1. Chronicity: cLBP &quot;defined as a back pain problem that has persisted at least 3
                  months and has resulted in pain on at least half the days in the past 6 months.&quot;

               2. Location: &quot;between the lower posterior margin of the rib cage and the horizontal
                  gluteal fold

          4. Average pain over the last month ≥ 5/10

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Radicular low back pain: defined as sharp (or burning) pain, with a defined territory,
             radiating down the limb, beyond the knee. Radicular pain may be accompanied by sensory
             and motor deficit along 1 or more dermatomes. Radicular back pain may also be
             accompanied by MRI evidence of intervertebral disc protrusion and compression of
             spinal cord and/or nerve roots.

          2. Pending litigation or Worker's compensation related to the low back pain.

          3. Currently pregnant or planning to become pregnant (in next 6 months)

          4. American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) class III or above physical status. ASA
             class III is defined as &quot;a patient with severe systemic disease.&quot; Examples would
             include poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, COPD or morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40).

          5. Mental health conditions or treatment for mental health problems that would interfere
             with study procedures, at the discretion of the study team. For example, psychosis,
             untreated major depression, ongoing substance abuse, suicidal ideation. These will be
             assessed by the MINI.

          6. Medications: opioids ≥60mg morphine equivalent units/day, benzodiazepines,
             corticosteroids.

          7. Prohibited interventions: during the study period, the following are not permitted

               1. Back surgeries

               2. Injections with local anesthetics or steroids to the back

               3. New chiropractic maneuvers

               4. New physical therapy programs

               5. New medications for back pain

          8. Bleeding disorders at the discretion of the study team.

          9. Previous acupuncture treatment in the past 10 years.

         10. Medical conditions that would interfere with study procedures (eg. Heart disease or
             pacemaker, active infection), per discretion of the team
