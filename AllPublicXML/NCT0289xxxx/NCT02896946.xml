  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The detection of small liver metastases represents a major challenge during the staging
      process of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Currently, thoraco-abdominopelvic CT
      represents the established imaging modality for selecting patients with pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma for curative surgery. However, despite its performance, 13% to 23% of patients
      undergoing a surgical procedure are finally found to have an unresectable disease because of
      arterial involvement, peritoneal carcinomatosis, or the existence liver metastasis that had
      not been detected by preoperative workup. Compared to CT, diffusion-weighted MRI provides a
      better contrast resolution for soft tissue and liver imaging, and thus leads to a better
      detection of focal liver lesions. Hence, it could be hypothesized that the use of DW-MRI in
      patients with potentially resectable PA may improve the selection process of candidates for
      curative pancreatic resection by increasing the detection of LM undiagnosed by traditional
      preoperative work-up
