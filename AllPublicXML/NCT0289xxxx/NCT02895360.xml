      Single-agent, open-label, multi-center sequential dose escalation and expansion study of
      BAL101553, administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 48 hours to adults with advanced
      or recurrent solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of prolonged intravenous infusion of BAL101553. BAL101553 will be
      administered as an intravenous infusion over 48 hours, to adults with advanced or recurrent
      solid tumors who have failed standard therapy, or for whom no effective standard therapy is
      available.

      The primary goal of the study is to find the highest dose of BAL101553 that can safely be
      given to humans and to assess what side effects occur. The study will start by treating
      patients with a low dose. Once it has been shown that this low dose is well tolerated, new
      patients will be treated at higher dose levels (&quot;dose escalation&quot;). Once the highest, well
      tolerated dose is identified, 40 new patients will be treated at that dose (this part is
      called &quot;dose expansion&quot;) to further assess the tolerability and potential anticancer activity
      of oral BAL101553. The study will also measure pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic effects and
      assess biomarkers.
