      The purpose of this study is to determine if the wearing of shoes &quot;rocker sole&quot; type
      prescribed in type 2 diabetics patients with neuropathy are responsible for disorders of
      equilibrium.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a public health problem. The functional prognosis is partly conditioned by the
      occurrence of wounds at the level of the foot affected by neuropathy and/or arteriopathy.
      Preventive measures are necessary to avoid such complications: education, pedicure, suitable
      footwear, insoles. There are many types of orthopedic shoes, standard or custom-made. A key
      objective is to avoid excessive pressure found at the level of the front-foot, favoring the
      appearance of lesions like ulcers. In this context, the Anglo-Saxons have developed a type of
      shoe ( &quot;rocker sole&quot;), allowing to decrease the pressures on the front-foot with a rigid sole
      system associated with an elevation of the front-foot. Some, however, have shown that this
      type of shoe may be responsible for disorders of equilibrium to the healthy subject, what
      about at the diabetic patients, already at higher risk of postural disorders and falls?
