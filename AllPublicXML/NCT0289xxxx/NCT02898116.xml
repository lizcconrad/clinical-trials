  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and preliminary
      efficacy of a targeted therapy for NSCLC in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor:

        -  Ensartinib (X-396), an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) Inhibitor and

        -  Durvalumab (MEDI4736), an anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody.

    <description>Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs and weight measurements, physical exams, ECG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status evaluation, imaging scans and any other medically indicated assessments, including subject interviews, will be performed to detect new abnormalities and deterioration of any preexisting conditions. The Investigator will evaluate any laboratory abnormalities for clinical significance, and clinically significant abnormalities will be recorded as adverse events. All treatment-emergent clinically significant abnormalities and deterioration from time of signing the informed consent to the end of study visit will be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRFs) as adverse events and graded according to the CTCAE Version 4.03.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ensartinib</intervention_name>
    <description>Ensartinib is taken orally, once per day. In this study, the starting dose for ensartinib will be 200 mg, which is considered an efficacious dose. Based on the results of the dose escalation phase, this dose may be escalated to the recommended ensartinib single agent dose of 225 mg or de-escalated to the minimum effective dose of 150 mg in the case of overlapping toxicities.</description>
