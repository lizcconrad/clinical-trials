    <textblock>
      The project is based on checking the effectiveness of the technique of suboccipital
      inhibition in patients with mechanical neck pain. Suboccipital inhibition technique involves
      the placement of the hands of the physiotherapist under the patient's head so that fingers
      can feel the spinous processes of the cervical vertebrae. Then the fingers slowly leads
      upward to contact the occipital condyles. At this point the investigator should gently move
      your fingers down, finding the space between the condyles and the spinous process of the
      axis. Then, flexing the metacarpophalangeal joints at 90 degrees, slowly raises the skull. In
      this technique the investigator would be carrying out the relaxation of the suboccipital
      muscles: lower rectus capitis posterior, superior oblique head straight back and head higher.
      It is a technique used very often but without knowledge about the time needed for
      implementation. In several studies that have used the technique it has been maintained for
      2.4 or 10 minutes without agreeing how long is necessary. The study will consist of three
      groups formed by patients with mechanical neck pain that they applied the technique two, four
      or ten minutes and a control group of patients with mechanical neck pain. The four groups
      were measured before and after treatment the pain threshold to pressure by algometer and
      conduct the test repositioning of the head to show any changes after application of the
      technique.

    <description>a target is placed on the wall in front of the subject at a distance of 90 cm and adjusted to align with the reference position of the head. a helmet with a laser on top is used. For each test subjects will be instructed to memorize the initial reference position by carrying out a maximum cervical rotation and returning to the reference position without speed limit. Subjects undertake 10 trials. Before each test, the examiner manually reposition the subject's head to the reference position. Once the subject is instructed to conduct the test measurement.</description>
