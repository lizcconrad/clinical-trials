        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥18 years of age

          -  Patients with early chronic hepatitis C (Genotype 1 or 4) which is defined as chronic
             hepatitis C with known episode of AHC within the last 4 years including those who
             failed to PEG/RBV or those who never received therapy for AHC. AHC infection is
             diagnosed on the basis of documented HCV-RNA positivity (&gt; 10.000 IU/mL) and anti-HCV
             seroconversion.

          -  No history of ascites, bleeding esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, or other
             signs/symptoms of advanced liver disease

          -  Have liver disease staging assessment as follows: Fibroscan performed within 3
             previous months of Day 1 of this study showing result &lt;8 kPa

          -  Be HIV-1 infected, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test and confirmed by a
             licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial
             rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  Be on stable HIV Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) for at least 8 weeks prior to study
             entry using a dual NRTI backbone of tenofovir or abacavir

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  &lt; 18 years of age

          -  Patients with chronic hepatitis C genotypes other than 1 or 4.

          -  History of ascites, bleeding esophageal varices, hepatic encephalopathy, or other
             signs/symptoms of advanced liver disease

          -  Have liver disease staging assessment as follows: Fibroscan performed within 3
             previous months of Day 1 of this study showing result &gt; 8kPa

          -  Not be HIV-1 infected, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test and confirmed by a
             licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than the initial
             rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 p24 antigen, or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  Due to known or suspected drug-drug interactions, for the purpose of this study, the
             use of Non Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors, Inhibitors or Protease
             Inhibitors against HIV will be not allow.
