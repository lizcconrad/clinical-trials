    <textblock>
      The EyeControl device is an eye movement-based communication device in the form of wearable
      glasses with connected infrared cam-era that tracks the pupil and translates blinks and
      movements into commands.This study is aimed to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of the
      EyeControl device in healthy volunteers, and ALS patients in early stages.
