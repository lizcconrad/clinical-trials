      Primary Objectives: To assess the antitumor activity (proportion of objective response by
      RECIST 1.1 criteria) of pembrolizumab with objective tumor response in patients with
      persistent, recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer harboring an ultra-mutated or
      hyper-mutated (MMR gene-defective) phenotype identified by next generation sequencing (NGS)
      and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of
      pembrolizumab as assessed by CTCAE in patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic
      endometrial carcinoma. Secondary Objective(s): To estimate the duration of progression-free
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          4. Patients who are pregnant or nursing. The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP)
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP
             should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational drug. WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             (minimum sensitivity 25 IV/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the
             start ofpembrolizumab. Women must not be breastfeeding.

          5. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or
             surgically sterile or have undergone definitive radiation) do not require
             contraception.

          6. Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases are excluded unless
             the following conditions are met: Metastases have been treated and there is no
             evidence of progression by CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to the
             first dose of pembrolizumab administration). There must also be no requirement for
             immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone
             equivalents) for at least 1 week prior to study drug administration.

          7. Patients should be excluded if they have known history of testing positive for human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
             Patients should be excluded if they have a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface
             antigen (HBV sAg) or hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating
             acute or chronic infection (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).

          8. Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might
             recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment
             including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not
             limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease, multiple
             sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myasthenia
             gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as SLE, connective tissue diseases,
             scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IRB), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis;
             and patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson
             syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of
             recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patient with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies
             including thyroiditis managed with replacement hormones including physiologic
             corticosteroids are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other
             arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and
             patients with positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid
             antibodies should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and
             potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.

             NOTE: Patients are permitted to enroll if they have vitiligo, type I diabetes
             mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone
             replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to
             recur in the absence of an external trigger (precipitating event).

          9. Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &lt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to use
             topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with
             minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if &lt;10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction
             caused by contact allergen) is permitted.

         10. Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal
             abscess, abdominal/pelvic fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, GI obstruction and/or
             who require parenteral hydration and/or nutrition..

             minimum of 3 years.

         14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.

         15. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         18. Has not recovered from adverse events to &lt;Grade 1 or prior treatment level due to a
             previously administered agent. Subjects with Grade &lt;2 neuropathy or alopecia of any
             grade are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study.

         19. Has a known additional malignancy that progressed or required active treatment within
             the last five years. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous
