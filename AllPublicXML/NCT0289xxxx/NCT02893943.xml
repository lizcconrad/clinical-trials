  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the potential of probiotics on weight management. It is
      hypothesized that the consumption of 1 capsule of probiotics daily will modulate the
      intestinal gut microbiota thereby reducing body weight and fat compared to those who do not
      consume probiotics. In addition, a diet supplemented with probiotics can be expected to be
      more beneficial than a diet without probiotic supplementation in impacting biomarkers of
      obesity-associated disorders including diabetes, hypertension and CVD.

      Overweight, obese men and women volunteers aged between 18-65 yrs with BMI greater than or
      equal to 25 will be recruited from the Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) area to participate in a
      two arm crossover, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, free-living intervention
      study for 60 days per study period following obtainment of informed consent. Participants
      will be informed to maintain their usual diets as well as their physical activity level.

      After obtaining consent, participants will be randomized to receive either 1 capsule
      containing probiotics, or 1 capsule of placebo daily for 60 days. Compared with the probiotic
      capsules, the placebo contains the same carrier material and is similar in size, shape and
      taste.
