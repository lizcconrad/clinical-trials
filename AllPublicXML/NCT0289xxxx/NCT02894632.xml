    <textblock>
      A novel magnetic resonance (MR) compatible accelerometer for respiratory motion sensing
      (MARMOT) has been developed as a surrogate of the vendors' pneumatic belts. The aim is to
      model and correct respiratory motion for free-breathing thoracic-abdominal MR imaging and to
      simplify patient installation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory motion is a serious problem in the acquisition of high-quality thoracic/abdominal
      magnetic resonance (MR) images. Various methods have been proposed to compensate the
      motion-induced artefacts, including breathholding, respiratory gating and model-driven motion
      correction.

      Breath-holding is the simplest among the three. However this conventional clinical method
      induces various problem, including inefficient use of scanners, inconsistent organ position
      between each breath-hold, imaging an altered physiological status and patient inconvenience
      especially for those who suffer from respiration difficulties. Free-breathing MR acquisition
      has therefore become of great clinical interest recently.

      The investigators intend to examine the efficacy of the MARMOT sensors for:

        -  modelling and predicting the respiratory motions in abdominal scans,

        -  correcting for the respiratory motion in a cardiac cine scan, via a reconstruction-based
           method.

    <description>Respiratory belts, which are usually used in MRI to monitor respiratory movements and brath-holding, are placed around the volunteer's body (on the abdominal and on the thoracic level).
They give the average displacement (in mm) across time generated by the respiratory movement.</description>

    <description>MARMOT sensors are placed on the volunteer's body (4 sensors placed on the thorax or on the abdomen).
MARMOT sensors give 2 measures : acceleration generated by the respiratory movement (in mm/s²) in 3 directions and rotation generated by the respiratory movement (angle in °/s) in 3 directions.</description>

    <description>Comparing the quality of the reconstructed cardiac cine images obtained with the cine-GRICS algorithm using:
the pneumatic belts alone
all MARMOT signals
signals from only one MARMOT sensor.
Three cardiologists are shown with the motion-compensated cine movies obtained using these three sensor configurations. The movies are presented in random ordering on the screen so that the clinicians are blind to the sensor configuration. They are then asked to rank them by overall image quality (1=best, 2=second best, 3=worst). Equal quality ranking is allowed in this procedure.</description>
