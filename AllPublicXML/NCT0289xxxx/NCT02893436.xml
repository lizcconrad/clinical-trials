    <textblock>
      The purpose is to calculate the time for an optimal recovery (T4/T1 &gt; 0.9) from the moment
      when 2 responses to double burst stimulation are visually identical and this for 95% of
      patients.

      Neuromuscular monitoring is a basic monitoring for all curarised patients. Acceleromiography
      is used to supervise neuromuscular blockade and allow measuring in an objective and
      quantitative manner the curarisation level during surgery and phase of recovery from
      neuromuscular blockade. Various parameters are usually measured during surgery:

        -  T4/T1 ratio: ratio between the 4th and 1st response to &quot;train of four&quot; stimulation (TOF,
           4 stimulations of 0.2 ms in 2 s). Neuromuscular recovery is considered appropriate if
           T4/T1 ratio is &gt; 0.9

        -  Double burst stimulation (DBS): 2 short tetanic stimulations separated by an interval of
           750 ms.

      It is known that when DBSs induce the same visual and/or tactile response, T4/T1 recovery
      time is &gt; 0.6. However, for an optimal recovery, T4/T1 ratio must be &gt; 0.9.

      This study will analyze the interval between the moment when DBSs are visually identical and
      the T4/T1 ratio is &gt; 0.9, from anesthesia sheet of patients undergone surgery with tracheal
      intubation curarisation.

      Results will define a minimum time to have an optimal recovery after having visually
      identical DBS responses.
