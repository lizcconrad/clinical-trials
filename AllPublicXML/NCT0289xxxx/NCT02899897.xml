  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IV fluid therapy remains an essential haemodynamic objective in the treatment strategy of
      septic shock. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction secondary to sepsis is observed in 40%
      and up to 65% of the population concerned. However, the capacity of the various indices to
      predict the response to IV fluid therapy in septic shock with left ventricular systolic
      dysfunction have not been clearly defined. Measurement of parameters reflecting filling
      pressures during transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is one of the methods used to evaluate
      cardiac function and estimate the filling reserve, but with no strong evidence. Right heart
      catheterization with determination of cardiac output by pulmonary thermodilution can also be
      used to measure the various parameters commonly used to predict the response to IV fluid
      therapy. Very few data are available with no reliable and clinically relevant data in this
      population with septic shock and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤ 40%) and the
      response to IV fluid therapy monitored by dynamic indices obtained by transpulmonary
      thermodilution and right heart catheterization. Consequently, the capacity of the various
      indices of preload dependence to predict the response to IV fluid therapy in septic shock
      with left ventricular systolic dysfunction remains difficult to define.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Septic shock with cardiovascular dysfunction despite norepinephrine,

          -  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction defined by transthoracic echocardiography and
             LVEF ≤ 40%

          -  Fluid challenge decided by the patient's attending physician according to the
             optimization of cardiac output in septic shock protocol,

          -  IV fluid therapy with 500 ml of crystalloid solution.

          -  Haemodynamic monitoring decided by the patient's referring physician not involved in
             the study, according to the department's usual practice by transthoracic
             echocardiography and thermodilution monitoring.

          -  Sedated, on mechanical ventilation, and adapted to the ventilator.

          -  Patients who have received oral information and written documentation (with a copy
             filed in the medical records) on awakening.

          -  The trusted person designated for each patient has received the same oral and written
             information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients under the age of 18 years, pregnant women, patients under judicial protection or
        deprived of their freedom, Amputation of one or both lower limbs Contraindication to
        passive leg raising (e.g.: severe IC, etc.), Cardiac tamponade or aortic dissection with
        uncontrolled active bleeding. No indication for IV fluid therapy
