  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The link between the products of synthetic chemistry and cancer is at the heart of much
      research. Recent work has identified the use of plant protection agents by farmers as a risk
      factor for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
      is the most common histology. Different biological models were used to understand the role of
      pesticides in lymphomagenesis. To summarize, most pesticides act at the cellular and
      molecular level, on different signaling pathways. After metabolized by cytochrome P450, these
      compounds generally become pro-oxidants. The increase in reactive oxygen species rate (SAR)
      causes the activation of signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. But
      deregulation of oxidative status does not in itself justify the specificity of the impact of
      pesticides on specific pathologies. Several agents have a genotoxic effect, others induce the
      activation of signaling pathways by binding to transcription factors and others have
      immunomodulating properties.

      The link between the products of synthetic chemistry and cancer is at the heart of much
      research. Recent work has identified the use of plant protection agents by farmers as a risk
      factor for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
      is the most common histology. Different biological models were used to understand the role of
      pesticides in lymphomagenesis. To summarize, most pesticides act at the cellular and
      molecular level, on different signaling pathways. After metabolized by cytochrome P450, these
      compounds generally become pro-oxidants. The increase in reactive oxygen species rate (SAR)
      causes the activation of signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. But
      deregulation of oxidative status does not in itself justify the specificity of the impact of
      pesticides on specific pathologies. Several agents have a genotoxic effect, others induce the
      activation of signaling pathways by binding to transcription factors and others have
      immunomodulating properties.

      Among these four mechanisms by which pesticides are involved in lymphomagenesis, two are also
      associated with resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, genotoxic agents leads the implementation
      process of DNA repair, used to repair genotoxic lesions induced by chemotherapeutic agents
      and evade apoptosis. On the other hand, to survive a high level of ROS, the tumor cell raises
      the level of antioxidant defenses, maintaining redox homeostasis and preventing oxidative
      stress. However, a high production of antioxidants constitutes a barrier to the effectiveness
      of anti-tumor agents which are effective in the generation of oxidative stress.
