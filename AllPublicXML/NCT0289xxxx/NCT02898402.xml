  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergent and infectious diseases are a public health priority on Reunion Island. Amongst
      public health threats, the infection due to Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) seems to have
      appeared on Reunion island in 2007 with two hospitalised confirmed cases (one death) and one
      probable case with a goat farmer.

      According to the investigator, the diffusion of C. burnetti is more ancient and such
      diagnosis have been made in the last 30 years with 80 positive serologies identified between
      2005 and 2011.

      Considering the high epidemic power of this disease, its often silent clinical expression and
      its life-threatening condition, the principal investigator wishes to perform a
      sero-epidemiological study in order to establish or to reject the risk of emergence of Q
      fever in Reunion island.

      The study will be performed on pregnant women because Q fever is responsible for particular
      complications during pregnancy and because the number of pregnancy followed on Reunion island
      is stable from one year to the other. The pregnant women population presenting the same
      exposure criteria as the general population, this population will be used to extrapolate to
      the general population of the island.
