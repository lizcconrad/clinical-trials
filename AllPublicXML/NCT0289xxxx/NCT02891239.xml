    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study. Subjects in this study will receive up to eight
      (8) treatments in 11±5 weeks (6-16 weeks) interval, with the PicoWay device using the 785 nm
      wavelength alone or combined with 1064 nm or 532 nm wavelengths. Subjects will return for one
      follow‐up (FU) visit at the clinic at 8 weeks following the last treatment.

      This study is a prospective clinical study to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the
      PicoWay device for benign pigmented lesion treatment.

      Up to a total of 60 healthy candidates, who are seeking treatment/clearance of benign
      pigmented lesions, will be enrolled at up to 3 participating study sites. Subjects will
      receive up to eight (8) PicoWay treatments at 11±5 (6-16) week's intervals. Prior to each
      consecutive treatment, the investigator will decide, based on degree of clearance assessment,
      should the subject undergo additional treatment or proceed to the 8-weeks follow-up (FU)
      visit with no more treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy female and male subjects between 18 to 70 years of age

          2. Fitzpatrick skin type I-VI

          3. Presence of unwanted benign pigmented lesions including but not limited to solar
             lentigines, freckles, café au lait, melasma, Nevis of Ota, Nevus of Ito and
             hyperpigmentation. Multiple lesions can be treated.

          4. Willing to receive the proposed PicoWay treatments and comply with all study
             (protocol) requirements to remove unwanted benign pigmented lesions.

          5. Willing to have photographs and images taken of the treated areas to be used in
             evaluations, publications and presentations (subject identity will be masked).

          6. For female subjects: not pregnant or lactating and is either post-menopausal,
             surgically sterilized, or using a medically acceptable form of birth control at least
             3 months prior to enrollment (i.e., oral contraceptives, contraceptive implant,
             barrier methods with spermicide or abstinence)

          7. Informed consent process is completed and subject consent is signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or planning to become pregnant, having given birth less than 3 months ago,
             and/or breast feeding

          4. Active sun tan

          5. Suffering from significant skin conditions in the treated areas or inflammatory skin
             conditions, including, but not limited to, open lacerations or abrasions,
             hidradenitis, or dermatitis of the treatment area prior to treatment (duration of
             resolution as per the Investigator's discretion) or during the treatment course

          6. History of squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma

          7. History of keloid scarring, abnormal wound healing and / or prone to bruising

             moisture prior to treatment, e.g., lack of noticeable skin flaking, skin peeling and
             skin surface roughness

          9. History of immunosuppression/immune deficiency disorders (including HIV infection or
             AIDS) or currently using immunosuppressive medications

         10. Known allergy to lidocaine, tetracaine, Xylocaine or epinephrine

         11. Has had a laser procedure, a peel or has used lightening creams in the area to be
             treated with in the past six months

         12. Subjects with pigmented lesions that are considered not acceptable by the study doctor

         13. As per the investigator's discretion, any physical or mental condition which might
             make it unsafe for the subject to participate in this study.
