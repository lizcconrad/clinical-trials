  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In adults, the sedentary behavior was related to cardiovascular risk markers, regardless of
      the level of physical activity (PA). However, the interruption of prolonged sedentary time
      has shown positive results even when performed in breaks of low intensity and short duration
      of activity. The aim of this study is to analyze the influence of a sedentary uninterrupted
      period, as well as different forms of breaks in sedentary time for the glycemic, insulin and
      inflammatory markers responses in older adults. This is a controlled clinical trial to be
      conducted in older (≥ 65 years) and sedentary (&lt;150 min / week of moderate to vigorous
      physical activity) people. Those with BMI ≥ to 35.00 kg /m2; diabetic, on medication for
      glycemic control, or with absolute or relative contraindications to PA practice will not be
      included . Participants will undergo four phases of intervention separated by an interval of
      7 days: (1) Prolonged Sitting Time(PST), in which older people will stay for 5 hours seated;
      (2) Prolonged sitting with PA of light intensity and short duration (LiSd), time sitting is
      interrupted for PA bouts of 50-60% of the Heart Rate (HR)max; (3) Prolonged sitting with PA
      of moderate intensity and short duration (MiSd), time sitting will be interrupted for PA
      bouts of 65-75% predicted HR max; (4) Prolonged sitting with PA of moderate intensity and
      long duration (MiLd,) time sitting will be interrupted with PA bouts of 65-75% of HRmax. PA
      bouts will be performed by walking into a hallway every 20 minutes of sitting time and will
      last 2 minutes, except in MiLd phase (10 minute breaks every 75 minutes). To evaluate the
      effects of different PA interruptions in plasma glucose, serum insulin and inflammatory
      markers, blood samples will be collected serially (-30min, Baseline and 30min, 1h, 2h, 3h, 4h
      and 5h after a standardized meal. It is expect that interruption of sedentary time, even with
      breaks of short duration and light intensity can bring benefits to cardiovascular risk
      markers even in the elderly.
