      A study of DHP107, a novel oral paclitaxel formulation, to determine maximum tolerated dose
      and recommended dose for phase II trial in patients with advanced solid cancer and explore
      efficacy of DHP107 in patients with gastric cancer

      1. Primary objective To determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose for
           phase 2 clinical trial for the repeated administration of DHP107 (oral paclitaxel) on
           advanced solid cancer patients

        2. Secondary objectives

             -  To identify the dose limiting toxicity and the safety (toxicity) of DHP107

             -  To evaluate the efficacy (tumor response rate) of DHP107

             -  To assess pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of DHP107

    <description>Phase I (determining MTD) The patients diagnosed with either advanced or metastatic solid cancers were enrolled. The administered dose was escalated in a step-wise manner by an increment of 2 x 50 mg/m2 at each dose level. Three patients were treated for toxicity evaluation for each dose level.
Phase IIa (efficacy evaluation) The safety and efficacy of the corresponding dose was investigated more closely by increasing the patient number to 6 or more patients in the dose tentatively determined as recommended dose for phase IIa clinical trial.</description>
