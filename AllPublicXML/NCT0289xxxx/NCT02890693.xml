  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MySweetHeart Trial is a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of a multidimensional
      interdisciplinary lifestyle and psychosocial intervention to improve the cardio-metabolic and
      mental health of women with GDM and their offspring.

      Primary objective of MySweetHeart Trial:

      To test the effect of a multidimensional interdisciplinary lifestyle and psychosocial
      intervention in women with GDM to improve 1) their metabolic health (decrease in maternal
      weight between study inclusion after GDM diagnosis and at 1 yr postpartum) and 2) their
      mental health (decrease in maternal symptoms of depression during the same time period).

      Secondary objective of MySweetHeart Trial:

      To test the effect of a multidimensional interdisciplinary lifestyle and psychosocial
      intervention to improve other cardio-metabolic and mental health markers in women with GDM
      and their offspring.

      MySweetHeart trial is linked to MySweetHeart Cohort, an observational cohort study that
      assesses the effect of GDM on offspring cardiovascular health early in life. The principal
      investigators of the cohort are Nicole Sekarski and Arnaud Chiolero (University Hospital
      Lausanne, Switzerland). Their primary objective is to assess the effect of GDM on the
      surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at birth (left ventricular mass index and
      subclinical atherosclerosis) and the secondary objective is to assess the effect of GDM on
      the cardiovascular structure and function during the fetal period and neonatal adverse
      cardiovascular risk factors.
