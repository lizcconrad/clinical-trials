      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and optimal dose of PCAR-119 in patients
      who are going to receive stem cell transplantation but without available treatment to achieve
      complete remission prior to the transplant.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and optimal dose of PCAR-119 in patients
      who are going to receive stem cell transplantation but without available treatment to achieve
      complete remission prior to the transplant. In addition, some patients who enroll to other
      CD19-CAR-T cell therapy trials might be eligible for this trial if their CD19-CAR-T cells
      cannot be produced successfully because they have insufficient T cells to allow the
      CD19-CAR-T cells to be made; their T cells are inefficiently transduced with CAR viruses; or
      their CAR-T cell expansion is failed.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects with CD19+ B cell malignancies in patients who have no available
        curative treatment options except stem cell transplantation, with limited prognosis
        (several months to &lt; 2 year survival) and no available treatment option to achieve complete
        remission prior to transplant. Some patients who have enrolled to other CD19-CAR-T cell
        therapy trials may be eligible if their CD19-CAR-T cells cannot be produced successfully
        because they have insufficient T cells to allow the CD19-CAR-T cells to be made; their T
        cells are inefficiently transduced with CAR viruses; or their CAR-T cell expansion is
        failed. All of those patients must meet the following criteria:

          1. Eligible diseases: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
             (CLL), Follicular lymphoma, Mantle cell lymphoma, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and
             diffuse large cell lymphoma, previously identified as CD19+.

          2. Patients 3 years of age or older, and must have a life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          3. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2 or karnofsky
             performance status (KPS) score is higher than 60.

          4. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and all
             subjects must agree to use an effective method of contraception for up to two weeks
             after the last infusion of CAR NK cells.

          5. Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following laboratory
             requirements: White blood cell count (WBC) ≥ 2500c/ml, Platelets ≥ 50×10^9/L, Hb ≥
             9.0g/dL, lymphocyte (LY) ≥ 0.7×10^9/L, LY% ≥ 15%, Alb ≥ 2.8g/dL, serum lipase and
             amylase &lt; 1.5×upper limit of normal, serum creatinine ≤ 2.5mg/dL, aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5×upper limit of normal,
             serum total bilirubin ≤ 2.0mg/dL. These tests must be conducted within 7 days prior to
             registration.

          6. Ability to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate.

          2. Active HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection at the time
             of screening.

          3. Serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient to be managed
             according to the protocol, including active uncontrolled infection, major
             cardiovascular, coagulation disorders, respiratory or immune system, myocardial
             infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, obstructive/restrictive pulmonary disease, or
             psychiatric or emotional disorders.

          4. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity to any of the agents including
             cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or aldesleukin.

          5. Concurrent use of systemic steroids. Recent or current use of inhaled steroids is not
             exclusionary.

          6. The existence of unstable or active ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding.

          7. Patients need anticoagulant therapy (such as warfarin or heparin).

          8. Patients need long-term antiplatelet therapy (aspirin at a dose &gt; 300mg/d; clopidogrel
             at a dose &gt; 75mg/d).

          9. Patients using fludarabine or cladribine chemotherapy within 3 months prior to
             leukapheresis.
