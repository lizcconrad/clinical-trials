  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To tested if the adding of consolidative SBRT to TKI in EGFR mutated patients with less than
      or equal to 5 metastatic sites (primary + 5) will improve progression free survival (PFS)
      compared to TKI alone.

      This protocol is a randomized phase III trial of TKI versus consolidative Stereotactic Body
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) plus TKI for patients with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      Prior to accrual on the trial, patients with Stage IV NSCLC will be treated with positive
      EGFR mutation. Patients who with fewer than or equal to 5 sites of oligometastatic disease
      will be randomized toTKI or consolidative SBRT to all sites of disease (followed by TKI at
      the medical oncologist's discretion). Choices of TKI will be determined by the medical
      oncologist based on clinical appropriateness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed metastatic lung adenocarcinoma (recurrent or de novo) harboring
             sensitizing EGFR mutations (L858R, exon 19 deletion, G719A, L861Q, S768I, exon 19
             insertions) with oligometastatic disease (≤5 discrete lesions of disease irrespective
             of location, inclusive of the primary lesion):

               -  all sites of disease must be amenable to definitive treatment with a local
                  therapy (surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, ablation and conventional
                  radiation therapy) as determined by surgery, interventional radiology and
