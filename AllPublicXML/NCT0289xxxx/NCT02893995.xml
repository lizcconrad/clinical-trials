  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, parallel, randomized (1:1 Slow Dose Titration Group;
      Rapid Dose Titration Group), two-group study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of slow and rapid dose titration regimens of subcutaneous
      Remodulin infusion in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The study will
      include about 50 subjects at up to 10 clinical trial centers in China. The treatment phase of
      the study will last approximately 16 weeks. Subjects who complete all required assessments
      will also be eligible to enter a long-term open-label, extension study (CVT-CV-004).

    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events Among Subjects through 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of adverse events among subjects throughout the 16 week study will be measured by the number of subjects analyzed and the percentage of those subjects who experienced an adverse event.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient Reported Site Pain from Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The site pain questionnaire is a 10-point scale rating the worst site pain experienced on a measured day. Scores will range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). The questionnaire will be completed each time a new infusion site is placed and until a subject's infusion site pain level reaches a score of zero for two consecutive days or they have completed 14 days. Changes from Baseline to Week 16 will be summarized and compared between treatment groups using descriptive statistics. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Subject Discontinuations Among Participants through 16 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of subject discontinuations among subjects throughout the 16 week study will be measured by the number of subjects analyzed and the percentage of those participants who discontinued.</description>

    <measure>Change in 6-minute Walk Distance (6MWD) from Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The intent of the 6MWD test is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out activities of daily living. Change in 6MWD from Baseline to Week 16, correlates with the current clinical standard for assessing patient functional status in the treatment of PAH and is considered an objective measure of patient functional status by the American Thoracic Society (ATS). Subjects will be instructed to walk down a corridor at a comfortable speed as far as they could manage for six minutes. Distance &lt;500 meters suggests considerable exercise limitation; Distance 500-800 meters suggests moderate limitation; Distance &gt;800 meters (with no rests) suggests mild or no limitation. Changes from Baseline to Week 16 will be summarized and compared between treatment groups using descriptive statistics. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed.</description>

    <measure>Change in Borg Dyspnea Score (following 6MWT) from Baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg dyspnea score is a 10-point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea (difficulty in breathing) experienced during the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The Borg dyspnea score will be assessed immediately following the 6MWT. Scores range from 0 (for no shortness of breath) to 10 (for the greatest shortness of breath ever experienced). Changes from Baseline to Week 16 will be summarized and compared between treatment groups using descriptive statistics. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed.</description>

Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity. Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity. Class IV: Inability to carry out any physical activity without symptoms. Changes from Baseline to Week 16 will be summarized and compared between treatment groups using descriptive statistics. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed.</description>

    <description>Remodulin (1.0, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/ml formulations as available) will be administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion via a subcutaneous cannula using a microbore infusion tubing set and a micro infusion pump. While hospitalized, initiation will begin at approximately 1.25 ng/kg/min of subcutaneous treprostinil with dose increases of approximately 1.25 ng/kg/min once every seven days for the first 4 weeks, then approximately 2.5 ng/kg/min every seven days thereafter according to clinical response and tolerability.</description>

    <description>Remodulin (1.0, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/ml formulations as available) will be administered by continuous subcutaneous infusion via a subcutaneous cannula using a microbore infusion tubing set and a micro infusion pump. While hospitalized, initiation will begin at approximately 2.0 ng/kg/min with dose increments of 1-2 ng/kg/min approximately every 12 hours according to clinical response and tolerability. Following subject discharge, the dose rate should be increased by 1-2 ng/kg/min with dose increments separated by at least 24 hours. When a dose rate of 20 ng/kg/min has been achieved the dose increments can be increased up to 4 ng/kg/min with dose increments separated by at least 24 hours. The aim is to achieve a dose rate of at least 10, 20, 30 and 40 ng/kg/min by the end of Weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12, respectively.</description>
