      The LipiFlow System (TearScience, Morrisville, NC) is an in-office FDA approved treatment for
      meibomian gland dysfunction. It relieves meibomian gland obstruction through the use of heat
      and pulsatile pressure. A recent study has observed that a single treatment with the LipiFlow
      system can decrease dry eye symptoms and objective findings of meibomian gland dysfunction
      for 1 year. We aim to see if the Lipiflow System will be beneficial in patients with
      Parkinsons disease who may have difficulty performing normal meibomian gland dysfunction
      treatment.

      Objectives To determine whether a single treatment with thermal pulsation relieves dry eye
      symptoms (primary objective) and improves objective findings of meibomian gland dysfunction
      in patients with Parkinsons disease.

      Methods and Measures

      Design

        -  Randomized, controlled trial

        -  Patient eyes will be randomized to either receive a single thermal pulsation treatment
           the FDA-approved Lipiflow thermal pulsation system or to use traditional eyelid hygiene
           or to use traditional eyelid hygiene

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Meibomian gland assessment defined as assessment of 15 glands on the lower eyelid margin using a handheld instrument, the Meibomian Gland Evaluator.</measure>
    <time_frame>Four visits up to three months</time_frame>
    <description>Expressed secretion characteristics graded on a scale:
3 (clear liquid secretion)
2 (cloudy liquid secretion)
1 (inspissated/toothpaste consistency)
0 (no secretion)
Meibomian gland metrics will be calculated:
A) Total meibomian gland score (sum of the grades for all 15 glands with a range from 0 to 45)
B) The number of glands secreting any liquid (clear or cloudy liquid with a grade of 2 or 3) of the 15 glands assessed
C) The number of glands yielding the optimal clear liquid secretion (clear liquid with a grade of 3) of the 15 glands assessed.</description>

    <measure>Tear break up time</measure>
    <time_frame>Four visits up to three months</time_frame>
    <description>Tear break up time defined measured with the fluorescein tear break up time (FBUT) method and categorized as follows
&quot;Dry&quot; defined as FBUT values of 1-5 seconds
&quot;Marginal&quot; defined as FBUT of 6-9 seconds
&quot;Normal&quot; defined as FBUT of 10 or greater seconds</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of dry eye symptoms with Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score before and after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Four visits up to three months</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI score is assessed on a scale of 0 to 100 with higher scores representing greater disability.</description>

    <measure>Corneal Staining</measure>
    <time_frame>Four visits up to three months</time_frame>
    <description>• Corneal staining
Evaluated with a slit-lamp biomicroscope 90 seconds after instillation of fluorescein dye using a standard strip method
Corneal staining is based on the Report of the National Eye Institute/Industry Workshop on Clinical Trials in Dry Eye and will be graded on a scale of 0 (none) - 3 (severe) with a total corneal staining grade range from 0 to 15</description>

    <measure>SPEED Questionnaire assessment of dry eye symptoms before and after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Four visits up to three months</time_frame>
    <description>SPEED Questionnaire rating of types, frequency, and severity of symptoms. Frequency is grade 0 to 3. Severity is grade 0 to 4. Higher grades represent greater disability.</description>
