      Multicenter, national study, non-randomized , controlled, comparative with 4 independent
      groups (20 participants in each group). There are 3 experimental groups (&quot;smocker&quot;, &quot;nicotine
      replacement therapy&quot; an &quot;electronic cigarette&quot;) and 1 control group (&quot;without nicotine&quot;).

      The main objective of the study is to compare the level of urinary NNN in the electronic
      cigarette users versus the nicotine replacement therapy (patch) users.

      The study has only one visit taking place as below:

        -  Verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria.

        -  Collection of the informed consent of the subject Given the non-invasive nature of the
           procedure, a period of reflection will be given to the subjects, however, information
           and obtaining consent will be made during the same visit.

        -  Collection of 5 mL of required for the pregnancy test in women of childbearing age. This
           collection does not need to be fasting. If this test is positive, the subject will not
           be included in the study.

        -  Collection of 30 mL of urine needed for the cotinine and the NNN quantitative analysis.

      This collection does not need to be fasting.

      Then , the urine sample is divided into two vials stored at -80 ° C:

        -  a 10 mL vial for the cotinine analysis,

        -  a 20 mL vial for the NNN analysis.

             -  Realization of the Fagerstrom test (FTCD) in order to evaluate subject smoking.
                This test is not done for the group 4 (group &quot;without nicotine&quot;)

             -  Measurement of carbon monoxide in exhaled air If after signing the consent, the
                subject realizes that he cannot urinate or he did not enough urine during the
                inclusion visiting, the subject can come back the next working day to make the
                urine collection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Group 1, 2 and 3:

             -Having an urinary cotinine &lt;100 (ratio cotinine / creatinine - Determination Cotinine
             DRI)

          -  Group 4 (control group):

               -  Having an urinary cotinine&gt; 10 (ratio cotinine / creatinine - Determination
                  Cotinine DRI)

        The determination of urinary cotinine levels will be carried out centrally. The result will
        not be available at the inclusion visit. The included patients who do not have the urinary
        cotinine levels required for their group, will secondarily excluded from the study.

        The number of subjects in Groups 1, 2 and 3 with a ratio of cotinine would be less than 100
        is expected to be negligible.A102
