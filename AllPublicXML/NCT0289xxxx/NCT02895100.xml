      The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      daily doses of PTG-100 in subjects with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II multi-centre, double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical study
      to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of an oral peptide, PTG-100, administered
      as capsules for 12 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe UC.

      Following screening procedures and confirmation of subject eligibility, subjects will be
      randomised 1:1:1:1 to one of three daily doses of PTG-100 (150, 300 or 900 mg) or placebo.
      Stratification will be based on subjects' prior treatment with anti-TNF agents, with a
      maximum of 50% of subjects with prior unsuccessful anti-TNF agent treatments. Subjects will
      be treated with study drug for 12 weeks. Sigmoidoscopies will be performed at the Screening
      Visit and on Week 12. A final Follow Up Visit will occur on Week 16, when subject has been
      off study treatment for 4 weeks. Clinical, safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic
      (PD) parameters will be evaluated on an ongoing basis during the 16 week study.
