  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the ways in which mobile technology can be
      integrated into inpatient care to help better track pain levels using mobile technology of
      patients with sickle cell disease, oncology patients, and bone marrow transplant patients.
      The study will assess whether or not daily mobile monitoring with wearable accelerometers
      (devices that detect movement as well as heart-rate) to monitor and manage medical treatments
      can have a lasting positive impact on outcomes in patients with chronic diseases. The
      investigator hopes to learn more about the ways in which mobile technology can be integrated
      into inpatient care. Specifically, the investigator is looking to help patients better track
      their pain, use wearable technology to track physiological measures (for example, heart rate,
      sleep quantity and quality), and integrate these data points into the medical care of
      patients by providing the information to providers. This study will first gather information
      regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the use of technology on the inpatient unit.
      This will help the study team to refine the technology of the mobile app and logistics of
      integration. Following this, the investigator will complete a second phase of the study,
      during which select patients will pilot the intervention. This will be followed by the third
      and final phase, during which patients will be randomly assigned to the active intervention
      or standard of care. This phase approach will enable the study team to refine the
      intervention, relying on the feedback from patients and providers, and subsequently test its
      utility compared to standard of care through random assignment.

    <description>Patients will be given a wearable such as a Microsoft Band accelerometer to track movement, heart rate, galvanic skin response and sleep, which will be collected in combination with the data from the SMART visual dashboard. Data will be sent to the SMART dashboard as well as stored on the iPad/iPod touch via software from the manufacturer. Participants having a &quot;wearable device&quot; will receive the education intervention (such as haptic prompted texts that state 'try and walk today', 'have you had enough water today', 'make sure to take deep breaths').</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient 8-80 years old with a past medical history for a chronic disease (such as
             sickle cell disease), cancer (solid tumor, lymphoma, brain tumor), or currently
             undergoing bone marrow transplant

          -  Currently admitted to the hospital

          -  Have a current diagnosis which includes pain for which they are being treated

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be enrolled within 48 hours of admission

          -  Due to the possibility of a choking hazard, only patients who are at least 8 years of
             age will be enrolled in the study

          -  Patients in the Intensive Care Units will not be eligible

          -  Must be able to understand and operate the mobile device independently; therefore the
             investigators will exclude those the provider team considers unable to do so
