    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without cediranib works in
      treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places
      in the body. Olaparib and cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured
      by radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), as compared to olaparib monotherapy in
      patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured
      by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, radiographic response rate by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1, and overall survival (OS), as
      compared to olaparib monotherapy in patients with mCRPC.

      II. To evaluate association of homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair
      deficiency (HRD) with the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib or
      olaparib monotherapy, as measured by rPFS, in mCRPC patients.

      III. To evaluate the safety the combination of cediranib and olaparib and olaparib
      monotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing in mCRPC patients and
      correlate that with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.

      II. To characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes,
      angiogenesis markers, and immune markers, by whole transcriptome sequencing and correlate
      with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.

      III. To characterize changes in immune tumor microenvironment in mCRPC patients by profiling
      expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes,
      and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.

      IV. To identify baseline predictive biomarkers for rPFS or response and to identify
      on-treatment markers of acquired resistance in men with mCRPC receiving either olaparib plus
      cediranib or olaparib alone.

      V. To explore biomarker signatures that correlate with the clinical activity or resistance to
      olaparib with or without cediranib, including changes in gene expression or acquired
      mutations in tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily
      (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.

             resistant prostate adenocarcinoma by meeting ALL the following:

               -  Pathology of prostate gland or metastatic disease must confirm the diagnosis of
                  prostate adenocarcinoma; mixed histology with other variants such as small cell
                  or neuroendocrine differentiation must be discussed with the study principal
                  investigator (PI)

               -  Metastasis must be documented by radiographic evidence

               -  Castration resistance must be documented with surgical or medical castration with
                  serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/d (&lt; 2.0 nM); if the patient is being treated with
                  luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (patient who has not
                  undergone orchiectomy), this therapy must have been initiated at least 4 weeks
                  prior to cycle 1, day 1 and must be continued throughout the study

               -  Progression must be evidenced and documented by any of the following parameters

                    -  Two consecutively rising PSA values, above the baseline, at a minimum of
                       1-week intervals; the minimal value to enter the study is 1.0 ng/ml or
                       greater; the reference value (#1) is the last PSA measured before increases
                       are documented, with subsequent values obtained a minimum of 1 week apart;
                       if the PSA at time point 3 (value #3A) is greater than that at point 2, then
                       eligibility has been met; if the PSA is not greater than point 2 (value
                       #3B), but value #4 is, the patient is eligible assuming that other criteria
                       are met, if values 3A or #4 are 1 ng/mL or higher (Prostate Cancer Working
                       Group 3)

          -  Must have received at least two one prior line of therapy for mCRPC; a taxane
             chemotherapy administered for metastatic castration sensitive disease will not count,
             unless patient develops disease progression within 12 months from the last dose
             chemotherapy; therapy given in concurrent administration on a clinical trial will
             count as one line of therapy

          -  Must have a life expectancy greater than or equal to 16 weeks received
