      Assessment of the impact of oral Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO) application on acute
      diarrhoea and the development of prolonged and persistent diarrhoea in paediatric patients
      hospitalized with acute diarrhoea.

    <textblock>
      The trial is single site, double blind, randomized of HMO addition (1.5 g /day) to standard
      of care in paediatric diarrhoea patients. HMO application and follow-up of the children at
      home will be done for 2 weeks. Control patients receive only the standard of care (ORS plus
      zinc). A breastfed group of diarrhoea patients will serve as reference group.

      The total sample size is 495 patients. Patients will be females and males aged 6 months to 2
      years old with acute diarrhoea.

        Inclusion Criteria: Non breast-fed children (group I and group II):

          1. Both male and female children between the ages of 6 months to 2 years.

          2. Acute diarrhoea (&lt;48 hours) without interfering co-morbidities, e.g. acute respiratory
             tract infection, sepsis, gross electrolyte imbalances etc.

          3. Guardian is willing to have the child admitted to the hospital as an inpatient until
             resolution of diarrhea and to return to the clinic with the child on Day 14 after
             admission for a final evaluation.

          4. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to admission to this study.

          5. The subject has a physical examination that reveals no clinically significant
             abnormalities other than those expected for subjects with acute infectious diarrhea.

        Exclusion Criteria: Non breast-fed children (group I and group II):

          1. Children of either sex who are fully or partially breast-fed until one week before
             enrolment (since breastfed children receive naturally HMO, their inclusion into the
             ORS/zinc or HMO/ORS/zinc arms would critically interfere with the study question;
             depending on children's age 30 to 50 % of mothers would do so at icddr,b). However, an
             unblinded reference group will be constituted by age-matched children who are
             breastfed at the moment of hospitalization for acute diarrhea and where the mothers
             want to continue breastfeeding on the study ward (so breastfeeding is only an
             exclusion for the randomized groups).

          2. Suspected or confirmed cholera as detected by a positive DF examination in stool
             collected on admission. (The large volume and quick evacuation of stool could
             interfere with product presence in the gut)

          3. Symptom duration &gt; 48 hours at screening.

          4. Vomiting severity that is likely to make administration and retention of test product
             impossible.

          5. Severe malnutrition defined (using z-scores) as: severe stunting (SS; height-for-age
             z-score &lt; −3.00); severe underweight (SU; weight-for-age z-score &lt; −3.00), and severe
             wasting (SW; weight-for-height z-score &lt; −3.00), using the World Health Organization
             reference value. Moderate malnutrition was defined as follows: moderate stunting
             (height-for-age z-score −3.00 to &lt; −2.00); moderate underweight (weight-for-age
             z-score −3.00 to &lt; −2.00); and moderate wasting (weight-for-height z-score −3.00 to &lt;
             −2.00). We considered children as well-nourished if their z-scores for weight-for-age,
             height-for-age and weight-for-height z-score were form −2.00 to +1.00.

             Children with moderate malnutrition will be enrolled since they develop with higher
             frequency PD).

          6. Child already receiving antibiotics or anti-motility drugs for this diarrhea episode
             prior to screening.

          7. Children with any food allergy.

        Breast-fed children, (Group III - Reference group)

          1. Exclusive Breastfed children Either sex: Male and female

          2. Age 6-12 month

          3. Acute diarrhoea (&lt;48 hours) without interfering co-morbidities, e.g. acute respiratory
             tract infection, sepsis, gross electrolyte imbalances etc.

          4. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to admission to this study.

          5. The subject has a physical examination that reveals no clinically significant
             abnormalities other than those expected for subjects with acute infectious diarrhea.
