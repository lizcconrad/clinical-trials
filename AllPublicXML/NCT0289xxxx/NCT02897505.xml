  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women will be recruited from the EMPOWER clinic when they present for care; they may be given
      a flyer as part of their clinic entry paperwork, or approached by a study staff member in the
      waiting area of the clinic. Women who are clients of Sanctuary for Families may find out
      about the music workshops and the study through Sanctuary for Families staff, who will post
      flyers in their noticeboards or offices.

      This study will use a repeated measures survey design to evaluate the effect of a musical
      workshop intervention to aid in the management of mood, anxiety, and stress among women
      enrolled in the EMPOWER clinic for survivors of sex trafficking and sexual violence.
      Assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of this music intervention will be carried
      out on participants as they are taught to manage stress and emotions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Three (3) Months</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS-21 is a 21-item self-report questionnaire that measures the severity of a range of core depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. [6] The DASS-21 has been translated and validated in many languages, including Spanish, French and Chinese. In this study, the DASS-21 is conducted three times: at the beginning of the study (pre-intervention), at the end of the study (post-intervention), and at 3 months after the study (3-month follow-up). The DASS-21 can be completed in 5-7 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life Events Checklist (LEC-5):</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Three (3) Months</time_frame>
    <description>The LEC is a widely used self-report questionnaire that assesses participants' exposure to 16 potentially traumatic events and one additional stressful event not captured in the other 16 items. The LEC has been translated and validated in many languages, and can be completed in 5-7 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physiological and Emotion Thermometers Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Three (3) Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Physiological and Emotion Thermometers Survey records information on participants' physiological indicators (heart rate and blood pressure) and self-reported answers on the Emotion Thermometers, which is a simple visual-analogue tool used to detect and monitor emotional disorders and has been translated in many languages including Spanish, French and Chinese. The survey is conducted at the beginning and at the end of each music workshop (pre- and post-session, respectively) that the participant attends, and can be completed in 2-5 minutes.</description>
