  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate when is the best time to resume physical activity
      following a head injury. Two treatment plans will be studied; the first treatment plan
      consists of gradually reintroducing physical activity in the child's routine, starting 72
      hours following the head injury. The second treatment plan involves physical and mental rest
      until the child as no more symptoms. Once symptom free, physical activity is gradually
      reintroduced in the child's routine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent post-concussive symptoms (PPCS) pose long-term challenges and can impact
      negatively patients' health-related quality of life and functional outcomes. Preventing PPCS,
      pediatric concussion guidelines call for cognitive and physical rest. Strict physical
      activity restriction is recommended until symptom-free, followed by a progressive step-wise
      return to activities. Unfortunately, little evidence beyond expert opinion exists to guide
      health care professionals on how and when to best re-introduce physical activity to hasten
      recovery and reduce the burden of PPCS. Recent evidence suggests protracted rest may hinder
      recovery. In fact, early resumption of physical exercise has proven physiological,
      psychological and functional benefits in many other conditions, including stroke (a severe
      traumatic brain injury). Findings from pilot studies in children with PPCS support that
      early, active rehabilitation is associated with improved recovery.

      The goal of this study is to investigate whether early reintroduction of non-contact,
      physical activity at 72-hour post-injury reduces the rate of PPCS in children following an
      acute concussion as compared to usual care stepwise resumption of activity only once fully
      asymptomatic as per the Zurich consensus return-to-play protocol.

      The study is a multicentre, blind, randomized clinical trial. A total of 350 participants
      will be recruited from 3 Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) Emergency Departments
      (ED). Eligible children are those aged 10-17 years who sustained a concussion in the previous
      48 hours. Participants will be randomized to either the experimental intervention group or
      the the control group. The experimental intervention group consist of resumption of light,
      aerobic exercise (e.g., 15 minute walk) 72 hours post-injury, irrespective of symptoms.
      Patients will be allowed to progress activity daily using one of the following of their
      choice: Frequency, Intensity, Time (duration), or Type, as long as symptoms are
      well-tolerated, with a minimum of 24 hours between each step. Control group: Usual care
      according to Zurich return-to-play guidelines (complete rest until full resolution of
      concussion symptoms [several weeks of rest may be required prior to initiation], followed by
      stepwise activity progression).

    <measure>Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) will be used as a confirmatory instrument for defining a PPCS case. PCSI is a validated, comprehensive self-administered instrument that has been used in other pediatric concussion studies, and only one of two measures applicable to younger children with published validity and reliability data. For the purpose of this study the investigators will be using the PCSI pre-adolescent scale version (18-item, 3-point scale), encompassing physical, cognitive, emotional and sleep domains. The scale will be used for all the children in the study. This specific version has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (r=0.87 for children aged 8-12 years). The assessment will be included in the second and fourth week follow-ups.</description>

    <measure>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ version 4.0 (PedsQL-4.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL is a reliable and valid measure of health-related quality of life in healthy children and adolescents and those with acute and/or chronic health conditions.120 Parent versions exist for children aged 2 to 18 years (in 4-age groups) and child versions for those aged 5 and over. For this study only the child's version (ages 8-12 (appendix 16a) and ages 13-18 (appendix 16b)) will be used. The inventory covers four domains: physical, emotional, social and school and takes approximately 4 minutes to complete. The 18-item PedsQL™ Multidimensional Fatigue Scale is designed to measure fatigue in pediatric patients and comprises the General Fatigue Scale (6 items), Sleep-Rest Fatigue Scale (6 items), and Cognitive Fatigue Scale (6 items). The PedsQL™ Multidimensional Fatigue Scale has demonstrated excellent internal consistency reliability and validity. For the purpose of this study only the child version will be administered during the 2 and 4th week follow-up.</description>

    <description>The PIFOS is an assessment that evaluates functional outcomes. The PIFOS is a 26-item structure interview, and is completed by caregivers. The assessment elicits ratings regarding motor skills, daily living skills, communication skills, cognition, social-emotional functioning, physical changes, and academic functioning.</description>

    <description>The Actical will provide an objective measurement of activity/sedentary monitoring. The device is capable of encoding raw acceleration, activity counts, energy expenditure, physical activity intensity, body position, and amount of sleep. The device can store up to 32 MB data (194 days on the Epoch mode of 1 second) and the battery provides power for 180 days between charges. The Acticsl has been validated and is a reliable measure.</description>
