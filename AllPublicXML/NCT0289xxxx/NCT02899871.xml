  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) are associated with various types of joint manifestations,
      especially inflammatory. Patients with IBD treated with anti-TNF commonly report joint
      symptoms, with variable expressions and aetiologies, possibly responsible for impaired
      quality of life, and possibly leading to discontinuation of an effective and validated
      treatment.
