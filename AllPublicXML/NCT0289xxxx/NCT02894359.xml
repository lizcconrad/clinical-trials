  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical dystonia (CD) is a syndrome characterized by sustained and/or phasic involuntary
      neck muscle activity causing abnormal head postures and movements. It is the most frequent
      form of adult focal dystonia. The distribution of dystonic muscles is unique for each
      patient, explaining the variety of patterns encountered.

      The therapeutic management of CD is essentially local and symptomatic: Botulinum Neurotoxin
      injections and/or specific retraining therapy programmes. Therefore, analyzing the
      characteristics of abnormal head movements and identifying the dystonic muscles are the key
      points of these treatments.

      To a better understanding of the posture and movement disorders of head and neck, we wish to
      establish a three-dimensional (3-D) computer model of cervical spine movements of ten healthy
      subjects built from images obtained with the &quot;Cone Beam &quot; system. Then we will compare the
      cervical posture and movements for each of ten CD patients matched in age and genre to the
      computer model. Comparison with patients' images in the axial plane reconstructed by computer
      with the 3-D computer model will lead to the description of various patterns of CD. Analysis
      of the musculoskeletal disturbances in CD should be a help to improve the localization of
      Botulinum Neurotoxin injection sites as well as retraining programmes.
