  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators want to learn more about whether the Respiratory
      Volume Monitor (ExSpiron) can accurately measure breathing in infants less than 12 months of
      age. The Respiratory Volume Monitor uses up to 5 stickers that are placed on the chest to
      measure the amount of air going in and out of the lungs with each breath (Tidal Volume), the
      number of times per minute a breath is taken (Respiratory Rate), and the amount of air going
      in and out of the lungs per minute (Minute Ventilation).

      It is important for medical staff to be able to collect information about breathing
      non-invasively because it may help determine if certain children are experiencing breathing
      problems sooner than the way it is currently detected.

      The goal of this study is to determine if the Respiratory Volume Monitor works accurately in
      infants less than 12 months of age.
