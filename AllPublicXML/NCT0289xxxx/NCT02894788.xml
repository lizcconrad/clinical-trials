      Several score systems were created to stratify perioperative risk and predict mortality. The
      study rises from the needing of a rapid and simple system to identify the patient worthy of
      Postoperative Intensive Surveillance. In the first phase Authors retrospectively investigated
      on patients underwent to elective surgery searching for determining factors (DFs) for
      postoperative ICU admission. Later, Researchers prospectively studied how DFs could predict
      the admission in ICU of consecutive patients scheduled for elective surgery during a
      three-months period and created an index, named PoIS (Post-operative Intensive Surveillance),
      based on the results of this analysis. Authors used surgical invasiveness (SI), Diabetes
      Mellitus (DM), Myocardiopathy (MCP), Cerebrovascular Disease (CVD), Body Mass Index (BMI),
      age, serum creatinine level (sCr), Tiffenau Index (TI) and male sex for the development of
      the original model. Authors classified SI from G1 (lowest) to G5 (highest).

      The results show that the power of prediction of postoperative morbidity of PoIS and POSSUM
      resulted coincident and better than the American Society of Anesthesiology scoring system.
