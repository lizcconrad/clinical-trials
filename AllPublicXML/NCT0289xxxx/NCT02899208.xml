    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether an actigraph, measuring in-hospital activity, used for
      a week after discharge from the ICU at Zealand University Hospital Køge, can predict physical
      function at three-month follow up.

      The hospital activity will be measured with actigraphy, a measurement tool that quantifies
      activity level. The activity will be measured for 7 days after ICU discharge. The actigraph
      is to be worn as a bracelet.

      The physical function will be measured with Chelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool
      (CPAx). CPAx is assessed at ICU discharge and after three months.

    <textblock>
      Treatment at an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is often needed for the survival of critically ill
      patients, but it can take a long time to recover. A number of high quality studies have shown
      that patients experience functional impairments for a long period after discharge, even for
      years.

      These patients may suffer from a number of other negative influences of their critical
      illness and ICU stay, e.g. memory problems, episodes of depression, cognitive dysfunction and
      sleeping disorders. These symptoms are seen in both medical and surgical patients and has
      been named the Post Intensive Care Syndrome.

      Physical rehabilitation is important and must start already during admission, in order to
      regain some of the function and independence of the patients. This has a well documented
      effect on both mental and physical wellbeing.

      Actigraphy is a newer way of quantifying the activity level continuously. It is validated and
      has been used in the ICU to assess agitation and sedation and in an oncological, surgical and
      even an ICU population to assess sleep.

      It is easy to use, non-invasive and inexpensive. It is worn like a bracelet and doesn't
      impair the patients mobility or ambulation.

      Another issue when evaluating physical impairments is the choice of method for assessing
      physical function. For this study, the investigators use the Chelsea Critical Care Physical
      Assessment Tool (CPAx) as it has good validity and clinimetric properties and is easy to use.
      Also, it can be done as part of the daily training as it is developed specifically for the
      ICU.

      The aim of this study is to investigate how the in-hospital activity level of patients after
      ICU discharge is associated with their physical function at three months post discharge.
