  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rhabdomyolysis is a common condition in the UAA. Support is heterogeneous, it is in most
      cases a mass hyperhydration. The idea is to initially with an EPP simultaneously screened for
      the most affected by this disease and aggravating factors population, associated
      comorbidities.

      The rhabdomyolysis prognosis depends mainly on the etiology and associated comorbidities.

        -  Acute renal failure and hyperkalemia are the major complications that worsen the
           prognosis.

        -  In most cases, acute renal failure is reversible. Acute renal failure caused by renal
           vasoconstriction with ischemia, precipitation of myoglobin in the tubules and direct
           cytotoxic action of myoglobin.

      If the prime mover of rhabdomyolysis is ischemia (or hypoxia) cell, we now know that the
      tissue damage is greatly aggravated during muscle reperfusion, creating ischemia-reperfusion.
      Reperfusion will not only cause the release into the bloodstream of the cell contents
      myocytes but also an increase in necrotic areas. Indeed, the massive arrival of oxygen at the
      myocyte will cause significant production of free radicals, increasing their toxic effects.

      Predictive factors of acute renal failure is creatinine and urea. The urine alkalinisation by
      bicarbonates is questionable oral alkalizing seems to be an alternative when possible (oral
      alkaline solution) but not used to this day.

      The track N-acetyl cysteine as an antioxidant that can possibly have an effect on release of
      the free radicals during reperfusion by decreasing their toxicity is still not considered
      clinically.

      Main objective / secondary:

      Evaluation of current professional practice:

      I. Identify the most common etiologies encountered in our SAU. II. Identify the / types of
      people most affected by this disease III. Detect the most common complications of H0 support
      and evolution H48 if the patient not transferred IV. Evaluate the emergency treatment at the
      initial charge.

      Methodology :

      DESIGN:

      It is a non-interventional retrospective single-center study, within the Department of
      Emergency GHPSJ, to an EPP and output the results regarding the type of population most
      affected by this disease with the most common etiologies in our support (what we are doing).

      Time study:

      Study on patient records being passed on to the emergency 12 months out with a diagnosis of
      rhabdomyolysis.
