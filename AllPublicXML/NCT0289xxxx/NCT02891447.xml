  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn whether cytoreduction surgery (surgery
      to reduce or remove lesions), gastrectomy (where all or part of the stomach is removed), and
      hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (HIPEC, a heated chemotherapy treatment delivered
      directly inside the abdomen during surgery) can help control the disease in patients with
      gastric and/or gastroesophageal cancer. The safety of these procedures will also be studied.

      Study Procedures:

      If participant is eligible and agree to take part, they will have the following procedures:

        -  Standard-of-care cytoreduction surgery

        -  Standard-of-care gastrectomy

        -  HIPEC treatment during surgery, where participant will receive mitomycin and cisplatin
           over about 60 minutes. HIPEC treatment means participant will receive mitomycin and
           cisplatin over about 60 minutes. Heated mitomycin and cisplatin will be delivered
           through plastic tubing that is connected to a pump into the abdominal cavity. The pump
           pushes the heated mitomycin and cisplatin into the abdominal cavity and then pulls it
           out and recirculates the mitomycin and cisplatin. The skin of the abdominal cavity is
           temporarily closed during the abdominal wash. A pump will be used to pump the heated
           mitomycin and cisplatin in and out of the abdominal cavity over 60 minutes while the
           surgeon gently presses on the abdominal wall so the mitomycin and cisplatin reaches all
           areas in the abdominal cavity. After 60 minutes, the mitomycin and cisplatin is removed
           and the abdominal cavity will be washed. The remaining fluid will be removed before the
           surgeon permanently closes the abdominal cavity with stitches.

        -  Participant will also receive sodium thiosulfate to help protect the kidneys and lower
           the risk of side effects from cisplatin.

      Participant will sign separate consents for the cytoreduction and the gastrectomy that will
      explain what is done and the risks involved.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Patient's active participation in this study will be over after their surgery.

      Follow Up:

      Within 4 weeks after participant's surgery and again every 6 months after that, they will
      visit the clinic or be called on the phone. Participant will be asked how they are feeling
      and if they are having any problems. If participant is are called, these calls should last
      about 5 minutes.

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a CT scan, MRI, or positron
      emission tomography (PET)/CT scan of their abdomen, pelvis, and/or chest to check the status
      of the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Mitomycin and cisplatin are FDA-approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of gastric and gastroesophageal cancer. The combination of drugs
      and surgery is investigational.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
