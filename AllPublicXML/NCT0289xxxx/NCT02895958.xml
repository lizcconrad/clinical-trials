    <textblock>
      Hard-to-reach groups such as those attending addiction and homeless services are particularly
      at risk for HCV-associated liver disease progression as they do not engage in treatment, have
      poor attendance records for appointments, and are at risk of progression to cirrhosis without
      evaluation and detection. These patients are therefore &quot;silently&quot; progressing in the
      community and may be close to decompensation. Once a patient goes over that critical stage
      from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis, the cost to the patient in terms of their
      health, and the cost to the state in terms of the management of cirrhosis related
      complications are great.

      As part of this investigator-led community-based treatment protocol we aim to demonstrate the
      utility of an integrated community-based care partnership between primary and secondary care
      to best evaluate and treat such hard to reach populations.

      We aim to actively find fibrosis levels of HCV related liver disease using the FibroScan
      diagnostic tool, and support patients to be treated for their HCV with the newly available
      DAAs and be cured of their HCV infection and disease through:

        1. Active case finding by travelling to the services used by 'at risk' groups as opposed to
           giving appointments to the patient to attend hospital.

        2. Locating HCV patients (with positive RNA or HCV antigen) that are 'lost to follow up'.

        3. Staging and risk-stratifying HCV patients locally to support access to therapy.

        4. Educating HCV patients around new assessment tools and treatments.

        5. Setting up and supporting the initiation of treatment in the community e.g. daily
           dispensing of medication/treatment with methadone.

        6. Providing on-going harm reduction advice on preventing reinfection.

        7. Work in partnership with Methadone prescribing GP practices and Drug Treatment Centres
           from the North and South Dublin catchment area

                  subjects must agree to 7 months post-treatment contraception if taking ribavirin
                  and one month post- treatment contraception for Zepatier only.

          7. Stable attender in the site of enrolment (receiving OST at least 3 months before
             enrolment and were at least 80 % adherent to OST appointments)

          9. Fibroscan done as per HSE Hepatitis C Advisory Group guidelines.

         10. Safety bloods done prior to study including a HGB &gt; 9.5g/dL, platelets &gt; 75,000, AST &lt;
             10x ULN, albumin levels &gt; 30g/L.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. 1. Child Pugh B or C (see Appendix 10.1 for Child-Pugh Classification)

          2. HCV non-G1/G4

          3. History of decompensated liver disease

          4. Laboratory exclusions include platelet count &lt;75,000, albumin &lt;30gm/L, Alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          5. Subject is enrolled in one or more investigational drug protocols, which may impact on
             assessment of HCV treatment with Zepatier (+/-ribavirin).

          6. Subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, unable to complete the study dosing
             period and protocol evaluations and assessments.

          7. Patients with alcohol and drug use problems that in the view of investigator will
             compromise adherence to compliance with the study will be excluded.

          8. Subject is either pregnant or breastfeeding.

          9. Subject suffers from any serious medical condition (such as pancreatitis, diabetes,
             congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy or other cardiac dysfunction), which in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject.

         10. Subject has a pre-existing mental, physical, or substance abuse disorder that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with
             the dosing schedule and protocol evaluations and assessments.

         11. Subject has a history of inflammatory bowel disease or intestinal malignancy,
             intestinal ischemia, malabsorption, or other gastrointestinal dysfunction, which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, may interfere with drug absorption or render the
             subject unable to take oral medication.

         12. Subject has any acute laboratory abnormality at screening, which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would preclude the subject's participation in the study of an
             investigational compound. If subjects are found to have an acute Grade 4 laboratory
             abnormality at screening, this test may be repeated once within the 45-day screening
             window. Any verified Grade 4 laboratory abnormality would exclude a subject from study
             participation.

             agents within 28 days prior to Screening, or has an anticipated need for these agents

             the SPC) within 14 days of commencement of investigational product, or an anticipated
             need during the study.

         15. Subject has a history of allergy to any of the treatment products or any excipients
             therein.
