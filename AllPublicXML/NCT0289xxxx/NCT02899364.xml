      Rationale: the cornerstone treatment of a heart attack is a procedure called primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI): the cardiologist uses a catheter and guides it
      through an artery, mostly the wrist artery, to the site of the narrowing in the coronary
      artery in the heart and opens it with a balloon. Thereafter a small metal tube is placed at
      the site of the narrowing to keep the artery open). However, a heart attack still leads to
      irreversible injury to the heart with a risk of heart failure. The investigators have
      evidence from (cell/animal) that administration of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is also made
      in the human body, has been shown to protect the heart muscle and organs from damage caused
      by the lack of oxygen resulting from a heart attack. Data in humans suggests that sodium
      thiosulfate (STS) (a medicine that releases H2S in the body, and is already used to treat
      other diseases, i.e. cyanide poisoning and renal failure associated diseases) can be
      administered safely.

      Objective: to evaluate if sodium thiosulfate protects the heart from damage caused by a heart
      attack.

      Study design: a single centre, double blind (both doctor and patient do not know which
      treatment patient gets), randomized controlled clinical trial.

      A total of 380 patients, aged 18 years and above, undergoing treatment for a first heart
      attack are divided in two groups (decided by chance): 1 group receives sodium thiosulfate,
      the other receives a fake medicine (salt water that looks exactly like sodium thiosulfate).

      After 4 months patients receive a magnetic scan of the heart to evaluate the permanent damage
      of the heart muscle. When comparing the patients from both groups to each other the
      investigators can say something about the effectivity sodium thiosulfate.

      Introduction and rationale:

      Despite the recent advances in treatment, acute myocardial infarction (AMI) frequently
      results in permanent myocardial injury imposing an increased risk for adverse cardiac
      remodelling, diminished cardiac function and the development of heart failure. Decreased
      cardiac function after PPCI is associated with impaired prognosis{1}. In addition to PPCI,
      cornerstones pharmacological treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) includes; (1) treatment
      direct against blood coagulation with platelet aggregation inhibitors, (2) cholesterol
      lowering treatment with statins; (3) sympathicus inhibition by beta-blocker treatment; and
      (4) inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system{2}. These therapies were
      successfully implemented over the last decades and resulted in substantial improvements of
      prognosis after AMI.

      Although PPCI has a tremendous benefit in AMI, not only ischemia but also reperfusion itself
      is considered to cause myocardial injury and cardiomyocyte death{3,4}.This phenomena is
      referred to as &quot;ischemia reperfusion injury&quot; in literature and is caused by the sudden
      restoration of blood flow and its accompanying intracellular acidity (pH) change and calcium
      overload, cardiomyocyte hypercontracture, myocardial inflammation, oxidative stress
      generation and mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening{4-6}. Reducing ischemia
      reperfusion injury is expected to further decrease infarct size, decreasing adverse cardiac
      remodelling and improving cardiac function as well as clinical outcome.

      The investigators expect a substantial beneficial effect of H2S in the prevention of ischemia
      reperfusion injury. H2S is the third endogenous gaseous transmitter next to carbon monoxide
      (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) and is involved as a physiological mediator in several body organ
      and tissue processes{7}. H2S is synthesized endogenously by enzymatic and non-enzymatic
      pathways. A non-enzymatic pathway is by the reductive reaction with thiosulfate, with
      pyruvate acting as a hydrogen donor. Thiosulfate itself acts as an intermediate in the sulfur
      metabolism of cysteine and is known as a metabolite of H2S and in that way also able to
      produce H2S, especially under hypoxic conditions{8,9}.

      H2S has been shown to protect from myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury in various
      experimental animal models; e.g. it reduces infarct size and apoptosis and attenuates cardiac
      function. Inhibition of leukocyte endothelial cell interactions, neutralization of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and the reduction of apoptotic signalling are the suggested as
      additional mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect of H2S{5,10-13}. H2S has been
      shown to attenuate myocardial ischemia reperfusion in cellular, rodents and porcine animal
      models{7,10-23}. H2S can be safely administered intravenously as STS to humans. STS has been
      demonstrated to detoxify cyanide poisoning in 1895 in dogs, is used in humans since 1933 for
      the treatment of cyanide intoxication, is used since the eighties for treatment of vascular
      calcifications in end-stage renal disease, and is used to prevent toxicity of cisplatin
      treatment{24-26}. More recently, studies have shown STS can delay the progression of coronary
      artery calcification in haemodialysis patients{27,28}.

      Hypothesis

      The GIPS-IV is a randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that STS can be safely
      administered in patient presented with STEMI and, when administered at time of reperfusion,
      will decreases ischemia-reperfusion injury resulting in a reduced myocardial infarct size.
      The aim of the GIPS-IV trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of STS compared to
      placebo treatment on myocardial infarct size in patients presenting with STEMI undergoing
      PPCI in a double blind randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Study design

      The GIPS-IV trial is a single-centre, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double
      blind trial. A total of 380 patients presenting with a first STEMI will be included. All
      patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive STS (12.5 mg iv) or matching
      placebo. Study medication will be administered twice. The first dose of study medication will
      be administered immediately after checking inclusion and exclusion criteria and obtaining
      verbal informed consent at the cath-lab. The second dose of study medication will be
      administered 6 hours later, at the Coronary Care Unit (CCU). The study will take place at the
      University Medical Centre of Groningen (UMCG), a high-volume centre with experience in care
      and research in PPCI of patients with STEMI. The primary endpoint will be based on infarct
      size as measured by late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (LGE
      CMR)-imaging 4 months after STEMI, a period in which the remodelling of the heart is expected
      to be completed{29,30}. LGE CMR-imaging is a well-recognized, validated, and highly
      reproducible technique{31,32}. Total follow-up duration of the GIPS-IV trial is 2 years.
