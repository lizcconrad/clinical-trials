      This pilot study will be a clinical trial to test the feasibility and effectiveness of a
      kidney transplant (KT) prehabilitation intervention in adults with end stage renal disease
      (ESRD) who are within 3-6 months of transplantation.

      Prehabilitation is the enhancement of functional capacity of a patient to improve their
      ability to withstand a future stressor. The investigators primary objective is to demonstrate
      feasibility for prehabilitation in Aim 1 and test whether the number of prehabilitation
      sessions is associated with increased physical activity. The investigators will formally test
      whether prehabilitation is associated with a reduction in short term and long term KT
      outcomes as part of Aim 2. The investigators will test whether there is an effect of
      prehabilitation on short-term (KT length of stay&gt; 2 weeks, early hospital readmission and
      delayed graft function) and long-term (acute rejection (within the first year), 1 year
      patient and graft survival) outcomes compared to standard of care controls. Participants will
      be followed for 3-6 months or until they receive a kidney transplant.

    <description>The study will use a generic prehabilitation program which will include the following components: Warm-up, cardiovascular training, strength training, flexibility training, and cool down. Prehabilitation will occur once per week and approximately 1 hour in duration. Participants will take part in prehabilitation until they receive a kidney transplant which by study design is approximately for 3-6 months.</description>
