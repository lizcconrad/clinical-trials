  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a prospective, non-interventional, observational single arm study.

      A minimum of 150 patients will be recruited from approximately 30 haematology/oncology sites
      in the Netherlands. In all cases, the decision to treat the patient with azacitidine was
      already made prior to the decision to enter the subject into the study.

      Recruitment will continue until end of June 2015, provided a minimum of 150 patients have
      been included in the study. When this date is reached, all patients on azacitidine will
      continue to be followed until the last patient enrolled has been followed for 12 months.

    <measure>Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification system. The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE VERSION 4.03 whenever possible</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fact-Anemia Quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) questionnaire was used to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In addition to general HRQoL, the FACT-An measures the impact of fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms on patient functioning.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of patients with a Hematologic Improvement Using International Working Group (IWG Criteria for Hematologic Improvement Cheson 2000) Criteria for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Assessed by the investigator in daily clinical practice</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall hematological improvement (HI) was defined as any type (major or minor) of improvement of HI-E, HI-P, or HI-N. Criteria: Pretreatment=hemoglobin &lt;100g/L or RBC transfusion-dependent, platelet count &lt;100x10^9/L or platelet transfusion dependent, absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.5x10^9/L. Sponsor's determination was derived using clinically relevant data.
Denominator for progression/relapse after HI included participants who had achieved HI.</description>

    <measure>Time to treatment Failure daily clinical practice</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Treatment Failure is defined as the time from randomization to treatment discontinuation for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient preference, or death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival in daily clinical practice</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 4 years</time_frame>
