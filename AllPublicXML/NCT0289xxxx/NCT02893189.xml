    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will receive escalating doses of 4G7-CARD T-cells paralleling clinical
      standard of care with unmanipulated donor lymphocytes. There are 3 intra-patient dose levels
      planned.

      Patients will be followed up regularly during the interventional phase of the study until 12
      months post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell infusion. Thereafter patients will be followed up annually
      for years 2 and 3.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive escalating doses of 4G7-CARD T-cells without pre-conditioning,
      paralleling clinical standard of care with unmanipulated donor lymphocytes. Intra-patient
      dose escalation will proceed at intervals of not less than 8 weeks, dependent on development
      of toxicity or evidence of efficacy and confirmation by the Trial Management Group.

      Three dose cohorts levels are planned, and dosing will be according to total CD3+ T- cell
      dose as this correlates with toxicity in the unmanipualated donor lymphocyte setting:

        -  Dose Level 1: 1x10^6 CD3+ T-cells/kg (starting dose for all patients)

        -  Dose Level 2: 3x10^6 CD3+ T-cells/kg

        -  Dose Level 3: 1x10^7 CD3+ T-cells/kg

      The inter-patient dosing for the first 3 patients will be at least 28 days, following TMG
      confirmation. After the first 3 patients have received dose level 1 the Independent Data
      Management Committee will advise whether the inter-patient dosing interval for subsequent
      patients can be shortened.

      Patients will be followed up regularly during the interventional phase of the study until 12
      months post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell infusion. During the long term follow up phase of the study
      (years 2-3 post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell infusion) patients will be followed-up annually for
      overall survival, disease status and safety.

      All patients will enter long term follow up until 3 years post-final 4G7-CARD T-cell
      infusion.
