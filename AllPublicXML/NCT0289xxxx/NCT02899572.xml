  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Erection disorders constitute the first sign of vascular injury in type 2 diabetes patients.
      The important frequency of these disorders and their consequences in term of quality of life
      have a strong contrast with the actual interest showed for them by the medical community.

      Natural evolution of the disease and its management make that these disorders often occur
      little time after a therapeutic change. As a consequence, patients often accuse their
      medication to be responsible for the appearance of these disorders. This confusion,
      associated to false believes that may have the patients on their disease or their treatment,
      often leads to treatment discontinuation which has a deleterious effect on the disease
      evolution.

      Educational therapy programs showed a positive impact on therapeutic adherence. Increasing
      patients' knowledge on their disease and treatments increases their therapeutic adherence and
      makes it easier to balance diabetes and therefore limits complications appearance.

      Educational therapy programs concern today the disease, its process, its evolution, its
      treatments, their efficacy, their adverse effects but erection disorders are not specifically
      addressed.

      This study aims to evaluate the impact of a sexology consultation on diabetes balance
      measured via HbA1c rate. This consultation aims at precising this particular symptom of
      erection disorders, without any medicine prescription. The aim is to explain to patients the
      different links between their symptoms, diabetes, medicines and themselves.
