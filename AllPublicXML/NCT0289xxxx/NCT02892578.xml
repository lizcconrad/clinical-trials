    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia. Some studies shown that systematic
      screening with electrocardiogram could improve atrial fibrillation detection. No studies are
      available in nursing home. The goal of this study is to screen atrial fibrillation in
      patients who live in nursing home.

      A prospective observational cross sectional multicenter study.

      The goal of this study is to detect atrial fibrillation in nursing home people aged 65 years
      old and above, with systematic electrocardiogram. Participants agreement will be collected.
      Participants characteristics data will be collected in all nursing home. For all
      participants, one visit were realised with electrocardiogram, and symptoms survey. Data were
      anonymised on each center before analysed.
