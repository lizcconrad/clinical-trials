  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Germany about 5 to 20% of children suffer from early childhood caries (ECC). Preceding
      results of eye-tracking-studies on the perception of patients with unilateral cleft and
      patients with severe orthognathic malocclusion let us assume that caries and missing teeth
      might influence the observer's focus. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that
      the faces of patients with ECC and patients with signs of dental treatment (crown, gap etc.)
      are contemplated differently from and assessed more negatively than healthy patients.
      Particular attention should be paid to potential differences between the findings of the two
      observer-groups (medical laypersons/ dental students).

      In Germany about 5 to 20% of children suffer from early childhood caries (ECC). Resulting in
      complications like damages of the permanent teeth, pain and developmental disorder of the
      affected jaw, ECC might additionally lead to social exclusion. Previous eye-tracking-studies
      about the perception of patients with unilateral cleft and patients with severe orthognathic
      malocclusion demonstrated that these variations are transferring the observer's focus from
      the eyes and nose to the affected region. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis
      that the faces of patients with ECC and patients with signs of dental treatment (crown, gap
      etc.) are contemplated differently from and assessed more negatively than healthy patients.
      Particular attention should be paid to potential differences between the findings of the two
      observer-groups (medical laypersons/ dental students).
