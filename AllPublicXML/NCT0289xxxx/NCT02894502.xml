    <textblock>
      The aims of this study will be to evaluate the effect of motivational interviewing (MI) to
      improve self-care in heart failure (HF) patients and caregiver contributions to HF self-care.
      Also this study will evaluate the effect of MI on the following secondary outcomes: In HF
      patients: HF somatic symptom perception, generic and specific quality of life, anxiety and
      depression, sleep quality, mutuality with caregiver, hospitalizations, use of emergency
      services, and mortality; In caregivers: generic quality of life, anxiety and depression,
      mutuality with patient, preparedness, social support and sleep quality.

    <description>The intervention will consist of a brief session of motivational interviewing (MI) performed by a trained nurse. During MI, the interventionist will address one or two aspects of self-care that the participants want to address. After this first intervention, the same interventionist will contact the participant by telephone to improve the first intervention and provide further support as needed. These telephone contact will be done three times at two week intervals following the first intervention (for a total of two months). Patients and caregivers that receive the intervention also will be given informational material on HF management that is consistent with international guidelines.</description>
