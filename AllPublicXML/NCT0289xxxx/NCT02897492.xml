    <textblock>
      Patients with chest pain may have postponed or missed diagnosis of acute coronary events due
      to relatively late detection of troponin elevation. The study will investigate a new
      diagnostic method for early detection of even minimal troponin elevation in patients admitted
      with chest pain.

      A new diagnostic method will be applicated in the recent studies.

        Enrolled subjects will be patients admitted to Rambam health campus for the investigation
        of chest pain. Five m&quot;l blood will be collected for troponin assay. No further intervention
        will be applied for subjects. Blood will be centrifuged and plasma separated for study
        purposes (detailed in &quot;methods&quot;- section 3.2.1.
