    <textblock>
      Post-operative wound infections can prolong hospital stays, increase rates of readmission to
      the intensive care unit, and increase the costs of treatment significantly. This study will
      conduct a prospective chart review of all patients undergoing elective spinal surgery on both
      the neurosurgery and orthopedic spine services at two facilities on an academic campus. The
      investigators will collect the data of those patients who develop post-surgical infections.
      This data will then be analyzed and compared to published data from other studies. The aim of
      this investigation is to passively collect this infection data, which may ultimately provide
      needed baseline incidence rates using current and standard protocols.
