  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypotension often happens immediately after anesthetic induction. Particularly in 5-10
      minutes after anesthetic induction it is reported to happen more frequently. Patients may
      have preexisting hypovolemia resulting from dehydration and impaired compensatory responses,
      which increase the risk. However, it is still challenging to assess intravascular volume
      status in spontaneously breathing patients before anesthetic induction. Recently, the
      measurement of corrected flow time in carotid artery was introduced as quite useful, simple
      and noninvasive for the evaluation of circulating blood volume. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate whether corrected carotid artery flow time as determined by ultrasonography in
      spontaneously breathing patients before general anesthesia can predict hypotension after
      induction.

    <description>Corrected carotid artery flow time is measured using 10-5 MHz linear probe on a portable ultrasound machine. On the two-dimensional image, the optimal image of the long-axis view is obtained at the left common carotid artery. The sample volume is placed on the center of the lumen, 2 cm proximal to the bulb, and a pulsed wave Doppler examination was performed. Then, cardiac cycle time and carotid flow time is measured. Carotid flow time is measured between the upstroke of the flow tracing and the dicrotic notch, and it is corrected for pulse rate by dividing flow time by the square root of the cardiac cycle time to calculate corrected carotid artery flow time (flow time/√cycle time). The blood pressure was taken before anesthetic induction and every two minutes after anesthetic induction till ten minutes after endotracheal intubation.</description>
