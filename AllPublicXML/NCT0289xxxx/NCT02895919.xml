  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine non inferiority of direct inoculation of ascitic fluid in lab
      as compared to current culture media standard, bedside inoculation with blood culture
      bottles.

      The purpose of this study is to validate the principal study that recommends inoculation with
      blood culture bottles at bedside versus lab inoculation (delayed inoculation) of ascitic
      fluid in the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. This study had a small sample
      size (29) and goal is to validate results with a larger sample size. The aim of current
      proposed study is to assess for non inferiority of lab inoculation of ascitic fluid culture
      versus current standard of blood culture bottles. To achieve 90% power and true sensitivity
      95%, goal is to enroll 460 patients within the course of a year or until number of samples is
      reached, with plan to compare the sensitivity of bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles
      versus the lab using sterile plate techniques as per current lab culture technique. Unlike
      previous study, all comers for ascitic fluid collected will be analyzed that are to undergo
      diagnostic paracentesis.

        Patient population will include all patients undergoing diagnostic paracentesis comparing
        standard culture protocol (bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles with ascitic fluid)
        with an additional culture collected for study arm. Patients will be all comers for
        diagnostic paracentesis.
