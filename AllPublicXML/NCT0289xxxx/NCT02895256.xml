    <textblock>
      Cluster headache is a syndrome characterized by disabling headache and accompanying autonomic
      symptoms. Despite cluster headache is called &quot;suicide headache&quot;, its natural history has not
      been well investigated. The investigators aimed to investigate its disease course, overall
      prognosis, and treatment pattern in retrospective cohort.
