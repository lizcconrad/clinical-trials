  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, open-label, single-arm study, to evaluate the ease of use,
      tolerability, efficacy and safety of the Vibrant Capsule administered in the home
      environment.

      One arm will be assessed: Vibrant Capsule administered twice a week.

      Patients will follow a 2 weeks baseline period and then take the Vibrant Capsule for a
      treatment period of 6 weeks.

      During the 2 weeks of baseline, patients will be asked to refrain from taking any medication
      or supplement to relieve their constipation.

      After 14 days the patients will return and eligibility will be re-assessed. Patients will be
      instructed to complete a simple patient eDiary each day throughout the duration of the study.
      After 3 weeks of treatment, the patient will attend for evaluation and to receive new
      capsules. A final visit will take place at the end of the 6 week treatment period.

             stimulant laxatives used for at least one month at recommended dose)

          3. Patients with an average of less than 3 Spontaneous Bowel Movements per week and at
             least 1 Spontaneous Bowel Movements per week

          4. Normal colonoscopy performed within 10 years prior to study participation, unless the

             full dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs more than three times a week for at
             least six months. Patients on cardiac doses of aspirin may be enrolled in the study

         12. Patients with pelvic floor dysfunction/defecatory disorder, based on patient history

         13. Participation in another clinical study within one month prior to screening.

         14. Women who are pregnant or lactating

         15. Use of any medication for constipation relief during the study, except as rescue
             medication, as indicated by study rules

         16. Inability to use an electronic daily Diary (on a computer, phone application, tablet
             or other electronic device) to report bowel movements, symptoms and medication usage

         17. Any other condition which in the opinion of the investigator may adversely affect the
             safety of the patient or would limit the patient's ability to complete the study
