  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective treatment for a variety of psychiatric
      disorders. However, despite continued advances in ECT technique, neurocognitive dysfunction
      continues to be a frequent adverse effect. Declarative memory and less so selective memory
      are often impaired after an ECT course. Immediate memory, however, is broadly preserved. It
      is hypothesized that memory impairments are due to ECT induced disruptions on long term
      potentiation as well as in cerebral flux and glutamatergic and cholinergic systems. Different
      pharmacological agents for the treatment of ECT induced cognitive dysfunction have been
      tried. Agents such as opioids, vasopressin, neuropeptides, cholinergic agents, thyroid
      hormone, and stimulants have been used with equivocal results, and no controlled studies
      showed clear efficacy.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, painless brain stimulation
      treatment that uses direct electrical currents to stimulate specific parts of the brain.
      Electrical currents are applied constantly at low intensities (1-2 mA) over a long period,
      usually in minutes (5-30 minutes), to achieve changes in cortical excitability by influencing
      spontaneous neural activity. There are two types of stimulation with tDCS: anodal and
      cathodal stimulation. Anodal stimulation acts to excite neuronal activity while cathodal
      stimulation inhibits or reduces neuronal activity. Several studies demonstrated moderate to
      strong effect sizes of tDCS in various neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric settings. Majority
      of studies show positive effects of tDCS on cognitive functioning among healthy volunteers
      and subjects with neurological or psychiatric conditions. Beneficial effects of online
      stimulation applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex have been reported for
      working memory, attention and information processing in depressed patients. To the
      investigators' knowledge no studies have evaluated the potential efficacy of tDCS for the
      prevention of ECT induced cognitive adverse effects.

      In the current study, the investigators propose a double blind, randomized controlled trial
      to test the use of tDCS as a strategy to prevent or mitigate the memory impairments
      frequently associated with an ECT course.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, random assignment, double blind, parallel group study with an adaptive
      design comparing the efficacy of tDCS performed during the course of ECT to that of sham tDCS
      in patients with a major depressive episode being treated with ECT. The investigators intend
      to recruit patients who are scheduled to receive an acute course of ECT. Patients who are
      able and willing to provide written informed consent, and who meet study criteria when
      screened, will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to receive a course of real tDCS or sham
      tDCS. Subjects will receive a standard acute course of bifrontal ECT (3X/week) and depressive
      symptomatology will be monitored with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24)
      before each treatment.

      The primary outcome will be change in cognition from baseline to end of study. The
      investigators will monitor cognitive changes before and after each ECT treatment, at the end
      of the treatment course and two months after the last treatment.

      Secondary outcome will be the number of treatments needed to achieve remission. Remission is
      defined as two consecutive Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) scores &lt;= 10, and HRSD
      total score does not change &gt; 3 points or remains &lt; 6 at the last two consecutive treatments.
      In addition, the investigators will collect data on other treatment parameters such as
      seizure duration, electroencephalogram (EEG) morphology as well as hemodynamic changes.
