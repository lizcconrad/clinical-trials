  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative surgical pain has been extensively study with regard to anaesthesia pain
      modalities, however little is published with regards to various arthroscopic shoulder
      surgical techniques. An intriguing characteristic of shoulder arthroscopy is the various
      arthroscopic pump pressures used by different surgeons. One could hypothesize that excessive
      water retention from the arthroscopic pump could causes excessive tissue pressure and
      swelling resulting in post operative pain. Unfortunately we could not find any literature in
      the English language regarding varying pressure pump settings on post operative pain control.
      For that reason we would like to assess how variable pump pressure effect tissue pressure
      over pre set time points, and how this may relate to post operative pain control.
