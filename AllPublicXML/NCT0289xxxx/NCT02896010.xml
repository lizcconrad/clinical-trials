    <textblock>
      Sweetch is a personalized mobile-health platform coaching system (mobile phone app) designed
      to promote adherence to physical activity guidelines for people with prediabetes.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mobile phone app Sweetch seeks to increase leisure time physical activity rather than
      formal exercise through the use of a behavioral analytics engine that continuously process
      various aspects of the user's life habits, taking into account the user's demographics,
      behavioral change status, schedule, actual activity patterns, and more. The rationale behind
      this approach is that long-term adherence and patient engagement are more likely to be
      achieved when demands on manual user data entry are kept at a minimum. Compared to similar
      smartphone-assisted prevention apps, there are two novel features of the Sweetch app that may
      increase its efficacy. First, it uses a &quot;just-in-time&quot; adaptive intervention&quot; approach that
      tailors recommendations to the user's day-to-day routine and his or her readiness for
      behavioral change. Second, and most importantly, it requires no direct involvement by the
      user, since all the necessary data is collected using built-in tracking pedometers,
      accelerometer and GPS (Global Positioning System) sensors on smartphones. In contrast,
      interventions that focus on dietary changes (i.e. calorie reduction, change in macronutrient
      content), require active user tracking at every meal, which is difficult to maintain in the
      long-term even with the use of sophisticated, electronic calorie counting tools. For these
      reasons, the Sweetch app may achieve greater long-term adherence, which is usually a limiting
      factor to efficacy of mobile health interventions.
