      3rd generation cephalosporins (C3G) are the antibiotics recommended in probabilistic in most
      enteric infections in France including pyelonephritis and bacteraemia.

      However, the prevalence of resistance of Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli to C3G is
      continuously increasing for several years. In 2012, in France, the proportion of E. resistant
      or intermediate coli categorized to C3G is 10 to 25% (EARSS data).

      Antibiotics not adapted early in severe sepsis is responsible for worse prognosis for
      patients in terms of morbidity and mortality and unnecessary prolongation of the DMS.

      At St. Joseph's Hospital on enterobacteria levels of resistance to C3G is 15.4%.

      To avoid overuse of carbapenems for probabilistic antibiotic and to quickly prescribe
      antibiotics adapted to the resistance of the bacteria, it is interesting to use a rapid test
      for detection of resistance to C3G.

      The Lacta ™ test could be used in this indication. This is a rapid test diagnostic
      orientation detecting hydrolysis of a substrate (chromogenic cephalosporin) by the enzymatic
      action of ESBL, cAMP-type cephalosporinases and carbapenemases. This test was initially
      marketed for rapid detection of resistance to C3G enterobacteria from isolated bacterial
      colonies in culture.

      Main objective / secondary:

      We propose to conduct a study with a double objective:

        1. To assess the analytical performance and its positioning relative to all the tests
           available to us in urine samples,

        2. To evaluate prospectively the clinical impact test in urinary infections

      Expected results and prospects:

      This study will define the performance and limitations of this test in the most difficult
      situations (low number of bacteria / ml, haematic urine, ...) and will specify its
      indications and its place among all other tests before implanting it in our routine, as
      appropriate.

      The clinical impact study will provide medical and economic analysis data including
      shortening time to adapt antibiotic therapies and put in septic isolation to argue the
      implementation of this test routinely.

    <measure>Assessment of the relevance between antibiotic susceptibility and the antibiotic chosen,with phone questionary</measure>
    <time_frame>Hour 48</time_frame>
    <description>The biologist advise, as usual, the physician about the antibiotic to choose at H0 according to the result of Beta Lacta™Test. After the first result given, the biologist ask, at hour 48,the physician about the antibiotic chosen and determine the relevance according to the antibiotic susceptibility.
The answer can be yes or no.</description>
