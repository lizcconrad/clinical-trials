  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will conduct an initial clinical evaluation of this support program to examine its
      impact on reducing caregiver stress, increasing confidence in daily feeding, and improving
      weight-for-age growth percentiles in infants with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caregivers of infants with CHD are at high-risk of anxiety and distress due to the complex
      daily caregiving demands. Previous research has demonstrated decreased parental stress and
      more optimal infant developmental outcomes with a psychosocial intervention delivered to
      caregivers of infants with CHD prior to hospital discharge as well as reduced healthcare use
      in caregivers who received medical video-consultations during the interstage surgical
      palliation period. This study will implement a telemedicine intervention program
      (MyHeartBaby) to support caregivers remotely in the daily care and adjustment to having an
      infant with chronic medical needs. The program is delivered via video chat over the Internet
      and caregivers will complete questionnaires about general family information, stress, and
      feeding their infant.
