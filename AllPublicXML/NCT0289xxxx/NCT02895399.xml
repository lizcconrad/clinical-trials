    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer of women in French Guiana. Studies have
      shown that populations living in remote villages in the interior of the territory have early
      sexual relations and that multiple sexual partnerships are frequent. Hence, the main
      objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of HPV in these areas, and the
      predictive factors and epidemiology of this viral infection.

      Methods - This multicentric cross sectional study aimed the population of women aged 20 to 65
      years, living in the remote villages along the Maroni and Oyapock rivers. Women wishing to
      participate will be included after being informed of the study team schedule through radio
      address and key opinion leaders. The search for HPV and cytologic examinations will be
      performed for each woman. 2 samples will be taken from each woman: one sample will be sent to
      Fort De France hospital for cytology, and HPV testing; cytologic analyses will be performed
      using the 2001 Bethesda classification. Another sample will be sent to Pasteur Institute in
      Cayenne for sequencing and detection of E6 and E7 RNA which are associated with
      carcinogenesis. HPV infection will be defined by the detection of viral DNA using the
      GREINER-BIO-ONE kit. Statistical analysis of the results will use STATA software and mapping
      will use Mapinfo.
