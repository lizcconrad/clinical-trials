    <textblock>
      Single-center, open-label, 2-sequence, 3-period crossover drug-drug interaction study.
      Repeated doses of POL7080 and repeated doses of amikacin will be administered alone or
      combined. In total, 14 subjects will be enrolled to obtain at least 10 evaluable subjects.
      The study consists of an eligibility screening period, up to 3 treatments periods and a
      follow-up visit.
