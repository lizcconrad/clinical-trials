    <textblock>
      Cocaine addiction is a chronic condition with severe cardiac, neurologic, psychiatric and
      social complications. Cocaine is the second most consumed illicit drug in France. Its
      prevalence has been multiplied by 3 between 2000 and 2008, and is still on the rise. Craving,
      the compulsive need to consume, is a key feature of cocaine addiction. It is also predictive
      of treatment efficacy. However, there is no validated treatment for severe cocaine dependence
      yet. Response to current psychological and medical treatment is poor, with 73% relapse after
      3 months. Patients with severe cocaine addiction are thus in a therapeutic deadlock.

      To address these unmet medical needs, the investigators designed a pilot study (n=2) to
      evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nuclei
      (STN-DBS) in severe cocaine addiction with at least one cardiac, neurologic or psychiatric
      complication. Indeed, compulsivity is a critical component of craving, and severe
      treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are already successfully treated
      using STN-DBS. Moreover, animal studies recently demonstrated a therapeutic effect of STN-DBS
      in rats addicted to cocaine. Together, these two lines of research suggest a therapeutic
      effect of STN-DBS in cocaine addiction mediated by an anti-obsessive mechanism on craving.
