  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Currently used crystalloid solutes have a variable composition and may therefore
      influence acid-base status, intra- and extracellular water content and plasma electrolyte
      compositions and have a major impact on organ function and outcome. Despite continuing
      evaluation no superiority of one particular type of fluid has been reached so far. To the
      best of the investigators' knowledge no study in humans has ever assessed whether the type of
      crystalloid fluid given for fluid resuscitation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery has an
      impact on hemodynamic stability and cardiac function so far. Nonetheless in the animal model
      it was shown that the choice of crystalloid fluid may greatly influence cardiac performance

      Primary Aim: In this study the investigators want to clarify whether a balanced type
      acetate-buffered fluid solution in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is associated with
      better hemodynamic stability and cardiac function than a lactate-buffered crystalloid solute.
