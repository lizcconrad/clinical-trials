  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized controlled trial which will include women with ischemic
      heart disease to receive either a self-directed stress reduction program delivered through a
      smart-phone application or activity tracking only for the first month (&quot;early SR
      intervention&quot; and &quot;delayed SR intervention&quot;, respectively). Patients will be monitored for 1
      month for application use and step counts via telephone or email interview and/or collection
      of screen-captured data. Baseline questionnaires will be repeated at the end of one month to
      assess for all primary and secondary measures, at which time the control group (activity
      tracking only) will be introduced to the intervention program. The early SR intervention
      group will not receive a new intervention but will be encouraged to continue using the app.
      Data will be collected for an additional 2 months with all participants in both groups. After
      the three-month study period, the study will close with the collection of final questionnaire
      data.

    <measure>Seattle Angina Questionnaire [SAQ]</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Seattle Angina Questionnaire is a well-validated descriptive instrument for measuring quality of life across five dimensions of coronary artery disease: physical limitation, anginal stability, anginal frequency, treatment satisfaction and disease perception. 45 Patient SAQ scores have been found to be independently prognostic of subsequent mortality, hospitalization, and resource use.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rose Dyspnea Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Rose Dyspnea Score provides additional information about patient dyspnea, which is a common complaint in patients with IHD independent of the presence of heart failure.</description>
