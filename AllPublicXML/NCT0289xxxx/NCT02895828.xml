  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of 2 exercise programs including core stabilization
      exercise and general trunk strengthening exercise programs on trunk muscle activity, physical
      dysfunction, quality of life and lumbar motion in low back pain patient with clinical lumbar
      instability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical lumbar instability is the one of causes of chronic low back pain, that affects to
      pain intensity and quality of life. For clinical studies using core stabilization exercise
      (CSE) as treatment have revealed conflicting findings on pain, functional disability and
      muscle responses in chronic low back pain. The CSE promotes local muscle system that to
      provide lumbar stability. However, the stability of spine related to global muscle system,
      that using in this study.
