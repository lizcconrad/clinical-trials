  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-lactam antibiotics include penicillin and cephalosporins and are among the most
      prescribed antibiotics. This category of drugs is the most involved in immediate allergic
      manifestations with 2% reactions in treated subjects and a fatal outcome in 1/50000
      treatments. Reactions are IgE-mediated and have a considerable but unknown genetic origin,
      revealed by studies in groups of different ethnical origins in the same geographical region.
      There are also some families with a high frequency of allergic reactions without identified
      Mendelian inheritance.

      The purpose of this study is to identify predictive risk factors associated to immediate
      allergic reactions against beta-lactam antibiotics with a pangenomic approach.

      A secondary purpose is to identify rare predictive factors with homozygosity mapping and
      exome sequencing in various families with high risk of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics.
