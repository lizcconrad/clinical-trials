      This research focuses on the development and validation of indicators on the appropriateness
      of oral anticoagulant prescriptions. The investigators want to propose transferable tools to
      other healthcare institutions to allow automated construction of indicators as part of a
      structured approach to improve future practices. The main objective of the study is to
      develop indicators on the appropriateness of oral anticoagulant prescriptions in adult
      medicine automated from the hospital information system and to assess their criterion
      validity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The appropriateness of oral anticoagulant prescriptions (Vitamin K Antagonists and Direct
      Oral Anticoagulants) is a major challenge for improving quality, safety and efficiency of
      care. The large targeted population, prescription frequency and strong risk of severe adverse
      events, especially in healthcare institutions, justify the importance of developing
      indicators on the appropriateness of oral anticoagulant prescriptions and their automated
      implementation from the hospital information system. There is currently a need to develop and
      validate such indicators for integrating them into the hospital clinical practice, as part of
      a structured approach to improve quality and safety of care. As each hospital information
      system is different, the investigators want to propose transposable tools to other healthcare
      institutions to allow an automated construction of these indicators.

      The study will consist of three main steps: 1) identification of indicators on the
      appropriateness of oral anticoagulant prescriptions and their conditions of appropriateness
      (literature review), and analysis of their potential utility and operational characteristic
      (Delphi consensus); 2) operational implementation of the selected indicators from the
      hospital information system, using tools to generalize their implementation to other hospital
      information systems; 3) evaluation of metrological performance and robustness of the selected
      indicators. This is an observation of prescriptions after it has occurred without any
      modification or change of treatment to patients. This study is never Interventional.

      Statistical analysis : for each indicator, the criterion validity will be analyzed thanks to
      prevalence of appropriateness (or not) of oral anticoagulant prescriptions estimated by the
      hospital information system, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive
      values, and area under the ROC curve.

    <time_frame>between month 16 and 18</time_frame>
    <description>Recall, precision and F-measure are criteria for measuring performance of tools tracking information. The recall is defined by the number of relevant concepts that are correctly found by the evaluated automatic tool compared to the number of relevant concepts that are present in the text (in statistics, the recall is the sensitivity). Precision is the number of relevant concepts found on the total number of concepts proposed by the search engine for a given query. The F-measure combines recall and precision as follows:
F-measure = 2 x recall x precision / (recall + precision).</description>
