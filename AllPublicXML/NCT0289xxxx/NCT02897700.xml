    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of this study is to determine if the mainstay chemotherapeutic
      regimens represented by several genotoxic agents including but not limited to
      Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Epirubicin, Fluorouracil and Methotrexate (CDEFM), in the
      format of either a single agent or combinations are safe, tolerable, and effective in the
      treatment of patients with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of breast.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) of breast, or sometimes called invasive ductal carcinoma
      of breast, is the most common type of breast malignancy. About 80% of all breast cancers are
      IDCs.

      Once found, IDC usually has already broken through the wall of the milk duct and begun to
      invade the tissues of the breast. Over time, IDC can spread to the lymph nodes and possibly
      to other areas of the body with high frequency.

      According to the statistics of American Cancer Society, more than 180,000 women in the United
      States are diagnosed with IDC each year. Although IDC can affect women at any age, it is more
      common as they grow older. Further, approximately two-thirds of women are 55 or older when
      they are diagnosed with such this symptom.

      The treatments for invasive ductal carcinoma fall into two broad categories. First, local
      treatments for IDC, including surgery and radiation, which treat the primary tumor and
      surrounding areas such as the chest and lymph nodes. Second, systemic treatments for IDC,
      including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted therapy, which are supposed to deliver
      cytotoxicity throughout the body to eliminate any cancer cells that have left the primary
      site and to help minimize the risk of recurrent disease.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy
      of single or concurrent administration of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, epirubicin,
      fluorouracil and methotrexate (CDEFM) to women undergoing surgery for infiltrating ductal
      carcinoma in situ breast cancer.

      RATIONALE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-labeled and multicenter, pilot study.
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (arms A or B). Patients accrued as control
      participants are assigned to arm C. to implement the study, the investigators will collect
      surgical samples of the primary tumor and periphery blood from breast cancer patients to
      assess the effects of chemotherapeutic regimens and correlation with post-therapy survival in
      the patient cohorts. Besides the five-year disease-free survival, overall survival and
      five-year metastasis-free survival post treatment, the investigators also analyze and
      evaluate the anticancer agent-induced tumor stroma damage extent, which may provide further
      evidence to confirm the treatment efficacy and appraise the potential influence of a damaged
      tumor microenvironment on disease progression or regression in clinical settings.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The case of emergent events caused by treatment is measured by counting the blood cell number and detecting liver and kidney functions. Total blood cell number, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt; 20% above upper limit of normal, is considered as not safe.
Tolerability is measured by monitoring the first occurrence of grade 4 hematologic or grade 3-4 non hematologic toxicity as defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) (NCI-CTC version 4; or CTCAE v4.0) and/or disruption of chemotherapy because of inacceptable toxicity.
Chemotherapeutic efficacy is measured by the remaining tumor size after computed tomography (CT) scanning and comparing it with the original primary tumor size 2-3 weeks after last cycle of chemotherapy. The ratio of post-treatment tumor size to pre-treatment tumor size &lt; 50% is considered as effective. Otherwise not.</description>

    <measure>Circulating concentrations of tumor microenvironment-specific soluble factors</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Influence of the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic regimens on the primary tumor microenvironment is systemically measured for each patient. The circulating amounts per volume of a group of literature-reported soluble factors including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Wnt family member 16B (WNT16B) and serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) are measured in the peripheral blood 2-3 weeks post treatments to assess the influence of chemotherapies. Concentration of either IL-6 &gt; 50 ng/ml, IL-8 &gt; 80 ng/ml, GM-CSF &gt; 20 ng/ml, WNT16B &gt; 100 ng/ml or SPINK1 &gt; 60 ng/ml, is considered that the primary tumor has an activated microenvironment. The measurement continues for two more times, including one performed at 2 months and the other performed as 6 months after completion of chemotherapeutic regimens.</description>
