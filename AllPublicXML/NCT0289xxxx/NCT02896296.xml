      Study is to provide ongoing treatment with RBP-6000 and safety monitoring for subjects who
      complete the RB-US-13-0003 study and for whom a new treatment venue has not been identified.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, RBP-6000 treatment extension study in which subjects who
      have completed the End of Study (EOS) procedures for study RB-US-13-0003 are eligible. EOS
      assessments completed at the RB-US-13-0003 EOS visit will serve as the screening visit for
      this study. In addition, subjects will be requested to complete a Columbia Suicide Severity
      Rating Scale (C-SSRS) baseline survey and a medical history will be obtained.

      The Informed consent may be shared with subjects up to 2 months prior to the RB-US-13-0003
      EOS visit, however should not be signed until all assessments for the EOS visit have been
      completed.

      On Day 1, eligible subjects will receive a subcutaneous (SC) injection of RBP-6000 at a low
      or high dose based on the medical judgment and discretion of the investigator. After the
      injection, vital signs and the injection site will be assessed. Prior to departing the site,
      subjects will also be assessed for adverse events (AEs) and use of concomitant medications
      (ConMeds).

      Subjects will return to the site for monthly injection visits every 28 days (-2 / +7 days)
      for a total of up to 6 injections. At each subsequent visit (Injections 2 through 6) the
      following procedures / assessments will be performed : urine pregnancy test will be performed
      for all female subjects who are of childbearing potential before each injection; previous
      injection site will be assessed for potential reaction and evidence of attempts to remove the
      depot; vital signs will be collected pre and post each injection; RBP-6000 injection, urine
      drug screen (UDS); C-SSRS since last visit assessment, counseling (manual-guided behavioral
      therapy); use of ConMeds; assessment for AEs. Laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry and
      urinalysis) may be requested by the Investigator on an ad-hoc basis in order to assess for
      AEs.

      A subject's alternative treatment options should be assessed at least two months before EOS
      at each visit.

      At EOS, the following assessments will be performed: urine pregnancy test will be performed
      for all female subjects who are of childbearing potential; vital signs; previous injection
      site will be assessed for potential reaction and evidence of attempts to remove the depot;
      UDS; C-SSRS since last visit assessment, counseling (manual-guided behavioral therapy); use
      of ConMeds; assessment for AEs; a brief physical exam; height and body weight will be
      measured and a subject's body mass index (BMI) and hip to waist ratio will be calculated;
      laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis).

      Subjects should be contacted by telephone approximately 4 weeks after EOS for a safety
      follow-up assessment of AEs and use of ConMeds.
