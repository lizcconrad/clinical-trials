  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will focus on (1) estimating oxidative capacity of specific muscle groups
      during exercise using near infrared spectroscopy and (2) describing body composition to
      better understand exercise capacity and mitochondrial function in ambulatory spinal muscular
      atrophy (SMA) patients and disease controls. It is a 6-month observational study including 14
      ambulatory SMA patients, 14 ambulatory patients with mitochondrial myopathy, and 14 healthy
      controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a progressive, recessively-inherited neuromuscular disease
      characterized by weakness and muscle atrophy due to the loss of spinal cord motor neurons.
      The results from this study would provide preliminary data, using non-invasive methods, on
      oxidative capacity in ambulatory SMA patients and disease controls to aid in the design of
      exercise intervention studies. Furthermore, this information would link previous laboratory
      and preclinical findings of mitochondrial depletion in SMA to the clinical condition and
      provide important information for future studies designed to improve oxidative capacity and
      fitness in SMA patients.

    <description>Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) is a method of estimating bone and lean body mass by comparing the absorption of two distinct energy level beams at 46.8 keV and 80 keV, which are effective at differentiating soft tissue and bone. A standard DEXA scan will be performed in supine.</description>
