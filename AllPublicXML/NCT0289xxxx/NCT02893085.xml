    <textblock>
      The differential diagnosis between benign and malignant bile duct strictures is a difficult
      and demanding task for clinicians. Clinical, biochemical, and radiological characteristics of
      malignant biliary strictures are non-specific and tissue diagnosis is difficult to obtain
      preoperatively. For this reason, there is a need for the development of new diagnostic
      modalities. Of particular interest is the quest of tumor markers secreted or shed in bile by
      tumor cells developing in the biliary tract.

      In addition, patient's tumor molecular profile is the basis for selecting personalized
      therapy. Cholangiocarcinomas are characterized by a large genetic heterogeneity. The most
      frequent mutations are TP53, KRAS, BRAF, EGFR, MET, NRAS, PIK3CA, ERBB2, SMAD4, FBXW7,
      ARID1A, PBRM1, BAP1 et IDH1/2. In the case of pancreatic cancers, the most frequent are KRAS
      mutation detected in 90 % of the patients and CDKN2A, SMAD4, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, ATM, BRCA2,
      MLL2, MLL3, KDM6A, ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARC1, GNAS and RNF43 mutations.

      It is well established that KRAS and P53 mutations can be detected in bile samples from
      patients with biliary strictures related to cholangiocarcinoma and cancer of the head of the
      pancreas. The main objective is to determine if bile sample analysis from patients with
      malignant biliary stricture may allow to identify tumor mutation profile and determine tumor
      genotype. A secondary objective is to evaluate the diagnostic value of Vascular Endothelial
      Growth Factor (VEGF) and metallo-proteinases (MMPs) levels in bile samples.

      Tumor genotyping will be performed in bile samples (supernatant and cell pellet) and tumor
      tissues in a series of 10 patients surgically treated for malignant biliary stricture related
      to cholangiocarcinoma or cancer of the head of the pancreas. The biochemical markers, VEGF
      and MMPs, will be assessed in bile samples obtained during endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography in 50 patients with malignant biliary stricture and 50 patients
      treated for benign biliary diseases.
