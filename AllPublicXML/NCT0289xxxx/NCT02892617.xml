      Low back pain is one of the most frequent reasons for consultation in rheumatology. There is
      a strong correlation between low back pain, and the presence of a type of Modic 1 signal on
      MRI.

      The anomaly Modic 1 results in a hypointense signal T1-weighted images and hyperintense on
      T2-weighted sequences (including T2 STIR and / or Fat Sat) and contrast enhancement of the
      endplates after gadolinium injection; it corresponds to a replacement of normal cancellous
      bone of fibrovascular tissue.

      The origin of this inflammatory process Modic 1 into the vertebra is still unknown.

      infectious hypothesis was raised, including contamination by germs called &quot;slow-growth&quot; such
      as Propionibacterium acnes (PA).

      Many studies interesting Bacteriological analysis of disc material found the presence of
      bacteria (prevalence between 0 and 54%).

      A recent clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of antibiotic treatment compared to placebo
      in low back pain with Modic 1; a show effectiveness of this treatment on the different
      clinical parameters evaluated.

      However skin contamination is not formally excluded, particularly in patients previously
      infiltrated (including epidural).

      Our hypothesis is that the slow-growing bacteria are not involved in Modic 1 type of disc
      disease, and the possible presence of PA or other slow-growing bacteria in samples obtained
      discal posterior approach would be related to intraoperative contamination or during
      preoperative spinal infiltrations The main objective is to assess the prevalence of germs
      slow growth in the intervertebral disc in the spinal surgery by anterior disc disease in type
      1 Modic.
