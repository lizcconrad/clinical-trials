  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Around the scoliosis surgery, the pain (pre or post operative, physical, psychological,
      fantasy or real) is a major concern for adolescents and their families. She is also a key
      concern of caregivers, both its assessment and management is complex. this pain involved
      predominantly in the quality of life of these teenagers today who will become the adults of
      tomorrow.

      To date in France, no study aims to describe and evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary
      approach and its impact on the quality of life of these young people made.

      The present study wish to prevent, anticipate and limit the short, medium and long-term
      morbidity. Focus will be on pain and its management, on preparing for surgery,
      hospitalization, follow-up after surgery, rehabilitation until recovery.

      Help teens reclaim their bodies after the changes caused by the intervention is a major
      issue.

      This study believe that support good quality, adapted to patient needs will limit operating
      and postoperative pain in the medium and long term.

      Medical team developed special attention around the teenagers that are operated for scoliosis
      (teen groups and parent groups, interview before the operation and counseling, physiotherapy
      support ...).

      The present study would systematize data collections in order to have a comprehensive and
      accurate assessment of the care.

      The qualitative research will focus on the multidisciplinary care in an effort to evaluate
      the whole course of these teenagers, their experience and to identify efforts to put in place
      to optimize the current care.
