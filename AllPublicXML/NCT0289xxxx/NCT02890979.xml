  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well a swallowable sponge cell sampling device and next
      generation sequencing work in detecting esophageal cancer in patients with low or high grade
      dysplasia, Barrett esophagus, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. Checking biomarkers in
      abnormal esophageal cells using a swallowable sponge cell sampling device and next generation
      sequencing may improve diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of next generation sequencing for the detection
      of esophageal cancer from esophageal sponge cytology specimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the ability of next generation gene sequencing (NGS) of esophageal sponge
      samples to collect an adequate sample to detect mutations that are present in the underlying
      tissue.

      II. Determine the cost associated with esophageal cytology with next generation genome
      sequencing as a screening tool.

      III. Continue to collect safety and tolerability data related to the use of the Oesotest
      esophageal sponge.

      IV. Determine the limitations of esophageal sponge cytology and future needs to improve this
      technique.

      V. Use the data collected to design a larger screening trial to determine the ability of
      esophageal cytology with next generation sequencing to screen for esophageal cancer in the
      general population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cytology specimen collection procedure using a swallowable sponge cell
      sampling device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients must be scheduled for a procedure capable of providing a definitive
             pathologic diagnosis and evaluating for complications of the esophageal sponge on the
             same day as the study procedure, either upper endoscopy or surgical esophagectomy

          -  One of the following inclusion criteria must be true for patient to be eligible for
             enrollment:

          -  Subjects with known esophageal cancer (adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma)

          -  Subjects with a history of low or high grade dysplasia

          -  Subjects with risk factors for esophageal malignancy including Barrett?s esophagus and
             gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects that are unable to swallow a tablet/pill

          -  Subjects with completely obstructing esophageal cancer

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator precludes the patient from
             completion of the study procedure
