  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SUBUSQOL cohort aimed to improve knowledge of the quality of ambulatory care, in
      particular the prognostic role of the early satisfaction with care on the change from
      baseline quality of self-reported health status in outpatients with alcohol or opioid
      dependence. It is a multicenter prospective cohort. Satisfaction was assessed using a
      multidimensional self-administered and validated questionnaire during the early care process.
      In addition to measuring satisfaction and obtaining sociodemographic and clinical data, this
      study collected data on the self-reported health status at inclusion and 3, 6 and 12 months
      after inclusion.

      Early satisfaction with care was measured using the quality of care satisfaction
      questionnaire in outpatient consultation (EQS-C). Data collected during the study included
      patient sociodemographic, clinical and health status characteristics, as well as physician
      characteristics. Self-perceived quality of life was assessed using the generic SF-12 and a
      specific questionnaire in illness disease, the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction
      Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF).
