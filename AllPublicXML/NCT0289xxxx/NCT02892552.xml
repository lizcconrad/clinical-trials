      Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic concordance between multislice computed tomography
      (MSCT) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in the early postoperative assessment of
      patients after cochlear implantation.

      Study Design: Prospective, randomized, single-center, interventional, pilot study on the
      diagnostic performance of a medical device.

      Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Patients aged over 18 years requiring a CT scan
      after cochlear implant surgery.

      Interventions: Nine patients were implanted with electrode arrays from three different
      manufacturers, including one bilateral. High-resolution MSCT and CBCT were then performed,
      and 2 experienced radiologists blinded to the imaging modality evaluated the randomized
      images, twice.

    <description>Blinded images were analyzed in random order by 2 radiologists with several years of experience in temporal bone imaging. Each radiologist analyzed on the workstation the images of each patient twice at 4- to 8-week intervals. A consensus reading was performed by a third experienced radiologist in case of discordance.
Each radiologist determined CI localization. The cochlear implant (CI) was considered within the scala tympani if it was in the most posterior scala on axial reconstructions passing through the cochlea (behind the osseous spiral lamina often seen).</description>
