  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if prolonged fasting represents an independent risk factor for
      hypotension during induction of general anesthesia in the elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative fasting aims to reduce the risk of adverse events (eg, inhalation), but may be
      responsible for dehydration whose consequence is a major hypotension. This problem of
      hypotension is important because it (MAP &lt;55 mmHg) is directly correlated to the occurrence
      of pejorative events on the cardiac and renal level and even more so that the duration of the
      hypotension is long.
