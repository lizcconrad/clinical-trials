  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a medico-economic study of outpatient surgery paired with a night stay in a
      patient-hotel, compared with a conventional hospitalization for three types of urological
      surgeries.

      The aim is to show that those two strategies are not different in term of adverse effects or
      rehospitalization, and that the patient-hotel provide a better quality of life at a reduced
      cost, in order to generate savings for the paying agent: the Healthcare insurance.

    <description>Efficacity (QALY) is a composite measure of quality of life and adverse events occurence:
Quality of life is a composite score of : EQS5D questionnaire converted in utility, Other questionnaires : SF-12 ; International Continence Society short form, Post-Operative Patient, Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), l'Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-Short Form (IIQ-SF) et l'Urogenital Distress Index (UDI-SF).
Adverse events occurrence : urinary retention, postoperative infection, rehospitalization
Costs :
according to &quot; micro-costing &quot; method. Rehospitalizations will be priced from ENC rate.</description>
