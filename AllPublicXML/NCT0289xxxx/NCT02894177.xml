  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficult weaning from ventilation and extubation failure are major issues in intensive care,
      concerning 30% and 12% of patients respectively. These can be partly explained by the lack of
      accuracy of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure criteria to predict extubation failure.
      The investigators performed a pilot study to evaluate transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure
      (tcPCO2) monitoring during SBTs. The results showed that the difference between maximum and
      initial tcPCO2 (or ΔtcPCO2) was significantly higher in the group of patients who failed SBTs
      according to the usual criteria. Moreover, the results suggested that ΔtcPCO2 could be an
      accurate and early criterion for SBT failure. The size of the study could not examine ΔtcPCO2
      regarding extubation failure. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to determine if
      Δ tcPCO2 during SBTs is associated with extubation failure.
