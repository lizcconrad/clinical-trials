      Purpose: To assess the feasibility of using videos depicting people with DS to teach other
      adults with DS to perform healthy behaviors.

      Hypothesis: Videos of adults with DS performing healthy behaviors is a more effective way to
      promote healthy behaviors by adults with DS than other methods tested.

      This project will study whether videos showing a person with DS washing his hands correctly
      can improve hand washing by other adults with DS.

      The subjects will be recruited and identified and consented. Subjects will be randomized to
      one of 4 groups.

      i. Verbal instructions on hand washing with pictures (using the Illinois department of public
      health tools) ii. Verbal instructions on hand washing and video of the ADSC iii. Verbal
      instructions on hand washing and video of an adult without DS washing his hands iv. Verbal
      instructions on hand washing and video of an adult with DS washing his hands.

      Videos of the handwashing process will be taken pre intervention and then again post
      intervention.

      Scoring assessments will be completed upon review of the 2 files by 2 separate study team
      members, the second of which will be blinded to the information they will be reviewing.
