    <textblock>
      The patients enrolled on this new study will serve as an appropriate comparison group
      consisting of patients with the diagnosis of germ cell testicular cancer who were cured with
      surgical resection and did not receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy with a group of patients
      from another study who did receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

      Primary Objective

      To compare the prevalence of ototoxicity and neurotoxicity in GCT cancer survivors who only
      had surgery to a similar population from The Platinum Study (RSRB45410/1305011509) who
      received cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objective

      To compare the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and use of antidepressants/anxiolytics in
      GCT cancer survivors who only had surgery to a similar population from The Platinum Study who
      received cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.
