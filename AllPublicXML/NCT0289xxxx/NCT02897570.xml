  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at assessing the effects of glucose and different types of breakfast on
      metabolic and neurofunctional responses in healthy individuals.

      Twelve healthy subjects, on a stable diet, in a randomized-crossover fashion, received either
      a 50 g glucose load (control) or one of these breakfast:

      B1: milk (125ml) and cereals (30g); B2: milk (220ml), apple (200g) and cream chocolate filled
      sponge cake (30g); B3: milk (125ml), bread (50g), apple (150g) and hazelnut cream chocolate
      (15g). Prior and upon completion of each tolerance test, an EEG was performed to measure
      frontal P300-evoked potentials.

    <measure>Effect of glucose vs different kind of breakfasts on cognitive performances via brain evoked-potentials measure</measure>
    <time_frame>The incremental (post-pre) frontal P300 potential was assessed as a &quot;change&quot; ( before and 180 min after consumption)</time_frame>
    <description>On the same morning of the glucose tolerance test, before and 180 min after consumption, an EEG was performed to record P300 wave-evoked potentials.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of glucose vs different kind of breakfasts on AUC_glycemia in healthy subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples are drawn at -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120 minutes with respect to the ingestion.</time_frame>
    <description>The incremental area under plasma glucose concentration curve (AUC_glycemia) was used as summary measures of the metabolic responses resulting from the intake of either glucose or one of the 3 breakfasts. The incremental AUC was calculated as the difference between the total AUC and the product of the basal, pre-test concentration time during the experiment (i.e., 120 min).</description>
