  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is considered to be chronic if it has been present for longer than three
      months.

      This pathology is extremely frequent with an annual incidence between 5 in 10 % of the
      general population. Thus she is frequently met in general medicine, in particular to the
      ageing subject. It is the 2nd motive for consultation.

      The Chronic Low Back Pain is a mild pathology the forecast of which is in the favorable great
      majority of the cases but she pulled a socioeconomic cost mattering with a poly-consumption
      of care, in private individuals.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of a 3 months SPA Therapy on
      the Chronic Low Back Pain in older adults (from 60 to 80 years old) realizing a SPA Therapy
      of 3 weeks to &quot;Neyrac-les-Bains&quot;.

      Realization of the protocol :

        1. Selection of the patients (realized during the consultation of programming in the
           beginning of the SPA Therapy). They are 2 thermal doctors of &quot;Neyrac-les-Bains&quot; (1
           general practitioner with formation of thermal medicine and a rheumatologist) which
           include the eligible patients in this study during the visit of the beginning of SPA
           Therapy.

        2. They will put back to the patients the Inform Consent Form, the Form of non-opposition
           and the 1st questionnaire (J0). The nurse of the SPA Therapy will be at their disposal
           to help them to fill the questionnaire if need.

      An urn will be arranged in the entrance hall of Neyrac- les-Bains to get back the filled
      questionnaires (J0 and J21).

      Patients will follow the conventional SPA Therapy of 3 weeks without a specific changes or
      modification of the care provided.

      Feedback :

      Assessments conducted by the using of self - questionnaires:

        -  Delivered in the issue of the visit of inclusion and at the end of the Spa Therapy ;

        -  Sent by mail at 3 and 6 months

      The expectations and fears will be evaluated by means of individual interview or focus
      groups. To avoid the biases bound to the questionnaire, the patients questioned in
      qualitative are different from patients receiving the questionnaire (not over the same period
      of SPA Therapy).
