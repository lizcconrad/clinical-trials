  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of quality of life in health is particularly important for measuring the
      impact of the chronic diseases. The scales of measure constitute the main measurement tool in
      clinical trials because of their psychometrics properties and of their ease of use.

      Among these scales, the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and the EuroQol five dimensions
      questionnaire ( EQ-5D) were widely validated in various populations, of which the population
      of the diabetics patients. Both scales have validated versions in French.

      In the Antilles and in Reunion Island, diabetes is a frequent pathology and is the subject of
      many clinical and epidemiological trials. One of the difficulties encountered during the
      implementation of these studies is the absence of measurement tools validated for these
      populations.

      Investigators thus suggest, within a common workgroup uniting Guadeloupe, Martinique and
      Reunion Island, adapting and validating these scales according to an identical procedure in
      Creole from Guadeloupe, from Martinique and from Reunion Island and validating the French
      versions of these scales in their populations of type II diabetics patients.
