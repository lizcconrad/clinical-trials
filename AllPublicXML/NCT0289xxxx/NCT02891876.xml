      Biodentine® is a most recent material for direct pulp capping. The aim of this study is to
      determine the 3 months success rate (defined as clinical and radiographic successes together)
      of direct pulp capping realized with Biodentine®.

      Context : When a pulpal exposure happens on a vital tooth (without irreversible
      inflammation), direct pulp capping can be realized by using different biomaterials : CaOH2,
      MTA or Biodentine®. Biodentine® is the most recent material and its success rate for direct
      pulp capping is poorly documented.

      Objective : The main aim of this study is to determine the 3 months success rate (defined as
      clinical and radiographic successes together) of direct pulp capping realized with
      Biodentine®. The other aims are to determine the factors which have an influence over the
      success or the failure of direct pulp capping.

      Method : The patient's non-opposition is obtained after a loyal explanation of the study in
      order to collect clinical data, if a pulpal exposure (&lt;2mm) happens on a vital tooth during
      decy excavation.

      The operator registers the following data: age of the patient, type of the concerned tooth,
      volume of coronal pulp, surface of the pulp exposure, location, area and duration of pulp
      bleeding. An evaluation is realized 3 months later with the same clinical evaluation and a
      radiographic evaluation. If the pulp vitality is normal, the final coronal filling is then
      realized.

      A statistical analysis will be performed to determine the success rate (binomial distribution
      with p=0.05). The predictive factors of success or failure will be analyzed with a logistic
      regression (with p=0.05).
