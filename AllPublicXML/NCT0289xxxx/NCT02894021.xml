  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphoceles, or seromas, are the most frequent complication following mastectomy and are
      associated or not with axillary dissection occurring in 10 to 90% of cases. It is defined as
      the presence of a palpable post operative serous accumulation that is bothersome for the
      patient and requires a puncture and drainage or even several repeated punctures. The presence
      of seromas is therefore associated with discomfort and pain. Seromas could also be
      responsible for increased morbidity due to complications such as infection, suture
      separating, lymphedema, prolonged of hospital stay, or a delay in initiation of adjunct
      treatment (e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy). Some risk factors have been identified, such as
      obesity, increased post operative drainage of J1 to J3, and arterial hypertension.

      Different measures have demonstrated the benefits of limiting axillary lymphoceles after
      dissection : placement of a drain, padding and delay in shoulder mobility.

      Studies have shown that axillary padding decreases lymphocele development and shortens the
      length of hospital stay. Some studies based on padding of the mastectomy site also have shown
      a decrease in post operative seromas; however no study has been done on the usefulness of
      padding in the mastectomy site alone because they include both padding and a drain or padding
      of the axillary area.

      The padding technique the investigators employ is performed at the donor site in breast
      reconstruction by latissimus dorsi muscle flap, demonstrating a reduction in the rate of
      seromas.

      In this study, the classic technique will be compared to padding in the mastectomy site with
      short drainage (48h).
