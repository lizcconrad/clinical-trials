  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the relationship between human
      papillomavirus (HPV) and cancer risk in men who test positive for HPV antibodies. Antibodies
      are created by the immune system and may attack foreign cells or diseased cells, such as HPV.

      HPV infections can lead to oropharyngeal (throat area), anal, and/or penile cancer. The goal
      of the entire study is to learn if screening for HPV can help doctors learn which patients
      may be at a higher risk for developing these types of cancer.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 5000 men may be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      If you are eligible to take part in this study, and you agree, you will be screened for
      cancer and/or dysplasia (a type of pre-cancerous lesion). These visits will be at MD
      Anderson. You may refuse taking part in any part of the screening procedures or stop taking
      part in this study at any time. Your first visit will be at the time you sign this consent
      form.

      Oropharyngeal Cancer Screening:

      During your first study visit and then every 6 months for up to 5 years, you will be screened
      for oropharyngeal cancer. At each screening:

        -  You will have a head and neck exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test how your immune system responds to
           infections.

        -  You will have an oropharyngeal exam to look for anything unusual in your throat. A
           member of the research team will use a narrow band imaging device to look at the back of
           your throat. A narrow band imaging device is an ultra-thin flexible probe with a video
           camera on the end of it that will pass through your nose and shine a light on the back
           of your throat. The video will be displayed on a color TV so the researchers can look
           for anything unusual, such as signs of cancer.

        -  Your tonsils and the back of your tongue will be rubbed with a cotton swab to test for
           HPV.

        -  You will have ultrasound scans of your throat and the lymph nodes in your neck to check
           for cancer and/or dysplasia. To do this, an ultrasound probe will be placed on the
           outside of the neck.

      Anal Cancer Screening:

      At your first study visit:

        -  You will have an anal pap test to test for HPV. To perform this test, anal samples will
           be collected by gently swabbing the anal area with a cotton swab.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to test how your immune system responds to
           infections.

        -  You will have high-resolution anoscopy (HRA). HRA is an exam of the anal canal that is
           used to check for anal cancer and dysplasia. During the exam, a liquid solution of
           diluted acetic acid (normally found in vinegar) will be flushed into your anal canal to
           help pre-cancerous areas show up better during the exam. Then, a small tube with a
           camera on the end (called a colposcope) will be inserted into your anus and used to take
           pictures of possible pre-cancerous areas. This exam should take about 5-10 minutes. You
           will not be sedated for this procedure.

      Penile Cancer Screening:

      At your first study visit:

        -  The doctor will examine your genital area to check for anything abnormal.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Your penis will be rubbed with a cotton-like swab to test for HPV.

      If you have an abnormal test result from any of the screening procedures, you will be
      referred to a doctor to discuss more testing and/or treatment options, as part of your
      standard care.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation in this study will be over after your last oropharyngeal cancer screening
      (about 5 years after your first study visit).

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Researchers expect to enroll 5000 men aged 50-64, and expect that approximately 50 (1%) men will test positive for HPV16 E antibodies.</description>

    <measure>Incidence Rate of Oropharyngeal Related Malignancies in Men Aged 50-64 Who Test Serologically Positive for Antibodies to HPV 16 E Antigens</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Researchers assume that the prevalence of serum antibodies to HPV16 E antigens is 1% and the prevalence of oral HPV infection is 10% in the seronegative group. With a total of 5,000 participants, researchers will have 80% power with a 1-sided Î±=0.05 to detect a 12% difference of oral HPV infection prevalence between the seronegative group and seropositive group (10% vs. 22%).</description>

    <measure>Incidence Rate of Anal Related Malignancies in Men Aged 50-64 Who Test Serologically Positive for Antibodies to HPV 16 E Antigens</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Given an incidence rate of anal cancer in men aged 50-64 at 2.5 (95% CI 2.4-2.6) and an estimated increased risk of 75 (95% CI 18-321), researchers expect to detect 1 (95% CI 0-4) cases over 5 years of follow up in 90 men positive for HPV16 E antibodies. A sample size of 90 men positive for HPV16 E antibodies will allow researchers to estimate the cumulative incidence of anal cancer with 95% confidence with precision +6.3% or -2.5%, using Wilson confidence interval, assuming the cumulative incidence is 4% or less.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence Rate of Penile Related Malignancies in Men Aged 50-64 Who Test Serologically Positive for Antibodies to HPV 16 E Antigens</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence rate of penile cancer estimated along with a 95% Wilson confidence interval, respectively, for the HPV negative participants from the longitudinal study. A mid-P McNemar's test used to preliminarily test for the difference in incidence rate between the matched HPV positive and negative participants.
Researchers expect to diagnose no cases of penile cancer. These estimates are based on the current incidence rates among men aged 50-64 years in the United States and Texas.</description>
