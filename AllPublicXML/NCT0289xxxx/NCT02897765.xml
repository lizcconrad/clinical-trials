      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the treatment with NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant in
      combination with nivolumab is safe and useful for patients with certain types of cancer. The
      study also will investigate if NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant with nivolumab may represent a
      substantial improvement over other available therapies such as nivolumab alone. All eligible
      patients will receive NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant and nivolumab while on this trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will enroll patients with metastatic or advanced melanoma, lung, or
      bladder cancer. The three agents being used in this study are:

        -  A new, investigational, personal cancer vaccine called &quot;NEO-PV-01&quot;

        -  Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol), an investigational adjuvant that is used to help stimulate the
           immune system

        -  A cancer drug called nivolumab (OPDIVOÂ®)

      These agents are considered immunotherapy and work by stimulating the immune system to fight
      cancer. NEO-PV-01 is a truly personal vaccine therapy in that it is custom designed and
      manufactured to include targets for the immune system that are present uniquely on an
      individual's cancer. Poly-ICLC is an adjuvant that helps stimulate the immune system and make
      the vaccine, NEO-PV-01 more effective. Nivolumab helps T-cells, a certain type of immune
      cell, that recognize these targets to reach and attack the tumor. Nivolumab is in clinical
      development for treatment of bladder cancer and is approved by the FDA (the U.S. Food and
      Drug Administration) for the treatment of some lung, skin, kidney, and blood cancers.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant in
      combination with nivolumab is safe and effective for patients with melanoma, lung, or bladder
      cancer. The study also will see if NEO-PV-01 vaccine + adjuvant with nivolumab can improve
      responses compared to available therapies such as nivolumab monotherapy The side effects of
      NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant and nivolumab will be monitored and additional research tests will be
      done to assess the immune response against each individual's cancer.

             neurologically returned to baseline (except for residual signs or symptoms related to
             the CNS treatment) for at least 60 days prior to consent. In addition, patients must
             either be off corticosteroids, or on a stable or decreasing dose of 10 mg daily
             prednisone (or equivalent) for at least 60 days prior to consent.

             Patients may not receive or have received any radiation therapy at the biopsy sites.

          -  Have an active or history of autoimmune disease (known or suspected). Exceptions are
             permitted for vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to
             autoimmune condition requiring only hormone replacement, psoriasis not on systemic
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger.

          -  Have a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg
             daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 15 days
             prior to the first dose of study treatment (nivolumab). Inhaled or topical steroids
             and adrenal replacement doses (â¤ 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) are permitted in
             the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  Have any underlying medical condition, psychiatric condition, or social situation
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise study administration as per

          -  Have a planned major surgery.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab, personalized neoantigen
             peptides, and Poly-ICLC are agents with unknown risks to the developing fetus.

          -  Nursing women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown but potential
             risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             nivolumab, personalized neoantigen peptides, and Poly-ICLC.

          -  Have a history of an invasive metastatic disease, except for the following
             circumstances: individuals with a history of invasive metastatic disease are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 2 years and are deemed by the Investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that metastatic disease; individuals with the
             following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated: carcinoma in situ of the
             breast, oral cavity or cervix, localized prostate cancer, basal cell or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Mucosal melanoma and uvueal melanoma.
