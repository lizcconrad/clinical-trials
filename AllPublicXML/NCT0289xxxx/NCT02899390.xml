  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major non communicable chronic diseases in the world. It occupies the fourth or
      fifth leading cause of death in most high-income countries and there is strong evidence that
      has epidemic proportions in many developing countries, including Mexico. Like diabetes,
      prediabetes is associated with obesity and insulin resistance, thus promoting a lifestyle
      with healthy eating and physical activity can reduce weight and in turn the risk of diabetes.

      Several studies have shown that it is possible to prevent or delay the development of type 2
      diabetes through a lifestyle intervention based on diet and physical activity. The National
      Diabetes Prevention Program is a study based on the Diabetes Prevention Program conducted in
      real-world conditions.

      It is known that the acculturation of some ethnic groups has led to the increase in certain
      chronic degenerative diseases due to increased associated risk factors. The rural Yaqui tribe
      has a high prevalence of overweight, obesity, high triglycerides and type 2 diabetes. In
      addition to the rural Yaqui tribe there is another settlement of this tribe in the city of
      Hermosillo Sonora. Information on the health of this ethnic group is limited, however, it is
      known that being seated in an urban setting with an obesogenic lifestyle, which has been
      shown to have serious health effects in other populations, suggesting a high prevalence
      chronic non-communicable diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and hypertension at this
      ethnic group.

      The present study is a translational research clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of
      the National Diabetes Prevention Program to improve obesity parameters (weight, BMI, waist
      circumference) and increase physical activity in adults who are at risk of diabetes in the
      Yaqui tribe established in Hermosillo, Sonora.

      The present project wants to know if a diabetes prevention program can reduce the risk of
      developing diabetes in adults at risk of the Yaqui tribe established in Hermosillo, through
      the loss of weight and physical activity, all these with an intensive lifestyle intervention
      program that provide them the benefits of a healthy nutrition and physical activity.

      The hypothesis is that a lifestyle intervention program addressed to adults in the Yaqui
      tribe, established in Hermosillo at risk of diabetes can significantly decrease the
      parameters of obesity in a period of 6 months and increase physical activity in the same time
      period.

    <description>Before implementation of the National Diabetes Prevention Program, adaptations will be made in order to be culturally acceptable in the community taking in consideration the type of food they eat and their activities in the population.
The lifestyle intervention will be implemented by group and individual sessions and is aimed at achieving a 7% loss weight from baseline and 150 minutes per week of physical activity. Sessions will be held weekly in a period of 6 months. Individual sessions consist in nutritional counseling according to energy needs and food preferences of each participant.</description>
