  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is a frequent surgical emergency, with an estimated incidence of about
      80,000 cases a year (in France). It mainly affects young adults but is associated with a low
      complication rate and a short stay in hospital. Ambulatory treatment is an innovative type of
      care in which the patient is hospitalized for less than 12 hours and does not stay overnight
      in hospital.

      Ambulatory care is based on the guidelines issued by three French learned societies (the
      SFCD, the ACHBT and the AFCA) and has been defined by the French government as a national
      priority.

      The literature data show that 20% of patients undergoing appendicectomy for acute
      appendicitis can be treated on an ambulatory basis. However, the success factors for
      short-stay care (hospitalization &lt;24 hours) or ambulatory care (hospitalization &lt;12 hours)
      have yet to be identified.

      The investigators thus intend to perform a retrospective study of data from the PMSI French
      national hospital information system, in order to identify factors that are predictive of a
      length of hospital stay below 24 hours in patients having undergone appendicectomy for acute
      appendicitis during 2013 in France. The objective is to define the population of patients
      that could potentially benefit from ambulatory care.
