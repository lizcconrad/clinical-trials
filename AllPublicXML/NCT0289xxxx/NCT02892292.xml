      The objective of this study is to realize the typing of all HLA loci and validate this
      technique with continued optimization of next-generation sequencing technology (NGS).

      The number of patients waiting allograft of hematopoietic stem cells is constantly evolving.
      Similarly, the number of voluntary donors of hematopoietic stem cells on all global file has
      exceeded the threshold of 22 million donors since the end of 2013. Despite this, the search
      for a matched unrelated donor HLA for a patient remains sometimes a long and difficult,
      especially for patients with rare HLA alleles. It is important to increase the number of
      donors in the global file, increase HLA diversity of registrants and resolution HLA typing.
      More HLA typing of a donor registered on the file will be accurate, more research and the
      recruitment of a donor in order to achieve an allograft in a patient waiting will be fast.

      The constant evolution of the number of HLA alleles and the number of ambiguities quickly
      demonstrates the limits of current typing techniques. The study of exons and introns that
      would significantly refine the level of resolution HLA typing, reaching a level of allelic
      resolution. That level of resolution would also identify all null alleles (alleles from which
      the protein is not expressed). The search for an HLA with a patient will be made easier by
      reducing the financial impact and time of the search. In addition, numerous studies have
      shown that tissue compatibility narrowest possible between the donor and recipient of an
      allogeneic haematopoietic stem cells can improve patient survival by reducing the incidence
      and severity of disease graft against the host and to improve engraftment.

      In addition, analysis capability of the many sample using this technique should induce the
      decrease in HLA typing costs and thus facilitate the registration of anonymous bone marrow
      donors on the national register of the Biomedicine Agency .
