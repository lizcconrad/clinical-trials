      The FUTURE-II study is a confirmative clinical trial for Sirolimus Target Eluting
      Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (Firesorb) after the feasibility and safety of the device has
      been preliminary confirmed in a small-scale First-in-Man clinical trial.

      This study is a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial in
      patients with coronary artery disease caused by up to two de novo native coronary artery
      lesions in separate epicardial vessels. The goal is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
      of Firesorb to support the approval of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for
      this product. The Abbott's XIENCE Everolimus-eluting Coronary Stent System is selected as the
      control device. 610 subjects will be recruited and divided into queue 1 (n=430) and queue 2
      (n=180). All subjects in two queues will be 1:1 randomly assigned to experimental group and
      control group. All subjects will undergo clinical follow-up at 1-month, 6-month, 1-year,
      2-year, 3-year, 4-year and 5-year post-index procedure. Subjects in queue 1 will undergo
      angiographic follow-up at 1-year post-index procedure; of which 3-5 centers will be specified
      as a subgroup to complete OCT follow-up (n=80, 40 each in test and control group). Subjects
      in queue 2 will undergo angiographic follow-up at 2-year post-index procedure; of which 40
      subjects will complete OCT follow-up (20 each in test and control group).
