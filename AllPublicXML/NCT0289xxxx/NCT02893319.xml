  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid growth early in infancy is a risk factor for obesity and cardiovascular disease later
      in the lifespan. Evidence is limited, but both pre- and postnatal factors are associated with
      early rapid growth, and include high maternal BMI prior to pregnancy and excessive
      gestational weight gain. This research focuses on aspects of early feeding as potentially
      modifiable factor affecting early infant weight gain. Formula feeding mothers are randomized
      to receive either 5 oz of 8 oz bottles to use in feeding their infants from 2- to 16 weeks
      postpartum. In addition, a reference group of exclusively breastfeeding mother-infant dyads
      are also included. The hypothesis is that differences in feeding practices will be associated
      with differences in growth and that infants randomized to be fed from smaller bottles will
      grow more slowly that those randomized to larger bottles. Growth patterns of formula fed
      infants will also be compared to those of exclusively breastfed infants.

      Mothers complete feeding logs, questionnaires on health history, demographics, feeding
      attitudes and practices. Infant growth and body composition are measured via PEA POD, and
      maternal anthropometrics and body composition are measured in BOD POD the laboratory at 2, 8,
      and 16 weeks postpartum. Primary outcome is change in weight-for-age z-scores.

    <description>Infant weight (kg) (PEA POD scale) will be measured at each of three time points (2, 8, 16 weeks of age). Weight-for-Age Z-score (WAZ) will be calculated based on World Health Organization Global Database on Child Growth, means will be calculated and compared.</description>
