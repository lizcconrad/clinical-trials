      The association study will compare the allele frequencies of polymorphisms of a single
      nucleotide (SNP) in the population of individuals with aortic stenosis compared to a control
      population.

      Patients will be included only if they are suffering from a typical form of tight and
      surgical tricuspid aortic stenosis. Patients will therefore only included if they are
      suffering from aortic stenosis, the surface is less than 1 cmÂ² and if histological analysis
      or failing intraoperative findings of the surgeon showed a tricuspid aortic stenosis.

                  degenerative aortic stenosis, patients will be diagnosed with aortic stenosis

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Criteria has reached:

               -  That patients are operated or not, they can be considered as having a
                  degenerative aortic stenosis, patients will be diagnosed with aortic stenosis
                  (aortic area &lt;1 cm) without obvious cause found.

          2. criteria not met

               -  Strictly normal aortic valve by ultrasound in an over 65-year-old patient.

               -  All patients do not fit into the above two categories are considered as having an
                  unknown phenotype and will not be used in binding assays. In particular, the
                  presence of an aortic sclerosis or even moderate aortic regurgitation can be
                  considered as potentially incipient form of aortic stenosis, patients with this
                  type of anomaly will not be scanned during family analyzes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who did not sign the consent

          -  Non degenerative aortic stenosis or for which another cause could be found.

        Among the most commonly found causes are:

          -  Bicuspid aortic valve

          -  Severe renal impairment

          -  Severe Hypercholesterolemia
