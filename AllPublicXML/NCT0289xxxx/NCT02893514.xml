  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop a clinical decision support tool that assists primary care providers
      in carrying out substance use interventions, and then compare (in Phase 2) two clinical
      scenarios, screening only (SO) vs. SUSIT, (on dose of substance use brief intervention
      received) and changes in drug use at 3 and 6 months, among primary care patients.
      Investigators will develop the Clinical Decision Support (CDS) component and then test the
      full SUSIT approach, using mixed methods to assess its acceptability and adoption, and
      gathering preliminary data on its efficacy for reducing unhealthy drug use. CDS development
      is concurrent with the SO phase to avoid losing valuable time, but will be conducted at a
      secondary study site to avoid contaminating the SO condition.

      This study has 3 specific aims:

      Aim 1 is to develop clinical decision support that assists primary care providers in carrying
      out a brief intervention.

      Aim 2 is to assess the impact of the SUSIT on dose of substance use brief intervention
      received by patients.

      Aim 3 is to gather preliminary evidence on the efficacy of the SUSIT approach for reducing
      moderate-risk drug use.

    <description>Following completion of substance use screening, the tablet computer presents screening results (including level of risk) to the patient for each substance used, asks them to identify their drug of most concern (DOMC), and assesses readiness and confidence to change behavior. Results are delivered to the PCP at the point of care, paired with clinical decision support tailored to the patient's screening results. This information is delivered on the tablet computer, which is handed to the PCP by a Medical Assistant. CDS guides the PCP through a brief intervention specific to the DOMC, recommends clinical actions pertaining to the substance and risk level, and generates a printed summary for the patient. At each scheduled follow-up medical visit, the PCP receives a clinical reminder containing a summary of the patient's substance use and level of risk, paired with CDS that guides them through a follow-up brief intervention.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Substance use screening results (collected using the tablet-based screening tool)
             indicating current moderate risk drug use, based on a substance specific involvement
             score (SSIS) indicating current (past 3 months) use of at least one drug with a
             moderate risk level (SSIS 4-26), in the absence of any high-risk drug or alcohol use
             (SSIS 27+);

          -  Presenting for visit with a participating PCP

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior participation in the study (i.e. participation in the SO study phase would
             preclude participation in the SUSIT phase);

          -  Attending a formal addiction treatment program (not including informal treatment such
             as Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous), in the past 3 months;

          -  Pregnant (based on self-report).
