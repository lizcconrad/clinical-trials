  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans are at a substantially greater type 2 diabetes risk compared to Caucasians;
      however, very little data are available on the effects of exercise training on type 2
      diabetes risk factors in at risk African Americans. The present proposal will evaluate the
      effects of 6 months of moderate versus vigorous intensity aerobic exercise training on
      fitness, insulin sensitivity, mitochondrial capacity, skeletal muscle oxidative/insulin
      sensitivity markers, adiposity, and quality of life in African Americans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans have a much greater risk of type 2 diabetes compared to Caucasians in the
      United States. Similarly, recent evidence has emerged that fitness level, a major risk factor
      for type 2 diabetes also tends to be lower in African Americans. Many scientific studies have
      shown that exercise training has a beneficial impact on fitness levels and a variety of other
      type 2 diabetes risk factors such as the reduction of glucose/insulin levels, and body fat
      Importantly, studies performed in mostly Caucasian populations suggest that exercise training
      at a vigorous intensity may promote greater improvements in type 2 diabetes risk factors
      compared to moderate intensity exercise, which may suggest that it has greater promise in
      reducing type 2 diabetes risk. However, few exercise training studies compare the health
      benefits of different exercise training programs (such as exercise intensity) in African
      Americans, which is clinically important due to their greater type 2 diabetes risk, and that
      fact that they are less likely to meet public health recommendations for physical activity
      compared to their Caucasian counterparts.

      The High Intensity exercise to Promote Accelerated improvements in CardiorEspiratory fitness
      (HI-PACE) study will evaluate the effect of exercise intensity on cardiorespiratory fitness
      (CRF) and insulin sensitivity in obese (BMI: 30-45) African Americans (40-65 yrs.) with at
      least 1 additional T2D risk factor. Participants (n=60) will be recruited in collaboration
      with the ECU Center for Health Disparities, and subsequently randomized to moderate intensity
      (MOD-INT, n=20) or high intensity (HIGH-INT, n=20) aerobic exercise training, or to a control
      group (CON, n=20) for 24 weeks. Supervised exercise training will be performed at a heart
      rate associated with ~50% and ~75% of VO2 max in the MOD-INT and the HIGH-INT groups,
      respectively at the same exercise volume of 600 MET-minutes per week (consistent with public
      health recommendations). The primary outcome is the change in CRF, which will be assessed at
      baseline, mid-intervention, and follow-up. Insulin sensitivity will be measured via an
      intravenous glucose tolerance test at baseline and follow-up. Other secondary measures
      include mitochondrial oxidative capacity using infrared and measurements on muscle biopsies
      (PGC-1Î± and other indices of mitochondrial content), the expression of a protein involved
      with insulin action (GLUT-4 expression) in skeletal muscle as well as systemic inflammation,
      adiposity, quality of life and exercise enjoyment measures.

    <description>Fitness will be measured using a modified Balke protocol on a treadmill. Participants will walk at an initial speed of 2.0 mph with 0% grade for the first 3 minutes after which the treadmill speed will increase to 3.0 mph for the next 3 minutes. The treadmill grade will be increased by 2.5% every 3 minutes until volitional exhaustion. Respiratory gases (VO2, CO2) and ventilation will be measured continuously using a True Max 2400 Metabolic Measurement Cart (Parvomedics, Salt Lake City Utah).</description>

    <description>Waist circumference will be measured at the natural waist (midway between the inferior border of the rib cage and the superior aspect of the iliac crest) with a Gulick tape measure. Both landmarks (the inferior border of the ribcage and the superior aspect of the iliac crest) will be marked and the distance will be measured to determine the appropriate measurement site. Staff will confirm that: 1) the measurement tape remains horizontal; 2) the tape touches the entire circumference of the participant; 3) abdominal tissue is not compressed; 3) the tape measure is not within abdominal folds; 4) the measurement is taken at the end of normal respiration. The measurement will be repeated an additional time, and the reported value will be the average of these measurements. Both measurements must be within 0.5 cm to be considered acceptable for data purposes.</description>
