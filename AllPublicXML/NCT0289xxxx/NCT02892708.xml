  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surgical resection in
      elderly patients 70 years or older with a supratentorial glioblastoma de novo. The
      sensitivity of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy with perfusion sequences in the diagnosis of
      malignant glioma in the elderly will also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the standard treatment for gliomas is based on surgical resection followed by
      radiation therapy.

      However in patients 70 and older, surgery is not systematic, before radiotherapy. Moreover,
      at these ages, surgery is likely to be less well tolerated in general terms.

      The aim of this study is to try to determine the best treatment between radiation therapy
      associated with the surgical treatment and care by radiotherapy alone, after a brain biopsy.
      This is a randomized, two arms, multicenter, open study.

      In the two weeks following the radiological diagnosis of a lesion highly suggestive of a
      high-grade glioma, patients will be randomized to either arm surgery (partial or complete
      excision) + radiotherapy or in the radiotherapy alone arm. Within 5 weeks after surgery
      (biopsy or excision), all patients will receive treatment with focal radiotherapy.

      A central review blades and MRI data will be organized after the inclusion of patients.

      A maximum of 135 patients will participate in this trial.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Highly suggestive radiological aspect of a high-grade glioma

          -  Operability of the lesion, defined according to standard criteria of literature: lobar
             tumor, cortico-subcortical, well limited, without deep infiltration and without
             involvement of the basal ganglia. This operability is to reassess based on surgical
             experience and the ability to remove more or less completely a tumor of this type in a
             given location

          -  Age greater than or equal to 70 years

          -  Preoperative Karnofsky Index ≥ 50

          -  Information given to the patient or his family and signed written consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Existence of a cons-indication to MRI

          -  Non operability of the lesion

          -  Unbalanced concomitant serious pathology that might be an indication against-formal
             anesthetic (ASA 4-5) (see annex)

          -  Previous history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to this injury

          -  Patient under guardianship or under judicial protection
