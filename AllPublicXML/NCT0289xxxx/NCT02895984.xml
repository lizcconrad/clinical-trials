  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is almost ubiquitous on college campuses and first-year students are at
      particularly high risk of alcohol-related harm when they first make the transition to
      college. Peers are important agents in socializing both healthy and unhealthy behaviors, but
      despite the clear role of peer behavior in the maintenance of college problem drinking, there
      have been no efforts to measure the effect of individual change on the reduction of
      alcohol-related risks in the broader student body. That is, despite the importance of social
      connections for inducing and maintaining alcohol use in youth, intervention approaches have
      not measured nor capitalized on the potential of social influences for changing this problem
      behavior. It is essential that we understand the indirect effects of individual interventions
      and the impact such interventions have on the social structure and social connections. The
      best way to evaluate such effects is to use a research design that experimentally manipulates
      drinking using the best available intervention and measures its effects on the social network
      and its members.

      The purpose of this research is to investigate whether using an established individual Brief
      Motivational Intervention (BMI) administered to a small number of influential network members
      embedded in a social network significantly reduces heavy drinking and alcohol consequences
      among close peers who do not receive any intervention (the investigators call this the
      indirect intervention effect). In addition, the investigators will investigate putative
      social influence mechanisms of this transmitted effect, investigate how specific types of
      network connections and relationships moderate the indirect intervention effect, and
      investigate the effects of the intervention on network position and structure. First-year
      students at Brown (N = 1,280) will be enrolled and assessed early in their fall 2016 academic
      semester. Using baseline data, dormitories (N = 10) will be matched on size and randomly
      assigned to one of two conditions: BMI or natural history control (NHC). Heavy drinkers in
      each dormitory who are in the top quartile of betweenness centrality, a social network
      construct that reflects high connectivity and potential influence, will either receive BMI or
      serve as controls, according to their dormitory's intervention assignment. All participants
      will be assessed again 5 and 12 months after baseline to measure changes in behavior and in
      peer ties in the entire network of first-year students. The long-term objective of this
      research is to understand how peer influences function in social networks in order to
      leverage those mechanisms to reduce problematic alcohol use in heavy drinking populations.

      The proposed design and network analytic methods will allow the investigators to investigate
      the extent to which an intervention conducted with careful attention to network connection is
      transmitted to others (Aim 1), how those effects occur (Aim 2), conditions under which those
      effects are more likely (Aim 3), and how the connections themselves change as a function of
      the intervention (Aim 4).

      AIM 1. To investigate the efficacy of targeted Brief Motivational Intervention for reducing
      heavy drinking and alcohol consequences in network members who received no intervention. The
      investigators expect that heavy drinking participants residing in dormitories assigned to BMI
      but who receive no intervention will show lower frequency of heavy drinking and alcohol
      consequences at follow-up than their comparison group in NHC dormitories (n = 480; 240 in
      each condition).

      AIM 2. To identify the social influence mechanisms through which the intervention effect is
      conveyed. The investigators expect that reductions in the following social influence
      mechanisms will mediate the indirect intervention effect: (1) behavioral modeling of heavy
      drinking; (2) social reinforcement for drinking or not drinking; (3) offers and provision of
      alcohol; (4) the perception of peer heavy drinking (descriptive norms); and (5) the
      perception of peer approval of heavy drinking (injunctive norms).

      AIM 3. To identify the network and relationship features that moderate intervention efficacy.

      3A. Proximity to Intervention. The investigators expect that heavy drinking network members
      who: (1) have first-degree ties (i.e., a direct tie) with intervention recipients, (2) have a
      higher proportion of intervention recipients in their close network (i.e., have the highest
      exposure to transmitted intervention effects), and (3) have an intervention recipient as a
      roommate will show the strongest indirect intervention effect.

      3B. Quality of Peer Relationships. The investigators expect that stronger relationships with
      intervention recipients as measured by: (1) best-friend status, (2) higher perceived
      relationship closeness, (3) higher perceived social support, and (4) reciprocated network
      nominations, will be related to greater indirect intervention effects.

      AIM 4. To investigate the intervention effect on personal-level network position and on
      drinking-based selection in the network.

      4A. Network position. Differences between the intervention recipients in the BMI and NHC
      groups at follow-up will be investigated on: (1) betweenness centrality (how often the
      participant falls on the shortest path between two others) and (2) prestige (number of
      nominations of the participant by others). There is little literature on how network
      positions change following behavioral intervention, so directional hypotheses are not
      proposed.

      4B. Drinking-based selection. At follow-up, the investigators expect less drinking-based
      selection in the BMI group compared to the NHC group.

    <description>The intervention recipients will receive a 1-hour individual BMI. The BMI will follow the central principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI) and will include all the components determined to be efficacious in existing multi-component BMIs (e.g., personalized feedback on indicators of alcohol-related risk, including signs of alcohol dependence and family history of alcohol risk; normative comparisons of the participant's alcohol consumption with same-sex peers in his/her dorm and throughout campus, and protective behavioral strategies). Additional components will include reviewing the pros and cons of the participant's current pattern of alcohol use, providing estimates of the participant's recent Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC), and providing information about risks of specific negative outcomes at different levels of drinking. Participants will identify goals for behavior change, and with the counselor will develop a plan to achieve the goals and to address barriers to success.</description>
