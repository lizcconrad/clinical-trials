  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will included 20 children presenting with epilepsy with spasms. It aims to offer
      these children, non invasively and without supplementary examinations, a recording of local
      and cerebral hemodynamic changes concomitant with an electroencephalographic recording during
      epileptic episodes. This will be carried out by combining optical imaging using near
      infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) with electroencephalography (EEG), in a simultaneous
      high-resolution (HR) recording.

      This study is among those based on multimodal analyses of epilepsy, combining methods of
      analysis of electrical activity (electrical imaging) and hemodynamics (optical imaging).

      Surface electroencephalography (EEG) is a precious tool enabling the study of neuronal
      dysfunction from a functional point view. It is used in the routine follow-up of children
      with epilepsy. Optical imaging is a promising medical imaging technique. It uses light in the
      spectral regions of near infra-red as a source of radiation. It is quantitative, rapid, non
      invasive, and inoffensive which could easily be used at the child's bedside or in a clinical
      setting and can provide metabolic information about cerebral function.

      This study is multidisciplinary, which calls upon the skills of neurophysiologists,
      biophysicists, and clinicians
