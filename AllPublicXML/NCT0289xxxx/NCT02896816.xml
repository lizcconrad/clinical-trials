      Study Purpose:

      Parkinson's disease leads to severally impaired motor control. The purpose of this study is
      to better understand and analyze the characteristics of arm muscle activity while doing some
      reaching tasks and of leg muscles while walking. This will allow the investigators to improve
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying the motor impairments in Parkinson's disease.

      More details:

      A total of 20 participants with Parkinson's disease and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy
      controls will be included in this study. The participants with Parkinson's disease should
      have symptoms only on one side of the body, and they should not be taking any dopamine
      replacement medication such as levodopa or dopamine agonists. The study will take place at
      the Motion Analysis Laboratory of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown,
      Massachusetts. It will consist of two assessment sessions; one where muscle activity of the
      arms as well as movement characteristics will be assessed during a reaching task; and another
      where muscle activity of the legs and movement characteristics will be assessed while walking
      on a treadmill. Clinical evaluations will also be performed. In addition, individuals with
      Parkinson's disease will undergo brain scans at Massachusetts General Hospital to examine
      whether there are any relationships between muscle activity and brain function.

        Inclusion Criteria for Parkinson's volunteers:

          1. Male and female, age 18-80

          2. Motor symptoms only on one side of the body

          3. No use of dopaminergic replacement therapy or other medication related to PD

        Exclusion Criteria for Parkinson's volunteers:

          1. Cognitive impairments that may interfere with understanding instructions as needed
             during the performance of the study (MMSE&lt;23)

          2. Subjects who are unable to perform arm reaching movements

          3. Self-report of any condition that could affect walking

          4. No fractures or skin lesions in the upper or lower limbs

          5. Infectious diseases requiring contact precautions

          6. Subjects with contraindications to MRI cannot participate (i.e., implanted metal
             including pacemakers, cerebral spinal fluid shunts, aneurysm clips, artificial heart
             valves, ear implants or metal/foreign objects in the eyes and those with a history of

        Exclusion criteria for healthy volunteers:

          1. Cognitive impairments that may interfere with understanding instructions as needed
             during the performance of the study (MMSE&lt;23)
