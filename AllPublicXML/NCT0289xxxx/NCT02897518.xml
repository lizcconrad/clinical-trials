      The primary end point of this study is the feasibility of intubation. The secondary
      end-points are the success to intubate in the first attempt, the intubation time, the Cormack
      and Lehane score view, the comparison of the intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score and the
      need for maneuvers to aid the endotracheal intubation comparing Imago V-Blade ® and
      Glidescope®.

      Patients admit to the operation rooms of University of Naples &quot;Federico II&quot; and requiring
      endotracheal intubation for general anesthesia will be consecutively screened for the
      presence of predicted difficult airway according Italian guideline. According to this
      guideline, the presence of one or more of the following parameters may be considered highly
      predictive of difficult intubation: Mallampati class 3-4, inter-incisor distance &lt; 30 mm,
      mental-thyroidal distance &lt; 60 mm, large prominence of superior incisors above inferior
      incisors uncorrectable with jaw-thrust, reduced head and neck motility, and reduced
      mental-jugular distance. Patients matching more then 1 of the previous criteria stated by
      Italian guideline will be included in this case controlled study. Patients 1) without
      criteria for predicted difficult airway; 2) those requiring emergency surgery; 3) aged &lt; 18
      years; or 4) declined consent to participate, will be excluded from this study.The primary
      end-point was the comparison of the intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score. The secondary
      end-points were the learning curve, the intubation time, the Cormack and Lehane score view,
      and the need for maneuvers to aid the endotracheal intubation comparing different
      videolaryngoscopes available in our department. Two anesthesiologists with 10 years of
      experience in conventional endotracheal intubation and trained for video assisted intubation
      will perform the maneuvers.
