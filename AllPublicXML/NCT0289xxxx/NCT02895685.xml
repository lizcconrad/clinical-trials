      The investigators have planned a randomized study, examining the effect of self-directed
      training in groups vs. individual training on trainees' acquisitions of open surgical skills.

      Eighty participants who signed up for a pre-existing simulation-based course in basic open
      surgical skills will be randomized to practice either in pairs or individually during the
      course. Participants open surgical skills will be tested on a simulated skin model before and
      after the course. The investigators hypothesis is that dyad training will enhance
      self-directed learning in open surgical skills.

      The study is a prospective, rater-blinded, randomized, trial, examining the effect of
      off-site self-directed training in groups versus individual training in open surgical skills.

      Setting The study will be conducted at Copenhagen Academy for Medical Education and
      Simulation, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. The study period will be twelve months from August 2016
      to July 2017.

      Basic open surgery training programme Copenhagen Academy for Medical Education and Simulation
      (CAMES) has developed a course in basic surgical skills in open surgery. The course is aimed
      at junior residents who are about to start a career in surgery. The current course is a
      six-week course consisting of didactic instructions with an experienced surgeon,
      expert-guided self-training and self-directed training at home. Each class consists of eight
      participants. One week before the course starts the participants meet for an introduction. At
      the introduction participants are provided with training material consisting of a portable
      knot tying and suturing kit from Ethicon, Surgical Care, Johnson and Johnson and a written
      material with descriptions of instruments, instructions in different technical skills and
      theoretical knowledge in open surgery. The following six weeks participants meet once a week
      for a one and a half hour on-site class in open surgical techniques. The on-site classes are
      held in a traditional classroom setting at CAMES and consist of didactic instructions
      followed by expert-guided self-training. The content of each on-site class is predefined. The
      participants are instructed to read the written material before the on-site classes. The
      first on-site classes focus on simple open surgical techniques such as knot tying and
      introduction to instruments and their use. The following on-site classes focuses on suturing
      techniques. In the end of the course, participants are introduced to more complex tasks in
      open surgery, such as theory in abdominal opening and closure, dissection and haemostasis
      (Appendix B). The participants are instructed to practice the technical skills presented in
      the classroom at home, using the portable knot tying and suture kit. If the participants
      reach a predefined level of proficiency at the examination test, held within one week after
      the last on-site class, they are allowed to participate in an operative course in basic open
      surgery techniques the following week. During the operative course basic concepts of
      laparotomy, ligation and dissection are practiced. The majority of the operative course
      focuses on practical training on sedated pigs. Groups of three trainees are supervised by an
      experienced surgeon.

      Participants will be randomized to self-directed training at home in pairs (forty
      participants) or self-directed training at home individually (forty sixteen participants).
      All participants will follow the regular course in basic surgical skills in open surgery.
      Randomization will be en-bloc, so all participants following the same course, with eight
      participants in each course, will be randomized to follow the same instructions. Participants
      will be informed that they are expected to take part in classroom on-site classes, but they
      decide themselves when and how much time to spend practicing and which of the task presented
      in the classroom they practice.

      Technical skill test At the introduction participant's technical skills in open surgery is
      assessed in a pre-test. The same test is used for examination at the end of the course
      (post-test). The test is composed of five basic tasks performed on a simulated skin model.
      The tasks are designed to explore technical skills in three different knot-tying techniques,
      five different suturing techniques and knowledge in selecting the right instruments and
      sutures. The examination instructions are presented in written format (Appendix C).
      Participants are given twenty-five minutes to complete the tasks. Participants are instructed
      to distribute their time on each task themselves. Unlimited time is given before the test
      starts to read the instructions carefully and to select the sutures needed. Tests are
      recorded on video. The camera is placed so only the hands of the trainee and the operation
      field is showed on the video. Audio will be deleted to allow for blinded rating. To pass the
      course, the trainees must achieve a predefined proficiency level corresponding to fifty
      percent (15 points) of the maximum score (30 point) at the post-test. The test will be
      performed at CAMES assuring optimal height and light setting at every test session.

      Task 1: The participant is instructed to close a five cm wound using far-far near-near
      running suturing technique, 3-0 monofilament, nonabsorbable suture, anatomical forceps, and
      to start and end the suture using two hand knot tying technique.

      Task 2: The participant is instructed to close a five cm wound, the skin model simulates the
      fascia, they are asked to use an absorbable suture, De Bakey forceps and one hand knot tying
      technique to start and end the suturing.

      Task 3: The participant is instructed to close a five cm wound using subcuticular suturing
      technique, a 4-0 absorbable suture, anatomical forceps, and to start and end the suture using
      instrumental knot tying technique.

      Task 4: The participant is instructed to demonstrate three far-far near-near interrupted
      sutures on a five cm wound, using 4-0 monofilament, nonabsorbable suture, anatomical forceps
      and to close each suture with one hand knot tying technique.

      Task 5: The participant is instructed to close a five cm wound using simple interrupted
      suturing technique. The participant decides themselves which suture, instruments and knot
      tying technique they will use.

      Participants are instructed to show what kind of sutures that have chosen for each task to
      the camera.

      Training log Participants will be asked to keep a training log with details of time spend on
      training and number of training sessions. The training log will contain information on which
      type of task is practised and if the training is performed in pairs. Also time spend in the
      operation room, assisting or performing open surgery will be registered (APPENDIX D). Every
      week when the participants meet for the on-site class held at CAMES, the training log will be
      copied, to ensure the participants fill in the training log correctly and regularly.

      Expert assessment Two experts in surgery will do the ratings based on video-recordings. One
      rater will be blinded for both the randomization (dyad-training versus individually training)
      and who is performing on the video-recording. The other rater will teach the on-site classes
      and rate the examination tests, and is therefore not blinded for the randomization for the
      post-test. However, this rater will still be blinded for the randomization for the pre-test
      ratings and who that perform on the video-recording. The Objective Structured Assessment of
      Technical Skills (OSATS) is used as the primary endpoint of this study. OSATS is a validated
      assessment tool for the evaluation of general surgical skills[15, 16]. OSATS consists of a
      five-point global rating scale (GRS) and task specific checklists[15]. Only the GRS will be
      used for assessment, as no full procedures are performed in the test. A modified GRS will be
      used, as the audio will be deleted from all videos and no assistant will be available during
      testing. Using the modified GRS trainees will be evaluated on the following categories: 1)
      respect for tissue, 2) time and motion, 3) instrument handling, 4) knowledge of instruments,
      5) flow of operation and forward planning and 6) knowledge of specific procedure (Appendix
      E).

      Handling of adverse events during testing

      During testing there is a risk of adverse events. They should be handled as follows:

      The practical equipment fails:

      Testing is stopped. If equipment fail is repairable on the testing session, testing is
      restarted at the point it was stopped. If not, the testing session is seen as failed and the
      testing session will not be used or counted as an attempt. A new test will be performed.

      The simulated skin model becomes detached from the table:

      The participant is allowed to fix the simulated skin model to the table and will continue to
      finish the task. If this is not possible, a score of zero will be given.

      Other interruptions during testing:

      Testing is stopped. If the interruption can be overcome during the testing session, testing
      is restarted at the point it was stopped. If not, the testing session is seen as a failed
      testing session and will not be used.

      A test session which fails due to adverse events will not be used in the final analysis and a
      new test session will be arranged.

      Study participants Participants are medical doctors with a surgical interest and medical
      students in relevant jobs related to surgery (internships, research year) participating in
      the course in basic surgical skills in open surgery. Eighty trainees', who sign up for the
      current course in basic open surgical skills, will be enrolled in the study.

      Note:

      Base-line testing (pre-test) for 15 participants have been carried out in august 2016. These
      participants where randomized according to the protocol. No changes has been made to the
      protocol, and data has not been analyzed, since no post-testing has been carried out. The
      data from the first 15 participants will not be obtained and analyzed before the post-test at
      the end of september.

    <description>Participants will be paired in teams at the introduction. Participants will be instructed to train and supervise each other in pairs and will receive information on how to give constructive feedback. Participants will practice in pairs during on-site classes and encouraged to train in pairs during the self-regulated training at home. At the on-site classes, participants will be instructed to practice with their partner, during the expert-guided self-training and receive all feedback in pairs. Participants will train at the same table with space for two people. Outside the classroom, participants will decide themselves when and how often they will meet to practise. Participants are instructed to actively observe his or her partner while practising and are encouraged to discuss their performance and any difficulties they encounter. Testing will be done individually. With the training log, the investigators will measure whether the participants train in pairs at home as instructed.</description>
