  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sirukumab is a human anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the cytokine
      with high affinity that may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of polymyalgia
      rheumatica (PMR) by interrupting multiple pathogenic pathways. Sirukumab inhibits
      IL-6-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation,
      resulting in the inhibition of the biological effect of IL-6. This study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of sirukumab to characterize the benefit-to-risk profile of sirukumab in
      the treatment of active PMR. The study will be conducted in 2 parts (Part A and Part B) and
      consists of the following phases: Screening phase, Part A: 52-week double-blind treatment
      phase, Part B: 52-week extension phase with no study drug administration and a 16-week
      follow-up phase if applicable.

      Approximately 150 subjects with a diagnosis of PMR and active disease within 6 weeks of
      baseline will be randomized into Part A, the 52-week double-blind treatment phase, to receive
      one of two doses of sirukumab or placebo, each in addition to a pre-specified prednisone
      taper. The efficacy and safety of sirukumab in sustaining remission will be assessed at Week
      52. Subjects completing Part A of the study who are in clinical remission will be eligible to
      enter Part B, the 52-week extension phase, designed to investigate the long-term maintenance
      of remission and safety following cessation of sirukumab treatment and to assess long-term
      corticosteroid use. Subjects will need to have follow-up safety evaluations for at least 16
      weeks after receiving the last dose of study drug, applicable for those who have withdrawn
      prematurely from the study or who have completed Part A but are not eligible for Part B.

             diagnosis of PMR: Morning stiffness duration &gt;45 minutes (2 points) or Hip pain or
             limited range of motion (1 point) or Absence of rheumatic factor (RF) or
             anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) (2 points) or Absence of other joint
             involvement (1 point).

          -  Active PMR within 6 weeks of randomization where active disease is defined by an ESR
             &gt;=30 millimeter (mm)/hour (hr) or CRP &gt;=1 mg/dL within 6 weeks of randomization AND
             the presence of at least one of the following at screening (within 6 weeks of
             randomization): Unequivocal symptoms of PMR, defined as shoulder and/or hip girdle
             pain associated with inflammatory stiffness or Other features judged by the clinician
             investigator to be consistent with PMR or PMR flares (e.g. fever of unknown origin).

          -  Receiving oral prednisone 0-25 mg once daily (or equivalent) for PMR treatment at
             screening. Dosage of oral prednisone or equivalent, during the screening period can
             remain constant or be adjusted within the range of 0-25 mg prednisone equivalent based
             on investigator's discretion.

          -  Willing and able to receive treatment with oral prednisone 20 mg once daily at

             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             features that increase the likelihood of a non-PMR diagnosis may include some or all
             of the following: Age &lt;60 years; Chronic onset (&gt;2 months) at time of diagnosis; Lack
             of shoulder involvement; lack of inflammatory stiffness; prominent systemic features,
             weight loss, night pain, neurological signs; features of other rheumatic disease;
             Normal or extremely high acute-phase response; AND treatment dilemmas such as
