  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 2016/17 pilot study is to improve the combination of a card-based adverse
      drug reaction (ADR) system and the use of routine data to collect adverse events following
      vaccination with seasonal influenza vaccines, as per European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidance
      and Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of EMA (PRAC) requirements, and to identify
      additional data which may need to be collected in order to appropriately address the
      requirement.
