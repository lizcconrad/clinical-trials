  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pregnancy may activate flares of certain autoimmune diseases such as lupus. The influence
      of pregnancy on the evolution of ITP was never studied while this pathology affects firstly
      women old enough to procreate. Also, the influence of ITP on pregnancy (risk of obstetric
      complications) and on newborns (risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia) is rather unknown and
      never studied in a prospective study. The realization of a prospective study to answer these
      questions is necessary to allow us to inform better the patients affected by ITP and to
      define better in this context the strategy of supervision of the mother, the foetus and the
      newborn. The highlighting of risk factors of ITP flare or obstetric or neonatal complications
      will indeed allow the implementation of prevention measures.

      The conclusions of this study will allow us to adapt national guidelines for ITP during
      pregnancy.
