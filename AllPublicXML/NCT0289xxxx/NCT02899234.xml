  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization cigarette smoking is today one of the leading
      single causes of preventable death and morbidity. The electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) has
      been marketed as a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, and its global sales
      continue to grow exponentially each year. Despite growing e-cigarette use, scientific data on
      health effects are insufficient in some respects and completely lacking in others. Therefore
      the current study is designed to investigate the effects of active e-cigarette inhalation on
      the cardiovascular and respiratory systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 6 million people worldwide lose their lives due to tobacco use yearly.
      On average, cigarette smokers are estimated to die 10 years earlier than non-smokers.
      Ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, respiratory illness,
      lung cancer and other cancers have all been linked to tobacco use. In recent years the
      electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) has been introduced to the market as an alternative to
      traditional cigarette smoking. E-cigarettes have been aggressively marketed as a cheaper,
      healthier, cleaner alternative to smoking in both advertising and media outlets, primarily
      targeting women and adolescents. With limited knowledge of e-cigarette vaping health effects
      in humans it has been challenging for governments and health officials to give advice and
      regulate the use of this novel product.

      In the current study investigators aim to investigate acute cardiovascular and respiratory
      effects after active inhalation of e-cigarette in healthy human subjects.
