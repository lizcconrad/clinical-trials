    <textblock>
      BELINDA is a follow'up of subjects included 10 years ago in HELENA study which was a
      cross-sectional study carried out from 2006 to 2007 in more than 3500 adolescents aged from
      12.5 to 17.5 years old through 10 Europeans towns from 9 countries.

      BELINDA main objective is to assess CV risk using PDAY score (Pathobiological Determinants of
      Atherosclerosis in Youth) during young adulthood (20 to 31 years) and analyze lifestyle risk
      factors from adolescence (12 to 18 years). This analyze may define new CV risk factors and
      risk population cluster.

      BELINDA subjects from Lille and Ghent will be re-tested using a part of HELENA test battery
      and some new evaluation criteria.

    <measure>Diet Quality Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>data collected using HELENA-DIAT, an electronic dietary recall, data in DQI score unit.
DQI score is ranking from 0 to 9 unit and is based on three basic principles for a healthy diet: quality; diversity; balance. Furthermore, the daily diet was divided into nine recommended food groups, namely (1) water, (2) bread and cereals, (3) grains and potatoes, (4) vegetables, (5) fruit, (6) milk products (7), cheese, (8) meat, fish, eggs and substitutes, and (9) fats and oils.</description>
