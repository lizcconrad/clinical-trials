      Identify the cytokine or combination of cytokines, with the best diagnostic performance to
      characterize the vital nature of a skin wound in the body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Determining the vitality of skin wounds, that is to say their antemortem character, is an
      important issue in forensic pathology. The only criterion vitality currently recognized (but
      whose diagnostic performance remains limited) is the microscopic demonstration of an
      inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils. The search for more reliable diagnostic biomarkers is
      required. By their early expression of the injury site, inflammatory cytokines are potential
      candidates and their quantification in injured skin could optimize the diagnosis of vitality
      injury.

      The objective is to identify the cytokine or combination of cytokines, with the best
      diagnostic performance to characterize the vital nature of a skin wound in the body.
