    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the evaluation study is to determine if geriatric co-management is
      superior to standard of care in preventing functional decline in older patients admitted for
      acute heart disease or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implementation (TAVI) to the cardiology
      units of the University Hospitals Leuven.

      This study aims to implement and evaluate a geriatric co-management intervention in older
      patients admitted for acute heart disease or Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implementation (TAVI)
      to the cardiology units of the University Hospitals Leuven. The study uses a mixed-methods
      methodology aiming to 1) assess the feasibility and evaluate the effectiveness of geriatric
      co-management, 2) describe the experiences of intervention participants, and 3) perform a
      process evaluation. We will first consecutively recruit patients on the cardiology units to
      measure the standard of care in the control group. The geriatric co-management intervention
      will then be implemented and piloted on the participating units. Once fully implemented, we
      will consecutively recruit patients for the intervention group who will receive the geriatric
      co-management intervention.

    <description>A geriatric co-management intervention will be implemented on the cardiology units of the University Hospitals Leuven. Geriatric co-management is defined as a shared responsibility and decision making between the cardiology team and the geriatric team who provides complementary medical care in the prevention and management of geriatric problems. Patients included in the co-management program will undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment within 24 hours of hospital admission.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive the standard of care on the cardiology units. This includes multidisciplinary care with a one weekly multidisciplinary team meeting. Team members include a cardiology resident (supervised by a cardiologist), ward nurses, a physical therapist, a social worker and a dietician. A geriatric consultation team is available for consultation services if requested by the cardiology team.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cardio-geriatric co-management</intervention_name>
    <description>A comprehensive geriatric assessment on admission will stratify patients in groups:
Low risk patients are expected to do well and will not receive co-management.
Medium risk patients are expected to develop complications. A geriatric nurse will visit the cardiology wards daily to co-manage these patients aiming to prevent complications by coordinating interdisciplinary care, implementing protocols, perform assessments and bedside education. The geriatric nurse will work collaboratively with the cardiology ward staff based on a shared decision making. Patients will receive early rehabilitation and discharge planning.
High risk patients have an acute geriatric syndrome. The geriatric nurse with visit the cardiology wards (see above), and a geriatrician will co-manage the acute geriatric syndrome(s). The geriatrician will work collaboratively with the cardiology ward staff based on a shared decision making. Patients will receive early rehabilitation and discharge planning.</description>
