  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adverse effects of air pollution on cardiovascular and respiratory health have been
      demonstrated in an extensive series of epidemiological, observational and experimental
      studies. In the current project the investigators aim to determine whether an acute exposure
      to diesel exhaust causes impacts on sympathetic nervous system activation in healthy
      volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brief as well as chronic exposures to air pollution have been linked with increases in
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Evidence suggests that the strongest associations
      between air pollution exposure and adverse cardiovascular effects are found for
      combustion-derived particulate matter, especially in the fine and ultrafine ranges such as is
      found in diesel engine emissions. Despite a greater understanding of the cardiovascular
      effects of air pollution, the underlying mechanism through which exposure to fine particulate
      air pollution alters vascular function has yet to be determined. Microneurography is a method
      that records nerve impulse traffic in human peripheral nerves, allowing for the assessment of
      sympathetic nervous activity. The current study will employed microneurography techniques to
      evaluate autonomic function in association with inhaled air pollution exposure in healthy
      human volunteers.
