  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study proposes a new and potentially superior clinical approach to Optune™
      therapy of selected glioblastoma patients. The approach is based on combining TTFields with
      targeted surgical skull remodeling, such as minor craniectomy or a distribution of burr
      holes, designed for the individual patient. Pre-clinical modeling results suggest that such
      procedures may enhance the induced electrical field strength by up to ~100% and thereby
      potentially improve the clinical outcome of treated patients to a significant extent.

      The study is an open label phase 1 clinical pilot experiment designed to investigate
      feasibility, safety and efficacy of the concept. Fifteen patients with first recurrence of
      glioblastoma will be included in the trial. All patients will receive TTFields therapy with
      targeted craniotomy and best physician's choice chemotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathological evidence of GBM using WHO classification criteria

          -  Estimated survival minimum three months

          -  Supratentorial tumor

          -  Not a candidate for further radiotherapy

          -  First disease recurrence in accordance with RANO criteria

          -  Karnofsky scale score minimum 70

          -  Ability to comply with Optune therapy

          -  Tumor characteristics which indicate significant expected benefit from feasible

             surface

          -  Use of validated anti-conception for female participants in accordance with guidelines
             provided by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority

          -  Signed written consent form

          -  Total bilirubin &gt; upper limit of normal

          -  Significant renal impairment (serum creatinine &gt; 1.7 mg/dL)

          -  Coagulopathy (as evidenced by PT or APTT &gt; 1.5 times control in normal individuals not
             undergoing anticoagulation)

          -  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100x10^3/μL )

          -  Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g/L)

          -  Active participation in another clinical treatment trial

        Patients will be regarded as participants when they have signed a consent form and have
        been found suitable for enrolment by the examining physician, in accordance with the
        abovecriteria. Patients may receive medication depending on their clinical condition and
        other diseases.
