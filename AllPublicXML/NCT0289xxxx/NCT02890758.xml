  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find the number of natural killer (NK) cells from non-HLA
      matched donors that can be safely infused into patients with cancer. NK cells are a form of
      lymphocytes that defend against cancer cells. NK cells in cancer patients do not work well to
      fight cancer. In this study, the NK cells are being donated by healthy individuals without
      cancer who are not &quot;matched&quot; by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes to patients. After
      receiving these NK cells, patients may also be given a drug called ALT803. ALT803 is a
      protein that keeps NK cells alive, helps them grow in number and supports their
      cancer-fighting characteristics. HLA-unmatched NK cell infusion is investigational
      (experimental) because the process has not approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA).

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose of ex vivo expanded non-HLA matched donor NK cells in
      combination with ALT-803

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Describe safety profile / toxicity of combining ALT-803 with NK cell adoptive therapy.

        -  Determine antitumor activity of allogeneic NK cells with ALT-803 support.

        -  Determine if a lymphocyte depleting regimen is adequate for preventing early elimination
           of HLA-mismatched donor NK cells by host T-cells.

      Study Design:

      This is a phase I study with &quot;3+3&quot; design with three planned dose levels of NK cells and a
      fixed dose of ALT-803. Three patients will be enrolled sequentially to each dose level,
      starting with dose level 1. Patients will be segregated to either receive ALT803 as cytokine
      support after NK cell infusion (starting with same dose level as Level 1) or no cytokine
      administration. Patients in the arm receiving ALT803 will be either hematologic malignancy
      patients (Cohort A) or Colon/Soft tissue sarcoma patients (Cohort B). Absence of dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) in the DLT assessment period of 28 days must be documented for all
      patients enrolled a cell dose without ALT803 before the next cohort of patients to receive
      cytokines at that dose level can be enrolled. Patients can also be enrolled in parallel to
      the next cell dose level without cytokines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. Head imaging will be necessary to
             document absence of CNS involvement in patients with colon/rectal cancer and soft
             tissue sarcomas. Patients with hematologic malignancies who have undergone treatment

             active uncontrolled infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with chemotherapeutic agents. In
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Chronic active untreated hepatitis B or C infection.

          -  Recipients of previous allogeneic transplants who have rash involving more than 10%
             body surface area attributed to graft versus host disease (GVHD) (&gt; Grade 1 GVHD of
             skin). Stem cell transplant recipients will be excluded if they are still receiving
             immunosuppression including steroids for GVHD or have active GVHD in any organ (except
             for Grade 1 only of skin, not requiring treatment).
