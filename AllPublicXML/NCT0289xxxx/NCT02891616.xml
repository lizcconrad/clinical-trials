  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, advanced positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and
      positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging methods will be used to
      validate our hypothesis that melanoma patients receiving Dual-Immune Checkpoint Blockade
      (DICB) therapy, who ultimately achieve clinical benefit, will have an increase, or &quot;FLARE&quot;,
      in tumor FLT and/or FDG uptake from baseline, as seen after cycle#1 of treatment, and that
      after 2 cycles of treatment responders will have a decline in FLT and FDG uptake, in
      comparison to the patients classified as &quot;non-responders&quot;. In addition, alterations in tumor
      apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
      (DW/MRI) will be evaluated, expecting after cycle#1: transient reductions in ADC due to
      lymphocyte proliferation, increased cellularity and restriction of water movement in
      responding patients, with these patients tumors having increased ADC at 2 cycles into therapy
      associated with tumor necrosis. This study will evaluate rather early PET imaging with FLT
      and FDG is a useful imaging biomarker of response to DICB.

    <description>-Baseline, Week 3 (between days 14-20), Week 6 (between days 35-41)
FDG-PET/CT - Patients required to fast for at least 4 hours prior to FDG administration. Roughly 60 minutes prior to PET/CT imaging, FDG will be administered via IV bolus injection. A CT will be performed immediately before PET imaging. Whole body PET imaging will be performed for a total of about 30 minutes.
FLT-PET/CT - Patients required to fast for at least 4 hours prior to FLT administration. Roughly 80 minutes prior to PET/CT imaging, FLT will be administered via IV bolus injection. A CT will be performed immediately before PET imaging. Whole body PET imaging will be performed for a total of about 30 minutes.
PET/MR - A limited whole body scan performed immediately following PET/CT imaging when possible. Should be performed at least once at each time-point. This scan will be of a more limited area and be performed for no more than 30 minutes.</description>

             unresectable, stage III or metastatic melanoma.

          -  Patients who are eligible to receive combined dual immune-checkpoint blockade therapy
             with ipilimumab and nivolumab, per referring oncologist.

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 6 months.

          -  Disease that is measurable. This is defined as lesions measuring at least 10mm on
             radiologic imaging.

          -  The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1 or better

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Normal organ and marrow function as defined below

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (SGOT) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (SGPT)
                  ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (≤5 x upper limit of normal for
                  patient with liver metastasis)

               -  Total bilirubin within 1.5 x institutional level of normal or direct bilirubin ≤
                  upper limit of normal (ULN) for patient with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN)

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0g/dL or ≥5.6mmol/L

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000/mcL

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urinary or serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days of baseline imaging.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Significant auto-immune disease requiring hospitalization within the past two years or
             any history of life-threatening auto-immune disease

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy including systemic corticosteroids except for maintenance
             dosing for adrenal insufficiency

          -  Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment with the
             exceptions of basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,
             or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.

          -  Active autoimmune disease or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or
             immunosuppressive agents with the exceptions of replacement dose steroids for adrenal
             insufficiency, vitiligo, resolved childhood asthma/atopy, intermittent use of inhaled
             steroids, local steroid injections, hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement, and

             resonance (MR) contraindicated implant or foreign body would warrant exclusion from
             this study. Pacemakers may be reprogrammed or turned off by the strong MRI magnetic
             field. Radio-frequency (RF) fields in MR can also cause severe heating of pacemaker
             lead tips. Steel aneurysm clips are prone to torque in the strong MR field which can
             displace the clips and may damage the vessel, resulting in hemorrhage, and/or death.

          -  History of pneumonitis requiring hospitalization or systemic immune suppressive
             therapy.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study
