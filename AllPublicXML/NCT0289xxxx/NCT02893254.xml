    <textblock>
      Study of the efficacy and safety of IBI303 compared with adalimumab in adult patients with
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have had an inadequate response to or who are intolerant to
      one or more nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

    <textblock>
      Adults patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive treatment with adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) or IBI303, given
      subcutaneously (SC), in the 24-week double-blind (DB) phase. Randomized participants received
      one SC injection of the appropriate DB study medication (adalimumab 40 mg or IBI303) at Week
      0 and then eow until Week 22. A follow-up visit occurred 70 days(Week 32) after the last dose
      of study drug to obtain information on any ongoing or new adverse events (AEs).
