    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at the efficacy (the effect on tumor) and the
      safety (the effect on body) of the study drugs when given as a combination in patients with
      metastatic recurrent epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative inflammatory breast
      cancer. This is a phase II study of 2 drugs used in combination: nivolumab and ipilimumab.
      The combination of these drugs is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      to treat advanced melanoma (a type of skin cancer). Nivolumab and ipilimumab are not approved
      by the FDA for patients with metastatic recurrent HER2 negative inflammatory breast cancer,
      hence the treatment is considered experimental or investigational.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression free survival (PFS) in patients with newly recurrent HER2
      negative inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab according to
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v) 1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) according to
      RECIST criteria v1.1, in patients with recurrent IBC treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      II. To assess overall survival in patients with recurrent HER2 negative IBC treated with
      nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      III. To assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with
      recurrent IBC according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events v 4.03.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the predictive value of baseline iSCORE and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1
      (PDL-1) expression using archival tissue samples as well as any standard of care tissue
      obtained during study treatment.

      II. To assess the predictive value of circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) and immune
      signature by exosome analysis using blood samples at baseline.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W) and
      ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes every 6 weeks (Q6W) in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 12 weeks, and
      then every 3 months for up to 2 years.
