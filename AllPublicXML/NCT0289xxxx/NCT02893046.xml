  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this research is to evaluate a care pathway adapted to different
      category populations at risk of being infected with the hepatitis C virus in order to improve
      both the diagnosis turnaround times and the access to treatment. The aim is to allow a quick
      and effective access to diagnosis and treatment of HCV by strengthening the city hospital
      networks, access to early consultations and coordination of medical social actors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current estimation of infected persons with chronic hepatitis C in France is over 200
      ,000. It appears that prevention, screening, care management, medical and social care of
      patients can be significantly improved especially among the most vulnerable populations.
      Indeed, these new HCV infections are mediated by drug-using people, prisoners, migrants, men
      who have sex with men (MSM) and who are supported too late and without real access to
      treatment.
