  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This primary object of this study is to test to the hypothesis that the both the nudge and
      boost messages will increase short term gym utilization relative to the control condition but
      that only the boost message will increase long-term gym utilization.

      Non-technical summary: College students will receive one of three messages about exercise.
      Their card swipe data as a measure of gym utilization will be tracked as an assessment of the
      effect of those messages.

      Our study uses a survey methodology. Within the survey, participants are randomly assigned to
      experimental conditions. After completion of the survey, participants' real-world behavior is
      assessed via gym card swipe data.

      Within the survey, an experimental quantitative three group design will be used to answer our
      research question. Thus, our independent variable has three levels: the control message, the
      nudge message, and the boost message. Our dependent variable will be collected gym card
      swipes over the semester.

      The three experimental message conditions will be delivered within the questionnaire that
      participants complete. The control group will read only summary information about the David
      Pottruck Health and Fitness Center. Participants in the nudge condition will read a similar
      summary but will also be given a prompt to form an implementation intention. Those in the
      Boost condition will also have summary information about the Pottruck gym but will also be
      given information about why an implantation intention is an effective way to attain long term
      goals. They will also be given a prompt to form an implementation intention.
