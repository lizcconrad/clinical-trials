  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain following mastectomy surgery for breast cancer can be significant. Poorly managed pain
      in the immediate time-period following surgery can potentially lead to long-term (chronic)
      pain conditions. There is still a need to find the safest, least invasive, and most effective
      method to manage this pain. The investigators believe that a new technique of injecting local
      anesthesia (freezing) in to specific areas at the end of mastectomy surgery may be a very
      important step to managing pain after breast surgery. The investigators would like to begin
      by performing a pilot study, meaning the investigators will perform the technique in patients
      and compare what their pain outcomes are to patients who have not had the technique.

    <textblock>
      Mastectomy is associated with significant acute postoperative pain. It has been shown that
      inadequately managed post-mastectomy pain in breast cancer patients can have detrimental
      physiological, psycho-behavioural, recovery and healthcare utilization consequences. Most
      significantly, acute postoperative pain appears to be a substantial risk factor for
      progression to chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP), occurring in up to 68% of patients,, with
      higher severity of acute pain being linked with a greater progression to CPSP. A multimodal
      analgesic approach is the optimal method of reducing the risk of progression to CPSP, and
      there are a number of analgesic techniques that can be used to reduce the incidence of acute
      postoperative pain. Of the analgesic techniques used, the most common are multimodal systemic
      analgesia, thoracic paravertebral blockade, thoracic epidural analgesia, local anesthetic
      wound infiltration, and more recently pecs blocks and serratus plane blocks. The former three
      techniques are all associated with drawbacks including technical challenges, high risk of
      adverse effects, and limited evidence to minimize the progression to CPSP states, whilst
      local anesthetic wound infiltration has highly variable pain outcomes. Therefore, an
      alternative, safer, and more effective technique would be ideal.

      Local infiltration analgesia (LIA) techniques have been demonstrated to be efficacious in
      joint surgery, whilst injection of local anesthesia in the serratus plane to target some of
      the intercostal and pectoral nerves may have some benefit in mastectomy surgery. However,
      nobody has yet performed LIA around these nerves in breast surgery, and the investigators
      feel that this has enormous potential.

    <description>This is a quantitative pilot study assessing whether a new technique of local anesthesia injection during mastectomy surgery gives better pain outcomes than the standard methods. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be invited to partake and all patients will have the injection technique. These patients will then be monitored for pain outcomes up to 7 days following the surgery and the results compared with historical results from patients who have already had the surgery.</description>
