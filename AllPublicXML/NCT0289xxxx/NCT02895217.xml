  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training on an immersible ergocycle is becoming more popular as it appears to be
      more suitable for men and women even with poor physical activity level. Commercial tagline
      highlight beneficial effect of this activity on weight management. However there are poor
      information concerning the energy response induced by this activity. The aim of this project
      is to investigate energetic response (energy expenditure and food intake) of a single bout of
      cycling exercise in water vs on dryland in normal weight and overweight premenopausal women.

      After inclusion visit, all subject will be submitted to DXA to obtain body composition data.
      Then subjects will be submitted to four experimental session in a semi-randomized order. For
      all those session, subjects will take a standardized breakfast (570kcal) three hours before
      experimental session.

      Control session (CON): subject will stand sited without any activity during 30 min.

      Water exercise session (WAT): subject will exercise on an immersed ergocycle during 30 min at
      50 rpm.

      Dryland session 1 (LAND-1): subject will exercise on dryland, on the same ergocycle than in
      WAT session, during 30 min at 50 rpm.

      Dryland session 2 (LAND-2): subject will exercise on dryland on the same ergocycle than in
      WAT. Intensity of exercise will be set at the same heart rate average than in WAT session,
      exercise will be stopped when subject will have reached the same energy expenditure than
      during WAT session.

      During each session, energy expenditure, heart rate and rate of perceived exertion will be
      measured at 15 min and 30min.

      Appetite and hunger sensation will be measured with a specific scale at different time point
      of each day of experimental session. Thirty minutes after the end of each experimental
      session subjects will have a buffet meal for lunch time.
