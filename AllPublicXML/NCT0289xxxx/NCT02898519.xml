  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection induced by pathogen bacteria (genus: Leptospira)
      growing in water polluted by animal fluids. Due to its 10 fold occurence in French overseas
      aera, and especially in Reunion Island, as compared to metropoly, it is considered as a major
      public health issue.

      An important inter-individual variability in humoral immune response suggests that
      vaccination should be recommended in exposed subjects.

      This cohort study aimed to determine if subjects that have been infected by leptospirosis for
      1 to 7 years still remain immunized, and then do not need vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year more than 500 000 severe forms of leptospirosis are diagnosed in Reunion Island.
      The risk of mucocutaneous contact with contaminated media remains important due to highly
      aqueous environment.

      Cured subjects that have been infected for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 years will be enrolled. The
      qualitative and quantitative humoral immune response to leptospirosis infection will also be
      evaluated to determine whether they still get protective immunization. Leptospirosis
      immunization will be evaluated using micro-agglutination test.

      Graded immune responses related to the severity and the length of the infection will also be
      investigated.

      Finally, 3 methods used for leptospirosis diagnosis will be compared. It is expected from
      this study to evaluate the appropriate conditions in which new vaccination could be required
      to prevent further leptospirosis infection in cured subjects.
