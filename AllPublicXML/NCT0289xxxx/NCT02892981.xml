  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the role of chemoreceptor activity and ventilation perfusion
      mismatch on the genesis of exercise induced hyperventilation in Pulmonary hypertension
      patients. So the investigators tested the chemoreceptor response at rest, both with hypoxic
      and hypercapnic stimuli, and the ventilatory response during exercise analyzing its two
      components, alveolar and dead space ventilation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>dead space ventilation (measured in L/min)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Dead space ventilation is calculated through the equation: VT* [1- (863*VCO2)/(VE*PaCO2)], where VT = tidal volume, VCO2= CO2 output, VE= pulmonary ventilation,PaCO2 is the arterial partial pressure of CO2 and 863 is a constant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>peripheral response to hypoxia (measured in L/min/O2)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>the hypoxic test is based on the transient hypoxia (the patient inhales a mixture of nitrogen for 2-8 breaths, for 10-15 times); pulmonary ventilation (VE) and arterial oxygen saturation (O2 Saturation) by peripheral pulse oximetry is measured. The chemoreceptor sensitivity value is calculated as the slope of the trend line built on the two maximum consecutive VE and minimum O2 Saturation of each test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>peripheral response to hypercapnia (measured in L/min/mmHg)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>the peripheral response to hypercapnia is evaluated through the single-breath technique (the patient inhales a mixture of 13% CO2 in air for a single breath); pulmonary ventilation (VE) and end-expiratory CO2 fraction (FetCO2) are measured and then they will be used to calculate the peripheral chemoreceptor sensitivity.In fact, the sensitivity of the chemoreceptor is calculated using the following formula VEs-VEc / (FetCO2s-FetCO2c) * (PB-47), where s and c indicate the data collected after hypercapnic stimulus and those collected during control air breathing ,respectively; PB is the atmospheric pressure in mmHg</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>central hypercapnic chemosensitivity (measured in L/min/mmHg)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>the evaluation of the central response to hypercapnia is made through the re-breathing technique (the patient breathes through a reservoir containing 7% CO2 and 93% O2 for 4 minutes); pulmonary ventilation (VE) and partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) are evaluated. The slope of the curve describing the relationship between VE and PetCO2 identifies the central chemoreceptor sensitivity</description>
