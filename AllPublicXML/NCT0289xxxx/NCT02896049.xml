  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the basic data of all patients foreseen for a local hyperthermia in the
      participating centers the failure rate (of the Celsius TCS Hyperthermia System) and the
      complication rate (injury to the patients) will be recorded.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During this PMCF Trial from each participating center the internal data of all Celsius TCS
      Hyperthermia devices are collected. The participating centers are obligated to report any
      device-related failure and Adverse Event (injury to the patient). The center reports together
      with the device-internal data allows to calculate the failure and the complication rates. It
      will be analyzed regarding the kind of tumor and the concomitant treatment (radiotherapy
      and/or chemotherapy). The outcome groups (with/without failure or complication) will be
      analyzed regarding demographic and treatment parameters.

        The study will include all treatments performed with the Celsius TCS Hyperthermia System at
        the participating centers throughout the study period. (Normally these are neoplasm
        patients treated additionally with radiation and/or chemotherapy.)
