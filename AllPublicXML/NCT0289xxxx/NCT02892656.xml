      The purpose of this study is to determine the reliability of the Oswestry disability index
      (ODI) Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) and the Major
      Depression Inventory (MDI) in a chronic low back pain (CLBP) population referred to The
      Danish Rheumatism Associations´ rehabilitation centre Sano Aarhus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a highly prevalent health condition, and the leading cause of
      years lived with disability both globally and in Denmark. In the majority of patients with
      CLBP, no underlying pathology or cause can be identified and CLBP is acknowledged to be
      multifactorial. CLBP is defined by symptoms lasting for a period longer than three months.
      The high prevalence of CLBP causes a substantial impact on patients and their families,
      communities and health-care systems, as well as a financial burden. Besides pain and
      disability people with CLBP often experience psychosocial consequences with signs of anxiety
      and depression and effects on social, leisure, and work life.

      An important component in rehabilitation is documentation of treatment outcomes. This demands
      that a change over time can be measured. To determine effect, the measurement tool must
      detect real or important change over time. This requires the measurement tool is reliable,
      and therefore will show no real or important change in periods where the patient is stable.
      If the measurement tool shows real or important change, in periods where there is no change
      in the patient state, the results can not be predicted as an effect from an intervention, but
      due to uncertainty of measurement tool.

      The measurement tools are selected by the recommendation of literature and involvement of
      clinicians and patients at sano, and examines patient with CLBP.

      It is found necessary to determine the reliability of the abovementioned measurement tools in
      an overall picture on the CLBP population referred to Sano Aarhus. Data will be
      electronically entered in, stored in and collected from Sanos internal database (SanoBasen).
