  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether L-citrulline is effective and safe in the
      prevention of clinical sequelae of Acute Lung Injury in pediatric subjects undergoing surgery
      for congenital heart defects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study that will compare
      the efficacy and safety of L-citrulline versus placebo in subjects undergoing surgery for
      congenital heart defects.

      Eligible subjects undergoing repair of a large unrestrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD),
      a partial or complete atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), or an ostium primum atrial
      septal defect (primum ASD) will be eligible for enrollment in this study.

      Each enrolled subject will be randomized to receive either L-citrulline or placebo throughout
      all administrations in the study. Subjects will receive an L-citrulline bolus of 150 mg/kg or
      placebo at the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, the addition of L-citrulline at a
      concentration of 200 μmol/L or placebo given as a bolus during bypass. This may be
      administered as a one-time bolus or multiple administrations to compensate for fluids
      containing L-citrulline that may be removed from the patient during the course of the
      operation and thus to maintain the concentration of 200 μmol/L. L-citrulline bolus of 20
      mg/kg or placebo 30 minutes after decannulation from cardiopulmonary bypass, followed
      immediately by a 9 mg/kg/hr continuous L-citrulline infusion or placebo for up to 48 hours.

      The study drug or placebo infusion will be discontinued once invasive arterial blood pressure
      monitoring is discontinued or at 48 hours, whichever comes first. Subjects will be followed
      until Day 28 or discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first. For subjects discharged
      prior to Day 28, a final assessment via telephone will be conducted at Day 28.

    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The thoracotomy output is defined as the total volume of chest tube drainage recorded in cc prior to discontinuation of chest intubation. The total postoperative duration (in hours) that the chest tube is used will be calculated as the time from the end of the surgery to the time the chest tube is removed. If an additional chest tube is required or reinserted (until discharge from the hospital or at Day 28) the duration that the additional chest tube was used (from time of insertion to time of removal) will be added to the time the original chest tube was used for the total postoperative duration. If a subject did not use any chest tube the duration is set to 0. As a sensitivity analysis, subjects with no use of chest tube will be excluded. For subjects who died before discharge from the hospital or before Day 28, respectively, the observed duration of chest tube drainage will be used.</description>
