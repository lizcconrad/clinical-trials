      The study aims to evaluate the current surgical treatment and its result for Congenital
      Pseudarthrosis of tibia (CPT)in children in China. A retrospective study will be conducted
      with around 150 patients at 11 centers in China. This study will use available registry data
      from a defined time period of Jan 2006-Dec 2014. The treatment method will be recorded. The
      bone union rate and the refracture rate were calculated to evaluate the final result of
      several surgical treatment.

    <time_frame>9 months post-operation</time_frame>
    <description>Ohnishi criterion: Degree of union was evaluated by the findings on radiographs and classified into three grades( Ohnishi criterion): union, delayed union, and nonunion. Radiographic union was defined as possessing continuity of bone density between the fragments without obvious radiolucent zone between them and possessing cortex-bridging fragments with sufficient thickness and radiodensity on both anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. Delayed union was defined as a process of healing that was slow but was progressing. Nonunion was defined by the healing process that had completely ceased.</description>

    <description>Johnston clinical evaluation criterion of Congenital Pseudarthrosis of Tibia (CPT): The outcome was classified as grade 1 when there was unequivocal union with full weight-bearing function and maintenance of alignment requiring no additional surgical treatment; grade 2 when there was equivocal union with useful function, with the limb protected by a brace, and/or valgus or sagittal bowing for which additional surgery was required or anticipated; and grade 3 when there was persistent nonunion or refracture, requiring full-time external support for pain and/or instability.</description>
