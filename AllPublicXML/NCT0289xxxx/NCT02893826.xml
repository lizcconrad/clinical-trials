        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ruptured saccular aneurysm repaired by neurosurgical clipping

          2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage on computed tomography (CT) scan of grade 2-4 on the modified
             Fischer scale

          3. WFNS grade 1 or 2 assessed during the Pre-randomization Phase. If WFNS grade 2, must
             not require an EVD prior to aneurysm repair

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Major complication during aneurysm repair such as, but not limited to, massive
             intraoperative hemorrhage, brain swelling, arterial occlusion or inability to secure
             the ruptured aneurysm

          2. Angiographic vasospasm prior to randomization

          3. Evidence of cerebral infarction with neurological deficit
