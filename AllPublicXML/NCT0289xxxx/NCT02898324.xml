  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bullying is a major problem worldwide and, with no exception, in Chile. Bullying is defined
      as a systematic aggressive behavior against a victim who cannot defend himself or herself.
      Victims suffer many consequences such as social isolation, psychological maladjustment, and
      self-injury behavior. Additionally, bullies have a higher risk for conduct problems and
      substance use disorders. These problems appear to last in time, affecting mental health even
      years later since the experience of bullying.

      There are few studies in Chile aiming to determine the prevalence of bullying. In one of such
      studies, 47% of the students reported having been bullied during the last month before the
      application of the questionnaire. Even though there are many initiatives and guidelines in
      Chile supported by the government to help schools in order to deal with bullying, there is no
      any cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to assess the effectiveness of an
      anti-bullying program.

      KiVa anti-bullying prevention program contains universal and indicated actions. Main
      universal actions for 5 to 6 graders consist of 10 two-hours lessons given during a year and
      an online game, which have the aim to raise awareness of the role of the group in bullying,
      increase empathy and promote strategies to support victims. Indicated actions consist of a
      set of discussion groups with the victims and with the bullies with proper follow-up.

      The aims of this study are: 1) To develop a culturally appropriate version of the Kiva
      material, and 2) to test its effectiveness of KiVa program with and without the online game,
      to reduce bullying behavior among low-income primary schools in Santiago using a cluster RCT
      design with three arms: i) KiVa full program group, ii) KiVa without online game program
      group, and iii) Control group.

    <description>KiVa program is an anti-bullying intervention developed in University of Turku, Finland. It is based on the participant role model, where bullying is seen as a group process focused on the bystanders' reactions to the bullying. This program includes universal and indicated actions. Universal actions include ten students lessons given by teachers where pupils learn the role of bystanders in the bullying process, how to increase empathy towards the victim, and safe strategies to supports victims. Indicated actions are delivered by a school team of three staff members, who handle acute cases of bullying.</description>
