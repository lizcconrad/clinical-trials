  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to investigate chronobiological aspects of childhood obesity studying
      the potential relationship between meal patterns and circadian rhythmicity in a
      cross-sectional sample of obese, overweight and normal weight children/adolescent.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30
      y. As consequence, increasingly children and adolescents suffer from elevated blood pressure,
      impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia. Obesity has a multifactorial
      etiology since there are potentially numerous contributors to its development and
      progression. Chronobiology, the science that studies periodic (cyclic) changes in living
      organisms, has been recently proposed as a new and promising topic to investigate.
      Alterations of circadian (24 h oscillations) system may contribute to obesity and its
      complications development such as high blood pressure, insulin resistance, altered fasting
      lipid profile. Conversely, in a vicious manner, obesity has been regarded as a fault in the
      circadian system explainable by the association with imbalances and fluctuations of
      hormones/genes expressions rhythms under the influence of body weight changes.

      Thus, the study will examine changes in circadian rhythmicity over a week period. The primary
      end point will be to evaluate differences between obese/overweight and non-obese children in
      chronotypes and the responses of these parameters to meal patterns. In particular,
      non-invasive measures that are well-established determinants of chronotypes will form the
      core endpoints for the study. Well designed and age-appropriate questionnaires will provide
      further information in order to study correlations with eating, sleeping and sedentary/active
      behaviors.

    <measure>Individual chronotype with the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To assess chronotype with a questionnaire that establishes an algorithm which optimises chronotype assessment by incorporating the information on timing of sleep and wakefulness for both work and free days. The timing and duration of sleep are generally independent. However, when the two are analysed separately for work and free days, sleep duration strongly depends on chronotype. In addition, chronotype is both age- and sex-dependent.</description>
