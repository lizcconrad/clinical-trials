        All patients over 75 years under anticoagulant treatment 'xaban' (dabigatran, rivaroxaban,
        Apixaban) for atrial fibrillation, hospital unscheduled manner in Medicine and Geriatric
        services Versatile Service Home Emergency CHU Nantes and where a hemostatic balance is
        expected to be offered the study.

        The recruitment will be made on a 6-month period (November 2014 - April 2015). Bioassay
        'xaban' will be made from the remainder of the tube removed for hemostasis tests provided
        in the usual care of patients.
