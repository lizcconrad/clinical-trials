      This prospective multicenter registry evaluates the efficacy of hybrid coronary
      revascularization (HCR) combining coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) and percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) in the treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease. CABG is
      to be performed in the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex artery using
      only arterial grafts, whereas PCI is to be conducted for the treatment of significant
      stenotic disease in the right coronary artery with everolimus-eluting stents (EESs). This
      research plans to involve patients scheduled for coronary revascularization for multivessel
      coronary artery disease who consent to participate in the registry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with stable angina, unstable angina, or non-ST elevation myocardial
             infarction.

               -  Patients with multivessel coronary artery disease including significant stenotic
                  lesion* in the right coronary artery and also including left main stem disease.

               -  Patients who will be referred for CABG.

               -  Patients with significant stenotic lesion in the right coronary artery amenable
                  to PCI.

               -  Patients who can take DAPT medications.

               -  Patients who provided written informed consent. * Significant stenotic lesion
                  means a condition where fractional flow reserve (FFR) is lower than 0.80 or
                  visually confirmed stenosis is at least 75%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction occurring within 24 hours before
             enrollment.

               -  Patients who previously underwent CABG.

               -  Patients who are at high risk of receiving CABG.

               -  Patients who need simultaneous surgery such as valve surgery other than CABG.

               -  Patients with a life expectancy of 1 year or shorter due to co-morbidities.

               -  Patients with a history of cerebral infarction within the last 6 months.

               -  Patients with congestive cardiac failure of NYHA 3 or higher.

               -  Patients with unstable hemodynamics at enrollment.

               -  Patients with right coronary artery disease that is chronic total occlusion and
                  difficult to treat with PCI (J-CTO score of ≥ 23).

               -  Patients receiving long-term dialysis.

               -  Patients who are allergic to antiplatelet agent.

               -  Patients who are critically allergic to contrast media.

               -  Patients who are allergic to any DES component.
