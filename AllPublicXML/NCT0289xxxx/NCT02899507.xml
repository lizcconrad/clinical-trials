      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is potential benefits of prophylactic
      antibiotic treatment in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) treated
      in intensive care unit with therapeutic hypothermia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postresuscitation management of comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)
      significantly improved and &quot;bundle of care&quot; including therapeutic hypothermia, immediate
      coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and contemporary intensive
      care nowadays leads to survival with good neurological recovery. Benefit of prophylactic
      antibiotics, which may suppress development of postresuscitation infection and especially
      early onset pneumonia and thereby decrease the severity of postresuscitation systemic
      inflammatory response, is controversial. Because of these uncertainties, the investigators
      performed a single-center randomized clinical trial comparing prophylactic versus
      clinically-driven administration of antibiotics in comatose survivors of OHCA. The
      investigators hypothesized that prophylactic antibiotics may decrease the severity of
      postresuscitation systemic inflammatory response by reducing the incidence of
      postresuscitation infection and especially pneumonia which was further addressed by repeat
      microbiological sampling.
