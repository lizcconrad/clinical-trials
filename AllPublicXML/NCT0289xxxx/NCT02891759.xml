  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the performance of Alloderm RTU medium (LifeCell) vs. Cortiva 1mm
      Allograft Dermis (RTI Surgical®, Inc.). These are the thinnest versions of acellular dermal
      matrices (ADM) offered by both vendors and can be used for post-mastectomy breast
      reconstruction. Alloderm RTU medium has a thickness of 1.6±0.4 mm, while Cortiva 1mm
      Allograft Dermis has a thickness of 1.0±0.2 mm. In the context of breast reconstruction,
      these ADMs are used in the same manner. They may be inserted with a tissue expander
      immediately after skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy. The investigators will examine
      breast-reconstruction associated complication rates, pre- and post-operative patient reported
      outcomes using the Breast Q, and physician reimbursement as well as direct hospital costs.
      The endpoint will be either exchange of the tissue expander for a permanent breast implant or
      autologous flap, explantation due to patient preference, development of a complication, or
      less common reasons. The investigators propose that Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis and Alloderm
      RTU will have equivalent complication and patient reported outcome rates as well as physician
      reimbursement, but that direct hospital cost will be less with Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis.

    <description>All participants meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have a skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction will be included in the analyses of the primary study endpoint.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction as measured by Breast Q</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Each domain contains separate modules that investigate physical, psychosocial, and sexual well-being as well as their satisfaction with their care, breasts, and overall outcome.
It also investigates patient expectations in the preoperative questionnaire, and degree to which expectations were met in the post-operative version.
Each module generates a Q-score on a 0-100 scale that can be used for quantitative analysis to enable statistical comparison of the pre- to the post-operative state.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 15 months</time_frame>

    <measure>Comparison of direct hospital costs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 15 months</time_frame>
    <description>-These are available through Barnes hospital and will be normalized to Medicare rates by conversion from relative value units (RVU) due to heterogeneity in payer mix. Line item costs as well as patient-level data will not be available due to the proprietary nature of these products. However, normalized, aggregate patient data for the cycle of care in each study arm (Alloderm RTU vs Cortiva 1mm Allograft Dermis) is available and will be calculated. &quot;Direct costs&quot; are those that can be traced directly to a department, product or service, excluding overhead costs, and thus reflect the hospital's assessment of the cost it incurred providing the specific services and supplies used by the patients. All breast reconstruction related costs performed by Barnes, or Barnes West County hospital from the first surgery up until immediately before the second surgery will be included.</description>

    <description>-This is breast-level data since the left and right side may differ in bilateral reconstruction cases. The investigators already track tissue expander fills as part of the electronic medical record. The amount of tissue expander fill during surgery and device type are recorded in the operative record.</description>

    <description>Prior to the date of mastectomy, the BREAST Q patient-reported outcome survey will be administered for routine clinical care purposes. It may occur before or after enrollment.
On the day of surgery, patients will receive standardized preoperative care, a skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy from one of two experienced surgical breast oncologists (Dr. Cyr or Dr. Margenthaler), and immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction with Dr. Myckatyn or Dr. Tenenbaum. Uniform operative techniques will be used in both treatment groups. All patients will receive a 16x8 cm (128 sq cm) ADM graft. Patients randomized to Group A will receive Alloderm RTU
A post-operative version of the Breast Q validated in patients who have received tissue expanders will be administered between 1 and 3 months after tissue expander insertion, and again prior to exchange for an implant or flap (or at time of patient-requested removal</description>
