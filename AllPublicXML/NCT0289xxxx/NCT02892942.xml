  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To overcome unsuitable effects of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH )while maintaining
      large oocyte availability, investigators elaborated an innovative protocol (NATural Ovarian
      Stimulation) that dissociates E2 production from multiple follicle development.

      The purpose of this prospective, randomized trial is to demonstrate that, in a good prognosis
      IVF-ET population, the physiological E2 environment resulting from NATOS significantly
      improves IVF-ET outcome when compared to the conventional GnRH antagonist protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) seeks to improve IVF-ET results by increasing
      per-cycle oocyte and embryo availability. Yet, the coexistence of multiple preovulatory
      follicles engenders compulsory alterations in the endocrine milieu of the follicular phase.
      The most evident of them are the extremely high serum estradiol (E2) levels. The 10 to
      15-fold increase in E2 levels as a result of COH has been shown to provoke unwanted
      consequences in both embryo quality and uterine receptivity.

      Therefore, investigators elaborated an innovative COH protocol (NATural Ovarian Stimulation)
      that aimed at dissociating E2 production from multiple follicle development. To obtain this
      effect, they virtually curtailed endogenous LH production by using GnRH antagonist doses as
      strong and frequent enough to maintain E2 levels around the physiological range during
      standard exogenous FSH-only administration. Given that high E2 levels are commonly reached in
      patients having a normal follicle endowment, NATOS should target this group of good prognosis
      IVF-ET candidates. Indeed, this new COH approach was first tested in a pilot study that
      included 15 good prognosis IVF-ET candidates, aged 25-35 years, who volunteered to undergo
      NATOS. 11 out of 15 patients achieved a pregnancy. These pilot results spurred them to
      conduct a prospective, randomized trial to demonstrate that, in a good prognosis IVF-ET
      population, the physiological E2 environment resulting from NATOS significantly improves
      IVF-ET outcome when compared to the conventional GnRH antagonist protocol.
