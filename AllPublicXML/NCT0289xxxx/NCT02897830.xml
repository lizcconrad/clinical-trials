    <textblock>
      Open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ixazomib in combination with
      Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). The
      patient population will consist of adult men and women up to 65 years, who have a confirmed
      diagnosis of MM who meet eligibility criteria.

      Patients will receive induction therapy, comprising three cycles with Ixazomib, plus
      Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone.

      Peripheral Blood Stem Cells (PBSC) will be mobilized within 2 weeks (+/- 1 week) after the
      last dose of Lenalidomide, with Cyclophosphamide plus G-CSF or Granulocyte-CSF(Colony
      Stimulating Factor).

      Intensification: High Dose Melphalan (HDM) will be performed within 3 weeks +/- 1 week
      following stem cell harvest.

      After Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, patient will enter in the consolidation
      phase:

      Early consolidation (consolidation part 1) will start 2 months after transplantation and will
      comprise 2 cycles of MLN - Rd (MLN R identical to induction therapy but low dose of
      Dexamethasone).

      Late consolidation (consolidation part 2) will consist in 6 additional cycles of Ixazomib
      plus Lenalidomide. No Dexamethasone.

      Maintenance therapy will start within 28 days after the last dose of Lenalidomide in last
      cycle of Late Consolidation for thirteen 28-day cycles (approximately 12 months duration)
      Patients will be seen at regular treatment cycle intervals while they are participating in
      the study.

      Response will be assessed according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
      criteria until disease progression. All patients will be followed for survival after
      progression.
