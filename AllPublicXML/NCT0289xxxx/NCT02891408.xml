             individual in the mild hepatic impairment group.

          -  Individuals with mild hepatic impairment must have a score of 5-6 on the
             Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) Classification at screening, have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6
             months), and stable hepatic impairment with no clinically significant changes within 3
             months (or 90 days) prior to study drug administration (Day 1).

          -  Individuals will be current non-smokers (no smoking of tobacco, nicotine-containing or
             THC-containing products within the last 14 days).

          -  Each individual in the control group will be matched for age (± 10 years), gender,
             race, and body mass index (± 15% 18 ≤ BMI ≤ 36 kg/m^2) with an individual in the
             moderate hepatic impairment group.

             Classification at screening, have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), and stable
             hepatic impairment with no clinically significant changes within 3 months (or 90 days)
             prior to study drug administration (Day 1).

        Cohort 3 (Severe Hepatic Impairment):

          -  Male and nonpregnant/non-lactating females, ages 18-70 years inclusive with severely
             impaired and normal hepatic function.

          -  Individuals will be current non-smokers (no use of tobacco, nicotine-containing or
             THC-containing products within the last 14 days).

          -  Each individual in the control group will be matched for age (± 10 years), gender,
             race, and body mass index (± 15% 18 ≤ BMI ≤ 36 kg/m^2) with an individual in the
             severe hepatic impairment group.

          -  Individuals with severe hepatic impairment must have a score of 10-15 on the CPT
             Classification at screening, have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), and stable
             hepatic impairment with no clinically significant changes within 3 months (or 90 days)
             prior to study drug administration (Day 1).
