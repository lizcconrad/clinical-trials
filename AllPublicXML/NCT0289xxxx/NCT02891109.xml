      The chronic immune thrombopenia is an autoimmune disease caused by B cells. These cells
      produce anti platelets and megakaryocytes antibodies. Some B cells, named regulatory B cells,
      are known to control other cells. Their action in chronic immune thrombopenia is actually
      unknown.

      The chronic immune thrombopenia is an autoimmune disease caused by B cells. These cells
      produce anti platelets and megakaryocytes antibodies. Some B cells, named regulatory B cells,
      are known to control other cells. Their action in chronic immune thrombopenia is actually
      unknown. In our cohort of chronic immune thrombopenia and controls, we realized a flow
      cytometry analyze of B and T cells and a co-culture to determine regulatory B cells
      functionality.
