      Purpose: The purpose of this study would be to evaluate the effects of interval training on
      cardiovascular health, lipid profile and body composition in overweight and obese men and
      women.

      A secondary purpose will be to compare lab based measurements of body composition
      [4-compartment model (4C)) with portable equipment [bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy
      (BIS) and ultrasound (US)]

      Participants: Seventy-six men and women (age 18-55 yrs; BMI 25-45 kg/m2) will be randomly
      assigned to a high-intensity short interval group (SIT), high-intensity long interval group
      (HIT) or a control group (CON). Procedures (methods): Participants will be assessed for peak
      oxygen utilization (VO2peak), blood lipids, glucose and insulin levels. Body composition will
      also be measured using a 4C model, as measured from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA),
      air displacement plethysmography (BodPod), and BIS, in comparison to US values. Participants
      assigned to either training group will undergo 3 weeks of interval training, 3 days per week.
      SIT will complete 10 bouts of a series of 1 min cycling with 1 min rest periods at 90% of the
      power output obtained during VO2peak;in comparison HIT will complete 5 bouts of the same
      protocol: 2 min bouts with 1 min recovery at varying intensities of VO2peak (80-100% power
      output).
