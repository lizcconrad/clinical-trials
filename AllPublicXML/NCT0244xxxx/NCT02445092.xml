    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that washing the insemination catheter prior to performing the
      IUI (intrauterine insemination) will improve the pregnancy outcome in IUI cycles when
      compared to controls (without pre-washing the catheter).

      Catheter washing is performed routinely before embryo transfer, however it is not done for
      IUI catheters. Therefore no data is available on applying the technique to IUI catheters
      prior to insemination.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary objective:

      To determine if pre-washing the catheter before insemination improves the pregnancy outcome
      in women undergoing IUI.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the impact of pre-washing the catheter before insemination on the ectopic
           pregnancy rate in women undergoing IUI.

        2. To evaluate the impact of pre-washing the catheter before insemination on the
           miscarriage rate in women undergoing IUI.

        3. To evaluate the impact of pre-washing the catheter before insemination on the multiple
           pregnancy rates in women undergoing IUI.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      The study will be a prospective double blind trial among women undergoing IUI at the MUHC
      reproductive centre using a cluster randomized design. The week will be defined as the unit
      for the clusters of randomization. Weeks will be allocated to one of the following groups:

        -  Group 1 = pre-washing group (patients will have the IUI with a pre-washed catheter
           during that week)

        -  Group 2 = control group (no pre-washing before IUI during that week)

      A random block size will be used to minimize the risk of non-blinding. The study is
      double-blind, neither the patients nor the physicians performing IUI will know whether the
      catheter was washed or not, as both the sample and the catheter will be prepared by the
      andrology lab technician. The cluster randomization design is justified since the management
      of the unit will not allow us to perform a randomization at the patient level.

      However a very low Intra-Correlation Coefficient (ICC) between patients is expected.

    After reviewing the interim analysis results the study was terminated as a bigger sample size
    was needed to find a significant difference between the groups.

    <description>Intervention: pre-washing of the IUI catheter
Throughout the research period all of the insemination catheters used for patients recruited in our study, will be prepared as follows:
Connection: The catheter used for insemination, will be connected to the sperm filled syringe as per our standard procedure.
Catheter washing: The sperm washing media will be aspirated and then flushed through the insemination catheter..
Sperm loading: catheters washed or not connected to the syringe will be loaded with the washed sperm sample as our standard procedure.
Labeling:
Patient identification data will be labeled on the syringe and place back in the original package cover to ensure proper blinding and sterility of the catheter.</description>
