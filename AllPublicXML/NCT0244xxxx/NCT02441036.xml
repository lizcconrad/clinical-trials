  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 15 subjects will be enrolled and randomized. Randomized subjects will receive one
      single-side Ulthera® treatment in the pre-auricular region on the face. At each subject's
      scheduled facelift procedure, resected tissue will be obtained for analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, pilot clinical trial to evaluate the molecular changes
      following an Ultherapy® treatment. Subjects will be randomized to one of five treatment
      groups and, based on study group assignment, will receive one single-side Ultherapy®
      treatment at varying timepoints prior to an already planned facelift procedure. Treatment
      will be delivered to the pre-auricular region on one side of the face; the contralateral side
      will serve as control. During an already planned facelift procedure, treated and non-treated
      resected tissue will be obtained for analysis.
