  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stem cell transplantation has emerged as a relatively popular treatment that can help to
      regulate immunity, repair injury, and control inflammation. Several studies have used
      autologous stem cells or adipose-derived stem cells to treat Crohn's disease and its
      associated complications, and have achieved good efficacy. Thus far, the use of umbilical
      cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to treat Crohn's disease has rarely been reported. In
      this study, UC-MSCs were used to treat patients with hormone-controlled Crohn's disease. We
      observed the disease control conditions, corticosteroid dosage changes, and treatment-related
      adverse reactions.
