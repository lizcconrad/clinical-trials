    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the safety and
      potential efficacy of carfilzomib in reducing HLA antibody levels in highly sensitized kidney
      transplant candidates.

      This study is a non-randomized, open label, iterative pilot study. The duration of study will
      include a 16 month enrollment period and 5 to 6 months of follow-up. A total of 32 patients,
      male and female, between the ages 18 to 65 will be enrolled.

    <description>The primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the safety of carfilzomib alone and in combination with plasmapheresis, with or without rituximab, for desensitization in highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates. Safety will be assessed by overall safety of carfilzomib when used in the desensitization setting, incidence of grade 3 and above non-hematologic toxicities, incidence of grade 4 hematologic toxicities and incidence of all grades of peripheral neuropathy.</description>

    <description>The primary objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of carfilzomib alone and in combination with plasmapheresis, with or without rituximab, for desensitization in highly sensitized kidney transplant candidates. Efficacy will be measured by percent reduction in immunodominant DSA (iDSA) [highest titer DSA (MFI)] and/or immunodominant antibody (iAb) from pre-treatment to 48 hours after the last plasmapheresis treatment.</description>
