    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if toenail onychomycosis can be reduced by means of
      exposure to laser energy from the Cutera® GenesisPlus 1064 Nd:YAG laser system.

      This is a retrospective, open-label, single-centre study for the collection of clinical data
      on the efficacy and safety of the Cutera® GenesisPlus 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser for the treatment
      of nail fungus (onychomycosis). Safety and efficacy of treatment with the GenesisPlus laser
      will be evaluated by (1) assessment of subject's great toenail photographs at baseline and
      after two treatments with GenesisPlus Laser utilizing planimetry measurement of infected vs.
      clear nail area in target toenail photographs, (2) by clinical and subjective review of acute
      and follow up adverse events that may have resulted from laser treatment of the target
      toenails.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female subjects, age 18 to 80 years (inclusive).

          2. Subject with a clinical diagnosis of onychomycosis of one or both great toenails at
             baseline.

          3. Subject with a positive potassium hydroxide (KOH) stain and/or fungal culture.

          4. Subject has baseline and post treatment digital photographs of target great toenails.

          5. Subjects provided informed consent for treatment of nails with the Cutera GenesisPlus

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects have received laser treatment of the infected great toenail(s) with a

             treatment.

          2. Subjects have had a history or clinical diagnosis of moccasin type tinea pedis, lichen
             planus, psoriasis or bacterial nail infection.

          3. Subjects had a history or clinical diagnosis of coexisting disorders that may
             potentially demonstrate nail manifestations.

          4. Systemic antifungal medication within six (6) months prior to or following Cutera®
             GenesisPlus laser treatment.

          5. Subjects who have had a history or clinical diagnosis of repetitive nail trauma prior
             to treatment.

          6. Subjects who have participated in any clinical research study within thirty (30) days
             prior to or within 210 days following final Cutera® GenesisPlus laser treatment.
