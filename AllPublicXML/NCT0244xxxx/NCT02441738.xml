  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with a lifetime risk of
      developing AF of 1 in 4 people aged over 40. Besides hemodynamic compromises stroke remains
      the most feared complication of AF with an increase in risk by 5-fold.

      Catheter ablation has evolved as a standardized treatment option in paroxysmal AF. Due to the
      advanced electrical and structural remodeling the single procedural results of catheter
      ablation for persistent and longstanding persistent AF are rather disappointing without a
      proven superiority of any applied strategy compared to others. However, repeated catheter
      ablation can achieve better results. The surgical (epicardial) approach seems to be more
      effective, though still a significant amount of failures exist. Checking the epicardial
      ablation lines and if necessary making additional endocardial lines (which is a hybrid
      ablation) is expected to be most efficacious in avoiding lesion gaps and providing the most
      complete lesion set.

      The study objective of this pilot trial is to compare the safety and efficacy of catheter
      ablation within 6 months versus a hybrid ablation consisting of endoscopic epicardial surgery
      combined with endocardial catheter ablation (performed one-stage) in preventing the
      recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in symptomatic, drug refractory patients with
      persistent or longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation.
