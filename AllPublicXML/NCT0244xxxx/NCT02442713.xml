    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder is associated with several sleep Polysomnograph (PSG) findings: (1)
      impaired sleep continuity; (2) non-REM (NREM) changes; and (3) enhanced rapid eye movement
      (REM) sleep. The first two patterns are common in other psychiatric disorders, while the REM
      pattern is very characteristic in depression, so the phase-advance theory was accepted by
      most of psychiatrists. Many researchers have focused on the biological rhythm to investigate
      the etiological and pathophysiology of depression, and they think depression can be cured if
      its sleep abnormality is ameliorated.

      It is well known that most of antidepressants treat depression through 5-hydroxytryptamine
      (5-HT) neurons. 5-HT also affects the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle and the sleep
      microarchitecture. Many all-night PSG studies have shown tricyclic antidepressants can
      ameliorate the sleep architecture abnormality in depression by producing rapid suppression of
      REM sleep.

      Compared to TCAs, SSRIs are generally less sedating because of its high selectivity for
      serotonin receptors. On the other hand, it is known that, although all of SSRIs mainly
      increase the extracellular serotonin level by inhibiting serotonin transport in the
      presynaptic neuron, each SSRI has its unique pharmacological characteristics. For example, it
      was reported by accumulating researches that the serum melatonin level increased markedly
      after ingestion of fluvoxamine. The mechanism behind this effect is unknown, but one
      possibility is increased melatonin synthesis, caused by effects on serotonin, which is a
      melatonin precursor. Another possibility is that fluvoxamine inhibits the metabolism of
      melatonin in the liver.

      Thus, the property of fluvoxamine to increase serum melatonin level, or even recover the
      circadian rhythm of melatonin in depressed patients, might improve the clinical outcome by
      improving the sleep quality and quantity. By now, the changes of sleep architecture in
      fluvoxamine treatment were assessed by only three clinical trials, and their results were
      contradictive. This discrepancy might be due to the small sample size and different study
      design, such as clinical trial duration. Moreover, two of three researches applied home-based
      PSG assessment, which might have distorted the results of sleep architecture to some extent.
      Thus, the effects of fluvoxamine on sleep architecture need to be clarified by more clinical
      trials with standard PSG assessment.

      This study is aimed to evaluate the effect of fluvoxamine on polysomnographic (PSG) variables
      and clinical improvement in the treatment of depressive patients with insomnia.

      This is an 8-week open-label study. All patients are required to meet Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) [48 criteria for MDD, single
      or recurrent type, with moderate-to-high level of illness severity, as evidenced by a 17-item
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) score &gt;17 [49, 50]. Furthermore, these depressed
      patients should be suffering insomnia, which was determined by the total score of sleep
      disturbance factor in HRSD &gt;3 (items 4, 5, and 6; score range, 0-6).

      Before any procedure of the study, the patient would be explained in detail about the
      potential risk and benefit in this study with a signed informed consent form (ICF). Patients
      can discontinue the study at any time after informed consent. Also, this study should be
      approved by Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of Guang Dong Mental Health Center and
      compliance with the content of the declaration of Helsinki.

      After 7-day wash-out period and 2 nights PSG (the first night as adaptive and the second
      night as baseline), 30 depressive patients were administered by fluvoxamine as 50 mg/day in
      the 1st day. The dosage of fluvoxamine would be titrated during the 8-week treatment, and the
      maximum was lower than 300 mg/day. The primary endpoints were the changes of PSG variables
      from baseline to the 56th Day. The secondary endpoints were the changes of subjective sleep
      quality and clinical performance from baseline to the 56th Day. Their sleep quality was
      evaluated with Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and
      their clinical performance was evaluated with HRSD and Clinical Globe Impression (CGI).
