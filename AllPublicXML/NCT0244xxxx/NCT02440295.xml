  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the use of the SPY Elite System to assess real-time
      tissue perfusion of lower extremity amputation sites and to develop parameters to predict
      healing of amputations at the time of surgery.

      This is a pilot study to see if the Spy Elite System is capable of recording accurate
      measurements on amputation sites to allow some correlation to healing. If this study shows
      promise for the device, the investigators would plan a larger study in which the data would
      be assessed in the operating room at time of acquisition and revision performed if needed
      based on the findings.

      The pilot study is a prospective cohort study of consented subjects who require below knee or
      above knee amputation. The study will start with 18 subjects to assess proof of concept. If a
      correlation is identified, then a new proposal will be submitted with a larger cohort.

      Our hypothesis is that the Spy Elite System can help identify areas of poor tissue perfusion
      at the time of lower extremity amputation, and predict future potential wound healing
      complications.

      Primary outcome variables include wound healing at 30 days, and intra-operative imaging of
      amputation sites using the Spy Elite System. Secondary outcome variables include level of
      amputation, 30-day wound healing complications, readmission rate, need for revision, and
      subject demographics and co-morbidities.

      Subjects who agree to participation will undergo the amputations in the operating suite as
      per routine. The Spy Elite System will be implemented after final wound closure and prior to
      dressing placement. A single injection of 10 mg of Indocyanine Green will be administered,
      followed by 10 ml bolus of normal saline as per manufacturer IFU and recommendations
      (Attachments B, C, D). Recording from the Spy Elite Device will be saved for analysis. Also,
      a digital photograph of the surgical wound will be saved for comparison. No changes in
      operative management based on Spy Elite System will take place in this study.

      At subjects routine 30-day follow up appointment, wounds will be assessed for complications,
      a digital photograph of the incision will be saved, and secondary endpoints will be obtained.

      Possible correlations between perfusion values from the Spy Elite System recording and wound
      healing will be analyzed by the Investigators. The values will not be known until after the
      photos are taken and the investigators compare ischemic areas to normal areas based on the
      collected photographs.

    <description>The SPY Elite Imaging System is an adjunctive tool that can be used to assess tissue perfusion in real-time and provides surgeons with information that may change their operative plan before leaving the operating room. (http://novadaq.com/products/spy-elite) The system is comprised of two components, the first is the Spy Elite Kit, which is a single-use package containing one 25 mg vial of indocyanine green, one 10 ml vial of sterile Water for injection, and one SPY Elite sterile drape. The second component to the system is the SPY Elite Device which contains a near-infrared light source that illuminates the fluorescent agent within the tissues, an HD video camera captures the intensity of fluorescent marker in real-time, and software that allows the user to capture relative and absolute perfusion values within the surgical field.</description>

        Currently there are no proven, reliable, objective tests to predict wound healing for
        amputations. Successful wound healing relies heavily on perfusion of the tissue flaps
        during amputation, which may already be compromised in peripheral vascular patients.
        Amputation failure results in repeat hospitalizations, surgeries and prolonged immobility
        for patients. The financial burden for patients and hospitals are significant, as is the
        psychological and emotional burden for patients facing repeat amputation. Failure rates for
        BKA and AKA amputations are 10% and 7% respectively. In elderly patients, readmission rates
        are as high as 27% with a mortality rate of 9% at 30 days.1 With improved ability to
        identify amputation sites at risk for wound complication and failure, we hope to decrease
        the need for readmission and repeat surgery.
