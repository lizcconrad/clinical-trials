  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells (Treg) derived from the thymus and/or periphery can control
      immune responsiveness to auto- and allo-antigens. However, there have been few efforts to
      harness the therapeutic potential of isolated Tregs to control graft rejection and inducing
      transplantation tolerance in solid organ recipients. In order for Tregs to be used as a
      clinical treatment, the following properties are necessary: ex vivo generation of sufficient
      numbers of cells, migration in vivo to sites of antigenic reactivity, ability to suppress
      rejection in an alloantigen-specific manner, and survival/expansion after infusion. The and
      others have demonstrated 1) the feasibility of expanding Treg ex vivo, 2) the ability of
      these cells to down-regulate allogeneic immune responses in vitro, and 3) the efficacy of
      Treg for prevention of allograft rejection in animal models. In kidney transplant, the
      investigators have developed strategies for the ex vivo expansion of naturally occurring
      human Tregs (nTregs) from leukapheresis products that would allow for the clinical employment
      of this cellular therapy. The investigators are also interested in this approach in patients
      with end stage liver disease (ESLD) undergoing liver transplantation (LT). Our central
      hypothesis is that alloreactive human nTreg with suppressive action can be expanded ex vivo
      from ESLD patients (this proposal) and used to both prevent liver transplant rejection and
      facilitate the minimization and withdrawal of drug-based immunosuppression (future
      proposals). This application will further define and validate efficient methods for ex vivo
      expansion of human CD4+CD25+CD127- FOXP3+nTregs cells in ESLD. The investigators herein
      propose to use leukapheresis products obtained from patients with ESLD to further refine and
      optimize protocols for expansion of Tregs. Suppressive function of expanded cells will be
      assessed using in vitro assays of alloreactivity (mixed lymphocyte culture).

    <description>Catheter placement will occur for about 1 hour. The research nurse will schedule leukapheresis on the next day following catheter placement.
On the day of leukapheresis, a blood draw will monitor blood counts, kidney function, liver function, and blood clotting ability. Vital signs will be checked three times over the course of intervention.
During the procedure, blood is mixed with anticoagulant and separated (i.e. red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma). 1-1.5 cups of white blood cells will be collected. Leukapheresis will last 3-6 hours.
Remaining components, except for 100-200 ml of plasma, are returned through the catheter. Two teaspoons of blood will be drawn to determine when catheter removal can occur. This part of intervention lasts about 2.5-4 hours.</description>
