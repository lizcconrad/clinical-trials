      This is a bio repository of blood specimens from subjects with different Hematological
      disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been a marked increase in our knowledge of Blood Disorders in the last decade. Much
      of this knowledge comes from examining blood specimens from patients and subjecting these
      samples to red cell, plasma, serum or DNA analyses. We propose to set up a Hematology
      biobank, which will include patient histories, their medical progress and a linked but
      de-identified bank of blood samples. This will enable us to have a large database, which can
      be used to learn more about these diseases.

      The Hematology biobank will use whole blood, red blood cells, plasma, serum and/or DNA.

      Whole blood samples will be processed fresh or frozen and stored in cryo vials at -80°C for
      future isolation of DNA. DNA isolation will be done using commercially available kits such as
      Applied Biosystems' &quot;DNA Isolation from Fresh and Frozen Blood, Tissue Culture&quot;
      http://tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/cms_041387.pdf Plasma needed for
      biomarkers analysis we be obtained from whole blood samples. Whole blood will be spun down,
      plasma and sediment will be separated and stored in cryo vials at -80°C. Red cells and
      platelets will be stored at 4C. Red cell hemolysate may be stored at 4C or stored in cryo
      vials.
