  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to see if it is safe to give patients with pancreatic or
      head and neck cancer a low dose of the FDA approved anesthetic drug ketamine at the same time
      they receive radiation and/or chemotherapy for their cancer treatment to prevent depression
      and its effects. Researchers would also like to see if giving ketamine at the same time as
      cancer treatment is practical and reasonably acceptable to the patient.

      New onset depression is highly frequent in those with head and neck cancer, and depression
      has many negative consequences for outcomes in those patients. Depression has been known to
      have greater incidence in pancreatic cancer patients than in patients with other
      malignancies.

      Therefore, investigators would also like to see if giving patients ketamine during their
      routine cancer treatment will prevent the onset of depression and its negative effects on
      cancer treatment outcomes, and also help with anxiety, pain, and quality of life. The study
      will also use a placebo to compare to the good and/or bad effects of ketamine. A placebo is
      not an active drug and it will be look the same as ketamine, as a liquid to be taken by
      mouth.

      Ketamine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a general anesthetic
      by itself for some diagnostic and surgical procedures or combined with other general
      anesthetic agents. It has also been shown to reduce cancer pain. Ketamine is considered
      experimental in this study because it is not approved by the FDA for the prevention of
      depression.

      This is a prospective, single center, double blind, randomized, two-arm feasibility study of
      oral ketamine versus placebo for the prevention of depression in non-depressed patients with
      head and neck or pancreatic cancer undergoing curative intent cancer therapy. Approximately
      40 patients with head and neck cancer or pancreatic cancer about to undergo cancer therapy
      will be randomized 1:1 to receive study treatment with one of the following regimens:

        -  Arm A: weekly oral administration of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine

        -  Arm B: weekly oral administration of placebo

      Consenting patients will undergo screening procedures, and if eligible, a baseline interview
      and brief questionnaires regarding depression, mental and emotional health, and quality of
      life assessments.

      Study treatment will be administered for 12 weeks unless the patient experiences unacceptable
      toxicities, exhibits moderate to severe depressive symptoms, or withdraws consent. Patients
      on the placebo treatment arm will not be eligible to cross over to the ketamine arm at
      evidence of depression but will be removed from the study and treated with standard medical
      management for depression.

      Patients will be asked to complete psychosocial measurements every two weeks, before study
      medication/placebo administration, while on study treatment and monthly during a five-month
      follow-up period.
