  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a dose escalation, and cohort expansion study in subjects with advanced cancer
      for which no standard therapy exists. Subjects must have received prior treatment for cancer
      that has not worked, or has stopped working.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts. Part A is a dose escalation study to determine a
      safe and tolerable dose of ASN002 for subjects with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, or
      advanced solid tumors. Part A will also characterize the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of ASN002 through blood sampling. Subjects in Part B will enroll subjects
      with four types of lymphoma Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL),
      Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Additional groups of
      subjects with Myelofibrosis (MF) and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be treated with the highest safe and tolerable dose determined in Part A of the
      study to determine preliminary efficacy. Subjects may continue to receive ASN002 for up to 1
      year in the absence of severe side effects or disease progression.

             placement within the last 6 months, HIV infection, known Hepatitis B or C infection.
             Subjects at high risk for Hepatitis B or C infection should have serology testing to
             rule out infection, a medical condition requiring the therapeutic use of
