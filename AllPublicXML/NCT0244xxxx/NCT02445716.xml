  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Seventy women, aged 35-75
      years, with treatment-emergent loss of libido will be randomly allocated to the treatment
      with a Transdermal nanoemulsion of Testosterone (500mcg) delivering 300 mcg of
      testosterone/day or an identical placebo nanoemulsion (PLA) for 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of transdermal testosterone nanoemulsion
      (TNT) as a treatment for SSRI/SNRI-emergent loss of libido.

      The primary outcome measures to be evaluated is the change in the Sabbatsberg Sexual
      Self-rating Scale (SSS) total score over 12 weeks. The 4-week frequency of Satisfactory
      Sexual Events (SSEs) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) will be also
      evaluate.

    <description>The SSS is a 21-item, multiple-choice questionnaire containing seven domains (sexual interest, sexual activity, satisfaction with sexual life, experience of sexual pleasure, sexual fantasy, orgasmic capacity, and sexual relevancy). Each item has five levels scored from 0 to 4. Possible composite scores range from 0 (low sexuality) to 84 (high sexuality). It was developed to use in premenopausal and postmenopausal women .
Its validity and reliability have been independently established.</description>

    <description>It consists of a 12-week treatment with 300mcg of transdermal testosterone phase involving three study visits. Participants will attend at the Federal University of Sao Paulo in Brazil for their study visits.
Participants will be submitted to a physical examination including vital signs and breast and pelvic examination. Women who met the eligibility criteria is invited to attend a baseline randomization visit. They will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a transdermal testosterone nanoemulsion (0.8g per dose) delivering 300 mcg/day testosterone or an identical placebo provided by Evidence Pharmaceuticals LTDA, SP, BRAZIL.
Women are asked to return all unused pumps, and treatment compliance was checked by counting weighting returned packs at their final visit.</description>
