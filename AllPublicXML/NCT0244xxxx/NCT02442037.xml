      Phase I-II Clinical Trial - Safety and efficacy of umbilical-cord-derived mesenchymal stem
      cell (UC-MSC) in patients with active ulcerative colitis，randomized, single blind, controlled
      prospective study.

      Thirty patients will be selected and randomized into two groups: the first group of 15
      patients will receive a sole injection of UC-MSC and the remaining 15 patients will comprise
      the control group.

      Every patient will maintain their standard treatment of active ulcerative colitis, with
      maximum tolerated dosage without side effects.

      The day of infusion will be considered day zero. From that moment, followup will be divided
      into 0-1 week, 1 week-2 week,2 week-3 week, 3 week-1 month, and 3 month-6 months.

      Clinical results will be analyzed after completion of 6 months of followup.
