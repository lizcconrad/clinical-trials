      In a prospective cohort single-center observational study, 720-1080 chest pain patients
      ('all-comers' REALITY registry of CTA patients, Ural Institute of Cardiology, Yekaterinburg,
      Russia; www.cardio-burg.ru) with or without acute coronary syndrome will be enrolled who
      admitted to the chest pain outpatient center (The Heart Clinics, Yekaterinburg, Russia;
      www.hclinic.ru) between September 2010 and May 2015 underwent functional testing and computed
      tomography angiography, and/ or 3D quantitative coronary angiography with or without further
      percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequent plaque burden/ % stenosis (adjusted with
      technical limitations of CTA and 3D QCA), major adverse cardiovascular events (death from
      cardiac causes, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization due to unstable
      or progressive angina) will be judged to be related to either originally treated (culprit)
      lesions or untreated (non-culprit) lesions. Moreover, the clinical potential of CTA vs 3D QCA
      in two real-world patient flows of the Chest Pain center will be estimated with the special
      focus on safety (contrast-induced nephropathy, radiocontrast-induced thyroid dysfunction, and
      radiation dose). The diagnostic accuracy of both CTA and 3D QCA will be analyzed in deceased
      patients.

      The follow-up period will achieve 3-5 years when retro- and prospectively collected clinical
      events and imaging outcomes will be determined at the hospital, in 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and
      60 months after the first imaging examination.

      The independent ethics expertise will be provided by the Ural Medical University,
      Yekaterinburg, Russia (www.usma.ru). The monitoring of the clinical data with imaging as well
      as further CoreLab expertise (software of Medis) will be provided by De Haar Research
      Foundation, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The retrospective studies have shown that most atherosclerotic plaques responsible for future
      acute coronary syndromes are angiographically mild, and the lesion-related risk factors for
      major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) are poorly understood. Pathological studies have
      shown that thrombotic coronary occlusion after rupture of a lipid-rich atheroma with only a
      thin fibrous layer of intimal tissue covering the necrotic core (a thin-cap fibroatheroma) is
      the most common cause of myocardial infarction and death from cardiac causes. However, the
      prospective identification of thin-cap fibroatheromas has not been achieved, in part because
      the imaging tools to identify them in vivo did not exist until recently (Stone GW, et al,
      2011; doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1002358). Both CTA and 3D QCA provide us with a potential of the
      non-invasive imaging of atherosclerotic lesions, but accuracy and safety remain the keystone
      limitations of these approaches. CTA has the unique advantage over detecting non-calcifying
      plaques in addition to calcifying lesions, thus allowing for direct visualisation of early
      atherosclerosis stages such as lipid and fibrous atheroma, which are risk factors for future
      coronary events. Long-term studies report of an increased risk of adverse outcome associated
      with vulnerable fibroatheroma, whereas calcifying lesions tend to remain rather stable.
      Studies investigating the accuracy, outcome and, thus, the diagnostic benefit of coronary CTA
      in chest pain patients are scarce (Plank F, et al, 2014; doi:10.1136/openhrt-2014-000096).
      The accuracy of three dimensional (3D) QCA has recently developed to overcome 2D QCA
      limitations, however, accuracy and precision of 3D QCA measurements in the different stage
      lesions has not been established (Kan J, et al, 2014).

      In a prospective cohort single-center observational study REALITY, 720-1080 chest pain
      patients ('all-comers' REALITY registry of CTA patients, Ural Institute of Cardiology,
      Yekaterinburg, Russia; www.cardio-burg.ru) with or without acute coronary syndrome will be
      enrolled who admitted to the chest pain outpatient center (The Heart Clinics, Yekaterinburg,
      Russia; www.hclinic.ru) between September 2010 and May 2015 underwent functional testing and
      computed tomography angiography, and/ or 3D quantitative coronary angiography with or without
      further percutaneous coronary intervention. Subsequent plaque burden/ % stenosis (plaque
      burden for both culprit and non-culprit lesions will be calculated as a lesion volume (vessel
      volume-lumen volume)/lumen volume x 100; the variable will be adjusted for CTA and 3D QCA due
      to technical limitations; the correlation between PB and other variables (including
      composition of the atheroma) will be then assessed), major adverse cardiovascular events
      (death from cardiac causes, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, or rehospitalization due
      to unstable or progressive angina) will be judged to be related to either originally treated
      (culprit) lesions or untreated (non-culprit) lesions. Moreover, the clinical potential of CTA
      vs 3D QCA in two real-world patient flows of the Chest Pain center will be estimated with the
      special focus on safety (contrast-induced nephropathy, radiocontrast-induced thyroid
      dysfunction, and radiation dose). The diagnostic accuracy of both CTA and 3D QCA will be
      analyzed in deceased patients. The follow-up period will achieve 3-5 years when retro- and
      prospectively collected clinical events and imaging outcomes will be determined at the
      hospital, in 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after the first imaging examination. The
      independent ethics expertise will be provided by the Ural Medical University, Yekaterinburg,
      Russia (www.usma.ru). The monitoring of the clinical data with imaging as well as further
      CoreLab expertise (software of Medis Medical Imaging Systems B.V.: QAngio XA, QAngio XA 3D
      RE, QAngio CT RE) will be provided by De Haar Research Foundation, Rotterdam, the
      Netherlands.

      Patients will be provided with the Coronary Passport (REALITY Registry) which includes data
      of the complex examination with a 128-slice CT, two interviews with the risk factor
      modification recommendations, lab screening (serum fasting glucose, asparagine transaminase,
      alanine transaminase, total bilirubin, carbamide/ urea, creatinine, total cholesterol,
      triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol), complete blood count,
      ECG, and Echo. The Registry patients will be tested with HeartAge, SCORE, Duke ACC/ AHA, Duke
      - DCS, Diamond-Forrester - DFM, The Seattle Angina Questionnaire - SAQ, Duke Activity Status
      Index -DASI, and EQ-5D-5L. Patients will be screened for the major risk factors and its
      modification: unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, smoking, insulin
      resistance, diabetes, overweight or obesity, lack of physical activity, unhealthy diet
      (elements of Mediterranean and so called 'Russian' diet), older age, genetic or lifestyle
      factors, family history of early heart disease. Moreover such factors as CRP, sleep apnea,
      stress and alcohol consumption will be assessed.

      Maximum 400 chest pain patients with the clinical manifestation (medical history, mental
      status testing with MMSE and mini-cog, a physical and neurological exam) of degenerative and/
      or paroxysmal encephalopathy will be enrolled to the subanalysis with MSCT-screening of the
      cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease in association with markers of HSV-1 and
      fungi (Candida glabrata, Candida famata, Candida albicans, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Phoma,
      and Syncephalastrum racemosum, others).

      The main aim of our study was to evaluate the natural history of atherosclerosis within the
      concept of the Glagovian artery remodeling with the assessment of the clinical potential and
      safety of such imaging tools as CTA and 3D QCA.
