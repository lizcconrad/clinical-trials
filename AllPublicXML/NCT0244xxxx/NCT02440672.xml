      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single cohort, multicenter study to evaluate the
      clinical outcomes of TKA using the JOURNEY™ II CR Total Knee System in subjects with
      degenerative joint disease (DJD) requiring primary total knee replacement. One hundred and
      seventy (170) subjects will be enrolled at up to 18 clinical sites globally. Follow-up
      clinical assessments will be performed at 3 months, 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years
      post-operatively.
