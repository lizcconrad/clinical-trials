  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate that tolvaptan effectively and safely increases
      and maintains serum sodium concentrations in children and adolescent subjects with euvolemic
      or hypervolemic hyponatremia.

      The purpose of the study is to also assess tolvaptan's pharmacokinetics (PK) and its effect
      on fluid balance in children and adolescent subjects with euvolemic or hypervolemic
      hyponatremia. Subjects who are diagnosed with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia (serum
      sodium &lt; 130 mEq/L [mmol/L]) that persists despite initial standard background therapy (eg,
      including fluid restriction) are eligible to be screened for participation in this trial.
      Subjects who demonstrate prior resistance to vasopressin antagonist therapy will be excluded.
      All potential subjects must be deemed by the investigator as likely to benefit from a therapy
      that raises serum sodium levels.

      Subjects will be required to be in a hospital setting during initiation or titration of
      tolvaptan. Overall, in this trial, subjects will undergo treatment with tolvaptan or placebo
      for 30 (+2) days and a post-last dose follow-up phase of 14 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects ≥ 4 years of age (or per local Health Authority age
             restriction) to &lt; 18 years old and ≥ 10kg

          2. Subjects hospitalized with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia resistant to initial
             standard background therapy (including fluid restriction and excluding a vasopressin
             antagonist) and who are deemed by the investigator as likely to benefit from a therapy
             that raises serum sodium levels

          3. Persistent euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia defined as being documented as
             present for at least 48 hours, evidenced by at least 2 serum sodium assessments &lt; 130
             mmol/L drawn at least 12 hours apart (these values can be documented using historical
             values previously obtained per standard of care); a third (STAT) serum sodium
             assessment &lt; 130 mmol/L, which will serve as the baseline value for efficacy
             endpoints, is to be obtained within 2-4 hours prior to the final trial qualification
             and the first dose of IMP

          4. Ability to swallow tablets

          5. Ability to maintain adequate fluid intake whether orally or via IV support with
             adequate monitoring

          7. Trial-specific written informed consent/assent obtained from a parent/legal guardian
             or legally acceptable representative, as applicable per age of subject or local laws,

             as required by local laws must provide informed assent at Screening and must be able
             to understand that he or she can withdraw from the trial at any time.

             All informed consent/assent procedures must be in accordance with the trial center's
             IRB/IEC and local regulatory requirements

          8. Ability to commit to remain fully abstinent (periodic abstinence [eg, calendar,
             ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods] or withdrawal are not acceptable
             methods of contraception) or practice double-barrier birth control during the trial
             and for 30 days following the last dose of IMP for sexually active females of
             childbearing potential

             has systolic blood pressure or heart rate outside of the normal range for that age
             volume status should be specifically clinically assessed to rule out volume depletion

             monitoring and management

          5. Has a history or current diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome

          6. Has transient hyponatremia likely to resolve (eg, head trauma or post-operative state)

          7. Has hyperkalemia defined as serum potassium above the ULN for the appropriate
             pediatric age range

          8. Has eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated by the following equation:

               -  Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 µmol/L) within 48 hours; or

               -  Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline, which is known or presumed
                  to have occurred within the prior 7 days; or

               -  Urine volume &lt; 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours

             hyperemesis, obtundation, seizures)

         11. Has had treatment for hyponatremia with:

               -  Hypertonic saline (including normal saline challenge) within 8 hours of
                  qualifying serum sodium assessments;

             benzazepine derivatives (such as benazepril)

             thiazide diuretics)

         20. Has hyponatremia (eg, hyponatremia in the setting of adrenal insufficiency, untreated
             hypothyroidism, or hypotonic fluid administration) that is most appropriately
