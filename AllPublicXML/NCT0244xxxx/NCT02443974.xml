    <textblock>
      Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent in the elderly, with the knee being the
      most commonly affected joint in this population. Knee braces are often used to prevent common
      problems in knees during daily activities. The purpose of these devices is to decrease pain
      and improve functionality. In the literature some studies have tested the effectiveness of
      unloader brace for valgus or varus. However, the braces most used in the investigators'
      clinical setting and the less costly ones have not been described in quality studies in the
      literature. There are only few studies on this subject and they are methodologically
      inadequate. There are no studies that compared the effectiveness between the knee brace with
      metal hinges (no alignment) and knee brace without metal hinges. Objective: To evaluate the
      effectiveness of knee braces on pain, function and quality of life in the elderly with knee
      OA. Methods: Elderly with knee OA, both genders, with pain scale 3-7cm on a 10cm pain numeric
      scale were included. Of the 222 patients screened, 120 met the eligibility criteria and were
      randomized to the groups: without metal hinges, with metal hinges or control group. The
      groups without and with metal hinges received knee brace and were instructed to use it in
      daily activities, every day, during three months. Assessment for pain (NPS), function (WOMAC
      and Knee Lequesne) and quality of life (SF-36) were done at baseline and after 45, 90 and 180
      days by a blinded assessor.
