    <textblock>
      ROHHAD (rapid onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic
      dysregulation) syndrome is a rare pediatric disorder associated with a cancer called
      neuroblastoma and presumed to be driven by an attack of the immune system on specific area in
      the brain. Patients develop severe symptoms and often succumb to this disease. Based on the
      researchers' experience the investigators conduct a clinical trial to study intensive
      immunosuppression with high-dose cyclophosphamide in these patients. In addition to
      describing the symptomatic improvement, the investigators' trial seeks to define objective
      markers of disease activity.
