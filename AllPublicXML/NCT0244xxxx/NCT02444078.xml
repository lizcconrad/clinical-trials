  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomised controlled trial composed of two research arms: exercise
      training group (experimental group) and a social activity group (control group).

      The recruitment process will be made only in NHs (Nursing Home) where the staff will have
      voluntarily accepted to participate in the study. We estimated to recruit 140 PWD (person
      with dementia) from around six-to-eight NHs (i.e., in average a minimum of 18 and a maximum
      of 24 PWD per NH). NHs constitute the unit of randomisation; NHs will be randomised to study
      groups using a 1:1 ratio (it means that all the participants living in a particular NH will
      participate in either the exercise training or the social activity). The randomisation will
      be stratified by the prevalence of dementia among NH residents; this stratification will
      provide homogeneity across research's arms, increasing thus the comparability among groups
      and producing then reliable results. Randomisation will be done by a statistician not
      involved in the LEDEN study. Allocation concealment will be ensured by the use opaque sealed
      envelopes. The randomisation list will be kept in a electronic, password-locked file matching
      the name of participants to their research identification number and their group allocation.
      Given the nature of the LEDEN intervention (exercise training, i.e., a behavioural
      intervention) and since the main outcome measure, i.e., participants' ability in executing
      ADLs, of the the study requires that the outcome assessor knows how participants cope in
      their daily life, LEDEN is a unblinded study

    <description>(ADL performance) as assessed by the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) ADL-sev. This is a 19-item scale measuring the ability to perform basic (e.g., bathing, toileting) and instrumental (e.g., turning faucet/lights on/off) ADLs in the last four weeks. The ADCS-ADL-sev was specifically validated for people with moderate or severe Alzheimer's disease (AD), i.e., the large majority of PWD in NHs. Scores in this scale vary from 0 to 54, with higher scores indicating better functional ability.</description>

    <description>Exercise training will take place in the NH, twice weekly, around 60 minutes per session (session duration can be shorter during the first weeks of intervention according with participants' physical capacity), during 6 months; interval between two exercise sessions will be of at least 48 hours. The exercise program will be a multicomponent training, with exercises specifically developed to improve participants' flexibility (10 minutes), coordination and balance (10 minutes), muscle toning (10 minutes), and cardiorespiratory capacity (25 minutes). The exercise intensity targeted will be moderate. All exercise sessions will be accompanied by music.</description>
