  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether imaging techniques, such as magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), laser speckle contrast imaging
      (LSCI), and optical imaging (OI), can detect differences in blood flow and oxygen levels in
      different organ systems of participants with sickle cell disease (SCD). Differences in blood
      flow and oxygen levels detected by these techniques will be evaluated to determine their
      utility as biomarkers of clinical disease pathophysiology.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a diagnosis of SCD confirmed by hemoglobin analysis.

          2. Be in stable clinical condition, as determined by the Investigator.

             Subjects enrolled in Part B must also meet the following eligibility criterion at
             Screening:

          3. Receiving scheduled standard of care RBC exchange transfusion therapy, with ≥3
             transfusions already received.

          4. Be deemed healthy, as determined by the Investigator, based on the physical
             examination, medical history, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and
             clinical laboratory measurements.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to lie still for ≥5 minutes, claustrophobia sufficient to interfere with
             generating reliable MRI scans, body weight exceeding 320.0 lbs., or girth exceeding
             the magnet bore.

          2. Presence of a metal device affected by MRI (e.g., any type of electronic, mechanical
             or magnetic implant, cardiac pacemaker, aneurysm clips, implanted cardiac
             defibrillator) or potential ferromagnetic foreign body (metal slivers, metal shavings,
             other metal objects) which would be a contraindication for MRI.

          3. Acute pain crisis requiring hospitalization, with a discharge ≤4 weeks prior to the
             first imaging visit, or when determined by the Investigator to not be at steady state.

          4. Recent (≤3 months) treatment with hydroxyurea therapy.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
