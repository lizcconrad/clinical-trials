  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). At the time
      of diagnosis it is not possible to predict the course of the disease, which can range from a
      few flares in a lifetime to uncontrollable disease leading to hospitalization, surgery and
      stoma. There is a continuous need to improve treatment as well as diagnostic and prognostic
      tools.

      This study evaluates the clinical efficacy, tolerability and feasibility of remote ischemic
      conditioning (RIC) in patients with moderate active ulcerative colitis (UC). The
      investigators hypothesize that RIC beyond the well known effect on reperfusion tissue damage
      has a clinically relevant anti-inflammatory effect in UC. RIC constitute a repeated brief and
      non-harmful suppression of blood circulation in a limb. The mechanism of action of RIC is
      likely to involve suppressed inflammation and cell death.

      Our study is a randomized clinical controlled study including 38 patients. Patients will
      receive RIC or sham for 10 consecutive days.

      The effect of RIC on active UC is evaluated by changes patient's symptoms, endoscopy
      findings, and various markers in the blood, faeces and the intestinal wall.

    <description>Daily remote ischemic conditioning for 10 days. Remote ischemic conditioning is induced by placing a blood pressure cuff around the right or left arm. The cuff is inflated to 200 mmHg and the pressure is kept for 5 minutes. Hereafter the cuff is deflated for 5 minutes completing one cyclus. This cyclus is repeated 4 times.</description>
