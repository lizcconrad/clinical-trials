      This study is a single-arm, phase II study of selumetinib in combination with docetaxel in
      patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harboring MEK signature, RAS mutation or
      amplification as a second line chemotherapy.

      Selumetinib will be administered orally 75mg twice a day continuously. Docetaxel will be
      administered as an IV infusion over 1 hour at 60 mg/m2 every 3 week of a 21 days schedule.
