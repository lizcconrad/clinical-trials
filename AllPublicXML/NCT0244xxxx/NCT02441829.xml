    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of a single oral
      dose of eleclazine and its metabolite, GS-623134, in participants with normal and impaired
      renal function. Participants in the healthy control group will be matched to participants
      with impaired renal function by age (± 5 years), gender, and body mass index (± 10%).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All Individuals:

          -  Be a nonsmoker or consume &lt; 20 cigarettes per day

          -  Have a calculated body mass index (BMI) from 18 to 36 kg/m^2, inclusive, at study
             screening

          -  Have either a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or one with abnormalities that
             are considered clinically insignificant by the investigator

          -  Screening labs within defined thresholds

        Individuals with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment must also meet the following
        additional inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in this study:

          -  Must have diagnosis of chronic (&gt; 6 months), stable renal impairment with no
             clinically significant changes within 3 months (90 days) prior to study drug
             administration (Day 1)

          -  Individuals with severe renal impairment, creatinine clearance (CLcr) must be 15-29
             mL/min, inclusive (using the Cockcroft-Gault method) based on serum creatinine and
             actual body weight as measured at the screening evaluation. If an individual's score
             changes during the course of the study, the score at screening will be used for
             classification.

          -  Individuals with moderate renal impairment, CLcr must be 30-59 mL/min, inclusive
             (using the Cockcroft-Gault method) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as
             measured at the screening evaluation. If an individual's score changes during the
             course of the study, the score at screening will be used for classification.

          -  Individuals with mild renal impairment , CLcr must be 60-89, inclusive mL/min (using
             the Cockcroft-Gault method) based on serum creatinine and actual body weight as
             measured at the screening evaluation. If an individual's score changes during the
             course of the study, the score at screening will be used for classification.

        Individuals with normal renal function must also meet the following additional inclusion
        criteria to be eligible for participation in this study:

          -  Must, in the opinion of the Investigator, be in good health based upon medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, and screening laboratory evaluations

          -  Must have an CLcr of ≥ 90 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault method) based on serum
             creatinine and actual body weight as measured at the screening evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of meningitis or encephalitis, epilepsy, seizures, migraines, tremors,
             myoclonic jerks, narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, anxiety, syncope, head injuries
             or a family history of seizures

          -  Presence or history of cardiovascular disease (including history of myocardial
             infarction based on ECG and/or clinical history, any history of ventricular
             tachycardia, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or left ventricular ejection
             fraction &lt; 40%), cardiac conduction abnormalities, a family history of Long QT
             Syndrome, or unexplained death in an otherwise healthy individual between the ages of
             1 and 30 years

          -  Syncope, palpitations, or unexplained dizziness

          -  Implanted defibrillator or pacemaker

          -  Medical history of renal carcinoma or hepatorenal syndrome.

          -  Individuals receiving or anticipating use of hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or any
             other renal replacement therapy or other medical procedure that serves as a surrogate
             for renal function during the study.

          -  Individuals with fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating renal function. Assessment of
             the stability of the individual's renal function will be determined by the
             investigator.

          -  Renal allograft recipients

          -  Experienced hypertensive crisis, required the addition of ≥1 antihypertensive drug, or
             required more intensive antihypertensive therapy (eg, addition of a new drug class) in
             the last 3 months
