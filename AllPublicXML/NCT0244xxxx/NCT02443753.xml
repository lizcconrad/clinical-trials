    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EndoBarrier® SANS™ in overweight and
      obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. The barbless second generation device is being developed
      as a means to reduce the incidence of adverse events associated with the barbs of the
      predicate device while maintaining a similar efficacy profile as measured by changes in
      weight and diabetic endpoints (HbA1c, blood glucose, insulin, etc.). This first use in human
      will primarily evaluate preliminary safety, tolerability and efficacy of the new design.
      Because of the new design and its first study in human subjects, only a 3 month implant
      duration will be evaluated in this study.

      The GI Dynamics' EndoBarrier® SANS™ is an endoscopically positioned device that represents an
      alternative to the use of gastric bypass operative techniques as a means of re-routing food
      and altering the gut-hormone axis. The EndoBarrier® SANS™ provides an alternate passage of
      chime through the duodenum and proximal sixty centimeters of jejunum replicating in part the
      bypass of bariatric surgery.

      This study will be conducted at a single clinical site in Malaysia. Approximately 16 subjects
      will be enrolled in two cohorts of 8 subjects. The two cohorts will be implanted one week
      apart with the implantation of the second cohort triggered by the absence of major technical
      or clinical issues (i.e. safety, tolerability) observed in the first cohort in the first
      seven days.
