  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part one of this study will consist of baseline (BL) testing, 28 days of daily
      supplementation with XSurge, and an exercise protocol. The acute exercise protocol consists
      of five visits, of which, the first visit will consist of maximal strength testing. The
      remaining visits will consist of performance testing and muscle evaluation.

      Phase two of this study will consist of six weeks of supervised resistance training along
      with supplementation of XSurge. Following the six weeks of training, subjects will complete a
      second acute exercise protocol. Measures to be evaluated will consist of performance testing
      and muscle evaluation.
