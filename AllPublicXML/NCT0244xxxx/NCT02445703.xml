      The purpose of this study is to compare the immunogenicity and safety of three different
      immunization schedules of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) and/ or combined hepatitis A
      and B vaccine (HABV) in healthy Chinese infants.

      This study is a randomized double-blind, single-center, phase IV clinical trial. The purpose
      of this study is to compare the immunogenicity and safety of three different immunization
      schedules of inactivated hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) and/ or combined hepatitis A and B vaccine
      (HABV) in healthy Chinese infants between 18 and 24 months old. The subjects were randomly
      assigned into 3 groups. Subjects in group 1 each received 2 doses of HAV with a 6-month
      interval (at day 0 and month 6); subjects in group 2 each received 1 dose of HAV at day 0 and
      1 dose of HABV at month 6; subjects in group 3 each received 2 doses of HABV with a 6-month
      interval (at day 0 and month 6).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Post-immunization Seropositivity Rates (SPR) to Hepatitis A</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The post-immunization SPR is the percent of participants with anti-HAV titers ≥ 20 mIU/mL at month 7. Anti-HAV titers were detected in participants' serum samples using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Post-immunization Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) of Hepatitis A Antibody (anti-HAV)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The post-immunization GMC values of anti-HAV were measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in serum samples collected at month 7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Post-immunization GMC of Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (HBsAb)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The post-immunization GMC values of HBsAb were detected using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in serum samples collected at month 7.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Post-immunization SPR to Hepatitis B</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The post-immunization SPR is the percent of participants with HBsAb titer ≥ 10 mIU/mL at month 7. HBsAb titers were detected in participants' serum samples using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>AE information was collected after first injection (day 0) until month 7. Each AE case was reviewed by the investigator to determine whether or not it was an adverse reaction (related to the vaccination). After each injection, a 30-minute safety observation was conducted immediately, and body temperature and solicited adverse events (AEs) within 72 hours were recorded. Unsolicited AEs information was collected from day 0 (after injection) to month 7.</description>
