  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chlorhexidine is used in central line dressing changes and is effective in reducing line
      infections. It is unclear if daily chlorhexidine care at the exit site in peritoneal dialysis
      (PD) patients can reduce the risk of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) colonization or exit site
      infection.

  <detailed_description>

      There is no consensus on what regimen is optimal for topical care of the peritoneal dialysis
      (PD) catheter exit site. Several methods including soap and water, povidone-iodine, hydrogen
      peroxide, chlorhexidine, and topical antimicrobial agents such as gentamicin or mupirocin
      cream have been described for care of the exit site. However, many of these studies were
      small or short-term and lacked longitudinal evaluation of bacterial decolonization efficacy.
      Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is one of most common causes of peritonitis and exit-site
      infection and is associated with a high PD catheter removal rate. Carriers of SA had a higher
      rate of exit-site infection than non-carriers. In previous studies, staphylococcal carriage
      prophylaxis using either mupirocin or gentimicin ointment in the nares or exit site
      significantly reduced the rate of exit-site infection due to SA. However, emerging antibiotic
      resistance is a concern. In addition, MRSA infection in PD patients is more severe than other
      pathogens; therefore, choosing a good antiseptic for SA and/or MRSA decolonization is
      important.

      In recent years, the use of chlorhexidine in bathing or central line dressing changes was
      implemented to prevent bacterial colonization and multidrug resistant bacterial infections
      and was also used in hemodialysis patients. Data regarding chlorhexidine used in the catheter
      care of PD patients are limited and it is unclear if the use of chlorhexidine for exit site
      care contributes to long-term bacterial decolonization and acts as a prophylaxis for exit
      site infections.
