      Comparative study with two arms versus ENOXA® LOVENOX®, randomized, prospective,
      single-center, with rater-blinded whose main objective is to compare the incidence of
      thromboembolic events (symptomatic and asymptomatic) between the two arms of the study, in
      patients undergoing digestive cancer and receiving thromboprophylaxis based SODIUM
      enoxaparin.
