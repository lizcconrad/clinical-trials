    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for the treatment of
      participants with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced (locally
      recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic) breast cancer.
