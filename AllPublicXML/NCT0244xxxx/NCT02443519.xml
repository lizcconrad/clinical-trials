    <description>In this arm, participants will receive 8 weeks of the manualized treatment Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; Day &amp; Thorn). Participants will attend weekly 75-90 minute individual sessions for eight weeks. At each weekly session one of eight broad topics are addressed and discussed (Automatic-Pilot, Dealing with Barriers, Mindfulness of Breath, Staying Present, Allowing/Letting Be, Cognitive Restructuring, Self Care, Application to Headache Pain). Homework is assigned each week, and participants are expected to develop a daily formal mindfulness practice (body scan meditation, seated meditation, breathing meditation, etc). Participants are provided with a course manual, reading materials, and audio recordings to facilitate meditation practice.</description>
