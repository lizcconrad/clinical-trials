        Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) member who received 5 doses of acellular
        pertussis vaccines between ages 1 month and 84 months at KPNC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) member who received 5 doses of acellular
             pertussis vaccines be-tween ages 1 month and 84 months at KPNC.

          -  The 5th dose was given between the ages of 47 and 84 months.

          -  All 5 DTaP doses received were manufactured by GSK, depending on study objective
             (otherwise this criterion will not apply).

          -  Born in 1999 and later.

        Inclusion criteria for cases:

        • All individuals meeting above inclusion criteria who tested PCR-positive for pertussis
        and negative for parapertussis during the study period.

        Inclusion criteria for PCR-negative controls:

        • All individuals meeting above inclusion criteria who tested PCR-negative for both
        pertussis and parapertussis during the study period.

        Inclusion criteria for KPNC-matched controls:

          -  All individuals from the general KPNC population meeting above inclusion criteria who
             match a PCR-positive case on sex, age, race or ethnic group, and medical center.

          -  KPNC members on the day their matched case under-went the PCR test (anchor date).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals whose PCR test date (or anchor date) is less than 2 weeks after receiving
             their 5th DTaP dose.

          -  Individuals who were not KPNC members for greater than 3 months between their 5th DTaP
             dose and PCR test date (or anchor date).

          -  Individuals who received reduced antigen content pertussis vaccine (Tdap) or any
             pertussis-containing vaccine after their 5th DTaP dose but before their PCR test date
             (or anchor date).

        Exclusion criteria for controls:

        • Individuals will be excluded from serving as a control once they test positive for
        pertussis.
