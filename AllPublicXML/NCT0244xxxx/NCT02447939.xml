  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Present clinical study will be conducted in China to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      single and repeat oral doses of dabrafenib alone and dabrafenib and trametinib in
      combination, the safety profile and the clinical activity of dabrafenib in combination with
      trametinib in Chinese melanoma subjects with BRAF V600E/K mutation. Approximately 20
      evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the study, out of which, the first 10 subjects will be
      enrolled into cohort A (Part I and II) and remaining 10 subjects will be enrolled in cohort
      B. Subjects in cohort A (Part I) will receive dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily (BID) and
      subjects in cohort A (Part II) and Cohort B will receive combination of dabrafenib 150 mg BID
      and trametinib 2 mg once daily (QD). Study treatment will continue until disease progression,
      death or unacceptable toxicity. After disease progression, all enrolled subjects will be
      followed up for overall survival. The study will be completed after all subjects have died or
      surviving subjects have had at least 5 years of follow-up, whichever occurs first.
