  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In metastasized of locally advanced breast cancer patients, local problems often occur like
      skin metastases, ulcerations or lymph node metastases. These problems are related to a worse
      quality of life, while overall survival is generally in the order of months to years.
      Treatment of these lesions is challenging, especially after failure of first or second line
      systemic therapy. Local treatments, like radiation, are able to give short-term palliation,
      but the effect is often disappointing in the long run. Therefore, the search for new
      therapeutic strategies like the combination of local and systemic treatments is emerging.

      Recent investigations clearly show that radiation is capable of inducing a systemic
      anti-tumor response. Both in mouse models and in patients, it was reported that irradiating
      one metastasis can slow down the growth of other non-irradiated metastases. This effect is
      called the &quot;abscopal effect&quot; and is immune-mediated. There are also several chemotherapeutics
      that are capable of influencing the immune response like cyclophosphamide. Cyclophosphamide
      is a known inducer of immunogenic cell death, which leads to the activation of dendritic
      cells and thus the presentation of antigens.

      In this pilot study the investigators wish to identify the immunological effects of combined
      treatment with radiation and cyclophosphamide in breast cancer patients. Five patients with
      metastasized breast carcinoma will be treated with the combined treatment and the
      immunological effects will be monitored using repeat blood draws and biopsies. These effects
      will be correlated to the clinical response.
