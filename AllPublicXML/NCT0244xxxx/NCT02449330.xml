  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the clinical trial designed to assess the cardiac diastolic function of long term
      treatment with teneligliptin compared to that without teneligliptin in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus by two arms; one includes patients showing E/e' by echocardiography less
      than 8, the other includes patients showing E/e' by echocardiography more than 8.
