  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will take place at Health Sciences North (HSN) in Sudbury. Patients will be
      identified and screened for inclusion into the study once referred to a general or colorectal
      surgeon for resection of their rectal cancer. This may occur before or after preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy (CRT) but randomization will take place after CRT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main question of this study is whether or not delaying surgery after preoperative CRT
      increases disease-free survival. The standard 6-7 week waiting period will be compared to
      10-11 weeks, which was the time-frame identified in the Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit as
      increasing the likelihood of pCR the most. This trial will also be able to determine if an
      increased waiting interval increases the rate of sphincter-preservation, local recurrence,
      and pCR. While similar to the GRECCAR-6 trial, our primary outcome is disease-free survival
      (a more clinically relevant outcome) and is the first North American clinical trial of this
      nature.

      To maximize the utility of this trial, immunohistochemical staining will be performed on
      pre-CRT tumor samples to prospectively validate the scoring system proposed by Hur et al.
      [28] The question being whether or not expression of these biomarkers can predict which
      patients will experience pCR and disease-free survival.

      The pilot will be constructed as a prospective, open-label clinical trial, with patients
      being randomized to undergo surgery at 6-7 weeks or 10-11 weeks after completion of
      preoperative CRT. The intention is that once preliminary data is available, other centres in
      Ontario will be recruited. This will not only help answer our research question, but also
      create a large, prospective database of rectal cancer patients. The Primary outcome
      (disease-free survival) will be assessed at 3 years.
