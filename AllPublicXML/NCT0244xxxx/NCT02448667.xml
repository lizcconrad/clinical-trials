  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from the metabolic myopathy Glycogen Storage Disease type IIIa (GSDIIIa)
      have a problem releasing sugar stored in cells that is needed for energy production. This
      causes several systemic impairments, but only recently have the exercise-related symptoms in
      the muscles been examined. A previous study showed signs that intravenous infusion of glucose
      relieves some of these symptoms. The purpose of this study is to investigate in a randomized
      and placebo-controlled fashion whether oral ingestion of sugar can alleviate muscular
      symptoms in patients with GSDIIIa.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has recently been documented how patients with GSDIIIa have a moderate to severely reduced
      exercise capacity, and that exercise induces muscle pain and cramps. These symptoms are
      caused by the inability to mobilize skeletal muscle glycogen and are most likely the
      consequence of a severe energy deficiency within muscles. The study changed the phenotype of
      GSDIIIa, to include exercise-induced symptoms, which is a typical presentation in other
      metabolic myopathies. It also documented that exercise capacity was significantly improved
      while exercise-induced muscular symptoms were relieved by an intravenous glucose infusion.
      Based on these findings, this study wishes to investigate if oral ingestion of sucrose has
      the same effects on work capacity on a larger number of patients, in a randomized,
      placebo-controlled, cross-over setup. Ingestion of sucrose has the potential to be an
      effective, cheap and easily accessible dietary treatment of muscular symptoms in GSDIIIa.

    <description>Diet softdrink with artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium. Both sweeteners are approved for use as food additives in the European Union and by the FDA. Aspartame metabolism is well understood and normal doses does not affect plasma concentrations of lipids, amino acids, glucose levels, key regulatory hormones or skeletal muscle metabolism. Acesulfame Potassium is not metabolized in humans and is excreted as the parent compound in urine. Since the two artificial sweeteners does not affect skeletal muscle metabolism or blood glucose levels, and both compounds have a well documented safety profiles, FAXE Kondi Free is considered to be an ideal placebo soft drink in this study.</description>
