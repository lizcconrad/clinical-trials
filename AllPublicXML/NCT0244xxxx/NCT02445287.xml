      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 2D and 3D imaging performance of the CARESTREAM
      Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scanner (&quot;investigational device&quot;) against the
      commercially available 2D and 3D predicate devices. The results of this study will be
      included in a Traditional 510(k) FDA Submission to obtain clearance to market the new
      CARESTREAM Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scanner in the US. The study was designed in
      accordance with the FDA Guidance titled &quot;Guidance for the Submission of 510(k)'s for Solid
      State X-ray Imaging Devices&quot;, issued on August 6, 1999.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 2D and 3D imaging performance of the CARESTREAM
      Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scanner (&quot;investigational device&quot;) against the
      commercially available 2D and 3D predicate devices. The study undertaken will demonstrate the
      safety and effectiveness of the investigational CARESTREAM Cone Beam Computed Tomography
      (CBCT) 2D imaging functionality by comparing against the predicate CARESTREAM DRX-1 GOS
      detector used on adult cadaver specimens to capture the image pairs.

      The study will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational CARESTREAM
      Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) 3D imaging functionality by comparing against the
      reference PHILLIPS Multi Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) scanner used on adult cadaver
      specimens (body part) to capture 3D volumetric exams using the anatomy of both upper and
      lower extremity specimens. The adult cadaver specimens will receive multiple x-ray exposures
      using the predicate devices for both 2D and 3D imaging. Target images from cadaver specimens
      will be reviewed by radiologist readers to rate diagnostic image quality, and the data will
      be included in a comparative evaluation.

      The live human subject portion of the study will be performed on healthy volunteers. Each
      volunteer will sign an Informed Consent after which will receive only one 3D volumetric exam
      using the investigational CARESTREAM Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scanner. Target
      images will be reviewed by radiologist readers to rate diagnostic image quality according to
      a radiologist reader scale applicable to 3D volumetric imaging.

        <description>1-1.9-Non-diagnostic Unacceptable for diagnostic purposes. Little or no clinically usable diagnostic information (e.g., gross underexposure, system failure or extensive motion artifact). Almost all such imaging should be repeated. 2-2.9-Limited Acceptable, with some technical defect (motion artifact, body habitus/poor x-ray penetration, or patient positioning may limit visualization of some body-regions but still adequate for diagnostic purposes). Not as much diagnostic information as is typical for an examination of this type, but likely sufficient. 3-3.9-Diagnostic Image quality that would be expected routinely when imaging cooperative patients. 4-Exemplary Good, most adequate for diagnostic purposes. Image quality that can serve as an example that should be emulated.</description>

The image data is analyzed by comparing the following: 2D images from the predicate device to 2D images of the investigational device, and 3D images from the reference device to 3D images of the investigational device. In addition, the CBCT 3D device has three separate reconstructions that are available, high resolution iterative, Feldkamp, Davis &amp; Kress (FDK), and standard iterative (SND). Therefore the outcome measures required four separate analyses (one for 2D and three for 3D) and are listed accordingly.
All p-values were calculated (and verified) by our statistician and are correct. They were rounded to fit four digits.</description>
