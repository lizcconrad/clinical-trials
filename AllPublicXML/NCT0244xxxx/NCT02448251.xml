  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AC0010MA is a new, irreversible, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation selective
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor. Aim at local advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      patients with EGFR mutation or T790M drug-resistant mutation. The molecular mechanism: by
      irreversible combining the EGFR-RTKs ATP binding site of cell, selectively suppress the
      activities of EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, block the signal transduction pathway of
      EGFR and inhibit the function of ras/raf/MAPK downstream, thus block the tumor cell growth by
      EGFR induction, and promotes apoptosis. AC0010MA Maleate Capsules has three characters: 1.
      Irreversible binding to EGFR; 2. Effectively suppresses the tumor cell with EGFR mutant while
      has no suppression to EGFR wild-type cell; 3. Efficient suppress the tumor cell with EGFR
      T790M drug-resistant mutation.

             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

          4. Has received the prohibited therapy (e.g., concurrent anti-cancer therapy including
             but not limited to: chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal, or immunotherapy) â‰¤14 days
             prior to first planned dose of AC0010MA.

          5. Received prior treatment with AZD9291 (osimertinib) or CO1686 (rociletinib) and

             study entry, for the duration of the study, and for at least 6 months after the last
             intake of study drug.

          8. Has a serious or unstable concomitant systemic disorder incompatible with the clinical
             study (e.g., substance abuse, uncontrolled psychiatric condition, uncontrolled
             intercurrent illness including active infection, arterial thrombosis, or symptomatic
             pulmonary embolism).

          9. Has any other reason(s) for the investigator to consider that the subject should not
             participate in the study.
