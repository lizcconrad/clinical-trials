      Background

        -  Patients presented to hospital with coffee ground vomiting and black stool may not be
           actually having upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB)

        -  Hospital admission can be avoided if serious UGIB can be excluded

        -  To date, the only useful tool to triage patient for hospital admission in UGIB is by
           using clinical score such as Rockall score or Blatchford score

        -  These scores are cumbersome and only exclude the most benign cases, but they are not
           useful in differentiating those who needs intervention

        -  In our pilot study, investigators found that capsule endoscopy can be used to identify
           patients with fresh blood and real coffee ground substance in the stomach and it is
           superior to nasogastric tube

        -  Most of UGI lesions leading to bleeding can be diagnosed by capsule endoscopy

      Objectives The current study is designed

        1. to validate capsule endoscopy is an effective method in identifying patients with UGIB

        2. to study whether the capsule endoscopy can reduce requirement of hospital admission in
           patients with suspected UGIB

        3. to study if capsule endoscopy can help to identify patients with UGIB that may require
           urgent (within 24 hours) endoscopy and intervention

        4. to study the cost-effectiveness of capsule endoscopy being used as a triaging tool in
           the management of UGIB

        5. to compare the effectiveness of capsule endoscopy against Blatchford score in
           identifying patients with UGIB that may require endoscopic intervention.

      Hypothesis PillCam Esophagus is effective in identifying genuine UGIB and hence able to
      reduce hospital admission due to unsubstantiated UGIB cases

      Methodology

        -  Patients presented to the Accident &amp; Emergency Department (A&amp;ED) of the Prince of Wales
           Hospital Hong Kong with symptoms suggestive of UGIB will be recruited into this study

        -  Patients will receive the following tests

             -  Complete blood count

             -  Coagulation profile

             -  Renal and liver function tests

             -  Hourly BP, Pulse up to 6 hours

             -  Glasgow Blatchford score calculated on admission

        -  Randomization

             -  Capsule Group: Capsule Endoscopy (CE) by using PillCam Esophagus (PillCam ESO) OR

             -  Standard group: Hospitalization and Standard of Care

        -  The video in capsule endoscopy will be read by trained personnel who have undergone at
           least one hour lecture about realtime reviewing.

        -  Legally a patient has to be signed off by a clinician within 6 hours. The finding of
           fresh blood or coffee ground will be documented. Upper GI pathology that may lead to
           bleeding will also be recorded.

      Capsule Endoscopy (CE) After confirming patient has been fasted for at least 5 hours, the
      subject ingested the PillCam® ESO 2 (Given Imaging Ltd., Yoqneam, Israel) (PillCam ESO) using
      the Simplified Ingestion Procedure.

      Thirty to sixty minutes prior to capsule ingestion, each subject received a single dose of
      intravenous Maxolon 10mg. Intravenous Maxolon, through its motilin receptor agonist effect,
      has been shown to promote gastric motility and improve visualization of the gastric mucosa at
      endoscopy. Moreover, use of Maxolon was thought to facilitate the capsule entering the
      duodenum.

      Using the REAL time viewer, UGI tract images (esophagus to the second portion of the
      duodenum) were obtained in real time at the patient's bedside. The video images that are
      transmitted by the PillCam ESO 2 are displayed in real time on the tablet computer screen.

      Each subject is also fitted with and wore the standard CE sensor array and data recorder so
      that a full-length CE video recording can be obtained for subsequent capsule workstation
      downloading and complete review.

      Other demographic data and parameters for Blatchford score calculation will be collected. 10
      ml of blood will be taken for routine blood checking. Patients will receive standard care
      according to EGD findings.
