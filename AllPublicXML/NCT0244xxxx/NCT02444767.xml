  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Bimatoprost Ocular Insert is intended to provide sustained delivery of bimatoprost to the
      ocular surface to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma
      or ocular hypertension.

      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic aspects of the Bimatoprost Ocular Insert in
      healthy (non-glaucoma) subjects.

      This study is designed to provide pharmacokinetic (PK) data with respect to the relative
      systemic exposure to bimatoprost and bimatoprost acid after administration of a single 13 mg
      Bimatoprost Ocular Insert for 1 week in medically stable adult subjects with or without
      primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects between the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive.

          2. Subjects who are medically stable with or without POAG or OHT.

          3. Written informed consent to participate in the study.

          4. Body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m², inclusive.

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential — not surgically sterile or at least 2 years
             postmenopausal — must agree to utilize one of the following forms of contraception
             from screening through completion of the study: abstinence, intrauterine device or
             vasectomized partner (6 months minimum).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurologic,
             hematologic, endocrine, oncologic, pulmonary, immunologic, psychiatric, or
             cardiovascular disease or any other condition which, in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of the
             study results.

          2. A history of allergic or adverse responses to bimatoprost or any comparable or similar
             product.

          3. Subjects who are unable to tolerate the Inserts that do not contain drug for the 7
             days trial wear period.

          4. Subjects who require two (2) or more site-assisted replacements of the inserts that do
             not contain drug during the 7 days trial wear period.

          5. Subjects who will require contact lens use during the study period.

          6. Subjects who currently have punctal occlusion in one or both eyes.

          7. Subjects who have made a blood donation of one (1) pint or more within 30 days prior
             to study initiation.

          8. Subjects who have made a plasma donation within 14 days of study initiation.

          9. Participation in a clinical trial within 30 days prior to the first dose of Study
             Drug.

         10. Use of any over-the-counter (OTC) medication, including vitamins, herbal products, and
             dietary supplements, during the study.

         11. Use of any prescription medication during the medication washout (screening) period or
             during the study.

         12. Required use during study of ocular medications or artificial tears.

         13. Ocular, orbital, and/or eyelid surgery of any type within the past 6 months from
             screening date.

         14. Past history of incisional surgery for glaucoma at any time.

         15. Past history of corneal refractive surgery.

         16. Any active ocular disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would interfere with
             the conduct of the study (e.g., severe dry eye, uveitis, inflammation, ocular
             infection, corneal edema). Patients may have mild blepharitis, mild dry eye,
             cataracts, age-related macular degeneration or background diabetic retinopathy if, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, it would not interfere with the conduct of the study.

         17. Smoking or use of tobacco products or products containing nicotine within 6 months
             prior to or during the study.

         18. Female subjects who are lactating.

         19. Positive pregnancy test prior to administration of Study Insert for all women of
             childbearing potential.

         20. Positive urine screen for alcohol, drugs of abuse, or cotinine.

         21. Subjects with POAG or OHT for whom, in the opinion of the investigator, it would be
             unsafe to discontinue ocular hypotensive treatment for the required periods during the
             study.

         22. Significant risk of angle closure due to pupil dilation, defined as a Shaffer
             classification of less than grade 2 based on gonioscopy performed within the last 12
             months.

         23. Subjects who were on ocular hypotensive treatment who are not fully washed out prior
             to receiving active inserts.
