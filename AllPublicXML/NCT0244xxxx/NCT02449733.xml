      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and uptake of a combination

      services for men who have sex with men (MSM) in South Africa.

      The objective of the Sibanye Health Project is to develop and evaluate a combination package
      of biomedical, behavioral and community-level HIV prevention interventions and services for
      men who have sex with men (MSM) in Africa. Experience implementing the prevention
      interventions and preliminary data collected regarding the acceptability of the HIV
      prevention package will be used to develop a proposal to design a larger efficacy trial to
      test the combination HIV prevention package for MSM.

    <description>FTC/TDF is a once daily oral tablet taken with or without food. The tablet includes 200 mg of emtricitabine (FTC) and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).
For men who meet eligibility criteria, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (FTC/TDF) will be made available beginning one month into the study. Men who express interest and meet eligibility criteria at their baseline visit can initiate PrEP at 1 month if they test negative for HIV. For men with extenuating circumstances, whose risk profile changes, of those who become more comfortable with the PrEP intervention through enrollment in the study, PrEP will be available to initiate at the 4 month visit.</description>
