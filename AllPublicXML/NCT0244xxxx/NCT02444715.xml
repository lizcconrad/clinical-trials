  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the most frequent and life-threatening diseases in Europe. About four stroke
      events occur per day in Luxembourg alone, and about 30% of these patients are affected by
      recurrent stroke within the following five years. Thus, new methods of primary and secondary
      prevention are needed to better control lifestyle-related risk factors.

      The development and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle (smoking cessation, healthy nutrition,
      moderate physical exercises etc.) is a major objective concerning the primary and secondary
      prevention of cerebro- and cardiovascular diseases. CAPSYS is a computer-based lifestyle
      coaching system developed by researchers from the Public Research Centre (CRP) Henri Tudor in
      Luxembourg in collaboration with neurologists from the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg
      (CHL), which aims at supporting patients in performing appropriate behavior changes in order
      to minimize their individual risk factors. Patients can access CAPSYS by dialing a local-rate
      telephone number and answer to a set of previously known questions concerning their current
      nutrition, physical activity, blood pressure, smoking etc. In an interactive voice response
      approach, questions are issued by the system in natural language using text-to-speech, and
      the patient can provide the required values using the phone keypad. Based on the gathered
      values for each patient, the system automatically generates personalized verbal feedback at
      runtime and presents it to the patient during the phone dialog. Depending on the individual
      development of the patient's risk factors, the system feedback can contain advice for
      improvement, praise for healthy behavior and motivation to pursue a certain goal.

      The user acceptance and effectiveness of the CAPSYS system is evaluated in a six-month
      randomized controlled study with participants recruited at CHL's neurology department.

    <description>The QoL was measured using the standardised EQ-5D-5L instrument provided by the EuroQol Group.
In this context, the health value was specified by the participants on a subjective scale ranging from 0 (&quot;The worst health you can imagine&quot;) to 100 (&quot;The best health you can imagine&quot;).</description>

    <measure>Usability: SUS Score</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The usability of the intervention was assessed based on the standardised System Usability Scale (SUS).
SUS scores were not collected in the SC group because the SC participants were not using CAPSYS and hence were not able to assess its usability.
The System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a &quot;quick and dirty&quot;, reliable tool for measuring the usability. It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. Originally created by John Brooke in 1986, it allows to evaluate a wide variety of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites and applications.
The total SUS score computed based on the responses provided to each of the 10 items can range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>

        <title>Usability: SUS Score</title>
        <description>The usability of the intervention was assessed based on the standardised System Usability Scale (SUS).
SUS scores were not collected in the SC group because the SC participants were not using CAPSYS and hence were not able to assess its usability.
The System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a “quick and dirty”, reliable tool for measuring the usability. It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from Strongly agree to Strongly disagree. Originally created by John Brooke in 1986, it allows to evaluate a wide variety of products and services, including hardware, software, mobile devices, websites and applications.
The total SUS score computed based on the responses provided to each of the 10 items can range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average.</description>
        <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
        <population>SUS questionnaires are missing, incomplete or invalid for 6 of the 32 IC participants who provided final questionnaires.</population>
