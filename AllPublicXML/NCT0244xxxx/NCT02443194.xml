  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary tumor glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain. Standard treatment includes
      biopsy or excision of the tumor in order to obtain a pathological diagnosis, and tumor mass
      reduction. After the surgery patients are treated with radiation and Temodal. The most common
      psychiatric symptom in this patient population is depression, valued at up to approximately
      50% in patients with glioma . Depression not only adversely affects the quality of life of
      patients but also impairs the ability and cognitive function due to the complex clinical
      course of patients with glioblastoma. There is a tendency to give Diagnosis of depression in
      this patient population, due to a lack of awareness, knowledge and literature on the subject.
      This study was designed to prospectively randomized, controlled, double-blind study.

      This method of recruitment - patients who undergo resection or biopsy of glioblastoma (newly
      diagnosed glioblastoma), immediately after diagnosis, patients will receive an explanation
      about the study and sign a consent form will enter research.
