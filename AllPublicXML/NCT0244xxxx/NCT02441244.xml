  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed the clinical care and lived experience of
      HIV infection. However, increased rates of adverse health conditions that are related to
      immune activation, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurodegenerative disease in
      ART-treated individuals persist. An important cause of this inflammation is the gut CD4 T
      cell loss and the &quot;leaking&quot; or translocation of luminal gut bacteria and other microbes
      across the bowel wall and into the bloodstream.

      The use of complementary and alternative therapies is common among people living with HIV,
      however their efficacy has generally not been well demonstrated. Probiotics are live microbes
      that may provide a health benefit to the host and the investigators believe that the
      simultaneous use of probiotics along with antiretroviral therapy (ART) will improve gut CD4 T
      cell restoration and function and therefore reduce microbial translocation and immune
      activation.

      Probiotic Visbiome consists of a high potency blend of eight different probiotics. The
      precise mechanism of action of Visbiome is unknown, but preclinical studies have shown that
      Visbiome may modulate the immune response towards a phenotype that is associated with reduce
      inflammation, and Visbiome was also protective in a non-human primate model of SIV infection.
      Therefore, we believe that the &quot;beneficial&quot; bacteria from Visbiome will accelerate the
      normalization of gut immune cells and function in HIV-infected individuals as they start ART.
      Early resolution of gut immune cells may normalize microbial translocation and immune
      activation and will reduce the rates of HIV-associated comorbidities.
