    <textblock>
      This observational study is proposed to evaluate if the trend in the levels of cf-DNA
      evaluated on a sample of peripheral blood may be related to different clinical behaviors of
      the disease monitored by radiological investigations conducted.

      Demetri and colleagues presented, at the AACR and ASCO Annual Meeting 2013, an exploratory
      analysis to assess GIST genotypes on patients in the GRID study. Mutations in the KIT gene
      were detected in 58 percent of the blood samples compared with 66 percent of the tumor tissue
      samples (31). However, when focusing their analysis on secondary KIT mutations, which are the
      mutations that drive resistance to targeted therapies like imatinib and sunitinib, the
      researchers found mutations in 47 percent of blood samples compared with only 12 percent of
      tissue samples. In addition, nearly half of blood samples in which secondary KIT mutations
      were found, harbored multiple secondary mutations. Therefore, cf-DNA may become an efficient
      marker of mutational GIST status and disease itself.

      On this basis, this trial aims to evaluate whether tumor DNA carrying mutations (for KIT,
      PDGFRα, BRAF, RAS, SDH) can be detected and quantified in the plasma of patients with GISTs,
      either with active disease or during follow-up, and whether detection can be correlated with
      the disease status.
