    <textblock>
      Diabetic macular edema refers to swelling (fluid accumulation) in the center of the retina.
      The retina is like the film of a camera and is located in the back of the eye. This condition
      can develop in diabetics where swelling results from leaking of fluid from the blood vessels
      of the eye, into the center of the retina, the macula. If left untreated, this can affect
      central vision. The current standard treatment for diabetic macular edema includes
      medications injected directly into the eye (intravitreal injections) and laser eye treatment.
      The drugs that are injected directly into the eye are known as anti-Vascular Endothelial
      Growth Factor (anti-VEGF) agents which help to reduce the leaking. However, response in
      patients to these anti-VEGF drugs can vary and examination of predictive factors is required.
      This particular study examines cellular factors called cytokines in patients receiving
      aflibercept, a type of anti-VEGF drug, in the hopes of detecting changes in cytokines that
      can predict treatment response amongst groups of patients.
