      This randomized phase III trial studies olaparib or cediranib maleate and olaparib to see how
      well they work compared with standard platinum-based chemotherapy in treating patients with
      platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back.
      Olaparib and cediranib maleate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Cediranib maleate may stop the growth of ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for
      tumor growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether olaparib or cediranib maleate
      and olaparib is more effective than standard platinum-based chemotherapy in treating patients
      with platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy of either single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib
      (cediranib maleate) and olaparib, as measured by progression free survival (PFS), as compared
      to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive
      ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the efficacy of single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib and olaparib,
      as measured by response rate and overall survival as compared to standard platinum-based
      chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or
      fallopian tube cancer.

      II. Assess the efficacy of single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib and
      olaparib, as measured by PFS, in women with or without deleterious germline breast cancer
      (BRCA) mutations (gBRCAmt) in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      III. Assess the effect on disease-related symptoms (DRS) as measured by the 9-item DRS-P
      subscale of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network-Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      (NCCN-FACT) Ovarian Symptom Index-18 (NFOSI-18), of single agent olaparib or cediranib and
      olaparib, compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy, in the setting of recurrent
      platinum sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      IV. Assess the efficacy of single agent olaparib or the combination of cediranib and
      olaparib, as measured by PFS, in women with or without homologous repair deficiencies as
      measured by BROCA in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal,
      or fallopian tube cancer.

      V. To assess changes in the number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) following three
      days of treatment with olaparib, combination olaparib/cediranib, or standard platinum-based
      chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or
      fallopian tube cancer.

      VI. To assess whether change in the number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) following
      three days of treatment with olaparib, combination olaparib/cediranib, or standard
      platinum-based chemotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer is prognostic for PFS.

      VII. To develop a profile from a panel of angiogenic biomarkers in women with recurrent
      platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer which is associated
      with PFS, and then validate the predictive value of this biomarker profile.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the time from randomization to the first non-study, anti-cancer therapy, surgery
      or death (TFST) for single-agent olaparib or combination cediranib and olaparib relative to
      standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian,
      primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      II. To assess the time from randomization to the second non-study, anti-cancer therapy,
      surgery or death (TSST) for single-agent olaparib or combination cediranib and olaparib
      relative to standard platinum-based chemotherapy in the setting of recurrent
      platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      III. Assess the effect on secondary measures of quality of life, as assessed by the treatment
      side effects (TSE) and function / well-being (F/WB) subscales of the NFOSI-18, sensory
      neuropathy as measured by the FACT/GOG-Ntx-4, and health utility as measured by the Euro
      Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D), of single agent olaparib or cediranib and olaparib,
      compared to standard platinum-based chemotherapy, in the setting of recurrent platinum
      sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients may be treated with one of the three regimens per investigator discretion.

      REGIMEN I: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN II: Patients receive carboplatin IV on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 for at least 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      REGIMEN III: Patients receive carboplatin IV and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      hydrochloride IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM III: Patients receive olaparib PO BID and cediranib maleate PO once daily (QD). Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

             screening imaging to rule out brain metastases is not required for screening, but
             should be performed prior to study enrollment if clinically indicated; patients with
             treated brain metastases and resolution of any associated symptoms must demonstrate
             stable post-therapeutic imaging for at least 6 months following therapy prior to
             starting study drug
