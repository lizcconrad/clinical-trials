    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ingenol mebutate gel,
      0.015% used in topical therapy of actinic keratosis on the chest. Subjects that present with
      4 or more actinic keratosis in one continuous 100cm2 area of the chest and meet all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into this study.

      Treatment with the investigational product (IP) will be applied for three continuous days.
      The investigator will guide application of the IP in-office at Day 0 and the subject will be
      instructed to self-administer the IP at Days 1 and 2. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at
      Days 1, 3, 10, 17, 24 and 59.

      Prior to treatment and at each visit, the investigator will assess the subject's treatment
      area for lesion counts and at follow up visits 4, 5, 6 and 7 evaluation of clearance.
      Pre-treatment photography will also be collected at baseline and at each follow up visit.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be complete clearance of all clinically visible AKs and no development of any new AKs on day 59. Lesion clearance will be determined on day 59 (visit 7) by comparing pretreatment lesion count with current lesion count on day 59, with primary efficacy endpoint being clearance of all lesions in treatment field and no growth of new lesions.</description>

          2. Subjects willing to comply with study requirements.

          3. The presence of four or more clinically typical actinic keratosis within one
             contiguous area of the chest that is 100cm2.

          4. For female subjects of childbearing potential willing to use an acceptable form of
             birth control during the entire course of the study. All systemic birth control
             measures must be in consistent use at least 30 days prior to entry into the study.

             A female is considered NOT to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenopausal

             bilateral tubal ligation.

             Acceptable methods of birth control are: oral contraceptives, contraceptive
             patches/rings/implants Norplant, Depo-Provera, double-barrier methods (e.g. condoms
             and spermicide) and abstinence.

          5. Subjects willing to refrain from the use of topical products containing alpha-hydroxy
             acids, retinoic acid, retinol, salicylic acid, and vitamins C/D (or their derivatives)
