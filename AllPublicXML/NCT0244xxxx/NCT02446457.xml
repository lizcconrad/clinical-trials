  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of pembrolizumab and
      rituximab can help to control relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL). The safety of this drug
      combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of melanoma. Rituximab is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and certain types of leukemia. The combination of these
      drugs to treat FL is investigational. The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are
      designed to work.

      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible for this study, on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, you will
      receive rituximab by vein. The first infusion takes 6-8 hours. After that, infusions take
      about 4 hours each. You will receive pembrolizumab on Day 2 of cycle 1 and repeated every 3
      weeks for up to 16 infusions.

      Each cycle is 21 days.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, your vital signs will be recorded.

      On Day 22 of Cycle 1, you will have a physical exam.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 3-16:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Every 2 cycles, part of
           this sample will also be used to check your thyroid function. Every 4 cycles, part of
           this sample will also be used to check the status of your immune system.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 5, 9, and 13:

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease (Cycle 5 only).

      On Day 1 of Cycle 9, you will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      At any time, if your doctor think it is needed, you may have a bone marrow biopsy and
      aspirate and/or a CT or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may take rituximab for 1 cycle and pembrolizumab for up to 16 cycles. You will no longer
      be able to receive the drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or
      if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed follow-up.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After you stop receiving the study drug(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a PET/CT scan to check the status of
           the disease.

      Long Term Follow-Up:

      30 days after your End-of-Treatment visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your thyroid
           function, and to check the status of your immune system.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Every 3 months for 1 year and every 6 months after that until you start a new therapy, the
      disease gets worse, or the study ends:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your thyroid
           function, and to check the status of your immune system.

        -  You will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.
