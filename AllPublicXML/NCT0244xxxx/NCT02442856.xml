      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the use of diffuse correlation
      spectroscopy to non-invasively measure dynamic cerebral autoregulation in subjects with
      vascular risk factors. Optical cerebral blood flow measurements will be correlated with
      changes in arterial blood pressure to assess how CBF is maintained in response to changes in
      ABP, and will be compared to transcranial doppler reference measurements.

    <description>We will measure dCA with both TCD and DCS during acute changes in mean arterial pressure using thigh cuff deflation techniques in vascular risk factor subjects. Measurements will be compared between TCD and DCS in order to validate DCS as a tool to measure dCA in this population.</description>
