  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of a modified depolarizing cardioplegia solution in adult cardiac surgery would allow
      for prolonged re-dosing intervals while providing equivalent myocardial protection. The use
      of del Nido solution has been used extensively in congenital heart surgery for over 25 years.
      The primary objective is to determine whether expanding this technique to adult cardiac
      surgery will confer significant benefits in both surgical workflow and patient clinical
      outcome. The investigators hypotheses with regard to the del Nido solution will demonstrate
      (1) a non-inferior delivery to the current blood-based cardioplegia strategy in functional
      recovery or clinical outcome, and (2) superior delivery to the current blood-based
      cardioplegia strategy in cost analyses.

      This prospective randomized controlled trial is designed for adult patients between the ages
      of 19-79 presenting for isolated CABG or single valve surgery, with or without CABG,
      requiring the use of Cardio-Pulmonary Bypass (CPB). Patients with previous cardiac surgery or
      requiring mechanical and pharmacologic support will be excluded from the study.

      Subjects randomized to the intervention group will receive del Nido cardioplegia solution
      during the aortic cross clamp period. The control group will receive whole-blood cardioplegia
      according to the Inova Fairfax Adult Cardioplegia protocol. Primary outcomes include clinical
      indicators for myocardial preservation such as serum troponin levels and the return of
      spontaneous rhythm. Surrogate primary endpoints for myocardial protection include the
      requirement for inotropic support and the need for defibrillation after coronary reperfusion.
      Secondary endpoints include post-operative clinical outcomes, duration of the aortic cross
      clamp period, and total expenses incurred during the patient length of stay.

      The investigators will conduct non-inferiority analyses to examine the effect of cardioplegia
      treatment arm on clinical outcomes and complications. Analyses of binary outcomes will use a
      5% non-inferiority margin and analyses of continuous outcomes will use a 10% non-inferiority
      margin.
