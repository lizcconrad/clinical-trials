  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Firstly, the investigators aim to show that breast tumour blood flow, measured as part of a
      standard MRI examination, decreases at the earliest stage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      those patients who go on to respond to treatment. Importantly, the investigators will also
      show that blood flow does not decrease in those patients who fail to respond.

      Secondly, the investigators will test whether the decrease in tumour blood flow over the
      whole course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can predict the response of the tumour measured at
      the time of surgery.

      i) Background. In a recent pilot study of 18 patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      (NAC), the investigators demonstrated for the first time that it was feasible to measure
      breast tumour blood flow (TBF) as part of a standard clinical MRI exam. TBF decreased
      dramatically in clinical responders and when compared with similar results obtained by others
      using [15-O] H2O positron emission tomography, the data led the investigators to hypothesise
      that TBF will decrease after only 1 cycle of NAC in responders. The data also suggested that
      changes in TBF over the course of NAC might predict pathological response.

      ii) Aims. The primary aim is to assess response to first line NAC non-invasively after only 1
      cycle of treatment. A secondary aim is to predict pathological response based upon changes
      measured over the course of NAC.

      iii) Techniques and Methodology. The investigators will measure TBF using a novel MRI
      approach in 40 patients studied before, following 1 cycle, at the mid-point and the end of a
      fixed course of NAC. The MRI data will be compared with histological and molecular markers,
      obtained from biopsies at baseline and after 1 cycle of NAC and from specimens obtained
      during surgery at the end of NAC, to assess mechanisms of response to chemotherapy. In a
      sub-study of 10 patients imaged twice at baseline the investigators will assess the
      reproducibility of the TBF measures.

      iv) Impact on breast cancer research. These techniques will provide absolute measures of
      tumour function during therapy which will particularly benefit non-responders to first line
      NAC allowing clear and objective decisions to be made about possible early changes in their
      treatment.

        Female patients aged over 18 years with invasive carcinoma of the breast who, following
        discussion at the breast multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting, are to be treated in Leeds
        using NAC with curative intent will be approached to take part in this study (this includes
        HER2+ patients receiving trastuzumab); the sample will thus reflect the general population
        of patients receiving NAC.
