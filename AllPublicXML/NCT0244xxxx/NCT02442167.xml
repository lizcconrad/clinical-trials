  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has improved the diagnostic performance of cytology
      for evaluation of malignant biliary strictures in the US and Europe. The utility of FISH for
      diagnosis of biliary strictures in Asia is currently unknown. The investigators conducted a
      prospective study in 2 university hospitals to determine diagnostic performance of FISH for
      the diagnosis of malignant biliary strictures in Thai patients.

      Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has improved the diagnostic performance of cytology
      for evaluation of malignant biliary strictures in the US and Europe. The utility of FISH for
      diagnosis of biliary strictures in Asia is currently unknown. The investigators aimed to
      compare the sensitivity of FISH and conventional cytology for the diagnosis of malignant
      biliary strictures in Thai patients. A prospective study was performed in 2 university
      hospitals between 2010 and 2013. Patients being evaluated for malignant-appearing biliary
      strictures were included. Bile duct brushings were collected and assessed by cytology and
      FISH. Sensitivities with 95% confidence intervals of cytology and FISH were main outcome
      measurements.
