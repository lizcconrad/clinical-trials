    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare efficacy and safety of palliative chemotherapy EOX and
      mDCF regimens in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced HER2-negative gastric and
      gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purposes: to determine the overall survival (OS) of patients who have locally
      advanced inoperable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric and gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma
      treated with first-line EOX (epirubicin + oxaliplatin + capecitabine) or mDCF (docetaxel +
      cisplatin + leucovorin + 5fluorouracil) palliative chemotherapy regimens

      The secondary purposes: to determine safety (as assessed by adverse events according to the
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0) and the progression-free
      survival (PFS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HER2- positive tumors defined as either IHC 3+ or IHC 2+, the latter in combination
             with FISH+

          -  previous chemotherapy for metastatic or locally advanced disease

          -  surgery &lt;3 weeks before the onset of the study treatment

          -  congestive heart failure

          -  significant dysphagia that would preclude oral administration of capecitabine

          -  concurrent malignant disease, except for adequately treated tumors with high
             likelihood of being cured (e.g. basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical cancer)

          -  clinical evidence of brain metastases
