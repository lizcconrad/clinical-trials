    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the addition of a local anaesthetic infusion into the abdomen to
      patient controlled analgesia in the management of postoperative pain and recovery after bowel
      surgery. Half of the patients will have an infusion of a local anaesthetic called ropivacaine
      and half will have an infusion of placebo in addition to their normal pain relief.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomised controlled blinded trial is to determine the effectiveness in
      every day practice of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic (IPLA) infusion on postoperative
      recovery following bowel resection in an optimised Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
      setting.

      The investigators hypothesise that, in an optimised ERAS setting, intraperitoneal
      instillation and infusion of the local anaesthetic ropivacaine to the site of maximal
      visceral dissection for 48 hrs will result in an improved functional postoperative recovery
      following both open and laparoscopic bowel surgery.

      This research will provide evidence to allow recommendation on the routine inclusion of IPLA
      into the multimodal analgesia component of ERAS programs for bowel surgery.

    <description>The postoperative domains of recovery of fatigue, and the post-discharge return to normal functioning in both cognition (concentration) and activities of daily living will be assessed using the Surgical Recovery Scale, previously validated for use following bowel surgery.</description>

    <description>Postoperative pain at rest and with movement (defined as coughing) will be evaluated using a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale with the end-points labelled &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;the worst possible pain&quot; for each of: I. somatic pain (incisional pain in the abdominal wall that the patient can touch) II. visceral pain (deep, dull, inside the abdomen) III. shoulder tip pain</description>

    <time_frame>Postoperative day 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Total opioid analgesia use during the postoperative day 1, 2, and 3 prior to discharge will be recorded and quantified using the Mean Equivalent Daily Dose (MEDD) method. Initially this will be parenteral fentanyl consumption, recorded daily in the patient controlled analgesia (PCA) device until removal of PCA. Then this will be prn tramadol, or other opioid as charted, until discharge.
Time to first PCA button press, and the number of PCA button presses will also be recorded as sometimes patients would like more analgesia than the PCA is able to administer.</description>

    <time_frame>Inpatient postoperative period (variable), and expected duration of 3-7 days.</time_frame>

    <description>The time to readiness for discharge (TRD) is a validated measurement of short-term recovery after colorectal surgery. TRD and actual length of stay (LOS) will be recorded.
Discharge criteria will be defined as
Passage of flatus or bowel motion, tolerance of oral diet and absence of nausea and vomiting.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study population will include adults from the Central Adelaide Local Health
             network catchment area, South Australia.

          -  Patients known to the Colorectal Surgical Unit who have provided informed consent to
             undergo elective large bowel resection for any indication or undergoing reversal of
             Hartmann's Procedure will be invited to participate in this study.

          -  Potential participants will then be provided with an Information Sheet and encouraged
             to take the time to read it, discuss it with anyone they like, and ask any questions
             they have prior to deciding if they wish to participate. They will be reassured that
             participation is voluntary and there is no disadvantage to them if they decide not to
             participate.

          -  After obtaining informed consent, eligibility for inclusion will be determined based
             on health questions and blood results.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Under 18 years of age or over age 90.

          -  Allergy to local anaesthetic.

          -  Underlying medical conditions requiring deviation from the proposed anaesthetic
             protocol i.e., use of spinal or epidural anaesthesia rather than general anaesthesia.

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) &gt;=4 due to the higher likelihood or
             morbidity and mortality, which may confound resulting data.

          -  Severe underlying cardiovascular disease including conduction abnormalities, ischaemic
             heart disease or congestive heart failure, or use of amiodarone as a regular
             medication due to a higher risk or cardiac arrest under general anaesthetic or during
             use of local anaesthesia.

          -  Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) Stage 3 (GFR &gt; 60 based on two samples a minimum 90d
             apart).

          -  The pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine is not affected by renal failure although the
             renal clearance of its main metabolite (S)-2',6'-pipecoloxylidide (PPX) correlates
             with creatinine clearance, non-renal clearance compensates for reduced renal clearance
             in most patients.

          -  GFR will be calculated using the Cockcroft Gault equation for creatinine clearance
             (CrCl) : CrCl ml/min = [140-age(years)] x bodyweight (kg) / R x serum creatinine
             (micromol/L)

          -  R = 0.815 for males, 0.85 for females

          -  Hepatic dysfunction of Child-Pugh class B or C. Patients with end-stage liver disease
             have about a 60% lower mean ropivacaine clearance than healthy subjects and are thus
             expected to have over two-fold higher steady-state ropivacaine plasma concentrations
             during a continuous ropivacaine infusion.

          -  Concurrent or recent (within 3 months) use of fluvoxamine, enoxacin, ketoconazole, or
             cimetidine. These are potent CYP (cytochrome P450) 1A2, 2E1, or 3A4 inhibitors that
             have been shown to reduce ropivacaine clearance in vivo or in in vitro models.
             Potential participants concurrently using other potent CYP1A2, 2E1, or 3A4 inhibitors,
             where it is unclear if there is an effect on ropivacaine clearance, will be included
             or excluded from the study at the discretion of their study specialist anaesthetist.

          -  Abdominal-perineal resections (APR) due to the greater area of dissection and skin
             incision which will increase the level of baseline somatic pain felt by a patient.

          -  Requirement for postoperative drain in-situ, as this will drain the experimental
             solution out of the abdomen.

          -  Preoperative systemic steroid dependence due to derangement of the inflammatory
             response.

          -  Preoperative chronic pain illness including fibromyalgia, chronic regional pain
             syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, non specific chronic pain requiring daily opiate
             use, and history of alcohol or drug dependence due to the impact these have on
             subjective interpretation of pain and tolerance to opioid requiring significantly
             higher dosing regimens.

          -  Inability to consent or complete data scores in the study questionnaires due to
             cognitive impairment and/or language barrier.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding.
