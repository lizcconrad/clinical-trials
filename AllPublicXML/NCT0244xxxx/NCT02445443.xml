  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current investigation is to assess the safety and efficacy of a new hinged
      revision knee device. This device is designed to provide efficient, reproducible
      reconstructions with optimal limb and implant alignment, durable implant fixation, and
      functional outcomes that increasingly approach those of primary Total Knee Arthroplasty
      (TKA).

      The objective of this study is to demonstrate statistically significant improvements in the
      original Knee Society Clinical Score (KSCS) from baseline to 1 and 2 years in subjects using
      the LEGION™ Hinge Knee System. The focus of the 1 and 2 year analyses will be on safety and
      efficacy. The 5 year analysis will focus on survivorship and safety.

    <description>The original Knee Society Score© (KSS) is subdivided into two parts. One part is the Knee Society Clinical Score (KSCS) and the other part is the Knee Society Functional Score (KSFS). The KSCS will be administered at the pre-operative visit and all follow-up visits. The purpose of administering this assessment is to determine the statistical clinical improvement over time which may be compared to literature at 1 and 2 years.</description>
