  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single
      intravenous (IV) infusion of 14C-labeled vemurafenib administered shortly after an oral dose
      of vemurafenib and following multiple oral doses of vemurafenib twice daily (BID) at steady
      state as well as to estimate the absolute bioavailability of multiple oral doses of
      vemurafenib BID at steady state in participants with BRAF^V600 mutation-positive
      malignancies. The study has two periods: Period A and Period B. During Period A, participants
      will receive vemurafenib BID orally from Day 1 to Day 20 and during Period B, participants
      will receive single IV infusion of 14C-labeled vemurafenib along with vemurafenib BID oral
      dose.
