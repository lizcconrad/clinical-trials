  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      alcohol abuse. Triage criteria will be reviewed. Patients characteristics and patient flow in
      the ED will be described.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective analysis of triage notes and electronic medical records will be performed in
      order to identify how triage evaluation is performed accordingly to the Swiss Emergency
      Triage Scale criteria. The proportion of patients leaving without being seen will be
      computed. Caracteristics of these patients will be compared to patients with medical
      evaluation.
