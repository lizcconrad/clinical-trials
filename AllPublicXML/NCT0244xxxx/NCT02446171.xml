  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-treatment, crossover,
      single-center, single-dose bioavailability study with alternate methods of administration of
      crushed naloxegol tablets, 25 mg and of a naloxegol solution formulation, 25 mg, compared to
      whole naloxegol tablets, 25 mg, in healthy subjects.

      The main objective of this study is to determine the bioavailability of each of three
      alternative methods of naloxegol administration compared to whole naloxegol tablets given
      orally by assessment of the primary pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of naloxegol

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, 4-period, 4-treatment, crossover, single-center,
      single-dose bioavailability study with alternate methods of administration of naloxegol:
      crushed and suspended in water and administered orally (Treatment A),crushed and suspended in
      water administered via nasogastric tube (Treatment B), solution administered orally
      (Treatment C) and tablet swallowed as a whole (Treatment D).

      Alternative ways of administering a tablet may be useful to help patients who, for different
      reasons, have difficulties with swallowing a whole tablet. Administration of dispersed
      (crushed) tablets suspended in water is a common way of administering drugs to these
      patients. A useful method in patients whose condition prevents swallowing is administration
      of dispersed tablets through nasogastric tubes. Additionally a solution formulation may be an
      attractive option for some patients including the pediatric population. The main aim in this
      clinical study is to investigate whether the blood concentrations of naloxegol
      (pharmacokinetic) after each treatment A, B and C is comparable to that after treatment D.
      Additionally, the safety and tolerability shall be assessed.

    <description>The C-SSRS is a unique, simple and short method of assessing both behavior and ideation that tracks all suicidal events, and provided a summary of suicidality. It assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability, reasons for ideation and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide. The C-SSRS was performed to determine the presence of suicidality.</description>

    <description>A 12-lead ECG was obtained after the participant rested in supine position for at least 10 minutes. The study physician was to judge the overall interpretation as normal or abnormal. If abnormal, it was decided as to whether or not the abnormality was clinically significant and the reason for the abnormality was recorded.</description>

    <description>Participants were assessed through each laboratory variables for any significant abnormalities. Hematology assessments included white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin and others. Clinical chemistry assessment included testing levels of sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, albumin, calcium, glucose (fasting) and others. Urinalysis assessment included glucose, protein, blood and microscopy (if positive for blood or protein).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Taste Test Assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 hour after dosing (Treatments A and C only).</time_frame>
    <description>A standardized questionnaire was provided to participants and were asked to complete the questionnaire for the liquid formulations tested, i.e., Naloxegol crushed tablet, oral (Treatment A) and Naloxegol oral solution (Treatment C), without assistance or influence from site personnel. For each formulation, the questionnaire was identical and required the participant's opinion. Sweet, salty, sour, bitter, metallic, hot/spicy were rated on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means not at all and 10 means extreme. The overall rating of the taste was rated on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means &quot;I dislike it extremely much&quot; and 10 means &quot;I like it extremely much&quot;. The smell of the medicine was based on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means extremely bad and 10 means extremely nice. The question on whether the participants would consider ever taking the medicine again was based on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means &quot;Never - under no circumstances&quot; and 10 means &quot;Yes, definitely&quot;.</description>

        <title>Taste Test Assessment.</title>
        <description>A standardized questionnaire was provided to participants and were asked to complete the questionnaire for the liquid formulations tested, i.e., Naloxegol crushed tablet, oral (Treatment A) and Naloxegol oral solution (Treatment C), without assistance or influence from site personnel. For each formulation, the questionnaire was identical and required the participant's opinion. Sweet, salty, sour, bitter, metallic, hot/spicy were rated on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means not at all and 10 means extreme. The overall rating of the taste was rated on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means “I dislike it extremely much” and 10 means “I like it extremely much”. The smell of the medicine was based on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means extremely bad and 10 means extremely nice. The question on whether the participants would consider ever taking the medicine again was based on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 means “Never – under no circumstances” and 10 means “Yes, definitely”.</description>
