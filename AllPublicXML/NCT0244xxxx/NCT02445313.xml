      The investigators would like to know if different imaging devices can improve the quality of
      images and visualization of imaged tissues. Also, the investigators would like to find out
      whether these changes are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. Using images
      of previous participants will allow us to demonstrate the advancement of different
      technologies, as well be used to allow comparisons between current technologies.

        Cohort A will consist of patients with AMD, recruited by PI when they come in to the
        clinic, with whom we will conduct medical record review and imaging procedures, using one
        of the research devices.

        Cohort B will consist of control subject with no ocular problems, with whom no record
        review will be conducted, but imaging will be conducted with study devices.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Normal, healthy participants and patients with AMD

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Those suffering from head, neck or other injury which makes them unable to position
             themselves in head restraint for imaging

          2. Participants who are unable to maintain retinal fixation on a specified target

          3. Participants unable to achieve sufficient pupil dilation and alignment stability for
             imaging to take place

          4. Patients with media opacity which preclude high quality imaging will be excluded.

          5. Exclusion criteria include vulnerable patientsÍ¾ patients under 18, pregnant,
             economically and educationally disadvantaged, decision impaired, or homeless people.
             We exclude pregnant women because pregnancy often can alter eye anatomy.
