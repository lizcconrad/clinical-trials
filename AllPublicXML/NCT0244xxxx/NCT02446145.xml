  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease with a poor prognosis including a 5-year overall
      survival (OS) of app. 20% for the entire population. In particular, the outcome of elderly
      patients with AML is dismal and the majority of patients die within the first year after
      diagnosis. This is also because treatment options for elderly patients with AML significantly
      differ from patients of younger age. In fact, comorbid conditions are common among the
      elderly such as heart disease, renal insufficiency and vascular disease thus influencing the
      ability to withstand intensive therapy. Elderly patients are also more likely than younger
      patients to develop severe, life threatening infections during the course of treatment. In
      addition to infectious complications, hemorrhages due to severe thrombocytopenia are
      responsible for morbidity and mortality in a considerable amount of patients. Compared with
      younger AML patients, elderly individuals with AML display a higher incidence of
      poor-prognosis karyotypes, of a preceding myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and greater
      expression of proteins involved in intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. As a
      result conventional anthracycline based chemotherapy is only infrequently used in patients
      above the age of 65 years. Based on a recent randomized trial (Kantarjian et al. 2012)
      low-intensity epigenetic therapy with decitabine (DAC) has become the first-line standard of
      care in most European countries including Germany. Nevertheless, even with this treatment the
      1-year OS is approximately 30 % only. Furthermore, severe thrombocytopenia is a main side
      effect of this therapy and can prevent adequate continuation of treatment being crucially for
      treatment success. Supportive care with platelet transfusions is effective primarily only
      over short periods and often requires hospitalization and therefore lowers the quality of
      life of these patients in their palliative situation. Therefore, patients could benefit from
      an approach aiming at an increase of platelet counts through combined use of DAC with an oral
      thrombopoietin receptor agonist like eltrombopag (EPAG). This could allow for a better
      adherence to DAC therapy by preventing dose delays due to prolonged thrombocytopenia.
      Additionally, the potential antileukemic effect of EPAG could also be beneficial for these
      AML patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DELTA-trial is designed as a two-arm, double-blind, multicenter randomized-controlled
      phase- II study of EPAG or placebo in combination with standard-dose DAC treatment as
      concomitant medication in subjects at least 65 years of age with AML not eligible for
      intensive chemotherapy and planned therapy with Decitabine (DAC). Patients will be randomized
      1:1 into the experimental study arm and the control study arm. EPAG 200 mg (100 mg for East
      Asian patients) once daily has been selected as the starting dose for this study because this
      regimen has been investigated to be safe and potentially effective in increasing platelet
      counts in patients with AML. Concomitant medication with DAC will be according to the
      european label and the summary of product characteristics. There will be a dose adjustment of
      EPAG depending on the platelet counts obtained on day 1 of a planned DAC cycle.

      Concomitant medication will be Decitabine (DAC) 20 mg/m2 i.v. over 30 minutes on days 1-5 of
      each cycle. One cycle lasts 28 days. Patients will receive medication as long as they benefit
      from treatment and in the absence of relevant adverse events indicating a treatment
      discontinuation; but for a maximum of 12 cycles. During Follow Up (up to 4 years) patient
      survival and first treatment change will be observed.
