  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a stepped wedged randomized controlled trial comparing the PARTNER intervention with
      usual care in 5 Intensive Care Units. The overarching goal of this research project to ensure
      patient-centered decisions about the use of intensive treatments for patients with advanced
      critical illness. In a prior project, the investigators developed the PARTNER program
      (PAiring Re-engineered ICU Teams with Nurse-driven Education and OutReach), a 4-facet,
      team-based intervention that re-engineers how surrogates are supported in ICUs, including: 1)
      changing care &quot;defaults&quot; to ensure clinician-family meetings within 48 hours of enrollment
      and frequently thereafter; 2) protocolized, nurse-administered coaching and emotional support
      of surrogates before and during clinician-family meetings, 3) increased use of palliative
      care services for patients with a poor prognosis; and 4) structured communication at care
      transitions about patient's health care preferences and goals. The investigators propose to
      begin deployment of the PARTNERII program in the spring of 2015 enrolling 690 patients and
      690 surrogate decision makers in 5 ICUs using a stepped wedge design. The investigators
      expect to achieve the following project goals:

        1. To increase the patient-centeredness of end-of-life decisions, and to increase the
           quality of clinician-family communication.

        2. To decrease the psychological burden on family members acting as surrogates.

        3. Lower costs: To reduce total health care costs by increasing the use of palliative care
           and hospice services and decreasing unwanted readmissions near the end of life.

    <description>The control group will receive usual care, in which the frequency and content of physician-family communication is determined by the clinical team according to their usual practice. No study ICU has a protocolized approach to family communication and instead clinicians determine the timing and frequency of communication with families.

Additionally, there is academic detailing of ICU physicians and ICU bedside nurses to augment the intervention. The PARTNER Intervention deploys three strategies to improve: 1) the timeliness and frequency of clinician-family communication, 2) the emotional and decision support provided to families and 3) the appropriate involvement of palliative care specialists.</description>
