    <textblock>
      Using protective or combat garments under heavy heat stress conditions, during rest or
      exertion, may hinder the body`s ability to effectively exchange heat with the environment and
      thereby can lead to heat injuries. The purpose of this research is to physiologically examine
      the new textile solutions that are planned to be integrated in the protective garments,
      combat garments and work uniforms in the army, by evaluating the physiological stress
      obtained during exertion under hot climatic conditions.

      10 young, healthy civilian volunteers will participate in this study. After reading and
      signing an informed consent form, all subjects will undergo medical examination which
      includes ECG, anthropometric measurements and Vo2max test. Afterwards, the subjects will
      perform 6 acclimatization days carried out by the standard protocol of Heat Tolerance Test
      (HTT). After acclimatization, the subjects will undergo 4 experiment days under heavy heat
      stress in a climatic chamber, dressed in each experiment day with one out of 4 clothing
      combinations (NBC protective garment [charcoal base], combat garment and 2 different types of
      work uniforms). Physiological stress will be evaluated from rectal temperature and heart rate
      measurements.

6 acclimatization days carried out by a standard protocol including a daily 2 hour effort performed in a climatic chamber, which include walk on a treadmill at 5 Km/h on a 2% incline under heat conditions (40 deg. centigrade &amp; 40% HR) and when dressed in shorts.At the sixth day, the subjects will be dressed in a standard work uniform as a baseline exposure. Core (rectal) and skin temperature and heart rate will be monitored continuously.
4 experiment days carried out by the following protocol: 2 hour walk on a treadmill (5 Km/h,2% incline) under heavy heat stress conditions (30 deg. centigrade,60% RH) and when dressed each time with different clothing out of 4 options:
NBC protective garment (charcoal base).
