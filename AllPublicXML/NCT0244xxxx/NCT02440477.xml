  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Shoulder pain is the third most common musculoskeletal problem accounting almost
      21% of all musculoskeletal complaints. Symptomatic Rotator cuff degenerative tears (RCDT) are
      mostly common above the age of 40. Deviations of posture in the upper quadrant such as,
      slouched posture and forward head position, have been linked repeatedly to rotator cuff
      diseases, altered scapular kinematics and changes in the acromiohumeral distance (AHD). No
      study yet examined the effect of changing posture in sitting on the output of shoulder
      clinical tests, in patients with RCDT.

      Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to examine the effect of changing posture
      in sitting on selected clinical shoulder tests in patients with rotator cuff degenerative
      tears (RCDT) Study design: A single blinded controlled clinical trial Methods: A total of 100
      subjects (Patients referred to physiotherapy outpatient clinics of Clalit Healthcare Services
      in Holon and Hertzlyia) will be included in this study and divided into 2 groups: 50 subjects
      with shoulder pain who are diagnosed with RCDT by ultrasound and a control group of 50
      volunteering subjects without any pain in the upper quadrant. All patients will be measured
      for their body weight and height and their hand dominance will be notified. Following
      reliability trials on the first 10 subjects, all subjects will be tested for pain provocation
      and level of pain (VAS) in both shoulders with 3 commonly used clinical shoulder tests for
      the diagnosis of rotator cuff diseases (Empty can - sensitivity=94%, specificity = 46% Neer
      test - sensitivity = 72%, specificity = 60%, and Hawkins-Kennedy test - sensitivity = 79%,
      specificity = 59% ) in 3 sitting postures; normal resting posture, slouched posture, and
      upright posture with scapular retraction as described by Kalra et al (2010). In addition, the
      rotator cuff muscle strength tests during shoulder abduction, internal rotation and external
      rotation will be measured for the 2 shoulders using a hand-held dynamometer.

      Quality assurance - &quot;clalit&quot; health services will provide ongoing auditing and monitoring of
      the study. data checks will be also examined by &quot;clalit health services&quot;. the investigators
      are obliged to enter all the data into logs provided upfront by the organisation. All the
      data obtained will be stored in an original folder intended for inspection and all encounters
      with volunteers will be documented in the computerized medical file of the volunteers.
      Standard operating procedures will be followed by the regulations expected by &quot;clalit&quot; health
      services and the Israeli ministry of health. After the first 10 volunteers of the study a
      reliability and validity statistical analysis will be made to assess the sample size
      estimated. Missing, unavailable, &quot;non-reported&quot; or uninterpretable data will be excluded from
      the final analysis.Data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social
      Sciences Version 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results of measurements of each test will
      be analyzed for mean, standard deviation (SD) and range. Categorical variables will be
      described percentiles/median. Changes of variables in the same subject will be analyzed using
      a paired T test for continuous variables and Mann-Whitney test for categorical variables. In
      addition, the correlations between variables will be calculated using ICC. P values smaller
      than 0.05 (p&lt;0.05) will be considered significant
