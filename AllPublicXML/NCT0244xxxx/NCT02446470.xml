    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the sinus tarsi approach
      to the extensile lateral approach for surgical fixation of calcaneus fractures.

      It is hypothesized that open reduction and internal fixation of intra-articular calcaneus
      fractures using a sinus tarsi approach will provide equivalent fracture reduction and stable
      fixation with significantly decreased wound complication rates in comparison to an extensile
      lateral approach.

    <description>There is an expected wound complication rate of up to 30% with this type of fracture. The difference in wound complication rate between the two surgical approaches will be the primary outcome measure. Wound complications will be defined by the presence of superficial or deep infections, skin edge necrosis, and soft tissue sloughing.</description>

    <description>A straight incision is made on the lateral side of the foot from the tip of the fibula to the base of the fourth metatarsal which centers the incision over the sinus tarsi. Then careful dissection is made through the subcutaneous tissues to prevent damage to the sural nerve, peroneal tendons, and extensor digitorum brevis (EDB). The origin of EDB is identified and the muscle is released distal enough to fully visualize the fracture and articular surface of the calcaneus. Following exposure of the fracture and articular surface of the calcaneus, open reduction and restoration of the articular surface of the calcaneus will be achieved followed by stable fracture fixation with plates and screws as dictated by the specific fracture pattern.</description>

    <description>An L-shaped incision overlying the lateral wall of the calcaneus will be made, followed by sharp dissection of soft tissues in line with the skin incision down to the periosteum. Effort will be made to identify and protect the sural nerve, as it commonly crosses the surgical field with this approach. The soft tissue flap is retracted as a single unit as subperiosteal dissection is performed. Following exposure of the lateral wall of the calcaneus, open reduction and restoration of the articular surface of the calcaneus will be achieved followed by stable fracture fixation with plates and screws as dictated by the specific fracture pattern.</description>
