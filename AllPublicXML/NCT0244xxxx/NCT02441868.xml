  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot test of an intervention to train family caregivers of home hospice
      patients about recognizing and treating shortness of breath.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shortness of breath is a prevalent symptom causing distress among patients at the end of
      life. In home hospice care family caregivers are expected to assist their family member with
      symptom management. This is often accomplished with little or no training.

      The investigators have developed a bundle of training materials targeted for family
      caregivers of home hospice patients at risk for shortness of breath. The investigators will
      pilot test the intervention in this clinical trial. A future randomized clinical trial is
      planned and the evidence from this pilot will enhance the planning of that future trial.

    <description>Hospice registered nurses will train family caregivers about how to recognize patient shortness of breath. This training will employ a guided learning tool the Respiratory Distress Observation Scale-Family. Training will be done with a DVD and return demonstration of the skills using the patient. In addition, the family will be taught the bundle of evidence-based interventions to treat shortness of breath.</description>
