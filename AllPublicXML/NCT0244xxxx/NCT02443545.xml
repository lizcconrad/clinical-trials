  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term follow-up to an earlier study, LA38-0411. Its purpose is to gather more
      information about the safety and efficacy of deferiprone in patients with sickle cell disease
      or other anemias who suffer from iron overload caused by regular blood transfusions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deferiprone (brand name Ferriprox®) is an iron chelator that is approved in the United States
      and over 60 other countries for the treatment of iron overload in patients with thalassemia,
      when other treatments are inadequate. This study has been designed to evaluate the long-term
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of deferiprone to treat iron overload in patients who have
      sickle cell disease or other anemias.

      Only patients who have completed an earlier study, LA38-0411, are eligible to enroll in this
      one.

             medication

             dated written informed consent prior to the first study intervention, and assent will
             be obtained from patients who are considered to be minors. Patients must be able to

             until 30 days post-treatment in the current study

             2): Presence of any medical condition (including clinically significant laboratory
             abnormalities, such as ALT ≥ 5 x ULN or creatinine ≥ 2 x ULN), psychological
             condition, or psychiatric condition which in the opinion of the investigator would
             cause participation in the study to be unwise.

          3. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study period.

          4. Treatment failure after 1 year on deferiprone which in the investigator's judgment
