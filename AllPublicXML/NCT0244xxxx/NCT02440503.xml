  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators research group conducted a feeding study in 2012 (IRB 07-0003) that
      included breastfed infants consuming different infant solid foods. The investigators results
      showed that different solid foods, especially the protein content of the food, is important
      on infant's gut bacteria profile and growth. Although the first year of life is critical in
      obesity development later in life, data are very limited on the effect of protein from solid
      foods, an important component of infant diet, especially in breast-fed infants. In this
      study, the investigators will re-contact these participants, who are now in their early
      childhood (~5 years old), to evaluate the long-term effect of various macronutrient
      quantities in solid foods, by assessing the participants' growth, body composition, and gut
      bacteria profile.
