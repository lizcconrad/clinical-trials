  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wellness Incentives and Navigation (WIN) project is designed to help improve health
      self-management and reduce the incidence and consequences of chronic disease among
      non-elderly adult Medicaid Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries. WIN targets SSI
      beneficiaries with behavioral health (mental health and substance abuse) diagnoses. Research
      demonstrates that these individuals are more likely to suffer chronic physical
      co-morbidities, experience debilitating chronic illnesses earlier in life and have elevated
      healthcare costs.

      WIN uses person-centered wellness planning and navigation facilitated by trained,
      professional health Navigators, dedicated specifically to the WIN project, who use
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques, and a personal wellness account. Participants with
      more serious mental illnesses will be offered additional support in the form of Wellness
      Recovery Action Planning (WRAP) to enable them to take full advantage of person-centered
      wellness planning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Texas based Wellness Incentives and Navigation (WIN) project uses a continuum of
      evidence-based &quot;whole person&quot; interventions that take into account clinical, environmental,
      and social risk factors and co-morbidities. Unlike more traditional didactic approaches to
      health management, WIN addresses individual behavioral, social, and economic barriers to
      health and wellness, and promotes continued engagement in achieving, internalizing, and
      maintaining healthy behaviors.

      The study is focused on non-dual eligible adult STAR+PLUS (a Texas Medicaid managed care
      program for people with chronic illnesses) members (ages 21-55) with a behavioral health
      disorder including serious mental illness (SMI - e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or
      major depressive disorder) or other behavioral health conditions (e.g., anxiety disorder or
      substance abuse). Key features of the program include the use of professional health
      navigators, working in collaboration with the three STAR+PLUS plans in the Harris Service
      Area (SA) (United-Evercare, Amerigroup, and Molina), the use of motivational interviewing
      (MI) techniques to help members develop and meet personal wellness goals, and a flexible
      wellness account for the participant to use in meeting his/her goals.

    <description>The SF-12 has been validated across a number of chronic diseases and conditions. The survey consists of 12 questions measuring functional health and well-being. Patients answer questions related to daily functioning, difficulties in physical tasks, and disruptions in life due to mental illness (e.g. depression, anxiety). The overall score can be further classified into two summary scores for physical and mental health.</description>

    <description>A person-centered wellness intervention that includes a patient-directed wellness account. Enrollees meet with a patient Navigator to develop a wellness plan. The enrollee can then use the flexible wellness account to make purchases that are consistent with the goals of the wellness plan. Health Navigators have monthly phone contact with enrollees and meet quarterly with them to discuss goals and spending with the express goal of improving self-management, use of preventive services, satisfaction with care, healthcare utilization and expenditures and quality of care.</description>
