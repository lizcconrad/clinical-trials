      Introduction: Chronic pain affects more than half of elderly individuals. Past studies have
      shown that pain can interfere with motor learning and rehabilitation. It was suggested that
      relieving pain before physical therapy sessions might be an interesting strategy to
      potentiate the rehabilitation of older patients suffering from pain.

      Objective: This study aims to determine if the analgesic effect induced by TENS can be used
      to maximize the rehabilitation of elderly patients suffering from chronic pain. More
      specifically, the objectives are to: 1) compare functional outcomes of patients from the Day
      Hospital receiving rehabilitation with either active TENS treatments or simulated TENS
      treatments, and 2) determine if there is an association between the analgesic effect of TENS
      and the clinical evolution of patients following their rehabilitation.

      Methods: In this RCT, patients will be assigned randomly to either the: 1) experimental group
      receiving active TENS treatments or 2) the control group receiving simulated TENS treatments.
      Thirty-six patients will be recruited according to the following criteria: 1) will receive
      physiotherapy rehabilitation at the Day Hospital of the CSSS-IUGS, 2) be at least 65 years of
      age, 3) suffering from chronic pain (pain lasting for more than 6 months), 4) presenting pain
      during the rehabilitation at the Day hospital. For security reasons, patients with a cardiac
      simulator will be excluded from the present study (TENS contraindications). Patients with
      cognitive alterations (score of &lt; 24/30 at the Folstein test) will also be excluded.
      Sociodemographic information will be retrieved from medical records by the research assistant
      at baseline (T1). Moreover, various questionnaires will be administered at T1, after half of
      the rehabilitation period (i.e. 4 to 6 weeks) (T2), and after the 8- to 12- week
      rehabilitation period (T3) to measure the qualitative aspects of pain, mood, and physical
      function. Functional outcomes will as well be collected directly from the medical record at
      each assessment times (T1, T2 and T3).The measures include exercise tolerance, balance,
      mobility and balance, and functional ability.

      Anticipated results: We believe that: 1) use of active TENS during the rehabilitation
      sessions will potentiate rehabilitation of patients suffering from chronic pain at the
      CSSS-IUGS Day Hospital, and 2) there is a relationship between the analgesic effect induced
      by TENS and the clinical evolution of patients.

      Introduction Chronic pain affects more than half of elderly individuals. Past studies have
      shown that pain can interfere with motor learning and rehabilitation. This phenomenon,
      potentially attributable to the deleterious effect that nociceptive inputs have on the motor
      system, suggests that relieving pain before physical therapy sessions might be an interesting
      strategy to potentiate the rehabilitation of older patients suffering from pain.

      Objective The objective of this study is to determine if the analgesic effect induced by
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can be used to maximize the rehabilitation
      of elderly patients suffering from chronic pain. More specifically, this study aims to: 1)
      compare functional outcomes of patients from the Day Hospital receiving rehabilitation with
      active TENS treatments with patients receiving rehabilitation with simulated TENS treatments,
      and 2) determine if there is an association between the analgesic effect of TENS and the
      clinical evolution of patients following their rehabilitation.

      Methods This study is a randomized clinical trial with two parallel arms. Patients will be
      assigned randomly to either the: 1) experimental group receiving active TENS treatments or 2)
      the control group receiving simulated TENS treatments (double blind study). Thirty-six
      patients will be recruited according to the following criteria: 1) will receive physiotherapy
      rehabilitation at the Day Hospital of the Pavillon d'Youville of the CSSS-IUGS, 2) be at
      least 65 years of age, 3) suffering from chronic pain (pain lasting for more than 6 months),
      4) presenting pain during the rehabilitation at the Day hospital. For security reasons,
      patients with a cardiac simulator will be excluded from the present study (TENS
      contraindications). Patients with cognitive alterations (score of &lt; 24/30 at the Folstein
      test) will also be excluded. In order to have a better characterisation of the sample,
      information will be retrieved from medical records by the research assistant, including: 1)
      age, gender, pain localisation, medical diagnosis and medication. Moreover, various
      questionnaires will be administered at baseline (T1), after half of the rehabilitation period
      (i.e. 4 to 6 weeks) (T2), and after the 8- to 12- week rehabilitation period (T3) to measure:
      1) the qualitative aspects of pain (McGill-Melzack pain questionnaire), 2) mood (Beck
      Depression Inventory), and 3) physical function (Brief Pain Inventory). Functional outcomes
      will also be collected directly from the medical record at baseline at each assessment times
      (T1, T2, T3). The measures include: 1) exercise tolerance (6-minute walk test [6MWT]), 2)
      balance (Berg Balance Scale [BBS]), 3) mobility and balance (Time up and go [TUG]), and 4)
      functional ability (Functional autonomy measurement system [SMAF]).

      Anticipated results We believe that: 1) use of active TENS during rehabilitation sessions
      will potentiate rehabilitation of patients suffering from chronic pain at the CSSS-IUGS Day
      Hospital, and 2) there is a relationship between the analgesic effect induced by TENS and the
      clinical evolution of patients.

    <description>TENS is a technique use to relieve pain in an injured or diseased part of the body in which electrodes applied to the skin deliver intermittent stimulation to surface nerves and block the transmission of pain signals. In this research, the frequency will be set at 100 Hz, implusion duration at 60 μsec and intensity will be increase until having strong but confortable stimulations.</description>
