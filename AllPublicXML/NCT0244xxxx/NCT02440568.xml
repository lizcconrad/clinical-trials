      This is a dose escalation study to evaluate Omacetaxine when given in combination with a
      standard induction regimen of &quot;7+3&quot; (cytarabine for Days 1-7 and Idarubicin for Days 1-3) in
      patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      This is a dose escalation study to evaluate Omacetaxine when given in combination with a
      standard induction regimen of &quot;7+3&quot; (cytarabine for Days 1-7 and Idarubicin for Days 1-3) in
      patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Omacetaxine will be given
      subcutaneously Q12 hours on Days 1-7. The optimally safe and active dose (OD) will be
      determined using the EffTox design. EffTox is a Bayesian adaptive design that seeks to
      determine the optimal dose for further study in Phase II by considering a trade-off between
      efficacy and toxicity. The EffTox design begins by treating a cohort of three patients at
      dose level 1. These patients' efficacy and toxicity outcomes are used to update the posterior
      distributions for the probability of efficacy and toxicity and identify acceptable dose
      levels. The study terminates if no dose levels are acceptable. Otherwise, the acceptable
      doses are ranked using the Euclidean distance from (1.0, 0.0) and the next cohort is treated
      at the dose with the minimum distance under the restriction that we may only escalate or
      deescalate by one dose level at a time (e.g., the second cohort can only escalate to dose
      level 2 or deescalate to dose level -1). The second cohort is treated at the dose with the
      minimum distance and posterior distributions, and the list of acceptable doses and distances
      are updated as before. This process continues until at least 20 subjects are enrolled in the
      study. The dose with the minimum distance at study completion is considered the optimal dose
      for further investigation. If none of the dose levels are acceptable at study completion, an
      optimal dose level will not be identified and the drug does not warrant further
      investigation.

      Post induction therapy will consist of standard cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy or
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation based on pretreatment risk assessment.

OD will be defined as a dose level at which fewer than 30% of patients experience hematologic toxicity and greater than 50% of patients achieve a CR (50% is an accepted CR rate in AML when using a single induction).</description>

    <description>Patients will receive Omacetaxine, Cytarabine and Idarubicin as part of the treatment plan. Study participants will follow in outpatient clinic at least every 2 months for a total of 6 months. A final study visit will occur 6 months (+/-1 week) after the last dose of Omacetaxine. This visit will end study participation unless there is ongoing toxicity that is at least possibly related to study treatment. In this case, the patient will be followed as medically appropriate until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed, untreated patients with AML according to the WHO classification for
             AML. Prior short-term therapy (≤7 days) with hydroxyurea, steroids, biological or
             targeted therapy (e.g. FLT3 inhibitors, other kinase inhibitors, azacitidine, ATRA),
             or hematopoietic growth factors is allowed. A single or two-day dose of cytarabine (up
             to 3 g/m^2) for emergency use is also allowed as prior therapy.

          2. Patients age 18 to 70 years old who meet diagnostic criteria for AML according to the
             WHO classification for AML.

          3. Previously untreated AML (≥20% blasts). Note that prior short-term therapy (≤7 days)
             with hydroxyurea, steroids, biological or targeted therapy (e.g. FLT3 inhibitors,
             other kinase inhibitors, azacitidine, ATRA), or hematopoietic growth factors is
             allowed. A single or two-day dose of cytarabine (up to 3 g/m2) for emergency use is
             also allowed as prior therapy.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0-3

          5. Adequate organ function, if not suspected to be due to AML, within 14 days of study
             registration, defined as:

             Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN (unless due to hemolysis) AST and ALT ≤ 3 X ULN (unless
             believed to be due to tumor involvement) Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine
             Clearance &gt; 30 ml/min

          6. Negative urine or serum pregnancy test in females. Patients of reproductive potential
             (males and females) must consent to and practice double-barrier methods of
             contraception during treatment and for 12 weeks following the last dose of
             Omacetaxine. Adequate contraception is defined as double-barrier protection (i.e.,
             condom plus spermicide in combination with a diaphragm, cervical/vault cap, or
             intrauterine device). Birth control pills, birth control patches and/or injections of
             hormones to prevent pregnancy are not considered an adequate method of preventing
             pregnancy, and double-barrier protection is required while on study and for 12 weeks
             after last dose. Patients will be instructed to notify the investigator if pregnancy
             is discovered either during or within 12 weeks of completing treatment with
             Omacetaxine. This also applies to male patients whose partners become pregnant while
             the patient is on study or within the 12 week period after the last dose of study
             drug.

          7. Patients must be willing and able to review, understand, and provide written consent
             before starting therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute promyelocytic leukemia.

          2. Investigational drug within 4 weeks of study entry.

          3. Cardiac insufficiency grade III or IV New York Heart Association (NYHA)

          4. Female subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding.

          5. Patients who are HIV positive.

          6. Active uncontrolled infection or severe systemic infection (enrollment is possible
             after control of infection).

          7. Concurrent malignancy (other than AML) with an estimated life expectancy less than two
             years and requiring active therapy.

          8. Psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical condition that would preclude
             study compliance and follow-up.

          9. Uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or
             electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia or medically relevant active
             conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry, any ECG abnormality at
             screening has to be documented by the investigator as not medically relevant.

         10. Pregnant or breastfeeding: Omacetaxine is a Pregnancy Category D medication and has
             caused embryo-fetal death in animals. Confirmation that the subject is not pregnant
             must be established by a negative urine β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG)
             pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not required for
             post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.

         11. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for enrollment in this study.
