  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune encephalitis，found in recent
      years，producing the specific IgG antibody induced by the NMDA receptors.It is the most common
      curable disease among the non infectious-autoimmune encephalitis,usually has been
      misdiagnosed as other causes of encephalitis.Our previous study found that there are
      differences between the Chinese and the foreign in anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis such as
      the sex ratio, the rate of combined tumor and clinical manifestations.As a new found
      disease,the incidence rate has been underestimated.Therefore,to establish the Registry
      Research Database for Chinese group of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is imminent.This study
      will combine Beijing area's hospitals and foreign experts,depending on multicenter,
      prospective and registry method,to understand the incidence in Beijing area,to summarize and
      analyze the clinical data of patients.So,there will make a solid foundation for the
      subsequent Beijing area detection platform and other research.
