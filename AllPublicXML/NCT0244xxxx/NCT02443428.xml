      The purpose of this prospective observational registry is to monitor safety of eribulin in
      routine clinical practice. Additionally, this study will also assess the effectiveness of
      eribulin in real-life settings.

    <description>Participants will be treated in accordance with normal clinical practice. The recommend dose of eribulin is 1.23 mg/m2 administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 of every 21-day cycle.

        Participants with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after up
        to two chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced disease will be prospectively included in the
        registry. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxanes unless the
        patient was not suitable for these treatments.
