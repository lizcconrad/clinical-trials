  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 2 decades scientists have been studying the effect on brain function from meditation
      practices. The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of a meditation retreat program
      on serotonin and dopamine transporter binding and changes in cerebral blood flow. The retreat
      program that will be followed is a week-long retreat called the Ignatian Retreat.

    <textblock>
      This study will utilize DaTscan single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in healthy subjects within one month of entering
      the retreat. The study uses DaTscan to measure the effect on serotonin and dopamine
      transporter binding, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the effect
      on cerebral blood flow. The Ignatian Retreat is a weeklong retreat which involves meditation
      and prayer.

      Additionally, study participants will complete a variety of questionnaires and scales to
      measure psychological and spirituality states. The scans and questionnaires will be completed
      before and after the participant has completed the retreat. The ultimate goal of the study is
      to analyze and compare pre and post imaging and neuropsychological and spirituality changes
      in healthy controls who participate in this retreat.
