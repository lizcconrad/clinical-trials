      Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of suboccipital inhibitory
      manual therapy treatment in migraine compared to treatment based on Myofascial Trigger Points
      (MTrPs) and their stretching, often being hypersensitive in patients with migraine.

      Material and methods: 27 patients in two groups participated in the study: a) the control
      group received combined techniques based on MTrPs and bilateral stretching in the trapezius
      and sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM); b) the experimental group was applied the same
      techniques as those applied in the control group plus suboccipital inhibition. The treatment
      lasted for 8 weeks and the impact, disability and quality of life were assessed in both
      groups.

      Introduction Migraine is a highly prevalent disorder entailing substantial costs. Manual
      therapy offers an attractive option as an alternative to medical treatment or used in
      combination therewith. Treatment focused on the soft tissues of the suboccitpital region has
      been studied in other types of headaches but not in migraine.

      Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of suboccipital inhibitory
      manual therapy treatment in migraine compared to treatment based on Myofascial Trigger Points
      (MTrPs) and their stretching, often being hypersensitive in patients with migraine.

    <measure>The impact of headache (HIT-6)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) (Yang et al., 2011) provides an overall measure of the adverse impact of headaches. This questionnaire consists of 6 items measuring the impact of pain on social functioning, role functioning, vitality, cognitive functioning and psychological distress, and provides a measure of the severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability (MIDAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>. Disability caused by migraine was assessed by the MIDAS questionnaire (Adenis Silva et al., 2008) based on 5 questions and the score obtained from the sum of the days lost due to headaches registered in the questions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Sternocleidomastoid MTRP and stretching</intervention_name>
    <description>The sternocleidomastoid was treated with ischemic compression. The patient's head was passively moved into contralateral rotation and the patient was asked to relax completely. Sustained pressure was then applied to the sternocleidomastoid muscle until the pain threshold was reached. During the application of pressure, pain decreases so the pressure was gradually increased over a duration of 1 minute. The pressure was then reduced progressively.</description>

    <intervention_name>Trapezius MTRP and stretching</intervention_name>
    <description>The central MTRP of the trapezius was treated as described above for the sternocleidomastoid. Subsequently stretching was performed, whereby the therapist supported the patient's head and performed passive contralateral inclination and ipsilateral rotation of the head. The therapist placed one hand over the patients shoulder while the other hand performed the stretching and simultaneously controlled the position of the head to achieve suitable stretching</description>
