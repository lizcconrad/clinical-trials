  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether increased water intake is effective in
      preventing episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in pre-menopausal women
      suffering from UTI recurrences.

      This study aims to assess the effect of increased daily water intake on the frequency of
      clinical, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI) among low drinking pre-menopausal women
      suffering from recurrent community-acquired UTI over 12 consecutive months of study product
      consumption. It is a prospective, single site, open-label, randomised controlled trial in two
      parallel groups:

        -  Control group: not changing their fluid intake habits

        -  Intervention group: provided with mineral water, fluid intake recommendations and
           regular hydration coaching support

      The study population consists in pre-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent UTIs and
      having a 'low drinker' profile.

      The total number of randomized subjects in this study is estimated at 140. The study will
      include only women who are low-drinkers (&lt; 1.5 L fluids per day; urinary volume &lt; 1.2 L per
      day) since they are most likely to have a predisposition to UTIs due to infrequent voiding.
