  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research has investigated the effect of repetitive head trauma as it relates to
      physiological and psychological function. Boxing is one particular sport which predisposes
      athletes to a large amount of head impacts. We plan to assess the effects of a boxing
      tournament on balance, neuropsychological, and visual functions.

      This is a prospective, repeated measures cohort study, which is able to make within-subject
      (pre and post boxing tournament) comparisons on measures of physiologic and behavioral
      function.

      We plan to enroll boxing athletes who are participating in a boxing tournament. Each
      individual will be assessed on the following tests: balance (dynamic and static balance),
      vestibular-ocular motor function, neuropsychological function, and symptoms. Additionally,
      each boxing match will be video recorded and the total number of head impacts they sustain
      will be documented.

        -  In order to prospectively assess how a boxing tournament affects balance,
           neuropsychological, and visual functions from pre-tournament assessments to
           post-tournament assessments (Specific Aim 1), we plan to test all athletes before
           competition at the Pan-American games begins (pre-test) and after they have been
           eliminated from the tournament (post-test).

        -  In order to measure the associations between the number of head blows sustained during a
           boxing tournament with balance, neuropsychological, visual, and symptom deficits, we
           will also use a video camera to record each match and count the total number of hits to
           the head.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in boxing at a pre-specified tournament

          2. Medically cleared to participate in the tournament, as determined by the attending
             medical staff

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any pre-existing neurological disorder, including but not limited to stroke,
             intracranial hemorrhage, any movement disorder, and cerebral palsy.

          2. Any currently active psychiatric condition, including specifically major depression,
             bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. A history of a psychiatric condition but no ongoing
             psychiatric episode (e.g. not currently undergoing treatment for a major depressive
             episode) would not be an exclusion.

          3. Any unstable medical condition
