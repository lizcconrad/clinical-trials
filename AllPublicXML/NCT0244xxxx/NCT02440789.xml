    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out about the safety of sirolimus in individuals with
      HIV infection who are also being treated with ART. The investigators want to learn whether
      sirolimus will decrease inflammation and immune activation in the body; whether sirolimus
      will change the level of HIV in the participants' blood; and how sirolimus interacts with ART
      in the blood. Sirolimus is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent
      organ rejection in patients aged 13 years and older receiving kidney transplants. Sirolimus
      has also been used for the prevention of complications after stem cell transplants and as a
      treatment for certain kinds of cancers in HIV-infected patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

        NOTE: The term &quot;licensed&quot; refers to a US FDA-approved kit, which is required for all
        investigational new drug (IND) studies.

        WHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
        guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is
        different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test
        should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay or an E/CIA that is based on a
        different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (eg, indirect versus
        competitive), or a Western blot or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.

          -  Currently on continuous ART for ≥24 months prior to study entry. This is defined as
             continuous active therapy for the 24-month period prior to study entry with no
             treatment interruption longer than 5 consecutive days and a total duration off
             treatment of no more than 7 days in the 90 days prior to study entry.

          -  CD4+ cell count ≥400 cells/mm3 obtained within 60 days prior to study entry at any US
             laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any network-approved
             non-US laboratory that operates in accordance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices
             (GCLP) and participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs.

          -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA below the level of quantification (eg, &lt;20, &lt;40, &lt;50, or &lt;75
             copies/mL depending on the assay) for ≥24 months by any US laboratory that has a CLIA
             certification or its equivalent, or at any network-approved non-US laboratory that
             operates in accordance with GCLP and participates in appropriate external quality
             assurance programs. Participants must have at least one documented HIV-1 RNA below the
             level of quantification obtained 12-24 months prior to screening and one HIV-1 RNA
             less than the level of quantification obtained within 12 months prior to the screening
             HIV-1 RNA.

        NOTE:

          -  One month = 30 days.

          -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements above the limit of quantification but &lt;200 copies/mL in
             the 24 months prior to screening are allowed if directly followed by HIV-1 RNA below
             assay limit, but none in the 6 months prior to screening.

               -  Plasma HIV-1 RNA level of &lt;40 copies/mL obtained by the Abbott real time assay or
                  &lt;20 copies/mL by the Roche COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test, Version 2.0 assay within 60
                  days prior to study entry at any laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its
                  equivalent.

               -  For females of reproductive potential (defined as women who have not been
                  postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months or documentation that the woman
                  has undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingectomy), negative

             pregnancy.

          -  Females on hormone-based contraceptives at study entry must have been on the same
             method for at least 90 days prior to study entry.

                  laboratory that has a CLIA certification or its equivalent, or at any
                  network-approved non-US laboratory that operates in accordance with GCP and
                  participates in appropriate external quality assurance programs.

        CrCl (mL/min)*

          -  For women, multiply the result by 0.85 = CrCl (mL/min) NOTE: A program to assist in
             calculations is available on the DMC website at: http://www.fstrf.org/ACTG/ccc.html
