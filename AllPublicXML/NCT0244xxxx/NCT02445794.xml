      Study RT001-002 is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, ascending dose study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, disease state, and exploratory endpoints in
      patients with Friedreich's ataxia after oral administration. The study includes 2 dose levels
      of RT001.
