      Primary Objective:

      To assess the tolerability of cabazitaxel 25 mg per body surface area (m^2) with primary
      prophylactic polyethylene glycol-granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (PEG-G-CSF) in terms
      of the incidence rate of febrile neutropenia (FN) (defined: absolute neutrophil count [ANC]
      &lt;1000 per volume [mm^3] and a single temperature of &gt;38.3 degree or a sustained temperature
      of ≥38 degree Celsius for more than one hour) during Cycle 1.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess overall rate of FN and grade ≥3 neutropenia and diarrhea; frequencies of dose delay
      due to adverse events (AEs); dose reduction due to AEs; relative dose intensity; incidences
      of FN-related hospitalization and use of intravenous (IV) anti-infectives; tolerability
      according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (NCI-CTCAE) v4.0; prostate specific antigen (PSA) response (50% decrease); tumor response
      according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 if available.

    <description>25 mg/m^2 of cabazitaxel is given intravenously in combination with prednisolone 10 mg orally per day. PEG-G-CSF is administered subcutaneously 24 hours after the completion of cabazitaxel infusion once every 3 weeks.
Antihistamine (dexchlorpheniramine or diphenhydramine), corticosteroids (dexamethasone), and H2 antagonist (ranitidine) premedications will be administered by IV infusion at least 30 minutes prior to each dose of cabazitaxel. A prophylactic antiemetic treatment (metoclopramide, granisetron, or ondansetron) should be given to the patients in all cycles.</description>
