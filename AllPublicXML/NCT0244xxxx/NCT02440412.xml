  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of a single session of Massage Therapy in salivary cortisol
      level. All participants were assessed on three conditions: Massage session, rest in supine
      position listening music, and under normal working conditions. The hypothesis of the
      investigators is that the effect of the massage action in reduction of cortisol is superior
      to only rest.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have postulated that one of the physiological markers of the effect of
      massage therapy is to reduce the level of cortisol, the &quot;stress hormone&quot;. However it is not
      clear whether the effect is due to the manual action on the skin, or only by the relaxation
      induced rest. Therefore the variation of salivary cortisol in both conditions, and also in
      everyday working conditions was compared. Cortisol has a circadian cycle, with a maximum
      value upon awakening, which decreases during the morning; therefore a sample of saliva (in
      Salivette tube) it was collected in the three experimental conditions at the same hour time
      in the morning: 8:45(after intervention), and 9:30 and 10.30 (both, before).

    <time_frame>All participants were measured in three different condition, one week apart one each other. In each condition, three measurements were performed, in the morning</time_frame>
    <description>Data (a saliva sample in a Salivette (r) tube) were collected at: immediately before the intervention and placebo procedure, immediately after and later, one hour after. The control condition (normal working condition) was measured at the same hours (8:45 AM, 9.30 AM and 10.30 AM) in the workplace. After collected, were refrigerated.The three conditions (intervention, placebo and office work) were a week apart. Therefore, each participant had nine measurements. Determining the level of cortisol was performed by ELISA method, after all samples were collected.</description>
