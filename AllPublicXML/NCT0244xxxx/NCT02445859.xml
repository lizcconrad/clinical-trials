  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to randomise patients due to undergo colorectal surgery to standard antibiotic
      prophylaxis or an interventional antibiotic prophylaxis regimen and assess surgical wound
      infection rates. Standard antibiotic prophylaxis is a pre-operative injection of cefuroxime,
      repeated every 4 hours. The intervention regimen is a loading dose of cefuroxime followed by
      a continuous infusion of cefuroxime until the end of surgery. The intervention regimen dosing
      will be calculated using a patient's renal function and body weight. The intervention regimen
      will target a free serum drug concentration of 64mg/L. This serum level is 4x the MIC90 for
      colonising Enterobacteriaceae. The rational for this dosing regimen is summarised below. The
      primary objective of the study is to reduce by 50% the rate of surgical wound infections
      after colorectal surgery.

      An expert assessment is that fT&gt;MIC is the measure most likely to be applicable to
      prophylaxis. But this measure is not achieved by standard prophylaxis regimens. Neither do
      clinical data suggest this target achieves optimal prophylaxis. Therefore there is an
      opportunity to optimise antibiotic prophylaxis dosing. As the exposure response-relationship
      (pharmacodynamic target) is unknown we could either complete a number of studies exploring
      different relationships, or compare standard treatment to a single regimen which included a
      number of exposure-response relationships. The two most common exposure-response
      relationships are the CMAX/MIC ratio and the fT&gt;MIC. And it has been reported that killing,
      as opposed to inhibition used in MIC values, is optimised by achieving 4 times an MIC value.
      An antibiotic prophylaxis regimen which achieved drug concentrations of 4xMIC for the
      duration of surgery would therefore achieves a high CMAX/MIC ratio, high T&gt;MIC, and optimise
      bacterial killing. Therefore, standard dose antibiotic prophylaxis will be compared against a
      PD target dosed antibiotic prophylaxis regimen. The PD target will be a free serum antibiotic
      concentration of 4xMIC90 for Enterobacteriaceae against cefuroxime. Continuous infusion of
      antibiotic prophylaxis will ensure there is continuous targeting of this drug level
      throughout the operation.

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Undergoing colorectal surgery (incision, excision or anastomosis of the large bowel,
             including anastomosis of small to large bowel)

          -  Age &gt;18.

          -  Expected duration of surgery &gt; 2hours

          -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min

          -  Cefuroxime/metronidazole are appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis regimens.

          -  Patient capable of giving informed consent

          -  Patients undergoing colorectal surgery plus additional surgery e.g. plastic surgery,
             urological surgery, gynaecological surgery.

          -  If it is not possible to obtain intra-operative blood samples e.g. difficult vascular
             access, or pre-operative swabs e.g. anatomy makes it difficult to obtain, patients
             will be included and this information treated as missing data. Patients on antibiotic
             treatment for an existing infection (except SSIs) can be included in the study

             Nitrofurantoin and Clarithromycin would be permissible antibiotics without systemic
             Gram negative antibiotics).

          -  A current diagnosis of a SSI at the time of study entry.
