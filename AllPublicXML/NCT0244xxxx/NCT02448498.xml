  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Strength Training Regimen in Normal Weight Diabetics (STRONG-D) study will examine the
      effectiveness of different exercise regimen types in controlling diabetes for the normal
      weight type 2 diabetes population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the STRONG-D study, participants are randomly assigned to strength training, aerobic
      training or a combined strength and aerobic training group. Participants in the exercise
      group will attend exercise sessions over the course of 9 months at the YMCA. Participants
      will have opportunities to engage in other activities such as educational run-in visits that
      will allow for measurement of hemoglobin A1c and emphasize the importance of exercise in
      improving Type 2 diabetes.
