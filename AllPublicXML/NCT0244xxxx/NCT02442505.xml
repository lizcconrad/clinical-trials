    <textblock>
      This study will use an automated blood pressure monitor (Microlife WatchBP03) with an inbuilt
      algorithm to detect atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart rhythm) in patients with an
      implanted pacemaker who have previously documented paroxysmal (intermittent) atrial
      fibrillation. This study will compare the Microlife device detected atrial fibrillation
      episodes to the pacemaker detected atrial fibrillation episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The modified Microlife blood pressure monitor is able to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) with
      high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (86%) and has a positive predictive value of 68% and
      negative predictive value of 98% for single readings. In addition, the modified device was
      also able to accurately classify the majority of the anomalous non-AF rhythms, although the
      specificity was highly variable, dependent upon the rhythm. However sinus rhythm was detected
      with a specificity of 97%. However, we do not currently know if the device would demonstrate
      a similar sensitivity in detecting AF in patients with paroxysmal AF.

      Therefore, the present study will assess the sensitivity and specificity of the automated
      oscillometric device using a new AF algorithm among pacemaker patients with fast AF and
      atrial high-rate episodes and evaluate the effect of the specific rhythm abnormalities on the
      specificity for AF.

        Patients who have an implanted pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome with previously documented
        AF with atrial high-rate episodes, with be identified from the pacemaker clinic register at
        one NHS Trust. Patients with AF and one of the following pacemakers will be identified from
        this register: Medtronic Sensia DR, Medtronic Advisa DR, Sorin Reply DR, and St. Jude
        Medical Accent DR and the study population will be randomly drawn from these patients.
        Atrial high rate episodes will be defined as atrial rates â‰¥180 beats per minute [3-6]. The
        exclusion criteria will include any patient who's pacemaker has had previously documented
        atrial sensing or pacing problem issues and patients with permanent AF.
