    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of repeat administration of MST-188
      during vaso-occlusive crisis of sickle cell disease. Additionally, this study will evaluate
      the development of acute chest syndrome during VOC and re-hospitalization for recurrence of
      VOC.
