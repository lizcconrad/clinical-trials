  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the efficacy of modern treatment, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the the
      leading cause of death. Prognostic scores have been developed to estimate the risk of adverse
      outcome. Several serum biomarkers have been also investigated in patients with CAP. A growing
      number of echocardiographic markers have been evaluated as possible predictors of prognosis
      in patients with pulmonary and infectious diseases such as sepsis, septic shock, human
      immunodeficiency virus infection, pulmonary tuberculosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease. As echocardiography is a non-invasive, reliable, cost-effective, and reproducible
      diagnostic tool to evaluate cardiac function and structures, the investigators aimed to
      investigate left and right ventricular functions and aortic elastic properties in CAP
      patients. Furthermore, the investigators also aimed to observe relationships between
      echocardiographic findings and inflammatory and cardiac serum biomarkers in patients with
      CAP.

    <textblock>
      Despite the efficacy of modern treatment, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the the
      leading cause of death. Prognostic scores, like the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory
      rate, arterial blood pressure and age) score and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) have been
      developed and validated to estimate the risk of adverse outcome and to register a patient
      with CAP for hospital admission. Serum biomarkers have been also investigated in patients
      with CAP like Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Elevated N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic
      peptide (NT-proBNP) has been shown to be associated with adverse prognosis in several cardiac
      conditions and critically ill patients. NT-proBNP is also shown to be important predictor in
      the emergency department and in hospitalized patients with CAP. A growing number of
      echocardiographic markers have been evaluated as possible predictors of prognosis in patients
      with pulmonary and infectious diseases such as sepsis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease. Although effects of pneumonia on cardiac structures is
      theoretically possible due to increased systemic inflammatory activity, prothrombotic
      conditions, biomechanical stress on coronary arteries, variations in coronary arterial tone,
      and altered myocardial metabolic balance during infections, the role of transthoracic
      echocardiography has never been evaluated in patients with CAP. As echocardiography is a
      non-invasive, reliable, cost-effective, and reproducible diagnostic tool to evaluate cardiac
      function and structures, the investigators aimed to investigate left and right ventricular
      functions and aortic elastic properties in CAP patients. Furthermore, the investigators also
      aimed to observe relationships between echocardiographic findings and inflammatory and
      cardiac serum biomarkers in patients with CAP.

        Pneumonia group is defined as patients with community acquired pneumonia diagnosis
        hospitalised through emergency department. The control group will be consisted of
        consecutive sex- and age-matched patients admitted to the emergency department.
