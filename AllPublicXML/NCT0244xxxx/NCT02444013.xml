      The purpose of this study is to determine whether periprocedural administration of folic acid
      is effective in the prevention of contrast induced nephropathy in patients undergoing
      coronary CTA/angiography/angioplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperhomocysteinemia is considered to be independently associated with a greater risk of
      contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) in previous studies. However, the relationship between
      homocysteine-lowering therapy and CIN remains uncertain. Folic acid is considered to be the
      most common agent for homocysteine-lowering therapy. Therefore, this study aims to determine
      whether periprocedural administration of folic acid is effective in the prevention of CIN.
      400 patients undergoing coronary CTA/angiography/angioplasty are going to be initially
      enrolled. Of these patients,200 were randomly assigned to receive a standard dose of folic
      acid (5mg tid, given at least two days before the procedural and continued for two days
      after), 200 to receive placebo. Blood samples for estimations of serum creatinine were
      collected at 0, 24 and 48h of contrast agent administration. CIN is defined as an elevation
      of creatinine by ≥ 25% or ≥ 0.5 mg/dl from baseline within 48h. The occurrence of CIN and the
      major in-hospital clinical events were recorded and compared between the intervention and
      control groups.
