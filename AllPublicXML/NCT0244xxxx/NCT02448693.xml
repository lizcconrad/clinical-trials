    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI)
      compared with High Definition White Light colonoscopy (WLE) for detection of residual
      neoplasia in subjects with piecemeal polypectomy scars.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resection of large sessile polyps in the colon (usually more than 2 cm) or those nonpolypoid
      neoplastic lesions (also called laterally spreading tumors or LST), confers technical
      difficulty and often are forced to remove into fragmented resection or endoscopic piecemeal
      mucosal resection. This has been associated with a recurrence of 25%. For this reason,
      clinical guidelines recommend endoscopic follow-up at 2 to 6 months after piecemeal resection
      of colorectal polyps to check for residual neoplasia.

      Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI, Olympus) improves visibility and identification of the surface and
      vascular structures of colon polyps. In contrast to conventional chromoendoscopy, it is
      easily activated by pressing a button on the endoscope.

      Virtual or conventional chromoendoscopy are applied during resection of polyps defining the
      border of the lesion. However, there are few studies using Narrow Band Imaging and do not
      allow to know whether the use of this technique could improve the detection of residual tumor
      after fragmented polypectomy and avoid complications, time and costs of biopsy and
      histological analysis.

      In this context, the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) has recently
      published the first Guideline of Advanced Endoscopic Imaging for the Detection and
      Differentiation of Colorectal Neoplasia and recommends conventional or virtual
      chromoendoscopy in patients with piecemeal polypectomy scar (strong recommendation, low
      quality evidence).

      The investigators will perform a randomised, controlled trial of tandem colonoscopy using NBI
      and WLE. The main goal is to compare the rate of detected neoplasia between both techniques
      and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of NBI and WLE to histology as the gold standard.

    <description>Participants will be evaluated by same endoscopist, tandem colonoscopy. It consists of two revisions of the polypectomy scar using firstly High Definition White Light Endoscopy (WLE) and secondly Narrow Band Imaging. All suspected neoplasia will be classified macroscopically and resected and differentiated from both techniques. The rest of the gut will be inspected following conventional standards.</description>
