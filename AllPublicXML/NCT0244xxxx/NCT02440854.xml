  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study will include a representative sample of patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutations in
      Greece. Eligible NSCLC patients, for whom the physician has decided to initiate treatment
      with the study medication (afatinib, GIOTRIF®) will be treated according to the local
      prescribing information and standard medical practice in terms of visit frequency and types
      of assessments performed.

      The study will investigate the impact of GIOTRIF (Afatinib) on patients' disease-related
      symptom burden and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in a real world clinical setting in
      Greece.The Average Symptom Burden Index (ASBI) score of the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS)
      in eligible patients, after 6 months of therapy, will be analyzed.

      The overall study duration period is expected to be 48 months, including a 36-month
      enrollment period and a minimum 12-month follow-up period.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Adult outpatients (18 years and older) of either gender;

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic (IIIB/IV)
             NSCLC of any histological type with activating EGFR mutation(s) according to local
             laboratory EGFR testing;

          -  EGFR- tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive patients;

          -  Patients for whom the decision to prescribe therapy with afatinib (GIOTRIF®) according
             to the locally approved product's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) has
             already been taken prior to their enrolment in the study; the assignment of the
             patient to this therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance by the study protocol
             but falls within current practice and the prescription of afatinib is clearly
             separated from the physicians decision to include the patient in the current study;

          -  Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent and to comply
             with the requirements of this study protocol;

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients who have initiated treatment with Afatinib more than 7 days prior to their
             enrolment into the study;

          -  Patients that meet any of the contraindications to the administration of the study
             drug according to the approved SmPC;

          -  Receipt of any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the
             investigational agent (whichever is longer) before the commencement of therapy with
             afatinib
