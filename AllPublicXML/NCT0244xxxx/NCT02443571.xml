  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective observational multi centered study has been established to collect the
      clinical experience relating to the administration of Fluciclovine 18F employed in both
      investigator initiated studies and named patient/compassionate use programmes in up to 5
      sites.

    <textblock>
      This study will collect clinical data from consenting patients (unless a HIPAA waiver or
      equivalent was granted) who received the PET radiotracer Fluciclovine 18F (FACBC) (a
      synthetic amino acid analog) for imaging of patients with various cancers at participating
      sites in the US and Europe.

      Data collection will cover baseline medical history and medications in all patients.

      The result of PET radiotracer and other imaging findings, and reports of histopathology from
      biopsied tissue (where available) and in a time window relevant to the use of PET imaging in
      the diagnosis of primary/recurrent prostate cancer will be recorded.

      In all subjects, with regards to safety monitoring, available data for physical examination,
      vital signs and laboratory test results will be collected from 28 days prior to and out to a
      35 day window after Fluciclovine 18F (FACBC) administration.

      The major goals of the investigation are to consolidate the safety profile of Fluciclovine
      18F (FACBC), to evaluate its use in the detection of local and extraprostatic recurrence of
      prostate cancer and to evaluate its ability to detect malignancy in patients undergoing
      screening for primary prostate cancer.
