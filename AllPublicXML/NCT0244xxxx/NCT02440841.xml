  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential for co-administration of strong
      inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 to alter the pharmacokinetics of fedovapagon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fedovapagon is a vasopressin V2 receptor agonist in development for the treatment of
      nocturia. Agonism of the V2 receptor, located in the collecting ducts of the kidney, leads to
      translocation of aquaporin channels and increased re absorption of water and anti-diuresis.

      A number of drugs that are commonly co-prescribed in the population who may present for
      treatment of nocturia are inhibitors of CYP3A4, including diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin
      and clarithromycin and may therefore impact the plasma levels of fedovapagon if co
      administered.

      Conversely, concomitant intake of drugs that are potent CYP3A4 inducers may lead to lower
      than anticipated plasma concentrations of fedovapagon thus reducing the efficacy of
      fedovapagon. It is therefore important to assess the effect of CYP3A4 induction on the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of fedovapagon.

      The study design uses itraconazole as a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and, in a separate cohort
      of subjects, rifampicin as a potent CYP3A4 inducer at doses intended to maximize the
      potential to demonstrate an interaction.
