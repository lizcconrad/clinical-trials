      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and activity of the study drug known
      as LY3023414 in combination with necitumumab in participants with metastatic squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <why_stopped>
    The observed DCR at 6 months is 4%,below the hypothesized 44% DCR at 6 months as the primary
    objective of this study. The study stopped due to lack of activity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed squamous advanced NSCLC (Stage IV).

          -  Participants must have progressed on one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy in
             the advanced or metastatic setting.

          -  Measurable disease as measured by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
             (RECIST) criteria v 1.1.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1.

          -  Able to swallow the study drugs whole.

          -  Adequate organ function.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             performed ≤ 7 days prior to start of treatment. Women of childbearing potential or men
             with partners of childbearing potential must use effective birth control measures
             during treatment and during the 3 months following completion of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have received &gt; 1 prior line of chemotherapy in the advanced or
             metastatic setting. (Immunotherapy will not be considered a line of chemotherapy.)

          -  Prior treatment with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
             inhibitor, and/or necitumumab.

             and stable without requirement of corticosteroids.

          -  Have serious pre-existing medical conditions.

          -  Have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Participants with a type 2 diabetes mellitus

             anti-diabetics.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Clinically significant electrolyte imbalance ≥ Grade 2.

             weight heparin and oral Xa inhibitors are allowed.

          -  Have initiated treatment with bisphosphonates or approved receptor activator of
             nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L) targeted agents (e.g. denosumab) ≤ 28 days
             prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.

          -  Concurrent serious infection requiring parenteral antibiotic therapy.

          -  Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the investigator and Medical
             Monitor may affect the interpretation of results.

          -  Have an active, known fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection.

          -  History of arterial or venous embolism within 3 months prior to study enrollment. If
             the embolism occurred &gt;3 and &lt;6 months, the participant is eligible provided
             appropriate treatment according to institutional standard of care is ensured.
