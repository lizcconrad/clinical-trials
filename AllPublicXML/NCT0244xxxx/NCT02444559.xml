  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to investigate if clonidine prolongs the duration of an adductor
      canal block. By using healthy volunteers the investigators can perform a bilateral adductor
      canal block and thereby control for a systemic effect to clarify if the effect is actually
      peripheral or systemic. The investigators hypothesis is that clonidine/dexmedetomidine as an
      adjunct to a local anaesthetic prolongs the duration of a peripheral nerve block by a
      peripheral mechanism.

      Background:

      Efficient pain management promoting mobilization and convalescence is essential in an ideal
      perioperative course. Regional nerve blocks are a central element in postoperative regimes
      for many patients and it is therefore important that these nerve blocks are both long lasting
      and efficient. This trial will investigate whether it is possible to optimize the
      postoperative pain management when adding clonidine to the local anaesthetic ropivacaine in
      peripheral nerve blocks.

      The prolonging effect of using clonidine as adjuncts in peripheral nerve blocks have been
      investigated in several studies. However, it remains uncertain whether the effect is mediated
      by a systemic-, a peripheral- or a combined systemic/peripheral mechanism. In this trial the
      adjuvating effect of clonidine will be investigated using the adductor canal block. This is a
      nerve block that besides being efficient as pain treatment after knee surgery, is primarily
      sensory, and therefore augments mobilization after total knee arthroplasty.

      Method:

      On the trial day the volunteers will receive bilateral adductor canal blocks. In one thigh
      they will receive the local anaesthetic ropivacaine 20ml 5mg/ml and placebo (saline) and in
      the other thigh ropivacaine 20ml 5mg/ml and Clonidine 150μg. The allocation is blinded to
      volunteer and investigator.

      The duration of the nerve block will be measured by five different tests: Temperature test,
      Pinprick, Pain during tonic heat stimulation, Warmth detection threshold and pain detection
      threshold. All tests are validated within pain research.
