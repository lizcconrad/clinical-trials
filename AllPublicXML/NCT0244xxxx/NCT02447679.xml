      This single-centered phase II clinical study is to obtain preliminary information on 1-year
      recurrence-free survival rate, recurrence-free survival and safety profile of thalidomide in
      combination with tegafur-uracil in hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy and explore
      biomarkers(VEGF/bFGF) for thalidomide response.

      After liver resection to remove the hepatocellular carcinioma completely, the patients with
      high risk of tumor recurrence will be enrolled into this study. The high risk of tumor
      recurrence depends on tumor characteristics. The risk factors of tumor characteristics
      included tumor size &gt;5 cm in diameter, abscence of encapsulation, vascular invasion and
      presence of daughter nodules. The patients with high risk of tumor recurrence will have 1 to
      3 risk factors. When the patients are enrolled into the study, oral thalidomide in
      combination with tegafur-uracil will be applied to prevent tumor recurrence. The patients
      will be fillowed uo erevy 3 mnoths.

    <description>Measure a-fetoprotein and perform liver echo to find out tumor recurrence every 3 month. Then, if a tumor/tumors are found in liver echo, tumor recurrence will be confirmed by CT scan. The imaging on CT shows typical HCC pattern.
