      Phase I-II Clinical Trial-Safety and efficacy of umbilical-cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell
      (UC-MSC) in patients with paraquat poisoning induced lung injury,randomized, single blind,
      controlled prospective study.

      Forty patients will be selected and randomized into two groups: the first group of 20
      patients will receive three-time injection of UC-MSC and the remaining 20 patients will
      comprise the control group.

      Every patient will maintain their standard treatment of paraquat poisoning, with maximum
      tolerated dosage without side effects.

      The day of last infusion will be considered day zero. From that moment, followup will be
      divided into 2 d,7 d,14 d, 28 d and 2 m.

      Clinical results will be analyzed after completion of 2 months of followup.
