  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use monitoring and intervention technologies in suboptimal
      health status in a general population in China and evaluate the effectiveness of these
      technologies in the improvement of suboptimal health status.

    <textblock>
      The Suboptimal health status questionnaire (SHSQ-25) is used to evaluate the suboptimal
      health status. The SHSQ-25 includes 25 questions. The score of the SHSQ-25 is from 0 to 100.
      Suboptimal health status is defined as the SHSQ-25 score above than 35. The higher scores of
      the SHSQ-25 one gets, the more severity of suboptimal health status he/she has. All
      participants are asked to fill in the SHSQ-25 before and after the intervention. If the score
      decreases after the intervention, it means that the suboptimal health status has been
      improved.

      A monitoring device is used to monitor a person's blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen
      saturation, body weight, and energy consumption by Bluetooth Wireless technology.
      Intervention technologies include a health information push technology and a field-effect
      meridian therapy instrument.

    <time_frame>three months</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate the change of metabolic abnormality when the monitoring and/or intervention technologies are used. The definition of metabolic abnormality is met when one or more of the following criteria are present: (1) blood pressure ≥ 130 mmHg; (2) fasting blood glucose ≥ 100 mg/dl; (3) body mass index ≥ 28 kg/m2; (4) dyslipidemia (total cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dl, triglyceride ≥ 150 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dl, and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt; 40 mg/dl).</description>

    <description>All of participants with suboptimal health status use the monitoring device with three months, and are randomly grouped into the non-intervention group (Group 4 or Group 5) and the intervention group using the meridian therapy instrument (Group 6 or Group 7). Group 4 are participants without metabolic abnormality in the non-intervention group. No intervention technologies are used in Group 4.</description>
