      Open prospective multicenter phase IV study in patients presenting with symptoms of bacterial
      and/or mycotic (mushroom) vaginitis for 12 days as specified in the product information.

      Investigators/centers: 20 gynacologists are previewed to do the study in ambulatory
      treatment.

      Objectifs of the study:

      Principal objectif:

      Evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment on the clinical symptoms of bacterial and/or
      mycotic vaginitis

      Secondary objectif:

      Evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment on eradication of the diagnosed germs Evaluation
      of the correspondence of the efficacy on the symptoms and on the eradication of the germs.

      Numbers of patients previewed: 100 patients for evaluation of the efficacy

      Criteria of evaluation

      Principal criteria:

      Clinical efficacy as judged by the investigator Secondary criteria:evaluation of clinical
      symptoms judged by the patient reduction or emlimination of bacteria and other germs the
      relationship between clinical and bacterial results

      Evaluation of tolerance

      Used Study Drug:

      Polygynax, vaginal capsule consisting of Polymyxin 35000 UI, Neomycin 35000UI and Nystatin
      100000UI Application: vaginal application once daily in the evening for 12 days

      Study design:

      Visit 1:

      All patients presenting with the clinical symptoms, presenting all inclusion criteria and
      none of the exclusion criteria are included in the study at visit 1 and receive Polygynax
      treatment (one vaginal capsule once daily in the evening).

      A vaginal smear is obtained. Visit 2 (optional) If the results of the bacteriological
      examination confirms an infection with germs sensible to the treatment with Polygynax the
      treatment is continued. If other germs not sensible to Polygynax are present, the patients is
      contacted to stop the treatment, to come back to a second visit to her gynacologist who will
      change the treatment. The other patients continue the treatment.

      Visit 3:

      After the treatment the patients come back to the last visit. A clinical evaluation and a
      vaginal smear for control is obtained.
