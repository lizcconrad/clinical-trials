    <textblock>
      PTSD Coach is a mobile application (app) that aims to teach individuals self-management
      strategies for symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a major public
      health concern. Although effective treatments exist, affected individuals face many barriers
      to receiving traditional care. As smartphones are now carried by more than half of the U.S.
      population, they have the potential to overcome many of these barriers by delivering
      self-help interventions on apps. Despite PTSD Coach's use of evidence-based cognitive
      behavioral strategies there is still a need to test the effectiveness of the app in managing
      PTSD symptoms. This controlled, two-arm, randomized (1:1) trial will evaluate the efficacy,
      feasibility and acceptability of PTSD Coach to reduce PTSD symptoms in a community sample of
      trauma survivors with PTSD symptoms. After completing an eligibility phone screen or online
      screen, individuals who score a 35 or above on the PTSD Checklist (PCL) and consent will
      complete a baseline assessment and then be randomized to the PTSD Coach app condition or a
      waitlist control group. Additionally, those assigned to the PTSD Coach intervention will be
      instructed to download a research version of the app, called PTSD Explorer, that enables
      passive and objective monitoring of app use. Each individual will be reassessed at
      post-intervention (3 months) and follow-up (3 months later, or 6 months after completing
      baseline). The investigators predict that those using the PTSD Coach app will demonstrate a
      significant and sustained reduction in PTSD symptoms and increase in patient coping
      self-efficacy compared to the waitlist control group. The investigators will explore if there
      is a relationship between levels of engagement and PTSD symptom change.

    <measure>Change in PTSD Symptoms Measured by the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Posttreatment (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptoms were assessed with the PCL-C (Weathers et al., 1993), a 17-item self-report measure of DSM-IV PTSD symptoms with strong psychometric properties (Wilkins, Lang, &amp; Norman, 2011). Items are rated on how much the symptom bothered the respondent in the past month on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), with the sum score ranging from 17 to 85 providing a symptom severity rating, with higher ratings indicating more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Subject Coping Self-efficacy Measured by a Questionnaire Assessing Confidence in Managing Core Symptoms of PTSD Addressed in the Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Posttreatment (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD symptom coping SE was assessed with a 9-item self-report measure developed for the study following Bandura's guidelines (Bandura, 2006). Items assess confidence in managing PTSD symptoms and reaching out for support on a scale from 0 (cannot do at all) to 100 (highly certain can do). The average score provides an overall measure of SE with higher scores reflecting greater self-efficacy coping with PTSD symptoms. Cronbach's alpha at baseline was .87.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Interpersonal Functioning Measured by a Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (IPF7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Posttreatment (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Psychosocial functioning was measured using the Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (B-IPF; Erb, Kearns, Bovin et al., 2015), a 7-item self-report measure. Items are rated on how much trouble the respondent had in the past month in relationships or other important areas of functioning (e.g., work, training or education) on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 6 (very much). An average of applicable items provides an index of psychosocial functioning, with higher scores reflecting more poorer psychosocial functioning. Cronbach's alpha at baseline was .82.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression Symptoms Measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Posttreatment (3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Depression was assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8; Kroenke et al., 2009), an 8-item self-report measure of depression with evidence showing its ability to measure depression symptom severity and potential diagnosis. Items are rated on how much the symptom bothered the respondent in the past two weeks on a scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Total scores can range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe depression symptoms. Cronbach's alpha at baseline was .87.</description>

    <measure>Sustained Change in PTSD Symptoms Measured by the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)</measure>

Items are rated on how much the symptom bothered the respondent in the past month on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), with the sum score ranging from 17 to 85 providing a symptom severity rating, with higher ratings indicating more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

        <description>PTSD symptoms were assessed with the PCL-C (Weathers et al., 1993), a 17-item self-report measure of DSM-IV PTSD symptoms with strong psychometric properties (Wilkins, Lang, &amp; Norman, 2011). Items are rated on how much the symptom bothered the respondent in the past month on a scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely), with the sum score ranging from 17 to 85 providing a symptom severity rating, with higher ratings indicating more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>

        <description>PTSD symptom coping SE was assessed with a 9-item self-report measure developed for the study following Banduraâ€™s guidelines (Bandura, 2006). Items assess confidence in managing PTSD symptoms and reaching out for support on a scale from 0 (cannot do at all) to 100 (highly certain can do). The average score provides an overall measure of SE with higher scores reflecting greater self-efficacy coping with PTSD symptoms. Cronbachâ€™s alpha at baseline was .87.</description>
