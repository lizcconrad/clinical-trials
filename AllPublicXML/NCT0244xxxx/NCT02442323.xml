  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite evidence regarding the benefits of physical activity in various cancer patient
      populations, the effects of a home-based walking program for pancreatic cancer patients have
      been under-explored. The aims of the proposed pilot project are to: (1) Assess the
      feasibility of implementing a 12-week, home-based walking program among pancreatic cancer
      patients; and (2) Examine the effects of a 12-week, home-based walking program on quality of
      life (QOL) and symptoms among pancreatic cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      Among cancer patients, physical activity interventions can lead to improvements in QOL and
      reductions in fatigue and pain. While pancreatic cancer patients may have physical
      restrictions that limit their participation in moderate to high-intensity exercise
      activities, empirical evidence suggests that even low-intensity, home-based walking programs
      can confer benefits for cancer patients. In this pilot study, 50 patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive either the walking intervention program or usual care (UC). Assessments
      of quality of life, distress, and symptom burden will be completed at baseline
      (pre-intervention) and at follow-up (i.e. within 2 weeks post-intervention or approximately
      12-14 weeks post-baseline). Data from the proposed pilot study will inform the development of
      a larger randomized trial designed to improve QOL and reduce morbidity in this patient
      population.

    <description>Intervention patients will receive a 12-week home-based walking program, which includes a personalized instruction booklet and pedometer. The walking program consists of 3 phases and will be individualized for each patient based on their physical condition and baseline assessment. Patients are instructed to walk 3 to 5 times each week at home or other safe environment. Patients will be instructed on a gradual increase in walking time over the course of the intervention.</description>
