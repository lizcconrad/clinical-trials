      This is an open-label, single dose study designed to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety
      of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in subjects with either normal renal function or impaired renal
      function.

      Up to 48 subjects will be selected and enrolled according to the subject selection criteria:
      8 subjects with mild renal impairment (Group 1), 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment
      (Group 2), 8 subjects with severe renal impairment (Group 3), 8 subjects with end stage renal
      disease that are not yet on dialysis (Group 4), 8 healthy subjects with normal renal function

        In addition to the main inclusion criteria above for all subjects, the following criteria
        must be met for subjects with normal renal function enrolled in Group 5:

          -  Judged to be in general good health based upon the results of a medical history,
             physical examination, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

          -  At screening, estimated GFR (by MDRD equation) should be â‰¥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.

        Subject with Renal Impairment

        In addition to the main inclusion criteria for all subjects, the following criteria must be
        met for all subjects with renal impairment enrolled in Groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6:

          -  Judged to be in stable condition and acceptable for study participation based upon the
             results of a medical history, physical examination, laboratory profile and ECG.

          -  Presence of chronic renal impairment as indicated by medical history and a screening
             estimated GFR (by MDRD equation) &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73 m2.

          -  Subjects with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis should have been receiving dialysis for at
             least 1 month.

        Exclusion Criteria: - History of significant sensitivity to any drug.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding female.

          -  Recent (6-month) history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Positive test result for hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M (HAV-IgM), hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab) or HIV antibodies (HIV
             Ab). Negative HIV status will be confirmed at Screening and the results will be
             maintained confidentially by the study site.

          -  Subjects on strict vegetarian diet.
