      Randomized clinical trial among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who present for
      fertility treatment to evaluate the impact of screening for obstructive sleep apnea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' goal is to perform a randomized clinical trial among women with PCOS who
      present for infertility treatment. Our primary outcome is to determine if screening women
      with PCOS, and treating those with confirmed sleep apnea, will lead to more ovulatory cycles.
      Our sub-aims are to describe the rate of OSA and sleep symptoms in patients with PCOS, to see
      if current sleep questionnaires correlate to a diagnostic sleep study, to describe the
      correlation between OSA and biomarkers of glucose homeostasis in women with PCOS, to
      investigate health related quality of life between the groups, to compare perinatal outcomes
      between the groups, and to evaluate the composition of breastmilk among women who choose to
      breastfeed.
