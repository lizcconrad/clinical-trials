      This is a prospective randomized study to assess the efficacy and safety of a single dose of
      cefazolin 2g IV for the prophylaxis of surgical site and pleural space infections during
      medical thoracoscopy.

      Consecutive patients who are planned to undergo a medical thoracoscopy (rigid or semirigid)
      will be enrolled in the study if they satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria. One
      hundred patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either of the following: (a) A
      single dose of intravenous cefazolin 2 gms dissolved in 100 mL of normal saline administered
      over 10 minutes, between 15 and 30 minutes before the incision, OR (b) 100 mL normal saline
      administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes between 15 and 30 minutes before the
      incision. Thoracoscopy will be performed in the bronchoscopy suite on a spontaneously
      breathing subject (fasting for 8 h) under conscious sedation (using midazolam, pentazocine,
      and tramadol) observing complete aseptic precautions.

    <description>A single dose of intravenous cefazolin 2 gms will be administered over 10 minutes, dissolved in 100 mL of normal saline between 15 and 30 minutes before the incision. This will be preceded by an intradermal test dose to check for hypersensitivity to the drug. If hypersensitivity is present, the patient will be administered a single dose of intravenous Clindamycin 900 mg.</description>
