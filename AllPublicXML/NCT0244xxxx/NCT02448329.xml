    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, single center phase II study of AZD1775 in combination with
      paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harboring TP53 mutation as a
      second-line chemotherapy.

      Patients will receive AZD 1775 plus weekly paclitaxel combination regimen. The arm is
      composed of 25 patients.

      AZD1775 225 mg BID q 12 hours (x 5 doses) administered days 1~3 + paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 given
      days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle.

      Tumour evaluation using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 will be conducted at
      screening every 16 weeks until objective disease progression .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AZD1775 is an inhibitor of Wee1, a protein tyrosine kinase. Wee1 phosphorylates and inhibits
      cyclin-dependent kinases 1 (CDK1) and 2 (CDK2), and is involved in regulation of the intra-S
      and G2 cell cycle checkpoints.

      In in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, AZD1775 selectively enhanced chemotherapy induced
      death of cells deficient in p53 signaling. Tumor context-specific sensitization to the DNA
      damaging agents gemcitabine and platinums was observed in TOV21G (ovarian carcinoma) cell
      lines matched for wild type and knock down of p53.
