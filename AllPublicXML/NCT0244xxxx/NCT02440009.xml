  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the addition of itraconazole to glucocorticoids in management of acute
      stages of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Half of the participants will
      receive glucocorticoids while the other half will receive itraconazole and glucocorticoids

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) includes two important
      aspects namely institution of immunosuppressive therapy in the form of glucocorticoids to
      control the immunologic activity, and close monitoring for detection of relapses. Another
      possible target is to use antifungal agents to attenuate the fungal burden secondary to the
      fungal colonization in the airways. Oral corticosteroids are currently the treatment of
      choice for ABPA associated with bronchial asthma. They not only suppress the immune
      hyperfunction but are also anti-inflammatory.

      Itraconazole, an oral triazole with relatively low toxicity, is active against Aspergillus
      spp. in vitro and in vivo. The activity of itraconazole against Aspergillus spp. is more than
      that of ketoconazole. The administration of itraconazole can eliminate Aspergillus in the
      airways and can theoretically reduce the allergic responses in ABPA. We hypothesize that
      itraconazole when given in the acute stages of ABPA will decrease the chances of relapse and
      progression to glucocorticoid-dependent ABPA.
