    <textblock>
      Background: An anatomical reconstruction of ankle congruity is an important prerequisite in
      the operative treatment of acute ankle fractures. But, despite an anatomic reduction,
      patients suffer from residual problems like chronic pain, stiffness, persistent swelling and
      instability after these fractures. There is growing evidence, that this poor outcome is
      related to the concomitant traumatic intraarticular pathology. Therefore, supplementary ankle
      arthroscopy has been proposed in acute ankle fractures as it is a valuable tool to confirm
      the anatomic reposition and to further identify and manage associated intraarticular
      injuries. The arthroscopic treatment of these pathologies might result in a better outcome
      after complex ankle fractures. Nevertheless, until now, the vast majority of ankle fractures
      are managed by open procedures only. Still, indications for arthroscopically assisted open
      reduction and internal fixation (AORIF) are not clearly stated, and the effectiveness of
      AORIF compared with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) has not yet been determined
      for complex ankle fractures. In this context, only a prospective randomized study can
      sufficiently answer these open questions. Therefore, the investigators plan a randomized
      controlled trial intended to report the short-, midterm- and long-term follow-up of patients
      who underwent operative treatment of acute ankle fractures - with and without ankle
      arthroscopy.

      Methods/Study design: The investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial evaluating
      the effect of AORIF compared to ORIF with a sample size of 40 patients per group. The
      investigators include patients with an acute ankle fracture after written informed consent.
      Primary outcome of the investigators' study is the difference of the AOFAS score (American
      Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society) between the intervention (AORIF) and comparison (ORIF)
      group after a follow-up of 2 years. Several secondary outcome parameters will be assessed as
      well. Statistical analysis will be performed using a two-sided Student`s t-test.

      Discussion: Until today, there are only two randomized controlled trials evaluating the
      effect of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) compared to arthroscopically assisted
      open reduction and internal fixation (AORIF). Both studies only included patients with
      isolated fractures of the distal fibula at the level of the syndesmosis. These are the most
      simple fractures that are regularly treated operatively. Both studies documented a high
      incidence of intraarticular disorders in the AORIF group, but only one could show significant
      better results in the AORIF group. Moreover, several other studies could consistently
      demonstrate that the intraarticular damage is even more pronounced the more complex the
      fracture is. Consequently, a more distinctive effect of arthroscopy in complex fractures
      involving two malleoli or more has to be assumed when compared to these simple fractures.

      Acute ankle fractures are one of the leading pathologies disturbing ankle congruence. These
      fractures are extremely common with an incidence of 0.1-0.2% per year. The treatment of acute
      ankle fractures is determined by the classification of the injury based on radiographic
      findings. Operative treatment performing open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is the
      standard of care for unstable or dislocated ankle fractures. Anatomical realignment of the
      joint and restoration of ankle stability are the main goals of the operative treatment. Over
      the last decades the improved functional outcome has emphasized the importance of anatomic
      reconstruction. Nevertheless, successful anatomical reduction does not automatically lead to
      favorable clinical outcome. According to several studies, the mid- and long-term outcome
      following operative treatment of acute ankle fractures is often poor even though anatomical
      reconstruction of the joint has been achieved. Residual problems after acute ankle fractures
      include chronic pain, stiffness, recurrent swelling and instability. These problems occur
      despite the operative restoration of ankle congruence. There is growing evidence that the
      poor outcome might be mostly related to occult articular injuries involving cartilage and
      soft tissue damage. These intraarticular disorders have been shown to negatively affect the
      clinical results, but it is difficult to diagnose these intraarticular pathologies by
      physical examination, standard radiography or even CT-scans. In this context, many authors
      have well documented the value of ankle arthroscopy. Ankle arthroscopy is a standard
      minimally invasive technique that allows direct visualization of intraarticular structures
      without arthrotomy or malleolar osteotomy. In the last decades, it has become a safe and
      effective diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. In acute ankle fractures, arthroscopically
      assisted open reduction and internal fixation (AORIF) allows careful examination of the
      chondral aspects as well as the capsular and intraarticular ligaments. If necessary, the
      traumatic intraarticular pathologies can directly be addressed by removing loose bodies and
      ruptured ligaments extending into the joint, performing chondroplasty or micro fracturing if
      necessary. Furthermore, it allows a confirmation of the anatomic reduction without having any
      evidence that a supplementary ankle arthroscopy in acute ankle fracture treatment leads to a
      higher complication rate.

      Until today, there are only two randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of
      additional ankle arthroscopy. Both studies available comparing ORIF to AORIF included only
      patients with isolated fractures of the distal fibula at the level of the syndesmosis only.
      These are the most simple fractures that are regularly treated operatively. Thodarson et al.
      compared ORIF treatment of distal fibula fractures supplemented with or without ankle
      arthroscopy and found that 8 of 9 patients had articular damage to the talar dome in the
      arthroscopy group. Only minimal arthroscopic treatment was required and no outcome
      differences were noted after a mean follow-up of 21 months. Takao et al. documented an
      osteochondral lesion (OCL) in 74% in the arthroscopic group. In their study, the mean AOFAS
      score was significantly better when patients were treated arthroscopically. Moreover, several
      studies could consistently document, that the intraarticular damage is more pronounced the
      more complex the fracture is. Consequently, one must assume a more distinctive effect of
      arthroscopy in more complex fractures involving two malleoli or more - when compared to
      simple fractures.

      Nevertheless, until now, the vast majority of ankle fractures are managed by open procedures
      only. Still, indications for AORIF are not clearly stated, and the effectiveness of AORIF
      compared with ORIF has not yet been determined for complex ankle fractures where the
      investigators would expect even better results as intraarticular lesions are more common in
      these fracture types. Moreover, the prognostic importance of traumatic articular lesions
      still remains unclear, although several studies suggest such injuries may be the source of
      functional deficits. Nevertheless, this concept seems to be intuitively comprehensible. In
      this context, only a prospective randomized study can sufficiently answer these open
      questions. Therefore, the investigators plan a randomized controlled trial intended to report
      the short-, midterm- and long-term follow-up of patients who underwent operative treatment of
      acute ankle fractures (AO A2, A3, B2, B3, C1-C3) - with and without ankle arthroscopy.

All Patients will be operated following a standardized protocol of our foot and ankle department:
Posterior malleolus: ORIF of the posterior malleolus fractures will be performed using a one-third tubular plate in an antiglide-technique.
Lateral malleolus: If the patients suffer a fracture of the posterior and lateral malleolus, a posterolateral approach will be performed. After posterior fracture fixation a lag screw and a one-third tubular plate will be used laterally. In special cases a locking plate will be used. If the patient only suffers a lateral malleolus fracture, we utilize the standard lateral incision.
Medial malleolus: We perform a curved incision and two cannulated leg screws/tension wiring or locking plate for fixation.
Syndesmotic complex: After all, the stability of the syndesmotic complex is tested and reduction will be performed if necessary.</description>

    <description>Arthroscope AORIF = Arthroscopically assisted open reduction and internal fixation Our standard operative protocol is described above. Intervention: In case of randomization to the AORIF group, the arthroscopic procedure will be performed as the first step during the surgery before internal fixation. No distraction device will be used for the ankle. To avoid lesions of the cartilage and soft tissue, the joint will first be inflated with saline, and the portals will be created by blunt dissection. A 2.7mm, 30° arthroscope will be inserted into the ankle through a standard anteromedial portal. Fluid will be aspirated and the cavity filled with water. Afterwards the standard anterolateral portal will be performed in the same way. A standardized systematic examination as described by Ferkel and Fasulo will be performed to inspect the internal structures. At this stage loose bodies and disrupted ligaments extending into the joint will be removed.</description>

        resolved by consent. Only patients with a maximum interval of two weeks between injury and
        intervention must be included. All patients included must be able to understand the meaning
        of the trial and its consequences. Written informed consent is mandatory for trial
        inclusion. No additional investigation (clinical or radiographic investigation) will take
        place if the patient is included compared to patients who refuse inclusion. A list of
        inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found below. Patients will be excluded in case of
        open fractures or radiographically identified intraarticular lesions. Also, patients with a
