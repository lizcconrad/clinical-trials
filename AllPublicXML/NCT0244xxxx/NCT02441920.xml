  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that is characterized by
      loss of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone, and is a major cause of tooth loss.
      Results from clinical and epidemiological studies have suggested that periodontitis and tooth
      loss are more prevalent in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There is evidence to
      suggest that periodontitis could indeed be a causal factor in the initiation and maintenance
      of the autoimmune inflammatory response that occurs in RA. If so, chronic periodontitis might
      represent an important modifiable risk factor for RA. However, to date longitudinal studies
      on the effect of periodontitis on disease progression in RA are lacking. The aim of the
      present study is to assess the periodontal status of patients enrolled in an established
      longitudinal cohort of RA patients. These data will then be analysed to evaluate whether or
      not periodontal inflammation is related to parameters of rheumatoid arthritis.
