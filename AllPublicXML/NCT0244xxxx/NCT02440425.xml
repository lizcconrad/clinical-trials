  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of Paclitaxel once per week with
      Pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks will help participants with this disease. Researchers want
      to find out the effectiveness of the drug combination to improve the delay of cancer
      progression or death and compare it to historical data for weekly paclitaxel alone, and
      assess safety.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>6-month progression-free survival of the combination of weekly paclitaxel with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). PFS: The length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse. Progressive Disease (PD): Sum of the longest diameters (SLD) increased by at least 20% from the smallest value on study (including baseline, if that is the smallest) The SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Two lesions increasing from 2 mm to 3 mm, for example, does not qualify).</description>

          -  Must have confirmation of the histologic diagnosis of high-grade (grade 2-3)
             epithelial, non-mucinous, non-borderline, ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
             peritoneal carcinoma. May be based on original pathology report or review of original
             slides.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent and authorization

          -  ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent

          -  Disease must have been persistent or have recurred within 6 months of prior platinum
             therapy. Disease may not have progressed during prior platinum therapy (i.e.,
             refractory).

          -  Have measurable disease or detectable (non-measureable) disease

          -  Measurable disease: must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess
             response on this protocol.

          -  Prior Therapy:

               -  Have had one prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen for management of
                  primary disease containing carboplatin, cisplatin, or another organoplatinum
                  compound. This initial treatment may have included intraperitoneal therapy,
                  consolidation, non-cytotoxic agents (biologic/ targeted) or extended therapy
                  administered after surgical or non-surgical assessment. If patients were treated
                  initially with paclitaxel for their primary disease, this can have been given
                  weekly or every 3 weeks. The most recent therapy and any therapies subsequent to
                  initial therapy, however, cannot have contained weekly paclitaxel. If the
                  immediate prior (most recent therapy) is the initial therapy, it may not have
                  been with weekly paclitaxel.

               -  Allowed to receive (not required to receive), 2 additional cytotoxic regimens for
                  management of recurrent or persistent disease, with no more than 1 non-platinum
                  regimen. Treatment with weekly paclitaxel for recurrent or persistent disease is
                  NOT allowed.

               -  Allowed to receive(not required to receive), non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted)
                  therapy as part of their primary treatment regimen. Allowed to receive (not

                  treatment for recurrent or persistent disease and/or as treatment for recurrent
                  or persistent disease. If non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted) therapy is given
                  alone (i.e., not in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy) it will NOT count as
                  a prior regimen.

          -  Have tissue from an archival tissue sample that has been identified and confirmed as
             available for study, or newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion

             hormonal therapy directed at the malignant tumor must be discontinued at least 2 weeks
             prior to registration (continuation of hormone replacement therapy is permitted); Any
             other prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including chemotherapy,
             biologic/targeted and immunologic agents, must be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior
             to registration and at least 3 weeks before day 1 on trial.

          -  Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP): Negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72
             hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is

          -  WOCBP willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain
