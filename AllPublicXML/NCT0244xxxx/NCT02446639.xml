      &quot;Troponin T (TnT) is a component of the contractile apparatus of the striated musculature.
      Although the function of TnT is the same in all striated muscles found in the heart to form a
      TNT (cardiac TnT) differing significantly TnT of the skeletal muscles. Because of its high
      tissue specificity, cardiac TnT is a specific marker and highly sensitive of myocardial
      injury.

      Asymptomatic elevations of troponins is frequently found in patients with chronic renal
      failure in stage V, which present no clinical signs of acute or electrical myocardial injury.

      Many studies have been conducted in recent years to explain the origin and clinical
      significance of this elevation, but the results are controversial: cardiac dysfunction, left
      ventricular hypertrophy or chronic inflammation.

      Besides the effect of the dialysis session was evaluated on this biological parameter in
      different studies which together do not find Impact hemodialysis session on the value of
      troponin Achieving dosages rate hypersensitive serum troponin T in a dialysis population,
      will:

        -  to determine the evolution of TnT in time and what are the characteristics of the
           patients for whom this rate varies

        -  to know what its evolution during the session,

        -  to identify if possible the criteria that are responsible for the variation in the
           direction of increasing and / or its reduction

        -  and to characterize patients whose base rate is higher than the 99 percentile in the
           absence of clinical symptoms which could lead to establish reference population for this
           specific normal values. The Purpose of this study is to evaluate the serum troponin T in
           a hypersensitive dialysis population and verify what is the influence of the
           hemodialysis session, the session parameters and intradialytic events on changes in
           serum troponin T hypersensitive after a hemodialysis session. &quot;

      Current care study, single-center, uncontrolled, no randomised, open and prospective.

      Two hundred fifty patients on hemodialysis and / or peritoneal dialysis for more than 3
      months may be included in the study for a total period of 7 months.

      Hemodialysis patients will be informed at the weekly routine visits. Regarding peritoneal
      dialysis patients, a meeting can be organized with the physician. And the oral agreement of
      the patient will be collected during a second visit or meeting.

      The protocol provides four follow-up visits: at baseline, 4 weeks, 12 and 24 weeks.

      During these visits, the patient will have a clinical examination and a measure of the serum
      troponin T. Blood samples are realized in the usual conditions of the center - for
      hemodialysis patients: midweek as instructed by the usual protocol of the center. - for
      peritoneal dialysis patients: when the monthly routine consultation.
