  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder of unknown cause that affects more
      than a million Americans. It's most prominent pathology is the degeneration of dopaminergic
      neurons in the brain. It is believed that oxidative stress and inflammation play an important
      role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease as well.

      The object of this study is to evaluate whether nutritional supplementation with compounds
      that have been shown to have either anti- inflammatory, or antioxidant effects, might support
      brain function in patients with Parkinson's disease, particularly in regards to the dopamine
      system. Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to receive oral and intravenous n-acetyl
      cysteine (NAC), or standard PD care. This study will utilize Ioflupane (DaTscan) single
      photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to measure dopamine function, magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (MRS) to measure inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, and neurological
      measures to assess clinical symptoms, in patients with PD. Subjects will receive a DaTSCAN
      and MRS initially and after completing the supplement or NAC regimen.

      The study consists of two arms. The first arm of this study will receive intravenous and oral
      NAC, which is a strong antioxidant that increases brain glutathione, which may be beneficial
      in PD. NAC, is the N-acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid, L-cysteine. It
      is a common over-the-counter supplement and also is available as an injectable pharmaceutical
      that protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose. Laboratory studies have displayed
      some benefits to use of NAC, such as its potential to counteract intracellular damage that
      leads to dopaminergic neuron death. It also has the potential to reduce markers of oxidative
      damage, protect against dopamine cell death from MPTP toxicity, and to increase glutathione
      in blood, which might be useful in preventing oxidative damage in PD patients.The second arm
      will be a waitlist control receiving standard PD care. It should be noted that both arms will
      receive standard PD care which will be augmented with NAC.
