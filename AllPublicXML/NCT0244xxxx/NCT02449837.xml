  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the level of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) in
      cancer patients before and after undergoing treatment regimens where the primary treatment
      modality is radiation therapy (XRT). Specifically, there is interest in the change in CTCs
      pre- and post- XRT, both in absolute and relative terms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CTCs measurements will be taken pre- and post-RT treatment. CTCs measurements will also be
      taken during treatment. The CTCs measurements from this study will provide essential
      information for the power and sample size considerations for future translational studies,
      particularly for those looking to identify biomarkers possibly associated with CTCs and tumor
      response activity after XRT, and to adequately power more formal statistical comparisons of
      important associations between CTCs and patient characteristics and outcomes.

             advanced head and neck cancer but no distant metastasis scheduled to receive
