    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if a correlation exists between findings from brain
      imaging studies of the status of the dopamine system in the brain using DaTscan and SPECT
      imaging, clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease, and changes in the structure of the retina
      as detected by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in recently diagnosed and more advanced
      Parkinson's disease patients.

        The study population will be Parkinson's disease patients (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 - 3). One
        study group will be subjects (N = 6) with early PD who will be within 3 years from
        diagnosis and not requiring dopaminergic therapy. These subjects will need to have Unified
        Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores of 10 - 15. The second study group will be
        subjects (N = 6) with more advanced PD and will have had PD for at least 5 years and will
        need to have Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores of &gt; 20.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to give informed consent.

          2. Between the ages of 50-80 years old.

          3. Male or female with idiopathic PD who fulfill UK PD Society brain bank criteria for
             diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

          4. Early stage subjects will need to have Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
             (UPDRS) motor scores of &lt; 10, be within 3 years of diagnosis, and not requiring
             dopaminergic therapy

          5. Later stage subjects will need to have Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor
             scores of &gt; 20 and be &gt; 5 years from diagnosis

          6. If female, one of the following three scenarios must apply:

               -  at least two years post-menopausal

               -  surgically sterile

               -  negative urine pregnancy test, and following a reliable method of birth control
                  (oral contraceptive, intrauterine device, contraceptive implant, barrier, or
                  abstinence) for at least two months prior to entry, and agreeing both to follow a
                  reliable method of birth control, and (if relevant) to desist from breast feeding
                  during, and for two weeks following tracer administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Abrupt onset of Parkinsonism

          2. 'Other Parkinson-like syndromes (e.g. progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system
             atrophy)

          3. Any condition that would preclude successful completion of SPECT scanning

          4. Use of anti-coagulant therapy

          5. Any clinically significant eye disease that would complicate interpretation of OCT
             data

          6. Use of any drugs that would alter or interfere with tracer binding for SPECT imaging
             studies (ex., cocaine, amphetamines, methylphenidate, ephedrine, phentermine,
             bupropion, fentanyl, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).

          7. Known sensitivity to the imaging agent or to Lugol's solution or to potassium
             perchlorate.

          8. History or presence of severe renal disease.
