  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation dermatitis is one of the most common side effects of radiotherapy approximately
      occurring in about 95% of patients receiving radiotherapy . Acute injury due to structural
      tissue damage, generation of free radicals, irreversible double-stranded breaks in nuclear
      and mitochondrial DNA, and initiation of an inflammatory response in the epidermis and dermis
      occurs within hours to weeks after radiation exposure. Radiation dermatitis due to pain and
      discomfort has an adverse impact on the quality of a patient's life.The radiation toxicities
      such as radiation dermatitis encountered in clinical practice are typically managed with a
      variety of topical agents such as water-based moisturizing creams or lotions, topical
      steroids, antiinflammatory emulsions, and wound dressings. Pharmacologic interventions for
      the prevention and treatment of these toxicity can be used to protect skin against radiation
      damage.Currently, there is no standard treatment for the prevention of radiation-induced
      dermatitis with demonstrated effectiveness.The aim of this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the effectiveness of topical doxepin for the
      prevention and management of radiation-induced dermatitis during postoperative radiotherapy
      for breast cancer.

      The patients who have undergone breast surgery and require radiotherapy and fulfill the
      inclusion criteria of the study will be entered the study. All the patients will be treated
      by 3D conformal radiation therapy using CT -based treatment planning and multi leaf linear
      accelerators. The patients will be treated by conventional fractionation regimens to a total
      dose of 5000 cGy (25 fractions of 200 cGy, 5 days per week). Every week the patients will be
      visited by an experienced radiation oncologist and the skin reaction will be determined and
      recorded according to RTOG Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria which scores from 0 to
      4. The patients receive Doxepin cream at the beginning of 5th week of radiotherapy and use it
      for a whole week. After acquiring written permission, the radiotherapy site will be
      photographed at the start and ending of the Doxepin
