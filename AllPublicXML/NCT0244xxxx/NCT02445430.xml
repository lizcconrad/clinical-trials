  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to identify genetic alterations resulting in the development of
      arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the central nervous system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include AVM patients and members of their nuclear family. All patients will
      donate a sample of saliva (5 mL) or blood (10 mL). Basic demographic and clinical parameters
      will be collected, including ethnicity, age at first presentation, symptoms at presentation,
      history of subsequent symptoms, treatment history, Spetzler-Martin AVM grade, medication
      history, and other pertinent medical information. In patients undergoing AVM resection, a
      small sample of the AVM will be collected for concurrent genomic analysis. Family members
      will donate saliva (5mL) and document their relationship to the patient (i.e., parent,
      sibling, child, etcl). Nucleic acids will be isolated from the saliva/blood samples, and
      genetic sequencing will be carried out. When a surgical sample of the AVM is available,
      nucleic acids will be obtained and transcriptome profiling will be performed. Identification
      of genetic alterations common to patients with AVM and not present in samples from parents
      and siblings will greatly aid in identification of pathways associated with AVM formation.
      Candidate sequences will be chosen by differential expression (p&lt;0.05) and fold-changes. Once
      identified, mechanisms for the rapid detection of marker sequences will be developed and
      their predictive value tested in future collections.
