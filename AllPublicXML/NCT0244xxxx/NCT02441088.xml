      Participants in this research study have tumors that express somatostatin receptors such as a
      neuroendocrine tumor, medulloblastoma, meningioma, and neuroblastoma.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine if 90Y-DOTATOC is an effective treatment
      for tumors that express somatostatin receptors and if 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT can measure the
      extent of disease and measure response to this therapy. This research will determine if this
      process called dosimetry is an effective technique to determine how much 90Y-DOTATOC the
      participants can safely receive without damage to their kidneys and bone marrow.

      Goals for this study are to:

        1. Demonstrate safety and efficacy of dosimetry-guided peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT)
           using 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) in patients with neuroendocrine and other
           somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.

        2. Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using
           90Y-DOTATOC.

        3. Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) PET/CT as an accurate technique for
           diagnosis, staging, treatment targeting, and monitoring response to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.

      Approximately 64 people will participate in this study conducted at the University of Iowa.

         11. The effects of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, women and men of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 90Y-DOTATOC is a Class C agent
             with potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

          2. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with 90Y-DOTATOC, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued until 6 weeks after the last administration of study drug.

          3. Surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.

          4. External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of &lt;500 cGy to a single kidney
             or radiation to &lt; 50% of a single kidney is acceptable).

          5. Prior PRRT with 90Y-DOTATOC (TATE) or 177Lu-DOTATOC (TATE) or 131I-MIBG therapy for
             this malignancy.

          6. Another investigational drug within 4 weeks of study drug administration.

          7. Concurrent, malignant disease for which patient is on active therapy.

          8. Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently
             uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to
             complete this protocol.

          9. Any subject for whom, in the opinion of their physician, a 12-hour discontinuation of
             somatostatin analogue therapy represents a health risk. Also subjects who have
             received long-acting somatostatin analogue in the past 28 days or long-acting
             lanreotide within the past 16 weeks are excluded. Subjects may be maintained on short
             acting octreotide during the time from last injection of long-acting somatostatin
             analogue until 12 hrs prior to injection of study drug. Known antibodies to
             Octreotide, Lanreotide, or DOTATOC or history of allergic reactions attributed to
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 90Y-DOTATOC.

         10. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) of study drug administration or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

         11. Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

         12. Subject weighs more than 450 pounds. (Subjects who weigh more than 450 pounds will not
             be able to fit inside the imaging machines).

         13. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (due to cough, severe arthritis,
             etc.).
