  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 1 diabetes aged 15-65 years without major complications will be randomized
      either to usual care or to a structured group education program, with 6 four-hour weekly
      interactive sessions devoted to diabetes management. The principal endpoint will be the
      variation of HbA1c at 12 months from enrolment. Secondary endpoints will include quality of
      life, treatment satisfaction, fear of hypoglycemia, incidence of hypoglycemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The group intervention consists of interactive sessions for groups of 5-7 patients, dealing
      with different aspects of management of type 1 diabetes: insulin therapy and hypoglycemia,
      management of insulin doses, diet, physical exercise, sick days, etc. The intervention is
      designed for the acquisition of specific skills of self-management. This intervention is
      provided by a team including physicians, dietitians, and nurses.

      The control group will receive individual education during routine clinic visits, following
      usual care, complying with the recommendations of national (Italian) guidelines.

      HbA1c will be assessed every three months for all the duration of the study. The principal
      endpoint will be variation from baseline of HbA1c at 12 weeks from the beginning of the
      intervention.
