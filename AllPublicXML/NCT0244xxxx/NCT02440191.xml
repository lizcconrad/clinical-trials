  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been not clinically determined whether TomoDirect was dosimetrically better than
      3D-CRT for Asian patients with early breast cancer. Therefore, the objective of this study
      was to compare dosimetric parameters of TomoDirect and 3D-CRT in early breast cancer patients
      of an Asian cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In breast cancer patients, helical TomoTherapy is not a suitable option since the gantry
      continuously rotates around the patient, and this technique can deliver low dose radiation to
      lungs that is associated with an occurrence of radiation pneumonitis. To avoid this
      inefficiency of beam usage, a TomoDirect option using static gantry positions combined with
      simultaneous couch translation and dynamic collimator modulation has been developed. In a
      pilot study, TomoDirect seemed particularly well suited for postoperative irradiation in
      breast cancer patients. TomoDirect achieved an optimal target volume coverage and coincident
      adequate normal tissue sparing in a dosimetric study. Clinical studies of TomoDirect in
      breast cancer patients are scarce and have been assessed only in small and retrospective
      series. Thus, we undertook a prospective study on the technical feasibility and toxicity of
      TomoDirect in breast cancer patients who received postoperative radiotherapy.
