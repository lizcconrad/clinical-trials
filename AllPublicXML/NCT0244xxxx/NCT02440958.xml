  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is the fourth cause of death in the Western world. Surgery
      remains the only treatment offering an advantage in terms of overall survival (5-year
      survival range, 15-25%), but unfortunately only 10-20% of patients present resectable disease
      at the time of diagnosis. Since the approval of gemcitabine as a standard treatment for
      advanced pancreatic patients, no drug or combination of drugs has significantly improved the
      prognosis. Recently, as compared with gemcitabine, FOLFIRINOX was associated with a survival
      advantage (11.1 vs 6.8 months), but had increased toxicity. In some retrospective studies,
      modified FOLFIRINOX regimen (60/120 mg/m2 of oxaliplatin and irinotecan) has an improved
      safety profile in digestive malignancies. The purpose of this phase II multicenter study was
      to investigate the efficacy and safety in patients with pancreatic cancer who progressed in
      gemcitabine-based first line chemotherapy.

    <description>Modified FOLFIRINOX regimen consisted of oxaliplatin at a dose of 60 mg per square meter, given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, after 60 minutes, of irinotecan at a dose of 120 mg per square meter, given as a 90-minute intravenous infusion, immediately followed by leucovorin at a dose of 400 mg per square meter, given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion through a Y-connector. This treatment was immediately followed by fluorouracil at a dose of 400 mg per square meter, administered by intravenous bolus, followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of 2400 mg per square meter over a 46-hour period every 2 weeks</description>
