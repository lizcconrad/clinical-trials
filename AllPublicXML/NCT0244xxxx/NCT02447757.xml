  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retrospective observational study to determine the efficacy of remifentanil during the
      delivery. Authors will search the data in period between 2010 and 2014 in cohort of 100
      parturients and obtain data of analgesic efficacy (VAS score after remifentanil analgesia
      induction) and parturients satisfaction with the method.

    <textblock>
      In retrospective observational study will authors search the documentation of parturients.
      The cohort size is estimated to 100 subjects, in period between 2010-2014. Excluded will be
      all patients who did not signed the informed consent for processing with their medical
      data.The main aim is to evaluate the efficacy of the remifentanil analgesia in parturients in
      the first phase of delivery.

      The analgesic efficacy will be evaluated by the change in VAS (visual analogue scale) score
      after induction of remifentanil analgesia Satisfaction will be evaluated by the questionary.
