      This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of CD19 Chimeric
      Antigen Receptor (CAR) redirected autologous T-cells in children with high risk, relapsed
      CD19+ haematological malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells
      (CD19 CAR T-cells) in children and young adults (age &lt;24 years) with high risk, relapsed
      CD19+ haematological malignancies (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma).
      Following informed consent and registration to the trial, patients will undergo an
      unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD19 CAR T-cells. Patients will receive
      the CD19CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the
      safety, efficacy and duration of response of the CD19 CAR T-cells in children with high risk
      relapsed CD19+ malignancies.
