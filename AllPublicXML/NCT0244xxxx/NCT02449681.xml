  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the safety and activity of TH-4000 (Tarloxotinib),
      a hypoxia-activated prodrug in participants with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck or skin.

    <textblock>
      An open label, parallel-group, multi-center Phase 2 study in which the pharmacokinetics,
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of TH-4000 (Tarloxotinib) will be assessed in participants
      with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck or skin.

      Hypoxia PET scans will be obtained in select centers to analyze potential predictors of tumor
      response.
