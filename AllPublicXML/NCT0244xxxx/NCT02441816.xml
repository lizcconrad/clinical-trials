    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess a new treatment pattern for aflibercept. The aim is to
      achieve and maintain the best benefit of visual function and avoid unnecessary hospital
      visits.

      The hypothesis to be tested is whether intravitreous aflibercept given in an 8 week cycle of
      treatment in year 1 and a capped treat and extend treatment paradigm in year 2 can lead to
      improved vision and reading speed in eyes with active wet AMD over 2 years while reducing
      hospital visits.

    <description>The intravitreal dose of Eylea will be 2mg (in 0.05ml) per injection. The medication will be supplied in single use vials. Given monthly for 3 months and then every 8 weeks in the first year of treatment before applying a treat and extend paradigm to patient visits in year 2. This is an open-label study.</description>

    <description>In year 2 of the study a treat and extend protocol will be applied, if a patient has signs of disease activity (eg macular fluid on SDOCT) they will be brought back at 8 weeks after the visit and given an intravitreous injection. They will then be reviewed 8 weeks post treatment for a further treatment with follow-up and treatment interval extended to 10 weeks if the disease is quiescent (if no macular fluid at the subsequent visit the patient could be extended to 12 weeks interval with treatment).</description>

          -  Any concurrent intraocular condition in either eye (e.g., cataract or diabetic
             retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either require medical or
             surgical intervention during the 2 year follow-up period to prevent or treat visual
             loss that might result from that condition, or, if allowed to progress untreated,
             could likely contribute to loss of at least 2 Snellen equivalent lines of best
             corrected visual acuity over the 2 year follow-up period.

             pressure &gt;25 mmHg despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication)

          -  Inability to be photographed or to document CNV (eg due to allergy to fluorescein dye,
