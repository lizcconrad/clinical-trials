    <textblock>
      The purpose of thus study is to assess the feasibility and inform the planning of a proposed
      definitive randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of sealing
      permanent molars in children requiring caries related extractions under a chair General
      Anaesthetic.

    <description>All 'sealable' permanent molars will be sealed: Occlusal fissures and where appropriate, buccal pits (on lower molars) and palatal pits (on upper molars) will be sealed.
If patient compliance is adequate, a resin based sealant will be used as the first choice material. The tooth is thoroughly cleaned, prepared with a special solution, and dried. The liquid sealant is then applied and allowed to set hard.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria

          -  Children that are to have extraction of at least one carious tooth under a chair
             General Anaesthetic at Birmingham Dental Hospital

          -  Birmingham residents (as indicated by post code of home address)

          -  Be aged 5 to 15 years

          -  Be co-operative to a clinical dental examination

          -  Present with at least one permanent molar tooth that is 'sound and sealable'

          -  Be accompanied by an adult that has legal capacity to give informed consent

        Exclusion criteria

        Patients who at the pre-General Anaesthetic assessment visit present with:

          -  Signs of a systemic illness (e.g. coughs, 'colds', chicken pox) that might preclude
             placement of sealants

          -  Oral symptoms (e.g. pain, swelling) that would preclude sealant placement

          -  Parents unable to confirm (with a reasonable degree of certainty) that they would be
             contactable and able to attend for review during the 2 years duration of the study
             (e.g. because of plans to move)
