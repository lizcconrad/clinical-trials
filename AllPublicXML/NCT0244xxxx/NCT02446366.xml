      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of hypofractionated
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating patients with prostate cancer that was
      removed by surgery. Hypofractionated SBRT delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a
      shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and may have fewer side effects than
      standard radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine maximum tolerated dose-per-fraction for SBRT to the prostate fossa following
      prostatectomy based on acute toxicity (&lt; 90 days).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the acute (&lt; 90 days) toxicities and adverse events associated with
      hypofractionated SBRT when administered to the prostate bed in the post-prostatectomy
      setting.

      II. To describe the late (&gt; 90 days from treatment) toxicities and adverse events associated
      with hypofractionated SBRT when administered to the prostate bed in the post-prostatectomy
      setting.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the patient-reported toxicity/quality of life (QOL) following hypofractionated
      SBRT treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo 5, 10, or 15 fractions of hypofractionated SBRT daily over 1-3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 6, and 13 weeks and then
      at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months.

    <description>Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose tested in which none or only one patient experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT) attributable to the radiation therapy when 12 patients were treated at that dose and are evaluable for toxicity and is one dose level below the lowest dose level tested where two or more patients experienced radiation associated DLT. All toxicities and side effects of all patients who start SBRT will be recorded and summarized.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated primarily with radical prostatectomy

               -  Any type of radical prostatectomy is permitted including retropubic, perineal,
                  laparoscopic or robotically assisted; there is no time limit for the date of
                  radical prostatectomy

          -  One of the following pathologic classifications

               -  T3N0 disease with or without a positive surgical margin or
