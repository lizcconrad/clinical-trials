  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate that improvements in identification of social clues (and
      improvement of overall social behaviour) in subjects with ASD can be achieved using social
      games together with a BCI setup.

      The primary goal is to ensure increased rate of responses to joint attention cues.

      Intervention Type is a Device (brain computer interface using EEG). Structure: (1) initial
      eligibility screening (within 1 week after admission), (2) pre-intervention (first week of
      study, baseline outcome measures and additional evaluations), (3) intervention process (16
      weeks), (4) post-intervention (outcome measures and additional evaluations), and (5)
      follow-up (outcome measures at 6 months).

      Clinical research has demonstrated that ASD children have deficits in the interpretation of
      others intentions from gaze-direction or other social attention cues (Baron-Cohen, Baldwin, &amp;
      Crowson, 1997).

      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether a brain computer interface (BCI) using
      electroencephalographic (EEG) signals can be used to train social cognition skills (in
      particular interpretation of gaze direction pointing to objects of interest) in ASD patients
      and whether this improves clinical symptoms.

      The intervention comprehends seven BCI sessions spread over four months. The first four
      sessions are planned to occur weekly, and the rest monthly. In each session, the subject is
      asked to identify objects of interest based on the gaze direction of an avatar. The subject
      response is interpreted from the EEG signal (using the P300 component, as established in our
      previous work).

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The group will be evaluated in the pre and post evaluation time with this test. We will use a new task/realistic game that will challenge the detection of initiation of joint attention cues (from avatars - gaze or pointing). The number of correct responses (to particular objects and not to non-object parts of the scene, will be recorded). We will also record incorrect responses to non-pointing body gestures.
Participants will be challenged with about 20 events per minute (one every three seconds), of variable degree of difficulty. Given that the experiment lasts 10 minutes, and some events are control measures, we will have a total of 150 test events and 50 control events.</description>
