      This phase Ib combination study is being conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of
      radium Ra 223 dichloride in combination with paclitaxel in cancer subjects with bone lesions
      with special focus on Grade 3/4 incidence of neutro- and/or thrombocytopenia and exploration
      of the mode of interaction (i.e. additive or synergistic interaction) between the selected
      chemotherapy and radium Ra 223 dichloride with regard to myelosuppression.

          -  Subjects diagnosed with histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant solid
             tumors and at least two according bone lesions. A standard of practice bone scan for
             the documentation of at least 2 bone lesions can be used as long as it is within 3
             months of planned start of treatment. If no bone scan within a 3 month window is
             available, then technetium 99m or NaF PET bone scan will be obtained at screening
             (within 28 days of planned start of study drug)

          -  Eligible to treatment with paclitaxel as single agent, following the assessment of the
             investigator. If treatment with paclitaxel has already been initiated before signing
             the informed consent, patients will not be eligible.

          -  For women: documentation of menopausal status: pre menopausal or post menopausal
             subjects. Post menopausal status is defined either by: one year or more of amenorrhea
             in the absence of other biological or physiological causes, or surgical menopause with
             bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  Women and men of reproductive potential must agree to use adequate contraception when
             sexually active. This applies for the time period between signing of the informed
             consent form and for 6 months after the last radium Ra 223 dichloride administration.
             These procedures should be documented in source documents, the investigator or a
             designated associate is requested to advise the subject on how to achieve birth
             control.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a serum pregnancy test performed within 7
             days before start of study treatment, and a negative result must be documented before
             start of study treatment

          -  Life expectancy of at least 16 weeks

          -  Adequate bone marrow function assessed within 7 days of starting the study treatment,
             judged by the following laboratory values:

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100.000/cubic millimeters (mm3), within 7 days of starting the
                  study treatment AND

               -  Hemoglobin (HB) ≥ 9.0g/dl, within 7 days of starting the study treatment AND

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm3 within 7 days of starting the study
                  treatment

          -  Adequate liver function assessed within 7 days of starting the study treatment, judged
             by the following laboratory values:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal range (ULN) (except for
                  subjects with documented Gilbert's disease) AND

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN
                  (≤5 x ULN for subjects whose cancer involves their liver including liver
                  metastasis) within 7 days of starting the study treatment AND

               -  Albumin &gt; 30 g/L within 7 days of starting the study treatment

          -  International normalized ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or
             activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless receiving treatment
             with therapeutic anticoagulation. Patients being treated with anticoagulant, e.g.
             heparin, will be allowed to participate provided no prior evidence of an underlying
             abnormality in these parameters exists and INR of the patient is &lt; 3. Close monitoring
             of at least weekly evaluations will be performed until INR and PTT are stable based on
             a pre-dose measurement as defined by the local standard of care If patients are on
             newer generation therapeutic blood thinning agents without the requirement of
             monitoring (e.g. Xarelto, Dabigatran), patients are eligible and management (e.g.
             discontinuation of the anticoagulant) will be handled by good medical practice
             standards under direction of the investigator
