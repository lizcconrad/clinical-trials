  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the continuous addition of entacapone to infused levodopa and carbidopa
      on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). All
      patients will receive both study drugs, i.e. TRIGEL (levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone) and
      Duodopa (levodopa and carbidopa), in randomized order.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intestinal infusion of Duodopa (levodopa and carbidopa) provides faster absorption,
      comparable levodopa bioavailability and significantly reduced intra-patient variability in
      levodopa concentrations relative to oral administration. TRIGEL also contains a third
      ingredient, entacapone. In tablet form, entacapone is shown to improve the bioavailability of
      levodopa and might extend the half-life of levodopa, avoiding deep troughs in levodopa plasma
      levels, and providing more continuous delivery of levodopa to the brain.

      The intention with the study is to confirm that TRIGEL administration increases the area
      under the curve (AUC) for levodopa by combining levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone and
      thereby lower the daily levodopa dose needed. It is expected that TRIGEL administration will
      result in a similar intra-patient variability in plasma levodopa concentrations as Duodopa
      during continuous administration.

    <description>Dyskinesia and parkinsonism symptoms were evaluated throughout the study period as an assessment of the clinical response. To assess the ON/OFF effect the Treatment Response Scale (TRS) was used. The TRS ranges from -3 (severe &quot;OFF&quot;) to +3 (&quot;ON&quot; with severe dyskinesia). Results from the TRS recordings are presented as the mean percentage of time patients were in functional ON state (TRS: -1 to +1) during the time interval 3-14 h.</description>

Both TRIGEL and Duodopa treatment consists of 3 individually adjusted and pre-defined doses: a morning dose, a continuous 14 h infusion, and extra bolus doses (if required).
All TRIGEL doses correspond to 80% of the pre-study individually optimised doses of Duodopa. All Duodopa doses correspond to 100% of the pre-study individually optimized doses of Duodopa.
Administration is done through duodenal or upper jejunal infusion via the patient's permanently inserted gastrojejunostomy tube by means of an ambulatory infusion pump.</description>

All patients received TRIGEL and Duodopa treatment on two consecutive days in the study.
Both TRIGEL and Duodopa were administered during 14 h in total. Each treatment consisted of three individually adjusted and pre-defined doses: a morning dose, a continuous administration, and extra doses (if required).
The TRIGEL doses corresponded to 80% of the pre-study individually optimized doses of Duodopa in the first cohort of 5 patients. After the first cohort, a pre-planned interim analysis was performed. It was decided that the morning dose would be adjusted from 80% to 90% of the corresponding Duodopa dose for the second cohort. No other changes to the dosage regimens were made.</description>

To show non-inferiority of TRIGEL over Duodopa, the lower limit of the two-sided CI for the treatment ratio had to be above the chosen non-inferiority margin of 0.9. If non-inferiority was shown, analysis continued with test of superiority.

        <title>Treatment Response Scale (ON/OFF Effect) - Mean % of Time Patients Were in Functional ON State During 3-14 h</title>
        <description>Dyskinesia and parkinsonism symptoms were evaluated throughout the study period as an assessment of the clinical response. To assess the ON/OFF effect the Treatment Response Scale (TRS) was used. The TRS ranges from -3 (severe “OFF”) to +3 (“ON” with severe dyskinesia). Results from the TRS recordings are presented as the mean percentage of time patients were in functional ON state (TRS: -1 to +1) during the time interval 3-14 h.</description>
        <time_frame>TRS assessments were made every 30 minutes from start of study drug administration until 3 h, every hour between 3 and 14 h and every 30 minutes between 14 and 17 h.</time_frame>

            <description>TRIGEL, intestinal gel (20 mg/mL levodopa, 5 mg/mL carbidopa monohydrate, and 20 mg/mL entacapone).
All patients received TRIGEL and Duodopa treatment on two consecutive days in the study.
Both TRIGEL and Duodopa were administered during 14 h in total. Each treatment consisted of three individually adjusted and pre-defined doses: a morning dose, a continuous administration, and extra doses (if required).
The TRIGEL doses corresponded to 80% of the pre-study individually optimized doses of Duodopa in the first cohort of 5 patients. After the first cohort, a pre-planned interim analysis was performed. It was decided that the morning dose would be adjusted from 80% to 90% of the corresponding Duodopa dose for the second cohort. No other changes to the dosage regimens were made.</description>
