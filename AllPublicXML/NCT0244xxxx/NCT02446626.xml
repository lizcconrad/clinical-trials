      Background:

      The most common tick-borne illness in the United States, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia
      burgdorferi bacteria that are transmitted to people by Ixodes scapularis ticks. Most cases of
      Lyme disease are cured by antibiotics, but some patients continue to experience symptoms
      despite the absence of detectable Lyme bacteria. Xenodiagnosis uses a vector to detect the
      presence of a disease-causing microbe.. Researchers will use live, laboratory-bred ticks to
      see if Lyme disease bacteria can be detected in people after completing antibiotic therapy
      and if that is more common in people who continue to experience symptoms such as fatigue and
      joint pain.

      &lt;TAB&gt;

      Objectives:

      - To see if ticks can be used to detect B. burgdorferi in people who have had Lyme disease
      and received antibiotic therapy and if it correlates with persistent symptoms.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adults at least 18 years old who have:

        -  Untreated erythema migrans (the Lyme disease rash); OR

        -  Untreated Lyme arthritis; OR

        -  Continuing symptoms after treatment for Lyme disease; OR

        -  Had Lyme disease and antibiotic treatment within the past 12 months.

        -  Healthy volunteers

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

        -  Visit 1:

        -  Blood and urine tests, health questionnaire.

        -  Up to 30 laboratory-bred, pathogen-free, larval ticks (each smaller than a poppy seed)
           will be placed under a dressing.

        -  Participants may have two small biopsies of skin .

        -  4 6 days later, Visit 2:

        -  Dressing will be removed and ticks will be collected.

        -  Participants will answer symptom questions.

        -  If many ticks are still attached, participants will have to come back the next day. If
           not enough ticks feed successfully, the procedure may be repeated.

        -  Participants will keep a diary of symptoms for 30 days. Over 3 months, they will be
           return to the clinic 3 times to see how they feel and answer questionnaires. Test
           results will be discussed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lyme disease is the most common vector borne disease in the United States. Although
      antibiotic therapy is clinically effective in treating the symptoms of Lyme disease for most
      patients early in the course of disease, a significant number of patients who receive therapy
      report persistent symptoms. The cause of persistent symptoms after antibiotic therapy for
      Lyme disease is an area of great controversy. Recent studies have shown that the organism
      (Borrelia burgdorferi) may persist in animals after antibiotic therapy and can be detected by
      using the natural tick vector (Ixodes scapularis) to acquire the organism through feeding
      (xenodiagnosis). Whether this occurs in humans is unknown. Currently available tests for
      human Lyme disease do not allow determination of persistent infection after antibiotic
      therapy.

      We performed the first study of the use of I. scapularis larva for the xenodiagnosis of B.
      burgdorferi infection in humans. Our pilot study showed that xenodiagnosis was well tolerated
      with no severe adverse events (AEs). The most common AE was mild itching at the site. In this
      small pilot study, xenodiagnosis for B. burgdorferi was positive in 2 participants and
      indeterminate in 2 participants. Further studies are needed to determine the sensitivity of
      xenodiagnosis in evaluating the infection status of Lyme disease patients.

      In this proposal, we want to further investigate the utility of xenodiagnosis for identifying
      persistence of infection with B. burgdorferi in treated human Lyme disease. Our objectives
      include assessing the link between detection of B. burgdorferi by xenodiagnosis and
      persistence of symptoms in patients diagnosed with Lyme disease, within 1 year, post therapy;
      compare the rate of detection of B. burgdorferi by xenodiagnosis after therapy in
      participants with posttreatment Lyme disease symptoms; identify subject characteristics
      related to the likelihood of detecting B. burgdorferi by xenodiagnosis including: time from
      infection, time between infection and therapy, time from therapy; and continue to assess the
      safety of xenodiagnosis in humans.

      The results of study have the potential to resolve this long-standing controversy in Lyme
      disease pathogenesis. While xenodiagnosis is unlikely to be widely used in clinical practice
      due to the labor intensity and speed of testing, if our study shows a linkage between
      positive xenodiagnostic testing and persistence of symptoms after B. burgdorferi infection,
      it may prove to be a useful tool for testing new strategies for treatment and for correlation
      with more generally applicable diagnostic markers. Understanding the pathogenesis of
      persistent symptoms following Lyme disease, and identifying reliable diagnostic tests for
      determining the success of antibiotic therapy, is critical to the medical management of these
      patients.

             the end of the therapy and the xenodiagnostic procedure.

          4. Antibiotic treatment fulfills the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines
             for the recommended therapy for Lyme disease

        PATIENTS WITH POST-LYME DISEASE COMPLAINTS AT LEAST 12 MONTHS FROM INITIAL TREATMENT (N=40)

          1. Age 18 or older

          2. Diagnosed with confirmed or probable Lyme disease fulfilling the case definition of
             Lyme disease by the CDC
             (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/lyme-disease/case-definition/2017/)

          3. Received recommended antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease 5 at least 12 months between
             the end of the initial antibiotic therapy and the xenodiagnostic procedure.

          4. Persistent or recurrent symptoms that began or worsened within 6 months of the
             diagnosis and treatment for Lyme disease.

        ACUTE EM (N=40)

          1. Age 18 or older.

          2. EM diagnosed by the study physician.

          3. Receiving antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease for less than 48 hours.

        LYME ARTHRITIS (N=40)

          1. Age 18 or older

          2. Lyme arthritis and have not received antibiotic therapy for the disease.

        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (N=20)

          1. Age 18 or older

          2. No prior history of Lyme disease

          3. Negative whole cell ELISA or C6-based antibody test for Lyme disease

        Patients with recently diagnosed (acute) EM (within 48 hours of starting antibiotic
        therapy) and patients with untreated Lyme arthritis will be recruited in an attempt to
        increase the chances of finding a positive result by xenodiagnosis (an attempt of a
        positive control ) While patients with acute untreated EM would be the best positive
        control group, it would be unethical to withhold therapy in these patients for the few days
        required for tick feeding, due to the risk of dissemination of the organism and possible
        morbidity. Patients with untreated Lyme arthritis will be recruited to establish whether
        xenodiagnosis can be used to identify infection in late stage Lyme patients where the
        bacterium is known to be present. These patients have been infected for months and will not
        be harmed for delaying therapy for a few days. Lyme arthritis is a late manifestation of B.
        burgdorferi infection, and hematogenous dissemination already occurred at this late stage.
        Studies have shown that the presence or absence of previous antibiotic treatment is more
        predictive than the duration of untreated arthritis for the success of antibiotic therapy
        in Lyme arthritis. Similarly, patients who just started therapy for EM may still have live
        Borrelia in the skin and xenodiagnosis may be able to recover the bacteria (but culture of
        skin biopsies from patients with EM become negative very quickly - within one dose - on
        antibiotic therapy).

        While treatment for Lyme disease will not be offered under this protocol, it may be
        available via different clinical research protocols or regular medical care at the study
        site. If not, treatment will be prescribed by the patient s primary care. For patients with
        untreated early Lyme disease (erythema migrans), antibiotics can be started at the same day
        of tick placement. For patients with untreated Lyme arthritis, antibiotics can be started
        after collection of xenodiagnostic ticks (usually 4-5 days, up to 7 days). For patients
        with Lyme arthritis, if less than 14 ticks fed successfully and if the participant agrees,
        antibiotic treatment can be delayed until after the repeat procedure.

        Patients with acute EM and untreated Lyme arthritis will be able to re-enroll as Patients
        with Lyme disease, post-therapy. Therefore, in case of positive results, we will be able to
        compare between the procedures.

        Negative control patients will include healthy volunteers from Lyme endemic areas who have
        never been diagnosed with Lyme disease and have a negative B. burgdorferi ELISA and C6
        antibody titer.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. No antibiotic therapy active against Lyme disease in the previous 3 months (except
             patients with acute EM). Prophylaxis with a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg is not
             an exclusion.

          2. History of allergy to surgical tape or dressing.

          3. History of severe reactions to tick bites (granuloma or systemic reactions).

          5. Pregnancy or lactation.

          6. Unwillingness to use an effective method of birth control for the duration of
             participation in the study (women of child-bearing potential only) and for at least 3
             months following the last tick placement.

          7. Use of investigational therapy and devices during the time of the study and/or in the
             month prior to signing the informed consent.

          8. Active severe skin disease, uncontrolled diabetes, cancer other than non-melanoma skin
             cancers, autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, or history of HIV,
             chronic viral hepatitis, or syphilis.

          9. Oral or IV steroids in the previous 2 weeks (topical, nasal, inhaled, intra-articular,
             and replacement doses of steroids are not exclusions).

         10. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make the patient
             unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the patient participating in and
             completing the study.

         11. Refusal to participate in specimen collection and storage for future study related
             use.

        EXCLUSION FROM SKIN BIOPSY PART OF THE PROTOCOL

          1. History of forming large thick scars (keloids) after skin injuries or surgery.

          2. History of excessive bleeding after cuts or procedures.
