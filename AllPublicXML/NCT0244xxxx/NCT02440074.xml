      This trial pretends to validate for clinical use a bioengineered product composed of
      mesenchymal stem cells produced by the Instituto de Biologia y Genetica Molecular (IBGM),
      Valladolid (MSV, which have already been approved by the Spanish Regulatory Agency for three
      previous clinical trials) and a cross-linked matrix of autologous plasma patented by The
      Blood and Tissue Bank of Asturias (WO2008/ 119855) for bone maxillary cysts refilling. These
      two groups collaborate in the present project with the team of Maxillofacial Surgery of the
      Hospital Universitario del RÃ­o Hortega, who leads the clinical trial and deals with the
      medical aspects. The proposed trial is based on positive results obtained in previous animal
      studies performed by the present multidisciplinary team. A phase I / II clinical trial with
      10 patients suffering from bone cysts in the maxillofacial region is proposed. Autologous
      mesenchymal stem cells isolated from a bone marrow sample will be seeded in the autologous
      plasma matrix and cultivated for 3 weeks. At this time, the cyst will be removed by surgery
      and the cavity filled with the protein matrix containing the mesenchymal cells. Follow up
      tests will be conducted at 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the evolution of the cavity by
      panoramic radiography and computerized tomography scan.

      The proposed test is based on previous animal experiments with positive results by the
      multidisciplinary team applicant, whose results are presented in paragraph 2.6 (group results
      Valladolid) and Annex I (group results Oviedo).

      The investigators propose phase I-II trial with 10 patients with a common condition and
      difficult to solve volumetric regeneration therapies, such as bone cysts in the maxillofacial
      region.

      Autologous mesenchymal cells isolated from a sample obtained from the cancellous bone of the
      tuberosity intraoral mandibular later and after expansion, will be conveyed in the matrix of
      autologous serum. The total process takes 6-8 weeks. After this time, perform the osteotomy
      and enucleation of the cyst under local anesthesia and the residual cavity is filled with
      bioimplant containing the MSV-H.

      Once the bioimplant, there will be clinical controls at 2 weeks, 2 and 6 months, to follow
      the evolution of regeneration by bone cavity in panoramic radiograph and CT scan.

      This project proposes a novel approach to therapy twice, combining a tissue engineering
      protocol (bioimplant) consisting of autologous mesenchymal cells have already been approved
      by the unit cell production of Valladolid (MSV-H), and a new protein matrix obtained
      autologous serum crosslinked in order to stimulate the regenerative capacity of maxillary
      cystic bone defects.
