      The study investigates the effect of liquid food on the intake of energy and protein compared
      to solid food. One group will receive dietary counselling in fulfilling their need for energy
      and protein from liquid food and the other group from solid food.

      The study investigates the effect of liquid food on the intake of energy and protein compared
      to solid food. One group will receive dietary counselling in fulfilling their need for energy
      and protein from liquid food and the other group from solid food. Both groups need to
      register their dietary intake in a period of 14 days and will be weighed three times during
      the intervention. At the end of the intervention they need to fill out a questionnaire.
