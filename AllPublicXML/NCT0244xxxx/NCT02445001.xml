      Instead of the usual procedure of injecting ICG dye directly into an arm vein, now the dye
      can be placed inside of RBCs. When a small volume of the RBC's with the dye is injected into
      a person's arm, the individual RBCs can be seen as they flow through the retinal blood
      vessels.

      Capillary erythrocyte movement throughout the entire human macula can be observed routinely
      for periods up to 20 minutes by autologous re-injection of a small volume (about 1 mL) of
      indocyanine green (ICG)-loaded erythrocytes, making possible for the first time
      quantification of blood flow in individual capillaries, including abnormal structures like
      choroidal neovascularization (CNV), and it makes possible characterization of vasomotion in
      ocular vasculatures.

    <description>For each subject, on the morning of the day angiography was scheduled, or no longer than 4 days prior to angiography, 9 ml of blood will be withdrawn from an antecubital vein. Using sterile procedures, erythrocyte ghosts produced from the blood will be loaded with ICG dye (for the diagnostic part of the study) or with ICG and one of several drugs (for the therapeutic part of the study) by the following procedure, which requires about 2 hours and yields approximately 1 ml of packed cells (80% Ht) that, after microscopic examination, are ready for autologous re-injection</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A male or female, of any race who is at least 40 years of age and has clinical signs
             of CNV or exudative manifestations of AMD, has clinical signs of DR, or clinical signs
             of retinal occlusive disease.

             classic or occult and has dimensions less than 25.0 mm2 as measured on the sodium
             fluorescein angiogram (SFA).

             avascular zone (FAZ).

          4. Analysis of highspeed ICGA must show one or more welldefined feeder vessel.

          5. Patient must have best corrected visual acuity based on the ETDRS chart between 20/40
             and 20/320 in the study eye.

             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. CNV secondary to any cause other than AMD or DR.

          2. Patient with significantly compromised visual acuity in the study eye due to
             concomitant ocular conditions.

          3. Patient participating in any other investigational drug study.

          4. Patient with significant liver disease or uremia.

          5. Patient with known adverse reaction to indocyanine green or iodine.
