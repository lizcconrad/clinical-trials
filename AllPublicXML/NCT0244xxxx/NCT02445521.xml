      The objective of this study is to test four home phenylalanine monitoring prototype devices,
      selected out of a pool of candidates by the National PKU Alliance Scientific Committee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A real time, point-of-care and home phenylalanine monitoring system would provide patients
      with quick results and feedback. Home monitoring devices' phenylalanine measurements will be
      compared to the current gold-standard measurement of phenylalanine (plasma concentration) in
      four subjects with PKU and one control subject. The study will enroll subjects with different
      baseline phenylalanine concentrations (i.e., patients with poor to good metabolic control,
      assessed by comparing current phenylalanine concentrations to established treatment ranges).

      For each prototype device, three separate measurements of phenylalanine per subject will be
      performed. Three prototype devices require whole blood, thus 1 teaspoon (approximately 4mL)
      of whole blood will be collected through venipuncture and blood spots will be used to conduct
      tests. One prototype requires capillary blood to be collected through a fingerstick, and will
      require three blood spots from the stick. A single plasma amino acid analysis for each
      participant will also be performed using leftover whole blood from the 4mL blood draw through
      quantitative ion exchange chromatography, reported as micromoles/L.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Phenylalanine values for each of the three runs on each device for the same individual will be compared. Each PKU subject will be assessed separately to assess the reliability of each device since the subjects will have a range of phenylalanine concentrations.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Average phenylalanine values measured by the four tests of each device in each subject will be calculated. Mean concentrations for each device will be compared to the control (gold standard measure of plasma phenylalanine).</description>

        Control will be recruited by distributing an email to all staff on the Emory Genetics
        Clinic listserv to solicit a volunteer to provide 4ml of whole blood only. Respondents who
        are within two years of age and the same gender of at least one of the PKU subjects will be
        considered eligible. Remaining subjects will be recruited through Emory Genetics Clinic and
        possibly through the Emory Metabolic Nutrition Program's Annual Metabolic Camp.
