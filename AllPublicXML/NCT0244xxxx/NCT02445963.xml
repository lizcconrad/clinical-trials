  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, dose-escalating Phase 1 investigation of S. flexneri 2a
      InvaplexAR vaccine. A total of up to 40 subjects will receive one of four S. flexneri 2a
      InvaplexAR vaccine doses. The vaccine will be administered intranasally (without adjuvant).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine will be administered on Days 0,14, and 28. Volunteers (10 per group [8 minimum])
      will receive the same dose at each vaccination dependent upon group assignment. Groups will
      be divided according to the table below. An interval no less than 1 week will separate the
      third dose of a group from the first dose of the next group (receiving an increased
      InvaplexAR dose). Blood, stool, and saliva specimens will be collected at pre-specified
      intervals to examine systemic and mucosal vaccine antigen-specific immune responses. Ocular
      tear samples will be collected in groups C and D. Vaccine safety will be actively monitored
      during vaccination and for 28 days following the third vaccine dose. The decision to advance
      to the next dose level is based on the safety assessment (not immunogenicity). A dose level
      with no occurrence of stopping criteria in the 7 days following the last vaccine dose will
      prompt moving to the next higher level. All safety data will be summarized and reviewed with
      the research monitor prior to dose escalation. In addition, a report of all safety data will
      be provided to the sponsor's safety office for informational purposes.

    <description>Solicited AE monitoring will survey and specifically inquire about symptoms including subjective and objective fever (oral temperature &gt; 100.4°F), malaise, headache, rhinorrhea, epistaxis (nasal bleeding), nasal mucosal ulceration, nasal congestion, edema, nasal burning, nasal itching, nasal discharge, sore throat, post nasal drip, cough, sinus pain, sneezing, and itchy eyes.</description>

    <measure>Antibody titers against immunizing antigens</measure>
    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Serum samples will be assayed for antibody titers against immunizing antigens. Previously established high-titer specimens will be included on each plate to track day to day interassay variation. For each antigen, pre- and post-vaccination serum samples will be assayed side-by-side. The antibody titer assigned to each sample will represent the geometric mean of duplicate tests performed on 2 different days. Reciprocal endpoint titers &lt; 5 will be assigned a value of 2.5 for computational purposes. Seroconversion will be defined as a &gt; 4-fold increase in endpoint titer between pre-and post-vaccination samples AND a post-vaccination reciprocal titer &gt;10.</description>

    <description>The investigational product is S. flexneri 2a InvaplexAR. The product is composed of three individual components IpaB, IpaC, and LPS. The components were assembled into the high molecular weight S. flexneri 2a InvaplexAR complex and subsequently purified by ion-exchange chromatography yielding a bulk lot.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Health problems (for example, chronic medical conditions such as psychiatric
             conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or any other conditions that might place

             with the PI, will use clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis to assess safety risks
             under this criterion. The PI will consult with the Research Monitor as appropriate.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination (chronic sinusitis or
             seasonal rhinitis) which compromise identification and interpretation of potential
             vaccine associated adverse effects.

          -  Use of immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulative drugs such as corticosteroids or
             chemotherapeutics that may influence antibody development.

          -  Immunosuppressive illnesses (including IgA deficiency defined by serum IgA below level
             of detection or &lt;7mg/dL).

          -  Participation in research involving another investigational product (defined as
             receipt of an investigational product or exposure to an invasive investigational
