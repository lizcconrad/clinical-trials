      This is a matched-cohort study designed to assess the health impact of a rural demand-driven
      water and sanitation intervention that provides piped treated water and household level
      pour-flush latrines and bathing rooms, as implemented by Gram Vikas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will undertake a matched-cohort study among 84 villages in Ganjam district, Orissa, India
      to assess the health impact of a program that provides improved water supplies and sanitation
      to rural villages.

    <description>Rural villages in which Gram Vikas has fully implemented its water supply and sanitation (Mantra) intervention. Intervention villages must: 1) be within 3 hours travel to the study office in Brahmapur, 2) have started the intervention by January 2003, and 3) have completed the intervention by January 2013.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control group</arm_group_label>
    <description>Rural villages that have been matched with intervention villages on demographics and other criteria. The sampling frame for control villages is limited to those: 1) within 3 hours travel to the study office in Brahmapur, and 2) within Gram Panchayats which do not include an intervention village and are not adjacent to an intervention village, to minimize spillover effects. In addition, both intervention and control villages must appear in the Government of India Census in 2001.</description>

      Stool samples will be collected and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot will be fixed and
      used for assessing the rate and intensity of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection and
      the second aliquot will be frozen and used to assess biomarkers of environmental enteropathy
