    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of tremor control using various strategies for
      implementing demand-driven thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor.
      Therapeutic stimulation at the Vim nucleus of the thalamus will be initiated and modulated
      using signals derived from external sensors (e.g. EMG, accelerometer) and cortical or
      thalamic electrodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Essential tremor is effectively treated with deep brain stimulation of the ventralis
      intermedius nucleus of the thalamus, presumably because high-frequency stimulation disrupts
      aberrant cerebellar-thalamic input. For the most part, patients with essential tremor have a
      kinetic tremor that is present or worsened with movement. However, DBS therapy is currently
      continuous, and thus, stimulation occurs when the patient will not benefit symptomatically
      from treatment. This exposes the patient to unnecessary stimulation, which can lead to
      unnecessary usage of battery, unnecessary exposure to stimulation side-effects, and can
      possibly contribute to tolerance to DBS therapy.

      One possible solution is selective stimulation when movement is required. This study will
      determine signals predictive of motor activity using external sensors such as EMG, and
      cortical biomarkers of real and imaginary movement that are well-characterized.

      The primary aim is to demonstrate successful initiation and modulation of DBS therapy using
      the Activa PC+S system and implanted cortical or thalamic electrodes. Putative improvements
      in battery usage related to stimulation on-time and definition of coupling signals between
      thalamus and cortex that characterize tremor state are secondary outcomes.

    <description>Patients will be implanted with standard DBS electrodes for treatment of essential tremor, at the Vim nucleus of the thalamus, and an additional subdural electrode array overlying hand motor cortex.. The patient will receive standard of care programming for thalamic stimulation for essential tremor. During research study visits, implementation and evaluation of closed-loop DBS using the PC+S system will be performed.</description>
