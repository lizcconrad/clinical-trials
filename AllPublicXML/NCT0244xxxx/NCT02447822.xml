      This is a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate feasibility and safety of early
      steroid withdrawal after 6mg/kg vs 4.5mg/kg Thymoglobulin induction therapy in kidney
      transplantation. Patients are enrolled from June, 2015 for 24 months. They are randomized to
      either 6mg/kg or 4.5mg/kg Thymoglobulin induction group. Steroid withdrawal is done within
      one week after kidney transplantation for all the patients. Maintenance immunosuppressants
      are Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate mofetil (or Myfortic). Primary outcome is a composite of
      biopsy-proven acute rejection, delayed graft function, graft loss or death within one year
      post transplant.
