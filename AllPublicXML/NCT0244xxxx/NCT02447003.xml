  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study of pembrolizumab monotherapy in participants with metastatic
      triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC). Part 1 of the study will examine the efficacy and
      safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy as first line or above treatment. Part 2 of the study, if
      done, will expand the investigation of pembrolizumab treatment in a subgroup of participants
      from Part 1 and will only start after enrollment in Part 1 has been completed.

      Participants who discontinue study treatment after 24 months of therapy for reasons other
      than disease progression or intolerability or who discontinue treatment after attaining a
      Complete Response (CR) may be eligible for up to one year of retreatment after they have
      experienced disease progression by tumor imaging.
