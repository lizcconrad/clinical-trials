    <textblock>
      This is a controlled trial to assess the effects of resistance training on bradykinesia and
      physical function in patients with Parkinson's Disease. Forty patients diagnosed with
      Parkinson Disease stage 1 to 3 of the Hoehn and Yahr scale took part in the study and were
      allocated into 2 groups; Training Group performed a 9-week RT program twice a week while the
      Control Group attended lectures on the disease.

    <description>The TG performed the RT program using weight machines. Before the training period, participants underwent three weeks with eight familiarization sessions to ensure proper technique execution. The protocol aimed to workout major muscle groups and involved the following exercises: chest press, knee extension, hamstrings curl, leg press, and seated row. Training sessions lasted approximately 50-60 minutes with 2 sets of 10-12 repetitions until fatigue.</description>
