  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disease in which non-adherence is a well-recognized
      problem. Non-adherence may be due to patients´ lack of knowledge, understanding, and
      involvement. In this study the investigators aimed to determine the effect of an educational
      video displayed on a tablet-device. The investigators hypothesized that an educational video
      would increase patients´ knowledge on osteoporosis and treatment at a two week follow up.
