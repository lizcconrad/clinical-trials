  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will use a web-based survey to collect data on individual attitudes and
      self-reported health behaviour changes following genetic testing for personalized nutrition.
      Participants (n=80) are employees of a large multi-national food company's R&amp;D division
      located in Australia, Switzerland, USA and the UK. They underwent a genetic test for
      personalized nutrition in March 2015 that was offered at no cost through the company wellness
      program. A registered dietitian completed a pre-test consultation and disclosed the test
      results with DNA-based dietary advice. The test provided information on 7 components of diet
      and additional information on individual risk for gluten intolerance.
