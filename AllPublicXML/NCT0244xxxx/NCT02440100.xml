    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-and-subject blind, phase 1 study to characterize the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and central and peripheral pharmacodynamics of 14-day repeated
      ascending doses of PF-06648671 once a day in healthy adults (part 1) and repeated doses at
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined in part 1 in healthy elderly subjects (part 2). The
      study also include an optional cohort (part 3) to evaluate the drug interaction between
      PF-06648671 at MTD and CYP3A probe, midazolam

             and male subjects who, at the time of screening, are between the ages of 18 and 55
             years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

             who, at the time of screening, are between the age of 65 and 85 years, inclusive.
             Subjects must be in good health as determined by the Investigator based on a detailed
             medical history, full physical examination (including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement), 12 lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests. Subjects with mild, chronic,
             stable disease eg, controlled hypertension, non insulin dependent diabetes,
             osteoarthritis may be enrolled if deemed medically prudent by the investigator.
             Subjects taking daily prescription or non prescription medications for management of
             acceptable chronic medical conditions must be on a stable dose of these, as defined by
             non change in dose for the 3 months prior to the first dose of study medication and no
             planned changes during the conduct of the study.

          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          5. For Part 2 specific: the creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min using the
             Cockcroft Gault method.

          6. Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          7. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             the investigator.

          2. For Part 2 specific: Recent (eg, last 6 months) evidence or history of unstable
             disease or moderate to severe conditions which would, in the Investigator's opinion,
             interfere with the study evaluations or impact on the safety of participating subjects
             including but not limited to anemia, liver disease, stroke.

          5. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.

          6. Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement) or 5 half lives preceding the first dose of study medication, whichever
             is longer.

          7. Screening supine blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg (systolic) or ≥ 90 mm Hg (diastolic),
             following at least 5 minutes of supine rest. If blood pressure (BP) is ≥ 140 mm Hg
             (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic), the BP should be repeated two more times,
             following 2 minutes rest and the average of the three BP values should be used to
             determine the subject's eligibility.

          8. Screening supine12 lead ECG demonstrating QTcf &gt;450 or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec. If
             QTcf exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility.

                  direct bilirubin is ULN.

         10. Male subjects with partners currently pregnant; male subjects able to father children
             who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as
