    <textblock>
      This is Phase IV, Open label, Multicenter study. Subject's parents and/or legal guardian will
      be provided information about the trial. If interested and if eligible, they will then be
      asked to provide signed informed consent. The initial study visit can occur immediately after
      signed informed consent has been obtained. Approximately 135 subjects will be enrolled to
      receive 4 doses of intramuscular MenACWY vaccine at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age.
