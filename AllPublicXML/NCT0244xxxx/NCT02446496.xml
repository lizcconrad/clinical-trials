  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-sequence two-period crossover study,
      separated by 7 days washout interval from the first Study Drug Administration. This study is
      conducted to determine the bioequivalence of cefadroxil from DURICEF™ film coated tablets
      manufactured by Smithkline Beecham Egypt, LLC affiliated co. to GalaxoSmithKline (GSK) and
      cefadroxil from BIODROXIL™ film coated tablets manufactured by Kahira Pharm &amp;amp;Chem .Ind.
      Co . for Novartis Pharma (NP) after a single oral dose administration of each to healthy
      adult subjects under fasting conditions. In Period 1, subjects will be randomized to receive
      cefadroxil tablet manufactured by either GSK or NP. Following a washout of at least 7 days,
      subjects will be crossed over in Period 2 to receive the cefadroxil tablet that they did not
      receive in Period 1. DURICEF is a trademark of the GSK group of companies. BIODROXIL is a
      trademark of Sandoz.

    <measure>Maximal Measured Plasma Concentration (Cmax) After a Single Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0.00) and 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00 and 12.00 hours post-dose in each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis were drawn at indicated time points of each treatment period. Cmax was defined as maximal measured plasma concentration over the time span specified.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Measurable Concentration (AUC0-t) and Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-infinity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0.00) and 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00 and 12.00 hours post-dose in each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for PK analysis were drawn at indicated time points of each treatment period. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero (0) to the last measurable concentration (t), as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero (0) to infinity (AUC0-infinity) was calculated as the sum of the AUC0-t plus the ratio of the last measurable plasma concentration to the elimination rate constant (Ke), where first-order elimination or terminal rate constant calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The parameter was calculated by linear least-squares regression analysis using the last three (or more) non-zero plasma concentrations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of the Maximum Plasma Concentration (T-max) and Terminal Half- Life (T-half)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0.00) and 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 1.75, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00 and 12.00 hours post-dose in each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for PK analysis were drawn at indicated time points of each treatment period. If the maximum value occurs at more than one point T-max was defined as the first time point with this value. The elimination or terminal half-life was calculated by dividing 0.693 (natural logarithm of 2) with lambda z, where lambda z is the terminal phase rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis of the log transformed concentration-time data after each single dose.</description>

          <description>In each period of the study, participants received one tablet of treatment A (cefadroxil 1 gm F.C. tablet), given with 240 ml water. Water was at room temperature and measured with a 250 ml cylinder according to a plan of randomization. The study drug administration took place between 09:00 am and 09:46 am for both periods in the morning of study Day 1 of each study period. A washout period of 7 days between the two study drug administrations was allowed.</description>
