  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the duration of effect of GSK2245035 on allergic reactivity by
      repeating a nasal allergen challenge (NAC) approximately one year after treatment in subjects
      from TL7116958. This is a single centre, single period study in subjects with respiratory
      allergy/allergies who completed the study TL7116958 in 2014 to investigate the long term
      effect of previous treatment with GSK2245035 compared with placebo on total nasal symptoms
      elicited by nasal allergen challenge. Subjects and staff will remain blinded to the treatment
      received in the TL7116958 study (GSK2245035 or placebo). The study will consist of a
      screening visit to assess eligibility criteria, a study period consisting of a single visit
      when the nasal allergen challenge will be performed, and follow up by phone or a clinic visit
      at the discretion of the investigator 4-7 days following the allergen challenge. Eligible
      subjects will participate in this study for approximately70 days total from screening to
      follow up.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Sym. Score (TNSS) at Post-NAC 15 Minutes (Min)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline [pre-NAC] and post-NAC 15 min)</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS was obtained from 4 individual nasal sym. including nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, nasal itch and sneezing. Participants rated sym. on a 4-point scale. For nasal blockage and congestion the scores were (0= Breathing through nose freely and easily, 1= Slight difficulty breathing through nose, 2= Moderate difficulty breathing through nose and 3= Severe difficulty breathing through nose). For rhinorrhoea, nasal itching and sneezing (0= None: No sym. whatsoever; Absent, 1= Mild: Sym. is present, noticeable but not bothersome, 2= Moderate: Sym. is bothersome, but tolerable and 3= Severe: Sym. which are bothersome, harder to tolerate). The individual sym. scores were combined to produce a TNSS. TNSS were reported as median (credible interval). The baseline values were the latest pre-dose assessments. Change from baseline was measured as the value recorded at 15 min post-NAC minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Total Nasal Sym. Score (TNSS) at Post-NAC 15 Minutes (Min)</title>
        <description>TNSS was obtained from 4 individual nasal sym. including nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, nasal itch and sneezing. Participants rated sym. on a 4-point scale. For nasal blockage and congestion the scores were (0= Breathing through nose freely and easily, 1= Slight difficulty breathing through nose, 2= Moderate difficulty breathing through nose and 3= Severe difficulty breathing through nose). For rhinorrhoea, nasal itching and sneezing (0= None: No sym. whatsoever; Absent, 1= Mild: Sym. is present, noticeable but not bothersome, 2= Moderate: Sym. is bothersome, but tolerable and 3= Severe: Sym. which are bothersome, harder to tolerate). The individual sym. scores were combined to produce a TNSS. TNSS were reported as median (credible interval). The baseline values were the latest pre-dose assessments. Change from baseline was measured as the value recorded at 15 min post-NAC minus Baseline value.</description>

          <description>TNSS was obtained from 4 individual nasal sym. including nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, nasal itch and sneezing. Participants rated sym. on a 4-point scale. For nasal blockage and congestion the scores were (0= Breathing through nose freely and easily, 1= Slight difficulty breathing through nose, 2= Moderate difficulty breathing through nose and 3= Severe difficulty breathing through nose). For rhinorrhoea, nasal itching and sneezing (0= None: No sym. whatsoever; Absent, 1= Mild: Sym. is present, noticeable but not bothersome, 2= Moderate: Sym. is bothersome, but tolerable and 3= Severe: Sym. which are bothersome, harder to tolerate). The individual sym scores were combined to produce a TNSS. TNSS were reported as median (credible interval). The baseline values were the latest pre-dose assessments. Change from baseline was measured as value recorded at a specified time point minus Baseline value. WM 0-6 h of 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6h was reported.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the PNIF up to Post-NAC 6 h</title>
          <description>PNIF data recorded at Baseline pre-challenge and at 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6h. The percent change from Baseline and at specified time point was derived by the formula (PNIF at Baseline minus PNIF at Post-NAC specified time point) divided by PNIF at Baseline) multiplied by 100. The baseline values were the latest pre-dose assessments. Percent change in PNIF were reported as median (credible interval). WM 0-6h of 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6h was reported. WM were derived by first calculating the AUC using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing by the time interval. If available, actual times were used in the calculation, otherwise planned relative times were used for the calculation.</description>

        <description>Four individual nasal sym. including nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, nasal itch and sneezing were recorded at Baseline (pre-NAC) and at post-NAC 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6h. Participants rated sym. on a 4-point scale. For nasal blockage and congestion the scores were (0= Breathing through nose freely and easily, 1= Slight difficulty breathing through nose, 2= Moderate difficulty breathing through nose and 3= Severe difficulty breathing through nose). For rhinorrhoea, nasal itching and sneezing (0= None: No sym. whatsoever; Absent, 1= Mild: Sym. is present, noticeable but not bothersome, 2= Moderate: Sym. is bothersome, but tolerable and 3= Severe: Sym. which are bothersome, harder to tolerate). The baseline value were the latest pre-dose assessments. Mean change from Baseline at 15 min, WM0-1h, WM 0-6h, and maximum change over 0-6 h were reported. Change from Baseline was measured as the value recorded at a specified time point minus Baseline value.</description>
