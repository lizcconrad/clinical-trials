  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal transplantation represents currently the best therapeutic alternative for end-stage
      renal failure, not only in terms of patient outcomes (better quality of life and longer
      survival), but also in terms of costs for the society.

      Progress achieved in the last 20 years has resulted in a drastic reduction of the incidence
      of &quot;classic&quot; (i.e. clinically patent) acute cellular rejection episodes.

      Unfortunately, and rather unexpectedly, this progress has had hardly any effect on the
      frequency of the loss of kidney transplants beyond the first year, as shown by the stagnation
      of grafts' half lives.

      Furthermore, the use of immunosuppressant combinations that are more and more powerful has an
      impact on adverse effects in recipients, including an increased incidence of infections,
      cancers, but also metabolic complications (diabetes, osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, etc.), which
      are cause of significant morbi-mortality.

      In an attempt to improve on these disappointing outcomes, some teams have offered to perform
      screening biopsies: i.e. routine biopsies at specific time points during the follow up,
      irrespective of graft function. Their primary interest is to allow a pathological analysis of
      the graft at an early stage, i.e. when potential histological lesions allow for a diagnosis
      but before these lesions impact on graft's function. Indeed, it has been clearly demonstrated
      that therapeutic adjustments intended to protect the grafts are most effective when
      introduced early. There is a fairly broad consensus to perform these biopsies three months
      and one year after the transplantation. Performing screening biopsies has led to the
      identification of &quot;subclinical&quot; forms of rejection, i.e. graft infiltration by recipient
      immune effectors meeting the Banff histological criteria, but without increase in
      creatininemia.

      Assuming that about 10% of screening biopsies performed at 3 months reveal a subclinical
      rejection, which needs to be treated, the management strategy for the remaining 90% of
      patients, whose biopsies show either i) a mild inflammatory infiltrates: i.e. &quot;borderline
      changes&quot;, or ii) the complete absence of immune effectors in the graft is, poorly
      standardized.

      The investigators therefore propose to conduct a prospective randomized trial to answer these
      questions simultaneously by evaluating a strategy to optimize the immunosuppression of renal
      graft recipients based on the presence or absence of subclinical intragraft inflammatory
      infiltrates in the screening biopsy performed at 3 months post transplantation. Patients with
      borderline changes (sub-study A) will be randomized to receive a treatment for rejection
      (corticosteroid boluses). Patients without inflammation in their graft (sub-study B) will be
      randomized for corticosteroid withdrawal. Impact on graft function, progression of
      histological lesions and incidence of morbidity will be evaluated.
