  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cohort, observational, prospective, multicenter, longitudinal study. 100 patients
      will be followed postoperatively for a period of 12 months. Intermediate statistical analyzes
      will be performed at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 9 months.

      This observational study is non-interventional, it does not change the usual care of patients
      who underwent a bariatric surgery. Data collection will be carried out during routine visits
      planned in the post-operation usual follow-up. The blood tests are part of the patient's
      usual care for his bariatric surgery.

      Surgeons will include patients for whom they have freely decided to use the dietary
      supplement Refill under the care of the treatment of obesity. The motivation of the patient
      and his commitment to the project is evaluated by the surgeon.

      The main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of the dietary supplement Refill.

      The primary endpoint is the reduction of iron deficiency.
