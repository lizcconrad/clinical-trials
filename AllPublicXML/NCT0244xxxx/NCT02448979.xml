  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive malignant disease with poor prognosis. Surgical
      resection remains the most effective method for this malignancy. Although different
      approaches have been studied for the surgical resection of thoracic esophageal cancer, little
      evidence has been achieved due to lack of large scale multicenter randomized trials with
      regard to this issue: whether left transthoracic approach or right transthoracic approach is
      the optimal surgical approach for treating middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer
      without upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      postoperative local recurrence rate and long-term outcome of esophagectomy through left and
      right transthoracic approach in the middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer patients
      without preoperative upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis.

      Esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive malignant disease with poor prognosis. Surgical
      resection remains the most effective method for this malignancy. As to the middle and lower
      thoracic esophageal cancer patients without upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis, the
      rational transthoracic approach either through right or left chest has not been clarified to
      date due to lack of large scale multicenter randomized trials. Although some randomized
      trials had been finished in single-center, there is no enough evidences that all lower and
      middle thoracic esophageal cancer patients should be surgically treated throuhg right chest
      approch. It is widely recognized that left thoracotomy approach(Sweet procedure) is not
      appropriate in the patients with upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis, because patients
      can benefit from the right thoracotomy approach, through which upper mediastinal lymph node
      can be dissected completely and may get a better long-term survival.Therefore,in this study,
      the enrolled patients are the middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer patients without
      preoperative upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis by CT and/or ultrasound, and 10
      hospitals will participate this study. Through comparison in postoperative complications and
      long term outcomes as well as locoregional recurrence between the left and right apppoach,
      hopefully we can answer the question whether the right or left transthoracic procedure is the
      optimal approach for treating middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer patients without
      preoperative upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis.
