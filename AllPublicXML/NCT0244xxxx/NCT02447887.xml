  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II trial of the combination pegylated IFN-alpha 2b with ixazomib in
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Researchers believe that by disabling the protein
      complex NF-kB, which controls the transfer of genetic information; using the study drug
      Ixazomib, they can promote necrotic cell death of RCC using interferon alpha - 2b. They
      hypothesize that the combination of ixazomib with IFN will lead to increased necrotic cell
      death in RCC tumors and consequent clinical benefit to patients.

      Patients will receive ixazomib capsules and pegylated IFN alfa 2b injection in this research
      study. Treatments will be given weekly and 4 weeks of treatment make up one cycle.
