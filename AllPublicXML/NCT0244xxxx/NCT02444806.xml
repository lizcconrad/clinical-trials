  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to compare 2 different strategies used to setup non-invasive ventilation in
      patients with OCPD-OSA overlap.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With limited comparative data to support the different strategies, there is substantial
      variation across Europe and the United States in the methods used by clinicians to set up
      home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) for patients with chronic respiratory failure as a
      consequence of sleep disordered breathing. Indeed with few data to support the practice, many
      centres employ full montage polysomnography, which is not only a significant physical burden
      to the patient but also a financial burden to the healthcare provider in terms of the
      facilities required, staff training and equipment.

      The investigators propose to undertake a randomised controlled trial to compare the clinical
      effectiveness, in terms of the change in daytime arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide
      (PaCO2) at 3 months, of limited respiratory polygraphy and full polysomnography to set up NIV
      in patients with COPD-OSA overlap. Secondary outcome measures at 3 months will include
      overnight control of gas exchange, subjective sleep quality, health related quality of life
      and ventilator adherence. COPD-OSA overlap are a patient group that have a rising prevalence
      with limited data currently available detailing NIV set up, which wholly supports the
      rationale of using this increasingly important group as a target population for this trial.
