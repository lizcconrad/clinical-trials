      The aim of this study was to compare the functional capacity of exercise by six-minute walk
      test and lung function by spirometry, before and after Nuss procedure in subjects who have
      undergone the early rehabiliation program with those who were under conventional care.
      Researchers want to find out if early rehabilitation is a strategy to enhance recovery after
      Nuss procedure.

      The replacement of some traditional approaches in surgical care has demonstrated that
      surgical recovery can be accelerated and convalescence decreased. These multimodal approaches
      focuses on enhancing recovery and reducing morbidity by reduction of surgical stress,minimal
      invasive surgery, optimized pain relief, early nutrition and ambulation.

      In postoperative, the bed rest leads to the increase in muscle loss and weakness, impairs
      pulmonary function, predisposes to venous stasis and thromboembolism, increases infection
      complications and reduces functional capacity even in patients who are not restricted to bed.

      However, few studies have focused on when start the mobilization and which effects on
      functional capacity of exercise and lung function during hospital stay.

      In this trial the investigators will consider early rehabilitation to be safe and feasible in
      Nuss procedure.

    <description>one day before surgery, patients and their families were instructed by physiotherapists than explained the importance to perform physical exercises and breath exercises in postoperative. At the postoperative recovery room, after extubation and fully awake, patients started physiotherapy exercises, as physical exercises of moving up upper and lower extremities accompanied by deep breathing exercises. After than, the patients standed up beside the bed and if there was no complications, patients performed ambulation.</description>
