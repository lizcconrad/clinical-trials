  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the impact of two strategies to sustain and improve
      the delivery of an evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)
      in three different mental health systems. These approaches are based on two different
      theories of what is necessary to promote successful implementation. We will examine whether
      these strategies lead to improved patient outcomes, clinician skill, proportion of clients
      who receive CPT, and other outcomes that are relevant to the implementation of evidence-based
      psychosocial treatments. By examining these questions in 3 different mental health systems,
      we will also examine whether the implementation strategies yield different results in
      different systems.

      This project will compare two different methods of post-training support to promote sustained
      and improved CPT delivery: Fidelity-oriented learning community (FID-LC) and Continuous
      Quality Improvement Learning Community (CQI-LC). Clinics in which clinicians have previously
      received CPT training will be randomly assigned to one of these conditions. Outcomes will be
      observed changes in patient symptoms during and following treatment, independent expert
      assessment of clinician fidelity and adaptations in delivering the psychotherapy (via
      audio-recordings), proportion of eligible caseloads that receive CPT, and capacity to deliver
      CPT. Data will also be collected to assess clinician and setting characteristics that may
      contribute to the success of each strategy. The study results will help inform how best to
      support the ongoing implementation and benefits of evidence-based psychotherapy (e.g., CPT)
      in routine clinical settings. This is a knowledge translation project in partnership with 3
      systems; VA Canada, U.S. Veterans Health Care System and the National Centre for PTSD.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PTSD Symptoms over 6 months (PCL-5 measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for an expected duration of 12 weeks of therapy. PCL-5 will be measured at baseline, at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, post-treatment week, and at 3-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD. Each item is measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The PCL will track change from baseline to the 3 month follow up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fidelity Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The fidelity measure examines clinicians' adherence and competence to specific CPT interventions prescribed in each session. Clinicians are rated on their adherence to the protocol (on a 0-2 Likert-type scale), as well as their competence in delivery of these elements (rated on a 7-point, Likert-type scale).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Content-Level and Context-Level Adaptation</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, at 12 and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using a framework and coding system of modifications and adaptations made to EBPs, sessions will be rated to identify 11 potential content-level adaptations, as well as 5 context-level modifications.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CPT Activity Reporting</measure>
    <time_frame>monthly for up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>All clinicians will report monthly on CPT activity: caseload size, frequency, duration and satisfaction with the LC over the past month, number of new CPT patients, clinician confidence rating in their CPT delivery.</description>
