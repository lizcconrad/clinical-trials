      Efficacy of an Internet-based self-guided intervention for promoting healthy habits and
      weight loss in hypertensive people with overweight and obesity: A Randomized Controlled Trial

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity is on the rise worldwide with severe physical and
      psychosocial consequences. Hypertension is one of the comorbidities associated with obesity.
      Changes in lifestyles through eating behavior and physical activity level are the critical
      components in the prevention and treatment for hypertension and obesity. Data from several
      studies indicate that the usual procedures to promote these healthy habits in health services
      are inadequate. ICTs has been demonstrated as an effective tool for implementation of
      psychological interventions focused on this type of population. This study aims to describe a
      totally self-applied online program (¨Vivir Mejor¨) to promote healthy lifestyles (eating
      behavior and physical activity) for obese participants with hypertension. Participants
      (BMI=25-35) will be recruited from users of a hypertension unit of a public hospital and will
      be randomized into two groups: experimental group &quot;Vivir Mejor&quot; and control group (treatment
      as usual). &quot;Vivir Mejor&quot; program is composed by 9 modules aimed for promoting healthy eating
      habits and increase physical activity. Modules will be sent via Internet periodically. After
      6 months, a follow-up testing phase and a tracking module will be set. The outcomes variables
      will include anthropometric data, changes in eating behavior and physical performance and
      cardiovascular variables.

    <description>- International Physical Activity Questionnaire - IPAQ - short (Booth, 2000.): Self-report of 7 items that collects information about PA and sedentary behavior of people in four areas: activity at work, when traveling, at home and during leisure time (leisure). The IPAQ addresses the number of days and minutes for performing physical activities such as leisure-time occupations, locomotion and housework activities. The score is derived from the number of days, hours and minutes employed therein (Carral &amp; Perez, 2011).</description>

    <description>BREQ-2 - Scale regulation of behavior in physical exercise and eating habits (Markland &amp; Tobin, 2004. Validated to the Spanish context by Moreno, Cervellò &amp; Martinez Camacho, 2006): The original questionnaire was developed to measure external regulation, introjected, identified and intrinsic motivation. The BREQ-2 scale consists of 19 items, compared with 15 of the original scale, measuring stages of the continuum of self-determination. An adaptation of this scale also be conducted to assess motivation to change eating habits.</description>
