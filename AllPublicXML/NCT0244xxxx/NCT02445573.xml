  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a pilot randomized, placebo controlled trial to preliminarily assess the efficacy of
      EA for women with pure SUI. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to EA group or sham
      EA group in a 1:1 ratio via a central randomization system by acupuncturists. Participants,
      outcome assessors and statisticians were blinded to treatment allocation. Subject blinding is
      achieved via the aid of adhesive pads used in both groups, placebo needle with a blunt tip
      and sham EA electrode lines. Assuming a two-sided alpha of 0.05, power of 90%, and a 20%
      drop-out, a sample size of 36 would be needed for each group. The investigators expanded the
      sample size to 80 cases (40 cases per group) to increase the reliability of the study. The
      investigators performed statistical analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle. All
      patients accepting randomization were included in the analysis. Missing data were filled in
      by the last observed value. Student t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests were used for the
      comparison of continuous variables; chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests or Kruskal-Wallis
      H tests were used to compare categorical variables, as appropriate. For measures collected at
      two time points, paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used as appropriate. A
      statistically significant difference was set at P&lt;0.05.

    <description>Data of IEF was from 72-hour bladder diary recorded by participants over the last 72 hours of weeks 0 (baseline), weeks 2, 4, 6 (treatment period) and weeks 15-18,and 27-30 (follow-up period).
The 72-hour IEF of weeks 1-6 equaled the sum of 72h IEF at weeks 2, 4 and 6 divided by 3; The 72-hour IEF of weeks 15-18 equaled the sum of 72h IEF at weeks 15-18 divided by 4; The 72-hour IEF of weeks 27-30 equaled the sum of 72h IEF at weeks 27-30 divided by 4.</description>

    <description>The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) was a brief and robust measure for evaluating the symptoms and impact of urinary incontinence.It was used to assess the influence of urinary incontinence on quality of life during the past 4 weeks retrospectively. It contained three items on frequency, amount of leakage, and overall impact on quality of life, and a fourth, non-scored item for the assessment of type of incontinence. A total score was summed by the scores of the first three items, ranging from 0 to 21. A higher value indicates increased severity.</description>

    <description>When acupuncturing, adhesive pads were first pasted on acupoints after sterilization in either group. In EA group, participants were needled at bilateral BL33 at an angle of 30 to 45 degree inward and downward, and at bilateral BL35 slightly toward upside and outside, to a depth of 50 to 60 mm using acupuncture needles of size 0.30×75 mm. Needles were then lifted, thrusted and twirled evenly for 3 times. Paired electrodes of EA apparatus were attached transversely to bilateral BL33 and BL35 (using real electrodes) respectively, with a continuous wave of 50 Hz and a current intensity of 1-5 milliampere (mA) for 30 min. Participants were treated with EA 3 sessions a week on alternate days for 6 successive weeks.</description>

    <description>When acupuncturing, adhesive pads were first pasted on acupoints after sterilization in either group. In sham EA group, participants were needled at sham BL33 and sham BL35, which were about 20 mm lateral to BL33 and BL35, respectively, with blunt needle tips piercing adhesive pads and not piercing the surface of the skin, using placebo needles of size 0.30×25 mm. Needles were then lifted, thrusted and twirled evenly for 3 times. Paired electrodes of EA apparatus were attached transversely to bilateral sham BL33 and sham BL35 (using sham electrodes) respectively. The parameters of sham EA apparatus and the treatment course were the same as in the EA group.</description>

          <description>The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) was a brief and robust measure for evaluating the symptoms and impact of urinary incontinence.It was used to assess the influence of urinary incontinence on quality of life during the past 4 weeks retrospectively. It contained three items on frequency, amount of leakage, and overall impact on quality of life, and a fourth, non-scored item for the assessment of type of incontinence. A total score was summed by the scores of the first three items, ranging from 0 to 21. A higher value indicates increased severity.</description>

In EA group, participants were needled at bilateral BL33 at an angle of 30 to 45 degree inward and downward, and at bilateral BL35 slightly toward upside and outside, to a depth of 50 to 60 mm using acupuncture needles of size 0.30×75 mm. Needles were then lifted, thrusted and twirled evenly for 3 times. Paired electrodes of EA apparatus were attached transversely to bilateral BL33 and BL35 (using real electrodes) respectively, with a continuous wave of 50 Hz and a current intensity of 1-5 mA for 30 min.
