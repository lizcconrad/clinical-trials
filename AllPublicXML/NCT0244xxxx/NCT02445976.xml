      The goal of this clinical study is to determine the efficacy and safety of Seviteronel, a
      lyase-selective inhibitor of CYP17 and an androgen receptor antagonist, in patients with
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who have been previously treated with
      enzalutamide and/or abiraterone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 clinical trial of Seviteronel (an oral, potent and lyase-selective CYP17
      inhibitor) in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progressing on
      enzalutamide or abiraterone. Approximately 197 subjects will be used to assess treatment
      efficacy. The study will be conducted in two different clinical cohorts separated by prior
      exposure to enzalutamide or abiraterone, or prior exposure to enzalutamide and abiraterone.
