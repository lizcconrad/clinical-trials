      Predictors of response to pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder will be
      investigated. One hundred and twenty patients will be included in a naturalistic clinical
      trial. Psychopathology, personality traits, cognitive performance, brain structural changes
      and genetic polymorphisms will be evaluated. Patients will be followed for 18 months with a
      pharmacological treatment algorithm and will be evaluated monthly until 6th month and every 3
      months, up to 18 months. Psychoeducation will be offered to patients who did not remit until
      3 months of pharmacological tretment.

    <textblock>
      The relevance of depression prevention and treatment in older people tend to raise in future
      years, considering the rapid increase of the elderly population in Brazil and the growing
      impact of depression (the third cause of global burden of diseases in the world according to
      the World Health Association 2004 report). The association between structural brain changes
      and treatment response in patients with late-life depression (LLD) remains an intriguing area
      of research. Predictors of response to pharmacological treatment of major depressive disorder
      will be investigated in 120 elderly patients, who will be included in a naturalistic clinical
      trial, that will evaluate psychopathology, personality traits, cognitive performance, brain
      structural changes and genetic polymorphisms. Patients will be followed for 18 months with a
      treatment algorithm for depression and will be evaluated monthly until 6th month and every 3
      months, up to 18 months, to assess factors associated to response to treatment.

      Patients who are in the antidepressant treatment group and does not reach remission (MADRS
      score &lt;or =8) until 3 months of pharmacological treatment will be invited to be part of a
      psychoeducation program. If the patient accepts the psychoeducation intervention, he will be
      randomized to psychoeducation (pharmacological treatment plus psychoeducation) or treatment
      as usual (only pharmacological treatment). The psychoeducation program consists of 10
      individual weekly sessions, conducted by a trained psychologist who will explain the main
      concepts of depression and its symptoms, the importance of adhering to treatment, the main
      side effects of pharmacological treatment, and how to cope with daily difficulties.

      Peripheral venous blood (10mL) will be collected from participants, venocubital puncture into
      tubes with anticoagulant ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). After collection, the tubes
      will be properly stored at 4 ° C until the time of extraction. The genomic deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) will be extracted using a salting out technique (Miller et al. 1988). After DNA
      extraction, the achieved concentration will be measured by reading the Gene Quant
      spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech).
