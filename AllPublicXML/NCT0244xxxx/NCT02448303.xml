             platinum-based chemotherapy

          -  Received at least 1 platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Note: Subjects with EGFR

             patient population

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior malignancy (other than lung cancer), except for adequately treated basal cell or
             squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer from which the
             subject has been disease free for ≥ 2 years or which will not limit survival to &lt; 2
             years

          -  Known central nervous system metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias,
             congestive heart failure, or myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal function, or
             resection of the stomach or small bowel, symptomatic inflammatory bowel disease,
             partial or complete bowel obstruction, or gastric restrictions and bariatric surgery,
             such as gastric bypass
