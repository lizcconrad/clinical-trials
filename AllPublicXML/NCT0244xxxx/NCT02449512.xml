    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury and other systemic neurological diseases (Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's
      disease) affect the integrity of lower urinary tract (LUT) function, leading to neurogenic
      lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD). The urodynamic investigation is the current
      &quot;gold-standard&quot; for evaluating LUT function. Nevertheless, the sensory situation of the LUT
      cannot be investigated objectively. Furthermore, the current classification of the severity
      of the NLUTD due to spinal cord injury (SCI) does not represent the sensory situation of the
      LUT. Additional investigations therefore need to be established for assessing the sensory
      situation of the LUT. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) are an established method for
      investigating the processing of sensory nervous activity. However, SEPs from the LUT of SCI
      individuals have not yet been investigated.

      A novel technique, i.e. diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), allows to process magnetic resonance
      images (MRI) in order to visualize nerve fibers. Using DTI, the innervation of the bladder
      after SCI can be visualized. The structural presentation of bladder innervation will be
      compared with the functional results, i.e. the SEP of the LUT in SCI individuals.

      The primary objective of the proposed study is to elicit and characterize (latency,
      amplitude) the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) from the bladder in individuals
      suffering from neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction as a result of spinal cord injury.

      Furthermore, the SEPs from the bladder will be compared with the SEPs from peripheral nerves
      (N. tibialis, N. pudendus, N. medianus).

      Moreover, the latency and amplitude of the SEPs from the bladder of individuals with
      somato-sensory complete spinal cord injury will be compared with those from the bladder of
      individuals with somato-sensory incomplete spinal cord injury.

      Finally, the structural innervation of the bladder after SCI will be compared with the
      remaining sensory function.
