    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective, non-interventional sutdy is to compare the effectiveness
      of ICS/LABA combination therapy in the reduction of COPD exacerbations during the 12 months
      after initiation of therapy between COPD patients who are adherent to the index medication
      and those who are non-adherent.

      This retrospective, observational study will assess the effectiveness of ICS/LABA combination
      therapies among COPD patients new to the ICS/LABA combination therapies in the US, comparing
      those who are adherent to the index medication and those who are non-adherent. Adherence will
      be measured using the proportion of days covered with the index medication. Medical and
      pharmacy claims data will be used as the data source.
