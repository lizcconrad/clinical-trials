      Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a adapted exercise
      program and general exercise recommendations compared with only general exercise
      recommendations for the management of chronic back pain among the workers of BSH (Bosch
      Siemens Hausgeräte), a manufacturing company.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial. Participants: Subjects (N_40 volunteers) experimental
      group (n_20) control group (n_20). All of the participants needs to be diagnosed with chronic
      back pain by a physician. Participants are going to be randomly assigned to two groups: a
      control group (CG), and experimental group (EG).

      Intervention: The experimental group is going to follow a home-exercise program designed
      specifically to compensate the overloads and strength necessities of the workplace, the
      patient enter the description of the workplace in a mobile application (APP) and the APP
      shows specific exercises that the patient needs to practice. The exercise program includes
      muscle strengthening, flexibility, and endurance training, during 2 months, 3 times/week and
      generla recommendations. The control group is going to receive only general recommendation
      (ACSM recommendations) with the same kind of mobile application to control the amount of
      exercise that each patient performs during the week.

      Data on pain intensity (BPI short form, Brief Pain Inventory), disability (Oswestry Low Back
      Pain Disability Questionnaire), functional assessment of the lumbar spine (EMG
      Flexion-relaxation test), amount of weekly physical activity (IPAQ), and number of sick
      leaves are going to be measured immediately before and after intervention and 3 months after
      the end of the intervention period.
