  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1b, open label, multi center, multi-dose trial designed to estimate the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended dose for phase 2 (RP2D)
      investigations of PF- 05082566 in combination with KW-0761 (mogamulizumab) in patients with
      advanced solid tumors. Once the MTD of PF-05082566 administered in combination with KW-0761
      is estimated (dose finding), one or more expansion cohorts of patients with selected advanced
      solid tumors (dose-expansion ) will be enrolled to further characterize the combination in
      term of safety profile, anti tumor activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      biomarkers modulation.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated due to marginal efficacy and change in sponsor prioritization. The
    combination had a manageable safety profile.
