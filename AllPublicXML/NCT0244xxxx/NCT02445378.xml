    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies aromatherapy and essential oils in improving insomnia
      and other symptoms in patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. Aromatherapy and
      essential oils may help improve insomnia and other complications caused by chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Does the addition of aromatherapy by diffusion of essential oils improve insomnia in newly
      diagnosed, hospitalized leukemia patients?

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Does the addition of aromatherapy by diffusion of essential oils improve other common
      symptoms in newly diagnosed, hospitalized leukemia patients, including pain, nausea, lack of
      appetite, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety and wellbeing? II. Do newly diagnosed,
      hospitalized leukemia patients find the use of aromatherapy for symptom management a positive
      experience?

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients select between 3 scented essential oils: peppermint, lavender, or chamomile
      which is diffused in the hospital room from approximately 9 PM in the evening until morning
      during week 1 and placebo intervention using rose water during week 2.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo placebo intervention using rose water during week 1 and
      aromatherapy and essential oils as in Group I during week 2.

    <description>Statistical analysis will be performed using a mixed effects linear regression model. This model is designed to test the effects of interest (i.e., the effect of aromatherapy relative to baseline and to placebo) while accounting for the within-subject correlation arising from the repeated measures design. A 20% positive change in PSQI score will be seen as significant.</description>
