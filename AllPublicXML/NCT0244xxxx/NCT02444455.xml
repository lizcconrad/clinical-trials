      Phase I-II Clinical Trial - Safety and efficacy of umbilical-cord-derived mesenchymal stem
      cell (UC-MSC) in patients with acute lung injury,open label, controlled prospective study.

      Every patient will maintain their standard treatment of acute lung injury, with maximum
      tolerated dosage without side effects.

      The day of infusion will be considered day zero. From that moment, followup will be divided
      into 2,7,14 days.

      Clinical results will be analyzed after completion of 14 days of followup.
