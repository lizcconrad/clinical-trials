      Phase II, single-arm study of AZD6094 (Volitinib) in combination with docetaxel, in advanced
      gastric adenocarcinoma patients with MET overexpression as a second-line treatment.

      Volitinib is an orally available, potent, selective, small molecule c-MET inhibitor.

      Subjects will receive Volitinib once daily (at the MTD determined from Phase Ib) for 21 days
      as one cycle.

      Docetaxel 60 mg/m2 will be administered via intravenous access once every 3 weeks.

      To investigate the efficacy of volitinib when given in combination with docetaxel in patients
      with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma harboring MET overexpression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a xenograft model Hs746T with c-Met gene amplification, suboptimal doses 0.6 mg/kg
      volitinib and 3 mg/kg docetaxel induced TGI of 55.8% and 80.8%, respectively, whereas
      combination resulted in a TGI by 101.1%, and statistical significance was seen between
      combination group and either of mono-therapy group. Plasma exposures of volitinib and
      docetaxel were determined after last dose at the end of study, and there was no significant
      difference between combination and single agent on exposures of either volitinib or
      docetaxel. More importantly, combination was well tolerant and no body weight loss was found
      in the animals. These results suggested that it would be worthwhile to study the combination
      use of volitinib and docetaxel in clinic.
