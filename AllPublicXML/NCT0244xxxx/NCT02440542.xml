    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate outcomes of popliteal nerve blocks for postoperative
      pain control in patients undergoing ankle and hindfoot reconstruction surgeries. The
      following outcomes will be analyzed: length of hospital stay, level of pain control, pain
      medication use, complications, and patient satisfaction.

        The study population will be patients undergoing ankle or hindfoot reconstruction about the
        talus (ankle arthrodesis, subtalar arthrodesis, or ankle arthroplasty) who will be
        receiving a sciatic nerve block in the popliteal region while in the PACU, following
        surgery. Patients will be identified as potential subjects from within the practices of two
        fellowship-trained foot and ankle orthopaedic surgeons. Patients will be enrolled in the
        study by Informed Consent
