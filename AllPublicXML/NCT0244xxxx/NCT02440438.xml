  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile is responsible for up to 25% of reported antibiotic associated diarrhea
      cases and virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis (PMC). The clinical spectrum of C.
      difficile infection (CDI) varies in severity from asymptomatic carriage to self-limited,
      mild, watery diarrhea, to PMC, intestinal perforation, toxic megacolon, sepsis, fulminant
      colitis, and death. In the past decade, the 027/NAP1/BI strain has emerged world-wide and has
      been implicated in large outbreaks with increased severity, frequent recurrence, and
      significant mortality. The host immune responses can influence the severity of CDI and play
      crucial roles in CDI onset, progression, and overall prognosis. Low serum concentrations of
      antibodies directed against the toxins A&amp;B of C. difficile have been associated with a higher
      risk of recurrence. However, there are conflicting reports.
