    <time_frame>40 days</time_frame>
    <description>For the safety assessment, the variables will be evaluated for each experimental period using one-tailed Wilcoxon test to investigate the following hypotheses:
H0: The median of the results of the variable under study is zero (no irritation) H1: The median of the results of the variable under study is greater than zero (no irritation) The Wilcoxon test is used because it is the ideal to compare variables collected with ordinal scale with a reference value. In this study, the reference value is zero (no irritation).
The expectation is the absence of positive safety, ie higher scores than zero. If there are positive evidence of (mild, moderate or severe) for parameters erythema, peeling,blistering and swelling, the results are statistically evaluated.</description>
