  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular exercise adjustments are required during in order to redistribute blood flow
      from non-exercising vascular areas to active muscles. This hemodynamic adjustments, which are
      partially mediated by mechanosensitive and metabosensitive reflexes, ultimately increase
      oxygen and nutrient delivery to exercising muscle tissues (Mitchell, 1990). Static handgrip
      exercise has been shown to induce alterations in the arterial baroreflex function (Kim, 2005)
      and activation of muscle metaboreflex that increases arterial blood pressure and peripheral
      vasoconstriction, respectively. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) treatment used in
      physical therapy in patients who are unable to tolerate conventional exercise showed to be a
      good alternative for muscle strengthening (Sbruzzi, 2010) and to improve metabolic
      abnormalities (Karavidas, 2006). However, the effect of FES on metaboreflex activation in
      healthy individuals has never been investigated. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the
      metaboreflex activation induced by FES in upper and low limbs in healthy individuals, and
      also to compare their results with the effects caused by isometric exercise.

      All participants will be invited to attend four separate days for completion of the study
      protocols. On the first day, the metaboreflex activation in upper limb will be randomly
      assigned to isometric exercise or FES intervention. On the second day, at least two days
      apart, random isometric exercise or FES intervention will be performed in the upper limb. On
      the third day, at least one week apart, all participants will be assigned to perform
      metaboreflex in a lower limb induced by isometric exercise or FES intervention. On the fourth
      day, at least two days apart, random isometric exercise or FES intervention will be performed
      in a lower limb. To evaluate the isometric exercise and FES intervention the post-exercise
      ischemia will be randomly performed to evaluate the accumulation of metabolites in response
      to activated limb (PECO +) and evaluation control without ischemia (PECO-). The experiments
      between PECO+ and PECO- will be separated by a 30 min interval. During isometric exercise and
      FES protocols the blood flow and peripheral vascular resistance will be assessed by venous
      occlusion plethysmography. Fatigue will be determined every minute by the 10-point Borg scale
      to assess rate of perceived exertion and by blood lactate. Blood lactate will be evaluated
      through capillary action at pre, immediately post exercise and at 5 minutes during the
      recovery period. Hemodynamic variables such as BP and HR will be recorded every minute during
      the protocols.

    <description>The FES will be placed at the flexor muscles of the forearm and knee extensors, for evaluation of upper and lower limbs, respectively. The stimulation frequency will be 20 Hz. The pulse width used will be 0.5 milliseconds and the contraction time will be 60 seconds (TON: 60s) with a 1-second rest interval (TOFF: 1s). The total time of application will be determined for the muscle fatigue that will be evaluated by 10-point Borg scale and by the measurement of lactate accumulation that must not exceed 30 minutes. The intensity will be adjusted individually, taking into account the patient's ability to promote the full flexion of the wrist / knee extension and comfort during contractions. Along with the application of FES a 1 Kg overload will be applied to intensify the fatigue time.</description>
