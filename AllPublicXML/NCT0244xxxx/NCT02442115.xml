  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical manifestation of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex, with medical and
      mental health disruptions that occur with the three core behavioral criteria used for
      diagnosis (social behavior, communication, restricted interests/repetitive behavior).
      Co-occurring medical conditions, such as gastrointestinal dysfunction (GID), often are
      overlooked when designing research strategies to understand the mechanisms underlying the
      expression of ASD. This study was initially a collaboration between Children's Hospital Los
      Angeles (CHLA) and the Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt University. The current research
      project proposes to recruit subject at CHLA and the Center for Autism and Developmental
      Disorders (CAND), a Children's Hospital of Orange County and University of California Irvine
      (UCI) Health collaborative program. In Aim 1, the investigators will characterize GID in
      pediatric populations with ASD. Over a 12 month period, subjects will receive standard of
      care for their GID, typically functional constipation. The study population will be
      characterized with a standardized instrument for diagnosing functional GI disorders in
      children, the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms, and with the clinical
      acumen of an experienced pediatric gastroenterologist. Nutritional information also will be
      collected to determine whether there are patterns of GIDs that correlate with dietary and
      nutritional status. The in-depth characterization and treatment of GIDs in children with ASD
      will provide a unique way of determining if ASD symptom and GID symptom improvement are
      related to each other. In Aim 2, the investigators will do in-depth assessment of each
      subjects functional status for social communication, emotional regulation, cognitive
      function, speech-language, sensory integration, and a biomarker of oxidative stress. The
      latter will be measured in urine samples over the course of one year. There are no direct
      interventions for autism symptoms in this study. Rather, subjects will receive standard of
      care for the GID diagnosis and secondary effects on ASD symptoms will be evaluated. Our power
      calculation shows that the investigators will be adequately powered with the proposed study
      design and recruitment targets. As part of the study, the investigators have developed a
      collaboration with investigators in the University of Southern California (USC) School of
      Engineering, in which the investigators will work with them to develop computational tools to
      assist in the characterization of videotaped Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)
      assessments.

      Children ages 7 years 0 months to 12 years 11 months will be recruited into 1 clinical group
      (ASD+/FC+), utilizing the following clinics in Southern California:

      CHLA-affiliated Clinics

        -  Boone-Fetter Clinic, home of the CHLA Autism Treatment Network

        -  University Center of Excellence on Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD) Clinic at CHLA -
           UC Irvine/Orange County-affiliated clinics

        -  Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders in Orange County

        -  Children's Hospital of Orange County Exclusion criteria include a diagnosed syndromic
           disorder, prematurity, failure to meet standard birth weight, not enrolled in any ASD
           treatment program. For each child, the Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal
           Symptoms (QPGS)-Rome III is administered and the child is seen by a board-certified
           pediatric gastroenterologist. The child will be seen at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months for
           their research visits. Treatment of FC in children with ASD is based on the Autism
           Treatment Network (ATN) modified protocol of the North American Society for Pediatric
           Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and includes the following: 1) a
           thorough dietary history is reviewed and adjusted for introducing a diet rich in fiber
           (or supplements if able to be tolerated by the child; typically this will be in older
           children in the study); 2) assessment of abdominal pain, perianal skin tags,
           hemorrhoids, fissures, rectal exam if needed, frequency of stooling, quality of stool,
           rectal bleeding, other possible associated symptoms such as reflux/dyspepsia, vomiting,
           headaches, increase or decrease in appetite; 3) behavioral techniques, such as toileting
           after meal times, and other strategies are added; and 4) medicine and dietary
           adjustments are made. At each visit, the following instruments/questionnaires will be
           administered by a clinical psychologist: 1) social responsiveness scale; 2) Kaufman
           Brief Intelligence Test; 3) Child Behavior Checklist; 4) Aberrant Behavior Checklist; 5)
           Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Peds QL); 6) Repetitive Behavioral Scale-Revised;
           7) Autism Impact Measure; 8) Pearson Short Sensory Profile. The Vineland will be
           administered at baseline and 12 months. The ADOS-2 will be used at baseline to ensure an
           ASD diagnosis.

      At each visit, subject urine is collected and stored until an assay for the oxidative stress
      marker F2-isoprostane is measured.

      A buccal swab is collected and DNA extracted for future genetic studies.

Measures of ASD symptoms will be done at each visit to determine social communication, emotional and cognitive improvement due to the FC treatment.
