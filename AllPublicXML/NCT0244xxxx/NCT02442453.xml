  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is initiated by microbial biofilm but its progression is mediated by an
      abnormal host response to biofilm microorganisms.

      In a myriad of possible mechanisms that cause periodontal tissue destruction reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) play an important role. Imbalance between antioxidant defense system of body
      and ROS lead to a deleterious situation called oxidative stress.

      Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the key enzyme of body's antioxidant defense system whereas
      malondialdehyde (MDA) is product of lipid peroxidation due to ROS. Free radicals and ROS have
      short half lives in vivo of 10-6 to 10-9 seconds. Hence measurement of ROS is done by
      measuring the concentration of biomarkers of tissue destruction.

      For treating periodontal disease, conventional mechanical therapy comprising of scaling and
      root planing (SRP) along with timely maintenance has been a gold standard and any other
      therapy considered for treating periodontitis should always be used as an adjunctive and
      never in lieu of it.

      Curcumin, a hydrophobic polyphenol, is a principal active constituent of turmeric. Mechanism
      of action of curcumin is twofold-its role as a strong antioxidant and as a strong
      antibacterial. Its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties offer additional
      benefits.Periodontitis is a chronic disease of oral cavity accompanied by increased oxidative
      stress. Therefore the clinical application of a natural antioxidant in the form of curcuma
      longa can be beneficial in reducing oxidative stress and as an adjuvant in treatment of
      chronic periodontitis.

      Aim was to establish efficacy of curcuma longa gel as a topical antioxidant to alleviate
      oxidative stress associated with chronic periodontitis.The objectives were-1) To evaluate the
      presence of oxidative stress by biochemical evaluation of SOD levels and free radical damage
      in the form of MDA levels in whole saliva of chronic periodontitis patients.

      2) To show efficacy of curcuma longa gel as topical antioxidant agent on activity of SOD and
      lipid peroxidation product MDA.

      3) To compare SOD and MDA levels after SRP and SRP plus topical application of curcuma longa
      gel.

      4) To compare the clinical parameters such as Plaque index (PI), Gingival index (GI), Sulcus
      bleeding index (SBI), Probing depth (PD), Clinical attachment level (CAL) between test group
      (TG) and control group (CG).
