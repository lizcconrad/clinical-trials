  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization among
      patients randomized on the BMT CTN 1302 protocol, &quot;Multicenter Phase II, Double-blind Placebo
      Controlled Trial of Maintenance Ixazomib after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell
      Transplantation for High Risk Multiple Myeloma&quot;. It is hypothesized that Ixazomib maintenance
      therapy will result in improved PFS in patients with high-risk multiple myeloma following
      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) compared to placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a Phase II, multi-center double-blind trial that randomizes patients
      with high risk Multiple Myeloma to Ixazomib maintenance or placebo 60-120 days after
      allogeneic HSCT. The primary objective of this randomized trial is to compare progression
      free survival from randomization as a time to event endpoint between patients randomized to
      Ixazomib maintenance or placebo. Secondary objectives are to describe for each treatment arm:
      rates of grade II-IV and III-IV Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD, best disease
      response rates, disease progression, transplant related mortality, overall survival, rates of
      Grade ≥ 3 toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
      Version 4.0, incidence of infections, and health-related quality of life.
