  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of FF, an ICS and VI, an orally inhaled LABA has been developed as a
      once-daily combination therapy for the long-term maintenance treatment of asthma in adults
      and children &gt;=12 years of age. Pivotal phase III studies have demonstrated the safety and
      efficacy of FF/VI in asthma. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that randomised
      clinical trials tend to be highly controlled and enrol a more highly selected subject
      population than is expected to be prescribed the medication post-approval. There is a need
      for data in a more representative population in close to a 'real life' conditions, where
      physicians have the ability to choose the best treatment in their view for any individual
      subject and adapt treatments to subjects' characteristics and response. This multi-center,
      open-label, randomized, parallel group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of FF/VI
      compared with two usual ICS/LABA fixed combination (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol [FP/S]
      or budesonide/formoterol [BUD/F]) in subjects with persistent asthma, in a &quot;close to real
      life&quot; settings. FF/VI will be administered once-daily (QD) via ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler
      (DPI) and FP/S or BUD/F will be administered twice daily (BID) via DISKUS™ and TURBUHALER™
      DPI respectively. ELLIPTA is a new powder inhaler designed to be easy to use. The total
      duration of subject participation will be approximately 6 months (24 weeks). ELLIPTA and
      DISKUS are registered trademarks of the GSK group of companies. TURBUHALER is a registered
      trademark of AstraZeneca.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>ACT is a validated self-administered questionnaire utilising 5 questions to assess asthma control during the past 4 weeks on a 5-point categorical scale (1 to 5). The total score is calculated as the sum of the scores from all 5 questions. By answering all 5 questions a subject with asthma can obtain a score that may range between 5 and 25, with higher scores indicating better control. Change from baseline was calculated as Total ACT score at week 12 minus total ACT score at baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to read the instruction leaflet of the assigned device and will be instructed by the investigator on the proper use of inhalers. Then, subject will be asked to self-administer dose of assigned study drug. Any errors (critical or non-critical) made by the subject will be recorded by the health care professional (HCP). A critical error is defined as an error which may impact the ability of drug to reach the lung and hence impact efficacy. Overall errors includes non-critical errors.</description>
