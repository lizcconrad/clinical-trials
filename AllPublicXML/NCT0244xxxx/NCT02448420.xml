      This is a phase II, prospective, open-label, multicentre, Simon's two-stage-design study of
      the combination of palbociclib plus trastuzumab, with or without letrozole, in
      post-menopausal patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      (MBC) who have received chemotherapy and treatment with trastuzumab for their metastatic
      disease.The aim of the PATRICIA study is test the hypothesis that the addition of Palbociclib
      to standard therapy is well tolerated and can provide a benefit in progression-free survival
      in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer previously treated for their metastatic disease.

      This is a phase II, prospective, open-label, multicentre, Simon's two-stage-design study of
      the combination of palbociclib plus trastuzumab, with or without letrozole, in
      post-menopausal patients with HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      (MBC) who have received chemotherapy and treatment with trastuzumab for their metastatic
      disease.

      All patients will have histologically-confirmed HER2-positive breast adenocarcinoma and must
      have received at least 2 (maximum 4) previous lines of regimens for locally advanced disease
      or MBC. Patients must have radiological evidence of progression with at least one line of
      treatment including trastuzumab for locally advanced disease or MBC.

      Three patient cohorts will be formed on the basis of their hormone receptor status and
      treatment assignation. Cohort A will include patients with ER negative, HER2 positive breast
      cancer, who will receive trastuzumab plus palbociclib. Cohort B1 will include patients with
      ER positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who will receive trastuzumab plus palbociclib.
      Cohort B2 will include patients with ER positive, HER2 positive breast cancer, who will
      receive trastuzumab plus palbociclib plus letrozole. To avoid imbalance, assignation of
      ERpositive,HER2 positive patients to cohorts B1 and B2 will be randomised.

      The concomitant administration of trastuzumab plus palbociclib, or trastuzumab plus
      palbociclib plus letrozole have not been studied in a typical phase I clinical trial. For
      this reason, an initial safety phase will be conducted in each cohort. The first 6 patients
      included in each combination (3 patients in cohort A, 3 patients in cohort B1 and 6 patients
      in cohort B2, 12 patients in total) will undergo additional cardiac and haematological safety
      monitoring.

      The inclusion of these 12 patients will be done in cohorts of 3 for each of the two treatment
      combinations, analogous to the rate of patient inclusion in Phase I studies of classic
      design. If any unexpected toxicity is observed at the end of the second cycle of the third
      included patient, the inclusion in the safety run-in phase will continue up to 3 more
      patients in each treatment combination arm for a total of 12 patients. After this initial
      phase of safety, an independent monitoring data committee will meet in an extraordinary way
      to evaluate the safety data derived from observations of these 12 patients. If the
      evaluations are positive for safety regimes, the recruitment of the study will proceed until
      first stage inclusion completion, which is inclusion of 15 patients in each arm.

      The sample size was calculated according to Simon's optimal 2-stage design. The 3 cohorts
      will allow early stopping if the desired efficacy is not observed in stage 1. Accordingly, 15
      patients must be included in each group during the first stage. If 5 patients or fewer show
      progression-free survival at 6 months, the trial will be stopped (interim efficacy analysis).
      When the results of the interim analysis are available, the Steering Committee (SC) will
      review the data and will ultimately recommend which groups or cohorts will go on to stage
      2.The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will evaluate the safety data in patients
      included in the initial safety phase in an interim safety analysis, and will give
      recommendations to the SC regarding the continuation of the study or otherwise, on the basis
      of the toxicity data.

      Inclusion of patients will continue until a total of 46 patients are included, in order to
      detect a difference of 20% or greater (that is equal or more than 50%) in PFS at 6 months. A
      treatment regimen will be considered effective if more than 18 patients of the total 46 show
      progression-free survival at 6 months (final analysis), reaching 80% power with an alpha of
      0.05 level of significance.

      In summary, taking into account all possible scenarios for the 3 cohorts, the following total
      number of patients may be recruited:

      Minimum of 45 patients (early stopping of 3 cohorts). 76 (early stopping of 2 cohorts). 107
      (early stopping of one cohort). Maximum 138 patients (the 3 cohorts go on to stage 2).
