    <textblock>
      This prospective, global, multicenter, randomized, controlled study is designed to evaluate
      the safety and effectiveness of the Lutonix 035 AV Drug Coated Balloon PTA Catheter compared
      to a standard PTA Catheter in treating subjects presenting with clinical and hemodynamic
      abnormalities in native arteriovenous (AV) fistulae located in the upper extremity.

    <description>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a procedure that can open up a blocked blood vessel using a small, flexible plastic tube, or catheter, with a &quot;balloon&quot; at the end of it. When the tube is in place, it inflates to open the blood vessel, or artery, so that normal blood flow is restored.</description>
