  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood maltreatment is remarkably prevalent, and it has been shown to be associated with a
      wide spectrum of mental health problems, and it also been shown to be associated with smaller
      hippocampal volumes. This trial aims to see whether the 8-week mindfulness based stress
      reduction intervention can reduce the symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD for young
      adults with childhood maltreatment, and whether it can increase the hippocampal volumes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty subjects with early life adversity such as parental emotional neglect, verbal abuse,
      physical abuse, sexual abuse or peer bullying, will be recruited into the study, half of them
      will be allocated to the group to receive an 8-week mindfulness based stress reduction(MBSR)
      intervention, half of them will be allocated to the waitlist control group which will
      complete the same research procedures as the MBSR group at the same time and receive the MBSR
      intervention after the waiting period. MRI and a battery of self report questionnaires will
      be administered before and after the intervention for investigating changes in hippocampal
      volumes, perceived stress, depression and anxiety. Primary hypotheses include increased
      hippocampal volumes and reduced levels of perceived stress, depression and anxiety.
