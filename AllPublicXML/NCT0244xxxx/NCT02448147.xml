      BACKGROUND: The physiopathology of the heart failure involves compensatory mechanisms as
      exacerbated neurohormonal activity, endothelial dysfunction and consequently the muscle
      disability and exercise intolerance. The interval exercise training has been proposed as one
      efficient method to heart failure patients. It seems that the main mechanism involved in the
      benefit of the interval exercise training is &quot;shear stress&quot;. AIM: To study the interval
      exercise training versus the continuous exercise training in the sympathetic activity and in
      the peripheral muscle perfusion in heart failure patients. Moreover, we will evaluate the
      muscle apoptosis, microRNA in plasma and muscle biopsy, biomarkers levels of inflammation,
      quality of life and exercise capacity. METODOLOGY: Will be selected 40 patients (male and
      female) with age between 30 and 60 years, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%
      and functional class I, II and III. These patients will be randomized into three groups:
      Interval (AIT), continuous (MCT) and control (CG). All patients will be evaluated with
      microneurography, peripheral muscle perfusion, muscle biopsy, blood samples, accelerometer,
      cardiopulmonary exercise test and quality of life before and after end of the period of 03
      (three) months.
