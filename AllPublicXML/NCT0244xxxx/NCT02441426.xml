  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is considered one of the most prevalent risk factors for morbidity and mortality
      in children under five. An estimated 20% of children in the developing world are malnourished
      [1] and poor nutrition is linked to more than half of all child deaths worldwide [2].
      Malnutrition in early childhood may lead to cognitive and physical deficits and may cause
      similar deficits in future generations as malnourished mothers give birth to low birth weight
      children [3]. In addition, malnutrition increases susceptibility and incidence of infections
      and is associated with diminished response to vaccines.

      The MAL-ED Project is designed to determine the impact of enteric infections/diarrhea that
      alter gut function and impair children's nutrition, growth and development to help develop
      new intervention strategies that can break the vicious enteric infection-malnutrition cycle
      and reduce its global burden.

      The overall objective of the MAL-ED Project is to quantify the associations of specific
      enteric pathogens, measures of physical and mental development, micronutrient malnutrition,
      gut function biomarkers, the gut microbiome, and immune responses in very young children in
      resource-limited settings across eight sites that vary by culture, economics, geography, and
      climate.

      The central hypothesis of the MAL-ED Project is that infection (and co-infection) with
      specific enteropathogens leads to impaired growth and development and to diminished immune
      response to orally administered vaccines by causing intestinal inflammation and/or by
      altering intestinal barrier and absorptive function. Data analyses will test for associations
      between enteropathogen infections and growth/development to help illuminate:

        -  which micro-organisms or mixed infections are most frequently associated with growth
           faltering and poor development; and

        -  at what age specific infections cause the most disruption to growth and development and
           impair immune response.
