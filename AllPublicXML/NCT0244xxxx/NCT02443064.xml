  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Drug resistance of G+ cocci is a severe healthcare problem. According to the Ministry of
           Health National Antimicrobial Resistant Investigation Net (mohnarin) surveillance
           report, the isolation rate of MRSA is some 60% in China. MRSA infection has become a
           serious clinical problem;

        2. Vancomycin is a bactericidal glycopeptide antibiotic which inhibits bacterial growth by
           hindering the synthesis of cell wall in bacteria. It exerts strong antibiotic effect to
           Gram+ bacteria. It is indicated for serious staphylococcus infections especially MRSA
           infection and has become the gold standard agent in MRSA treatment;

        3. Vancomycin is a time-dependent antibiotic, its clinical and microbiological efficacy is
           related to area under curve（ AUC）/minimum inhibitory concentration （MIC ）(AUIC). Cmin at
           steady state is an surrogate parameter of AUIC, which is closely associated to the
           efficacy;

        4. AUIC &gt;400 and Cmin between 15~20 mg/L are recommended for effective vancomycin treatment
           by Infectious Diseases Society of America （IDSA） although it is still disputable;

        5. Due to the absence of PK/PD study on vancomycin in China, administration of vancomycin
           is performed in reference to the recommendation of IDSA. Its suitability to Chinese
           patients is still to be clarified;

        6. Plasma concentrations of vancomycin vary significantly between population and
           individuals. Factors such as large-volume fluid infusion, hypoproteinemia and renal
           clearance, etc. will influence the distribution and excretion of vancomycin, resulting
           in different plasma concentrations between individuals. Results of PK studies differ
           greatly between China and abroad. Administration based on the AUIC or Cmin recommended
           by IDSA would not be suitable to Chinese patients. Given the definite long-term benefit
           of vancomycin treatment, the AUIC or Cmin suitable to Chinese patients must be
           identified by clinical study.

        7. The PK/PD study on vancomycin in the treatment to MRSA septicemia and endocarditis is of
           great significance for more reasonable use and improved therapeutic efficacy of MRSA
           infection.

      Study design:

      A multi-center, non-controlled, open-labeled observational study

      Research objectives

      Primary objective:

      To explore the PK/PD target value (AUIC) of vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA septicemia
      and endocarditis in Chinese patients.

      Secondary objective:

      To detect the therapeutic efficacy and safety of vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA
      septicemia and endocarditis in Chinese patients.

      To exam the relationship between the Cmin of vancomycin and its efficacy in the treatment to
      MRSA septicemia and endocarditis.

      To explore the relationship between MRSA molecular type and vancomycin therapeutic efficacy

      Medicine and administration

      Drug:

      Vancomycin

      Dosing:

      15~20 mg/kg, IV, q 12~8h (or 1 g, IV, q12~8h) for adult patient with normal renal function;
      Dosage should be adjusted by blood creatinine clearance in patients with impaired renal
      function; Administration route： 1~2 h/ dosing, IV

      Drug combination:

      Drug combination is not recommended for patients with simple MRSA infection; Rifampicin can
      be combined in case of MRSA artificial valve endocarditis; Anti-G- antibacterial agents can
      be combined in case of concurrent G- bacterial infections.

      Duration:

      Septicemia: 2~4 weeks Endocarditis: 6~8 weeks
