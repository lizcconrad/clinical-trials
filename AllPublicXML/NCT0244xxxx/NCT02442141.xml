      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effects of routine anesthesia on infant
      brain oxygen levels. The investigators do not know how anesthesia effects blood flow in the
      brain of infants during surgery. This study will help the investigators detect possible blood
      flow changes in the brain for infants undergoing anesthesia. A monitor and sensors (NIRS or
      near-infrared spectroscopy) which use light to measure oxygen levels in the blood will be
      used. Sensors will rest on the child's skin and record measurements before, during and after
      the surgery.

      Pre-operatively medical history will be collected along with baseline physiological data
      (Blood pressure, heart rate, date of birth, date of surgery, weight, gestational age at
      birth, gender, medical conditions, and medications). Given the importance of reliable blood
      pressure measurement- during the study, strict guidelines regarding proper blood pressure
      cuff placement and choice of cuff size will be followed. An upper extremity and the cuff
      index lines will be used to make sure that the cuff is appropriately sized. NIRS sensors will
      be applied pre-operatively in the operating room prior to induction of anesthesia. All NIRS
      values will be collected as blind values so as to not influence anesthetic management or
      clinical decisions.

      Intra-operatively the NIRS values will be blindly recorded, physiological data and details of
      the anesthesia (the conduct of all clinical monitoring, including blood pressure measurements
      and anesthesia will not be affected in any way by this study). No additional blood pressure
      or other measurements will be made.

      One week later the hospital record (for those infants still hospitalized) will be reviewed
      for evidence of new changes in neurological status (specifically seizures or other
      generalized or focal neurological deficits noted by the clinical team in the record and
      physical exam). For infants discharged home prior to one week after surgery, a phone call
      will be made to inquire about the occurrence of any events that required medical attention or
      treatment.

    <description>This data will be obtained by using an FDA-approved NIRS monitor. This device measures regional tissue hemoglobin saturation using combinations of spatially resolved near-infrared spectroscopy and modified Beer-Lambert law approaches, along with measure changes in tissue hemoglobin concentrations; in combination, these measurements allow changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in the tissue to be calculated. Data will be recorded prior to induction of anesthesia and throughout the procedure until the infant begins to wake or 30 after arrival to the unit, whichever occurs first.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 6 months

          -  Scheduled for intubation/anesthesia for clinical purposes for a surgical procedure in
             the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Main operating room that is expected to
             last longer than 30 minutes

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children where application of the NIRS would be impractical: for example surgery on
             the head or neck.

          -  Children scheduled for cardiac surgery

          -  Children with known major cardiovascular shunting

          -  Children with known or suspected neurological abnormalities
