      The proposed project will help in assessing the effectiveness of a demand-side financing
      project that provides family planning services bundled in a package of postnatal care and
      infant immunization services. This approach will use postnatal and infant health as a gateway
      to family planning - building confidence among the client and her influencers in the provider
      and repositioning family planning as part of a continuum of care to ensure the health of the
      mother and the infant. Vouchers will help in creating demand among poor women for the Family
      planning and child immunization. Also incentivizing providers against each voucher will help
      in improving their counselling skills as they will spend more time with voucher clients
      resulting is a satisfied client and better compliance with Family planning methods.
