      Study 201283 is an exploratory, non-controlled, non-drug study in Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis (ALS) subjects. This study is being conducted as the first step for developing new
      meaningful measure(s) which might prove to be more effective than existing measures for
      monitoring clinical function and disease course in ALS. The objective of this study is to
      test novel measures of movement/physical activity, heart rate and speech and explore how they
      measure disease progression by evaluating their relationship to gold standard measures of
      function. This study will be conducted in two phases. A variable length Pilot Phase to test
      biotelemetry instruments and algorithms reliability and ease of use/acceptance. Approximately
      5 subjects will have at least 1 clinic visit to perform a series of set reference tasks while
      wearing the accelerometer and electrode. Subjects will also continuously wear the
      accelerometer and electrode in their routine home-life setting for approximately 3 days after
      the clinic visit (i.e., home monitoring). Subjects in the Pilot Phase will continue in the
      study and participate in the Core Study Phase. A 48 week Core Study Phase will be conducted
      to evaluate how measures of movement/physical activity, speech and Heart Rate Variability
      (HRV) relate to ALS disease progression. During this phase, a maximum of 25 subjects will be
      enrolled. Subjects will attend 5 clinic visits to perform gold standard measures of function
      and perform a series of set reference tasks while wearing the accelerometer and electrode. In
      between clinic visits, every month subjects will attach the accelerometer and electrode and
      wear it for approximately 3 days in their home. A telephone contact with the subject will be
      made by the site at the end of each 3-day home monitoring period.

    <description>During Pilot phase,subjects will attend clinic at least once to perform a series of set reference tasks while wearing the accelerometer and electrode. Subjects will also continuously wear the accelerometer and electrode in their routine home-life setting for approximately 3 days after the clinic visit (home monitoring). During 48 week Core Study, subjects will attend 5 clinic visits to perform gold standard measures of function (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised and Forced Vital Capacity) and perform a series of set reference tasks while wearing the accelerometer and electrode. Subjects will also continuously wear the accelerometer and electrode in their routine home-life setting for approximately 3 days after the clinic visits (home monitoring). In between clinic visits, subjects will attach the accelerometer and electrode and wear it for approximately 3 days in their home.

    <description>Each subject will be issued one FS and a MAT LifeInsight Hub for use during the study. At each clinic visit in the Pilot and Core Study Phases, the Faros sensor will be placed on the subject just prior to the defined reference tasks and will be worn on the subject's sternum during completion of the tasks. The morning after the clinic visit, the subject will re-attach the sensor and wear it for approximately 3 days. In between visits during the Core Study Phase the subject will wear the FS every month for approximately 3 days to enable data collection on a monthly basis over the 48 week study period. Movement/physical activity data will be collected by the FS throughout the study.</description>
