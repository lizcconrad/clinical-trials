      Primary research question: What is the effect of indoor rowing, under the ideal circumstances
      of a laboratory setting, on glucose control in adults with impaired glucose control?

      Secondary research question: Is it possible to develop a full-scale study of the benefits of
      indoor rowing under the usual circumstances of a community setting?

      Why? It is good practice to conduct a small pilot study before embarking on an expensive
      full-scale study.

      What? Around 150 minutes of aerobic exercise and around 150 minutes of resistance exercise
      per week are necessary to meet prevailing recommendations for adults with impaired glucose
      control. Around 120 minutes of indoor rowing per week might be a less time-consuming
      alternative to prevailing recommendations because indoor rowing involves a combination of
      aerobic and resistance exercise.

      Who? Twenty men and postmenopausal women aged 45-65 years with impaired glucose regulation,
      such as those with type 2 diabetes. Eligible volunteers will not have smoked in the last
      year, will not have exercised regularly in the last six months, and will not be taking any
      form of diabetes medication other than metformin. Eligible volunteers will have stable weight
      and a body mass index of 25-40.

      Where and how? Before and after the exercise intervention, glucose control (postprandial
      blood glucose concentrations) will be assessed at Leicester Diabetes Centre and cardiac
      function (MRI) will be assessed at Glenfield Hospital. During the exercise intervention,
      participants will use an indoor rower three times per week for 12 weeks at Leicester Diabetes
      Centre. Participants will be taught how to row correctly and the duration and intensity will
      gradually increase. In order to inform the design of a full-scale trial, recruitment rate
      will be assessed, adherence will be monitored, and a third party will interview participants
      to find out if the intervention and assessments are feasible and acceptable.

    <time_frame>Semi-structured interviews will be conducted during (week 5 or 6) and after (week 14) the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The interview during the intervention will focus on recruitment literature, screening procedures, baseline assessments, and first impressions of indoor rowing. The interview after the intervention will focus on participants' experiences of indoor rowing, including their likes, dislikes and suggestions. Each interview will last around 30 to 60 minutes and will be led by an independent researcher not involved in the day-to-day conduct of the study. Some questions and topics will be predetermined, but conversations will be allowed to flow freely and change according to the interviewer's discretion.</description>

    <description>Haemoglobin A1C is a longer-term marker of glucose control and may be an appropriate outcome for a full-scale trial. The investigators wish to use the sample standard deviation from this pilot study in haemoglobin A1C (and, possibly, other variables) to estimate the population standard deviation and, thus, the power of a full-scale trial.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive usual care, including standard advice about diet and physical activity. In addition to usual care, participants will be asked to take part in a 12-week exercise programme. Participants will use an indoor rower (Concept 2, Model E) three times per week at Leicester Diabetes Centre. Each session will be supervised and the investigators will liaise with the participants to arrange convenient times to exercise, including mornings and evenings. The supervisors will teach the participants how to row correctly.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study.

          -  Participant is willing to allow their general practitioner to be informed of any
             incidental findings.

          -  Eligible men will be 45 to 65 years of age.

          -  Eligible women will be 45 to 65 years of age and will be postmenopausal, defined as no
             menstrual period in the last 12 months.

          -  Body mass index of 25 to 40 kg·m-2.

          -  Stable weight, defined as self-reported weight change of less than 5 kg in the last
             six months.

          -  Impaired glucose regulation, defined as impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma
             glucose of 5.6 to 6.9 mmol·l-1), or impaired glucose tolerance (two-hour plasma
             glucose in the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test of 7.8 to 11.0 mmol·l-1), or
             haemoglobin A1C of 6.0% or greater, or type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma glucose of 7.0
             mmol·l-1 or greater on two occasions).

          -  Volunteers with type 2 diabetes will either be treatment naïve or will have been
             taking a stable dose of metformin for at least four weeks prior to study entry.

          -  White European ethnicity. There are ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease risk
             and prevailing definitions of dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and diabetes cannot
             account for these differences (Forouhi et al., Diabetologia, 2006, 49, 2580-8; Tillin
             et al., Journal of the American College of Cardiology, 2013, 61, 1777-86). Therefore,
             in order to make valid inferences, the investigators will only include white Europeans
             on this occasion.

          -  Little or no participation in exercise: eligible volunteers will not have been
             exercising two or more times per week for 20 minutes or longer for the last six
             months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers with type 2 diabetes will be excluded if they are taking any form of
             diabetes medication other than metformin.

          -  Known cardiovascular disease.

          -  Symptoms of angina.

          -  Resting systole blood pressure ≥180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mm Hg.

          -  Statin use.

          -  Beta-blocker use.

          -  Verapamil use.

          -  Hormone replacement therapy.

          -  Any smoking in the last year.

          -  Any absolute contraindication to exercise testing.

          -  Abnormal exercise test.

          -  Inability to undertake an exercise programme for any reason.

          -  Participation in a research study involving an investigational produce in the past 12
             weeks.

          -  Female volunteers who are pregnant, lactating or planning pregnancy during the course
             of the study. Pregnancy will be discussed during the consent procedure and the
             investigators will provide those in any doubt with a pregnancy test kit.

          -  Chronic kidney disease (EGFR of ≤30).

          -  Any metal implants.
