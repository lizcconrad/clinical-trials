  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Entre Familia was a 4-year randomized controlled trial funded by the American Cancer Society.
      The study was conducted in Imperial County, California, and involved a partnership between
      the Institute for Behavioral and Community Health at San Diego State University and Cl√≠nicas
      de Salud del Pueblo, Inc. a private, non-profit corporation providing comprehensive primary
      care services to residents throughout Imperial and Riverside Counties. The investigators
      enrolled 361 Latina mothers and one of their children aged between 7 and 13 years old; in 25%
      of families, the father was also enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to either an
      intervention or delayed-treatment control condition. The intervention consisted of a
      community health worker (or promotora)-delivered home-based intervention to promote healthy
      eating. The promotoras used a telenovela DVD series and accompanying manual, both written and
      produced by study staff. The intervention was delivered through 11 home visits and 4 support
      telephone calls over a 4 month period. Participants in the delayed-treatment condition
      received intervention materials when evaluation assessments had been completed. Evaluation
      measures were taken at baseline, 4 months (immediate post-intervention) and 10 months
      (6-months post intervention). Participants completed a self-report interview with study staff
      at each time point. Height and weight measurements were also collected for the mothers and
      children. The primary outcomes were changes in mothers' daily fruit and vegetable intake.
      Secondary outcomes for mothers, children and fathers included changes in fat intake, sugary
      beverage intake, parenting strategies, and perceived barriers to healthy eating.
