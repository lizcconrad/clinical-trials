  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to develop an improved understanding of the long term
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of natalizumab with both standard dosing and extended
      dosing, and collect additional samples to explore cell-based biomarkers of natalizumab
      treatment and PML risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The underlying etiology for the association of natalizumab therapy to an increase risk of
      progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) remains unknown. It is possible that
      persistently high natalizumab levels lead to sustained immune-modulation or suppression
      resulting in an increased PML risk. Since 2010 we have conducted three investigator initiated
      trials (IITs) at our center to measure serum natalizumab concentration, lymphocyte alpha 4
      integrin saturation, and other biomarkers to understand the association of these markers to
      PML risk. A number of the patients who participated in these clinical trials are still
      infusing. These studies have demonstrated that plasma natalizumab concentrations continue to
      rise over time with a plateau effect not yet clearly delineated. Improved drug clearance in
      patients with higher body weight is described in the prescribing information. We have
      accumulated preliminary data suggesting that patients with lower body weight may be at higher
      risk for PML and that this may relate to higher drug concentrations and saturations seen in
      this group. Dose extension may be a viable option to lower drug concentration
      (pharmacokinetic, PK) and saturation (pharmacodynamic, PD) in patients with lower body weight
      to potentially impact PML incidence. In addition to the PK/PD of natalizumab, host related
      biomarkers may allow for more specific PML risk stratification. Further validation of these
      biomarkers is critical for our understanding of their utility.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group A: Natalizumab Naïve</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group will consist of up to 10 people who are naïve to natalizumab (haven't received the drug before) and are just beginning therapy. These participants will meet with the study staff at Week 0 (Baseline) prior to their natalizumab infusion. They will then have a follow up appointment every 3 months for the first 12 months of their natalizumab infusions, for a total of 5 visits. Natalizumab concentration and other biomarkers will be measured at each visit.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group B: Intracycle Regular Dosing</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group will consist of at least 50 people who are on a regular infusing cycle of 28-31 days. These participants will be consented at Week 0 (Baseline) and asked to come back each week during their regular cycle at Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3, for a total of 4 study visits. Natalizumab concentration and other biomarkers will be measured during their participation in the study.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group C: Intracycle Extended Dosing</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group will consist of up to 60 people who are on an extended infusing cycle of greater than 30 days. These participants will be consented at Week 0 (Baseline) and asked to come back each week for a blood draw to measure Natalizumab concentration and other biomarkers during their extended cycle at Week 2, and Week 4, for a total of 3 study visits.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group D: Transition Dosing</arm_group_label>
    <description>This group will consist of up to 10 people who are on a regular infusing cycle of 28-30 days who will be transitioning to an extended dosing cycle. The decision to transition will be made by their treating neurologist. These participants will be consented at Week 0 (Baseline) and will be followed for 8 cycles. Natalizumab concentration will be measured at each cycle. During certain cycles, other biomarkers will be measured.</description>
