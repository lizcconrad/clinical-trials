    <measure>Photoirritation as measured through the use of dressings containing tested product and placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>05 days</time_frame>
    <description>The photoirritation will be measured with the use of four dressings that will be applied in the volunteer (3 dresssings containing different placebos and 1 containing the product). After some hours, the region is evaluated and irradiated with UVA. That procedure occurs during the period of five days.</description>

    <description>The photosensitization will be measured with the use of four dressings that will be applied in the volunteer (3 dresssings containing different placebos and 1 containing the product). After some hours, the region is evaluated and irradiated with UVA. That procedure occurs during the period of 32 days.</description>

    <description>This study is designed as a single group assignment, because the 4 dressings (3 placebos and 1 containing the product) will be applied in all volunteers. This means that the region in which the tested product will be applied will be compared with the other placebo regions in the same volunteer.</description>
