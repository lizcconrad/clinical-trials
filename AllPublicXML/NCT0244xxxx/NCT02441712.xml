  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) regarding the conservative treatment of
      patellofemoral pain (PFP) with an impairment based rehabilitation program. Those with PFP can
      have a variety of impairments, such as knee and hip muscle weakness, poor movement patterns,
      weak core activation and muscle tightness. Several recent RCT trials have looked at treating
      single impairments, but to date no RCT have address individualized patient impairments during
      a rehabilitation program. Abnormal muscle firing patterns have also been identified during
      functional tasks; such as jogging, stair climbing, and performing a single leg squat.
      Conflicting studies have produced changes to the quadriceps and hip muscle firing patterns
      with those with PFP. The abnormal activation patterns has been suggested to be why
      strengthening programs alone do not improve movement patterns during functional tasks for
      those with PFP. Patterned electrical neuromuscular stimulation (PENS) is a novel form of
      electrical stimulation that replicates proper firing patterns based off healthy
      electromyography patterns. The purpose of the study is to investigate the benefits of PENS
      with a impairment based rehabilitation program for the treatment of PFP. The rationale for
      this investigation is to assess the benefits of PENS with therapeutic exercise at improving
      altered firing patterns of the lower extremity muscles during functional tasks.
