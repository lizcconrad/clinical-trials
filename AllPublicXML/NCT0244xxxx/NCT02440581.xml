  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) represents the bone histologic abnormalities resulting from loss
      of renal function. It starts early during the loss of kidney function and is seen in
      virtually all chronic end stage kidney disease patients on dialysis (CKD-5D). A major
      component of ROD is bone loss leading to chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated
      osteoporosis. Debilitating hip fractures occur in patients with CKD at a rate 4.4 times
      higher than in the general population, with associated high costs, morbidity and an annual
      mortality of 64%. CKD osteoporosis is distinctly different from post-menopausal osteoporosis.
      Presently, no uniformly accepted CKD osteoporosis treatment protocol exists because of
      challenges related to racially specific bone turnover states. Therefore, most physicians are
      reluctant to treat this disorder despite the profound impact on health and quality of life,
      and its association with vascular calcifications. These vascular calcifications confer an
      increased risk for cardiovascular events which are the major cause of the over 20% annual
      mortality rate in CKD-5D patients.

      The goal of the proposed controlled randomized study is to test the concept that CKD
      osteoporosis can be successfully treated when treatment is individualized by patients'
      turnover status. The study will demonstrate that reversal of bone loss can be achieved by
      increasing bone formation in low turnover patients, and by reducing bone resorption in normal
      or high turnover patients. A second aim of this study is to provide new information whether
      these treatments will also retard progression of vascular calcifications. Blood tests
      measuring FGF23, indicators of Wnt pathway activity, bone resorption and formation will be
      followed to understand potential mechanisms and to evaluate their usefulness for prediction
      of changes in bone mass and vascular calcifications.

      CKD-5D patients with established osteoporosis will be enrolled into one of two treatment arms
      based on bone turnover status. Each arm will be adaptively randomized by race, age and gender
      into treatment or control groups. In the low turnover arm, teriparatide combined with
      cinacalcet will be given, and in the normal or high turnover arm, alendronate will be
      administered. Bone mineral density will be measured at baseline and after one year of
      treatment by quantitative computed tomography. Calcifications of the coronaries, aorta and
      heart valves will also be measured at the same times by multi-detector computed tomography.

      If this proof-of-concept study is successful, it will offer a heretofore unavailable
      treatment for osteoporosis in CKD-5D patients thus changing the prevailing clinical practice
      paradigm. This will provide immediate benefit to CKD patients by reducing fracture risk, bone
      pain, and cardiovascular risk, while greatly improving their quality of life. These
      improvements will also convey major socioeconomic benefits by decreasing the high associated
      treatment costs. The proposed study is highly relevant to the National Institute of Diabetes
      and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' mission of disseminating science-based information to
      improve the health and quality of life for patients with endocrine, metabolic and kidney
      diseases.

          -  Clinical condition that may limit study participation (e.g., unstable angina,
             respiratory distress, infections).

          -  Chronic alcoholism and/or drug addiction;

          -  Known Paget 's disease of bone;

          -  Prior external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the skeleton;

          -  Planning to move out of the area within 1 year of the study;

          -  On active transplant list;

          -  BMD t-score of the radius less than -3.5 by DXA (to avoid the known potential negative
             effects of teriparatide treatment on BMD of the radius);

          -  Planned or anticipated oral surgery within the next 12 months;

          -  Current treatment with medicines containing digoxin or warfarin;

          -  Calcidiol level below the normal range. (The current routine clinical practice in our
             dialysis clinics is to check calcidiol status twice yearly and supplement with vitamin
             D according to serum calcidiol levels. It is therefore unlikely that a substantial
             number of patients will be excluded due to this exclusion criterion.)
