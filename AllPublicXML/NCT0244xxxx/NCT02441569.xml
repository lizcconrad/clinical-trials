  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial examines the effectiveness of training pediatric primary care providers (nurse
      practitioners, doctors) to use of strategies that enhance family/youth empowerment and
      engagement during office visits for children with mild to moderate problems with anxiety.
      Children coming for routine care at one clinic are screened for anxiety symptoms and seen by
      either a specially trained provider or one of the clinic's other regular staff members.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children who are thought to have mild to moderate anxiety will, via their parents, be offered
      the opportunity to receive treatment from their pediatric primary care provider. Providers
      will either use their existing anxiety approaches or will use those approaches combined with
      extra communication skills designed to promote patient and parent engagement in care.
      Children will be seen for up to 4 30-minute visits at 2 week intervals, with a follow-up
      telephone call 3 months later to asses the impact of treatment. Children with more severe
      anxiety (or those whose parents so desire) will be referred for specialized mental health
      care.
