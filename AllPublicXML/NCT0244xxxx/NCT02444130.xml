  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study was to identify electrophysiological predictive markers of
      post-correction visual comfort for presbyopic patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For each participant, presbyopia was compensated with contact lenses by monovision during
      three weeks and multifocality (three weeks again). A break of two weeks without any
      presbyopia compensation came in between the two phases of the test that were randomized.

      All subjects were tested three times: before any compensation, after three weeks with
      monovsion and after three weeks with multifocality.

      Each testing session was strictly the same including visual examinations and VEPs (visual
      evoked potentials).
