  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators introduce a new &quot;capsule-reserved&quot; cataract surgical
      procedure in which anterior lens capsule is reserved and attached onto posterior lens capsule
      in the purpose of preventing posterior capsule opacification (PCO). A prospective randomized
      controlled study is reported to compare the new &quot;capsule-reserved&quot; surgical procedure with
      conventional one on the effectiveness to prevent posterior capsule opacification in
      age-related cataract patients.

    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized controlled study of 240 eligible patients will been enrolled. Two
      eyes of each patient were assigned randomly to two groups respectively: Group I; anterior
      lens capsule is conventionally not reserved after continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis, while
      in Group II, anterior lens capsule is innovatively reserved and attached onto posterior lens
      capsule. This novel adjusted surgical procedure, featured by using the reserved anterior lens
      capsule to protect the peri-capsule microenvironment and prevent PCO, is conceptual different
      from the traditional cataract surgical procedure. Clinical examinations including posterior
      capsule opacification grading score, central posterior capsule thickness, central posterior
      capsule density, best corrected visual acuity, contrast sensitivity were carried out
      preoperatively and at each postoperative visit.
