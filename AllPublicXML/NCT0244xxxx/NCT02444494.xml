      The objective of this non-interventional study is to evaluate clinical effectiveness and cost
      effectiveness of Dysport within the reimbursement scheme called &quot;drug programme&quot; funded by
      Polish National Health Fund (NHF) for patients with post stroke ULS. The study is designed to
      collect data in patients scheduled to receive Dysport treatment in a drug programme, based on
      routine treatment of subject with ULS.
