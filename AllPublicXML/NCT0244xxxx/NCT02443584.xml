      This is a randomized, control group design of pharmacogenetic implementation in a mental
      health population of subjects taking anti-depressants and/or anti-psychotics with a new or
      current primary or secondary diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Depressive
      Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DDNOS).

    <textblock>
      Mental illness affects one in four adults in the United States; approximately 61.5 million
      Americans experience mental illness in a given year. According to the National Alliance for
      the Mentally Ill, the impact of serious mental illness costs Americans $193.2 billion in lost
      earnings per year. In addition, mental illness patients have an increased risk of having
      chronic medical conditions, leading to increased costs and emergency service utilization for
      those conditions. In addition to substantial costs, patients with psychiatric illness are
      difficult to treat. More than two-thirds of patients with depression do not respond to first
      line therapy. Treatment often involves numerous trials of individual agents and combinations
      of medications in order to achieve optimal response. Pharmacogenetic testing is being used in
      more settings to guide treatment decisions.
