  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that AQUACEL® Ag Surgical dressing would have a significant
      improvement in the efficacy of wound care and wound complications compared with traditional
      Sofra-Tulle® dressings after minimally invasive total knee arthroplasty (MIS-TKA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional adhesive dressing (Mepore®; Mölnlycke Health Care) for low limb arthroplasty
      wounds had blistering up to 26%. The jubilee dressing, which consisted of a highly absorbent
      Hydrofiber inner layer and (Aquacel; ConvaTec Inc.) and a viscoelastic hydrocolloid outer
      layer (DuoDERM Extra Thin; ConvaTec Inc.), was introduced for lower limb arthroplasty wounds
      with lower blistering rate (2% vs. 18%) and lower surgical site infection (1% vs. 3%)
      compared to traditional adhesive dressing. A new modern dressing regime (Aquacel Ag Surgical
      dressing; ConvaTec Inc.) also reported longer wear time, less dressing change and less
      blistering.

      In our institution, the standard wound care after TKA was an antimicrobial dressing
      (Sofra-Tulle®; Royal Chem. &amp; Pharm. Co., Kaohsiung, Taiwan) in the inner layer and gauzes in
      the outer layer.

      The investigators hypothesized that AQUACEL® Ag Surgical dressing would have a significant
      improvement in the efficacy of wound care and wound complications compared with traditional
      Sofra-Tulle® dressings after MIS-TKA.

    <description>The AQUACEL® Ag Surgical dressing was applied to the wound in the operating theater by the surgeon. Clinical indications for removal of the AQUACEL® Ag Surgical dressing were leakage from the dressing beyond the hydrocolloid exterior layer and more than a 50% saturation of the Hydrofiber® inner layer10. If there were no indications to change the dressing, it was changed at the day of discharge usually the 4th or 5th postoperative day (POD) and remained cover of the wound for 7 days except for exudate across the dressing.</description>

    <description>The Sofra-Tulle® dressing was applied to the wound in the operating theater by the surgeon. The Sofra-Tulle® dressing was routinely changed at a daily basis. If there were strikethrough on the gauze, the nursing staff would proceed the dressing change automatically between the daily routine. After discharge from the hospital, the family who had been taught well to do this job during the patient's stay in the hospital conducted the daily dressing change.</description>
