  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies minority patients receiving care at the Comprehensive
      Cancer Center of Wake Forest University (CCCWFU) to see what their attitudes are regarding
      the healthcare they receive and how much they know about clinical trials. Clinical trials are
      an important way to test healthcare treatments and need diverse participants to be most
      effective. Studying what minority patients think about healthcare and clinical trials may
      help researchers learn more about why minorities are less likely to enroll in clinical trials
      and create programs to help increase their enrollment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe perceived quality of care received in the CCCWFU adult oncology clinics by
      patients belonging to one of the racial/ethnic minority and underserved populations
      (Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, rural, uninsured, or young adult).

      II. To describe cancer-related health needs of racial/ethnic minority and underserved
      patients in the CCCWFU adult oncology clinics.

      III. To describe attitudes towards, and knowledge regarding, clinical trials in racial/ethnic
      minority and underserved patients treated in the CCCWFU adult oncology clinics.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare levels of perceived quality of care, cancer-related health needs and attitudes
      towards and knowledge of clinical trials in racial/ethnic minority and underserved patients
      to a comparison group of non-minority/underserved patients treated in the CCCWFU adult
      oncology clinics.

      II. To describe perceived quality of care received in the CCCWFU adult oncology clinics,
      cancer-related health needs, and attitudes towards, and knowledge regarding clinical trials
      by elderly patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete survey items across a number of domains (patient characteristics, access to
      health care, perceived quality of care, clinical trial knowledge and attitudes, and cancer
      related health needs). Patients also complete questionnaires to obtain demographics
      information including age, education, race and ethnicity, marital status, employment status,
      insurance coverage, and income, as well as health status/indicators. Cancer-related
      characteristics, including diagnosis, stage, time since diagnosis, and treatments received
      are obtained self-report and patients' medical records.
