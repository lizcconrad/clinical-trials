      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether High Intensity Interval Training
      (HIIT)can improve the health and wellbeing of pre-diabetic elderly adults. In particular,
      there is specific interest in describing the effects of an interval exercise program on
      inflammatory state and immune function.

      DESIGN: Subjects will be sedentary, 65 to 80 years old adults, with prediabetes as defined by
      fasting plasma glucose (100 to 125 mg/dl). Before and after a 10-12 week High Intensity
      Interval Exercise training program subjects will undergo several tests including: 1) a
      maximal treadmill test, 2) an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, 3) muscle biopsy, 4) body
      composition, 5) several physical function tests and 6) other health related measures
      including lung function, arterial stiffness and several blood measures (e.g. liver enzymes,
      kidney function).

      DATA ANALYSES &amp; SAFETY ISSUES: As there are no comparison groups, data analyses will consist
      of performing paired t-tests on pre and post exercise training values for each of the
      measurement variables of interest. In addition, the data will be used to provide power
      calculations for future grant proposals. High Intensity Interval Training is a very safe
      exercise modality. The regular use of vigorous intensity exercise intervals have been used
      extensively in exercise training. In fact, the exercise intervals will start at levels lower
      and will be of shorter duration than were used during the maximal exercise test. They will
      then be carefully and slowly made to be more challenging as each subject is able to safely
      tolerate.

      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize that HIIT will result in significant improvements
      in markers of inflammation, immune system markers and other health-related risk factors.
