  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The influence of different doses of edoxaban on physical characteristics of the clot and
      thrombin generation kinetics in blood samples will be studied by in vitro spiking of blood
      samples collected from patients treated for heart failure (with and without
      hypercoagulability) and from healthy volunteers (with and without hypercoagulability). This
      in vitro experiment will help us to:

      (i) detect qualitative anticlotting properties of edoxaban. (ii) quantify the anticlotting
      properties of edoxaban.

      Experimental protocol

        1. On the day of experiment blood samples will be collected in 3.2% citrate tubes.

        2. One citrated blood tube will be centrifuged to collect plasma for biomarker measurements
           (C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor (vWF), interleukin (IL)-6,
           p-selectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9).

        3. Blood samples will be incubated with different concentrations of edoxaban (no edoxaban,
           subtherapeutic range - 30 nM, therapeutic range -300 nM, and supratherapeutic range- 900
           nM) (3).

      A) Cora® Hemostasis Analyzer System (Cora®) will be used to assess qualitative and
      quantitative assessment of the hemostatic properties of a blood sample in the presence or
      absence of edoxaban. The CORA is an integrated computer module with Ethernet connection
      capability and provides continuous resonance-frequency viscoelasticity measurements using a
      disposable four-channel microfluidic cartridge to determine simultaneous maximal
      platelet-fibrin clot strength, fibrin clot strength, and response to antiplatelet agents or
      anticoagulants. The cartridge has four channels - citrated Kaolin (CK) channel that measures
      platelet-fibrin clot strength, anti-Xa channel, DTI channel and FFC channel that measures
      contribution of functional fibrinogen.

      In addition, using the V-curve software, the following parameters of thrombin generation
      kinetics will be evaluated from the CK channel- R - Period of time of latency from the time
      that the blood was placed in the TEG® analyzer until the initial fibrin formation. This
      represents the enzymatic portion of coagulation.

      K - K time is a measure of the speed to reach a certain level of clot strength. This
      represents clot kinetics.

      alpha - measures the rapidity of fibrin build-up and cross-linking (clot strengthening). This
      represents fibrinogen level.

      MA - Maximum Amplitude is a direct function of the maximum dynamic properties of fibrin and
      platelet bonding via GPIIb/IIIa and represents the ultimate strength of the fibrin clot. This
      represents platelet function/aggregation.

      TMRTG - Time to maximum rate of thrombus generation. MRTG - Maximum rate of thrombus
      generation. TG - Total thrombus generated. TMRL - Time to maximum rate of lysis MRL - Maximum
      rate of lysis L - Total lysis D - Delta is the difference between R time and the time of
      initial split point (SP, mins) of the TEG tracing (R - SP), representing the time interval of
      greatest clot growth secondary to peak thrombin generation.

      B) Calibrated Automated Thrombogram® (CAT) System: Lag time, peak thrombin production, mean
      velocity rate index and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) will be assessed by calibrated
      automated thrombogram in platelet poor plasma (Thrombinoscope by Stago).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients with heart failure (class I-IV) are eligible for enrollment:

          1. Patient must have documented symptomatic chronic HF for at least 3 months prior to
             screening. Exacerbation of chronic HF is defined as symptoms of worsening dyspnea or
             fatigue, objective signs of congestion such as peripheral edema or ascites, and/or
             adjustment of pre-hospitalization HF medications.

          2. Subject must have a documented LVEF of less than or equal to 40% within 3 months of
             the study. If more than one LVEF is available, the most recent one should be used, but
             it must be less than or equal to 40%. The ejection fraction will be determined by one
             of the following methods: echocardiogram, nuclear multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan,
             cardiac MRI, cardiac CT scan, or left ventriculography.

          3. Patient must be receiving appropriate HF treatment at the appropriate dosing per
             guidelines:

               -  Beta blocker therapy

               -  Aldosterone antagonist therapy.
