    <textblock>
      This mechanistic study is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Right and left ventricular ejection fraction at each time-point</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Right and left ventricular ejection fraction is the fraction of blood (in percent) pumped out of the heart's left and right ventricular chamber, respectively, with each heart beat and will be determined as measured by MRI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ricght and left ventricular endsystolic volumes at each time-point</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Right and left ventricular endsystolic volume is a measurement of the volume of blood in the heart's right and left ventricular chamber, respectively, at the end of the heart's contraction and will be determined as measured by MRI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Right ventricular enddiastolic volume at each time-point</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Right ventricular enddiastolic volume is a measurement of the volume of blood in the heart's right ventricular chamber at the end of the chamber's filling with blood and will be determined as measured by MRI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac output at each time-point</measure>
    <time_frame>week 2</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiac output is calculated as the heart rate multiplied by the stroke volume (= difference between ventricular enddiastolic volume and endsystolic volume) that will be determined as measured by MRI.</description>
