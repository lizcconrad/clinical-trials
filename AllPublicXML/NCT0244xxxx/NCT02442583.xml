  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interview colorectal cancer survivors and use this input to create a brochure intended to
      guide reduction of sedentary behaviors in this population. Have colorectal cancer survivors
      review and comment on a draft of the brochure. A third group of colorectal cancer survivors
      will wear an Actigraph activity monitor for one week, then receive feedback on their activity
      level with the brochure. After one month this group will be surveyed by telephone regarding
      their use of the brochure, and their physical activity level.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The means and variances of self-reported total minutes per day of light to strenuous physical activity will be computed and compared from the survey at baseline, to the survey at the 1 month time point.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of minutes per day of bouts of sedentary behaviors.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The means and variances of self-reported total minutes per day of sedentary behaviors, will be computed and compared from the survey at baseline, to the survey at the 1 month time point. Time per day will also be analyzed by type of activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Covariation between baseline use of an ActiGraph, and self-reporting of sedentary behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the baseline reliability of self-report, we will calculate the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the self-report measure (total time and by each activity reported) and ActiGraph based on daily repeated measures for one week.</description>

    <description>15 early stage colorectal cancer survivors will complete a baseline survey about sedentary behaviors, then wear an Actigraph device and self-report their sedentary activities for one week. They will receive feedback regarding their activity, and one month after receiving the feedback will participate in a phone survey regarding use of the brochure, physical activity and sedentary behaviors.</description>

    <description>This pilot will occur in two phases. Phase 1 will occur in two steps. In Step 1, we will conduct one-on-one telephone interviews with 15 early stage CRC (colorectal cancer) survivors to obtain their knowledge and insights about sedentary behaviors and ways to reduce them. Their input will be used to help create a brochure on sedentary behaviors. In Step 2, we will conduct one-on-one telephone interviews with 5 early stage CRC survivors to provide feedback about the brochure. In Phase 2, we will recruit 15 CRC survivors. After completing a baseline survey, they will be asked to both wear an ActiGraph and self-report their daily sedentary behaviors for one week. They will receive tailored feedback as to their average weakly levels of sedentary behaviors and receive the brochure. One month post-intervention, they will be asked to take part in telephone survey assessing sedentary behaviors, PA (physical activity), and use of brochure.</description>
