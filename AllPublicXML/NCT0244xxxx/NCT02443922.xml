  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-year clinical study to improve tools for measuring the function of insulin-producing
      beta cells in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A three-year observational study to standardize the meal tolerance and maximal stimulation
      tests for measuring beta cell function in the clinical setting. It also aims to improve
      methods for the early prediction of the long-term response to an intervention and for
      identification of patients at risk for rapid beta cell function deterioration, thereby
      enabling future clinical studies that examine diabetes progression.

      The objective of this protocol is to establish the dynamic responsivity of the methods to
      treatment with glimerpiride or sitagliptin.

                            hysterectomy, oophorectorectomy, or post-menopausal status, that the
                            use of a spermicidal gel or foam will constitute adequate protection in
                            conjunction with use of a condom by the male.

         10. BMI 27-40; stable weight (less than 3% change in past 3 months)

         11. Age Range: 30-65

             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic,
             neoplastic, or allergic or clinical findings at Screening (seasonal allergies
             allowed).

          2. Any condition possibly affecting absorption (eg, gastrectomy, malabsorption syndromes,
             abdominal surgery other than appendectomy, cholecystectomy or hysterectomy).

          3. Use of unacceptable medications (see Appendix A)

          4. A positive urine drug screen.

          5. History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for men (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.

             first dose of study medication.

          7. 12 lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at Screening for males, 470 msec for females.
             If QTc exceeds 450/470 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the average
             of the three QTc values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility. An ECG
             with evidence for possible old myocardial infarction will need to have prior ECGs to
             document stability of finding.

          8. Supine blood pressure &gt;=140 mm Hg (systolic) or 90 mm Hg (diastolic), on a single
             measurement. If elevated, confirm by a single repeat, following at least 10 minutes of
             rest.

          9. Screening serum alanine transaminase (ALT) or serum aspartate transaminase (AST)
             greater than 2X the upper limit of the laboratory reference range.

         10. Elevated fasting triglycerides at screening (&gt;500 mg/dL), confirmed by a single repeat
             if deemed necessary.

         11. Pregnant or nursing females; inability to use effective contraception.

         12. Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.

         13. Participation in a clinical biomedical research study within prior two months may be
             excluded, depending on study type and details.

         14. History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, if utilized by
             the site for blood draws.

         15. Unwilling or unable to comply with directions and procedures described in this
             protocol.

         16. Subject is the Investigator or a sub-Investigator, research assistant, pharmacist,
             study coordinator, other staff, or a relative of study personnel directly involved
             with the conduct of the study.

         17. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
