    <textblock>
      PRINCE primary is cluster randomised waiting list controlled trial to evaluate the
      acceptability and feasibility of studying an integrated approach to care in general practice
      for adults with persistent physical symptoms (PPS). PPS is defined as physical symptoms with
      no obvious underlying organic cause (Dreary, Chalder and Sharpe, 2007; Stone, 2009). In the
      intervention arm GPs practices will be offered training in 10-minute cognitive behavioural
      therapy (CBT), a therapy that aims to address unhelpful behaviours and beliefs. Participants
      will also be given self-help materials which include a series of leaflets and an animation
      describing a patients experience with chronic pain. The systems approach will be compared
      with a waiting list.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with persistent physical symptoms (PPS) are often severely functionally impaired and
      very distressed. They consume large amounts of health care and welfare benefits. However,
      patients are often resistant to reassurance, traditional medical explanations and standard
      treatments aimed at symptom relief.

      The management of PPS is one of the most important tasks facing both general practice and the
      specialist in hospital medicine. There is an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that
      cognitive behavioral interventions can reduce levels of symptoms and improve functioning in
      patients who have had PPS for several years.

      In 2011, a meta-analysis examined the efficacy of short term psychotherapy for PPS and this
      drew on ten previously published systematic reviews on psychological interventions as well as
      new trials. Overall, the studies were small and focused on patients with longstanding
      problems (mean = 13.3 years). It was difficult for the authors to generalize, as the studies
      were so diverse in terms of number of sessions, setting, mode of delivery, who delivered
      therapy etc. In general, there was evidence for a small beneficial between group effect of
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for PPS but moderate effects for within group contrasts.
      The effect sizes differed considerably depending on the setting and outcome, such as,
      healthcare utilization, functional impairment, psychopathology and physical symptoms. Larger
      effect sizes tend to be seen for more specific syndromes, such as non-cardiac chest pain and
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). The authors concluded by suggesting that mental health
      professionals were better placed to deliver therapy but that consultation rates could be
      tackled by general practitioners (GPs) trained specifically in communication skills.

      The aim of this study is to assess whether it is feasible to conduct an adequately powered
      trial to evaluate the systems approach (please refer to arms and interventions for more
      details).

    <description>The overall aims of the intervention are to help the patient:
develop an understanding of the relationship between cognitive, emotional, physiological and behavioral aspects of their problem;
understand factors that may be maintaining the problem;
learn how to modify the behavioral and cognitive responses which may be maintaining the problem;
adopt a healthy sleep routine which can promote healthy living.
Hand-outs will be available for GPs to give to patients, but the structure of the intervention allows for treatment to be formulation-based so that particular issues raised in the consultation that might be maintaining symptom severity (e.g. avoidance) can be addressed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  adults (≥18 years - ≤65 years) seen in one of the nominated GP practices in Southwark
             and Lambeth with a PPS (which are medically unexplained) labelled as such by the GP
             and possibly confirmed by diagnostic criteria where available (Read Codes);

          -  patients who have had 6 or more consultations with the GP in the last year; (not
             necessarily for the same symptoms or directly related to persistent physical
             symptoms). Originally the inclusion criteria required that the patient had attended 12
             consultations in the last year and so we will record whether the patient would be
             eligible under the original inclusion criteria or only under the widened criteria.

          -  ability to give written informed consent and baseline measures before randomisation.

          -  The patient can speak and read English at a level adequate for participation in the
             trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  active psychosis;

          -  drug or alcohol addiction as indicated in the patients notes;

          -  current Benzodiazepine use exceeding the equivalent of 10 mg Diazepam per day;

          -  the patient is thought to be at imminent risk of self-harm, after psychiatric/
             psychological assessment;

          -  Any psychotherapy treatment within the last year (not inclusive of general visits from
             community psychiatric teams)

          -  The patient is taking part in the PRINCE Secondary study

          -  The patient has dissociative seizures.

          -  The patient is taking part in the ACTIB study.
