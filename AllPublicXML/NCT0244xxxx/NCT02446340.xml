          5. willingness to remain totally abstinent or use adequate contraception; e.g., 2 of the
             following methods: hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, condom, diaphragm, and
             spermicidal gel/foam) in order to prevent pregnancy from the screening visit until 60
             days after the follow-up visit. For men, the donation of sperm during this period is
             also prohibited.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. the presence of clinically significant medical history as determined by the
             investigator.

          2. the history of clinically significant cardiac abnormalities or presence of clinically
             significant abnormality on 12-lead ECG.

          3. the history of pre-existing paresthesia or neuropathy;

          4. abnormalities on neurologic exam at screening or baseline

          5. the history of any cancer requiring systemic chemotherapy or radiation; individuals
             with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer, nonrecurring carcinoma in situ treated
             with laser or cryotherapy or cervical cancer-in-situ, resected surgically with no
             evidence of disease, may be accepted on a case by case basis at the discretion of the
             Investigator;

          6. the presence of acute infection or history of acute infection within 7 days prior to
             receipt of the study drug; additionally, oral temperature may not exceed 37.4Â°C at
             baseline;

          7. the presence of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities (chemistry panel of 20
             analytes [Chem-20; fasted 10-12 hours], complete blood count [CBC], and urinalysis
             [UA]) as determined by the investigator;

          8. positive urine drug screen for drugs of abuse (opiates, methadone, cocaine,
             amphetamines, cannabinoids, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cotinine, tricyclic
             antidepressants and alcohol) at Screening or at Baseline.

          9. typical intake of more than 7 units of alcohol per week (one unit of alcohol equals
             approximately 250 mL of beer, 100 mL of wine or 35 mL of spirits)

         10. a positive hepatitis screen (Hepatitis BsAg or anti-HCV) or positive Human
             Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody test ;

         11. a history of multiple drug allergies that are important in the view of the
             Investigator;

         12. any history of anaphylaxis or a history of allergy to a medication, diet, or
             environmental exposure (including bee stings) that are important in the view of the
             Investigator;

         13. participation in another clinical trial with receipt of an investigational product
             within 60 days of dose administration (or 5 half lives, whichever is longer);

         14. recent (within 1 year of Screening) history of illicit drug use;

         15. history of alcohol abuse that is important in the view of the Investigator

         16. inadequate venous access that would interfere with obtaining blood samples;

         17. use of prescription medications, over the counter products, herbal remedies and
             nutritional supplements within 7 days of study drug administration and throughout the
             study, or the anticipated need for prescription medications prior to Study Completion;

         18. recipients of blood transfusion or transfusion of blood or plasma products within 60
             days of study drug administration;

         19. donation of blood &gt; 500 mL within 2 months of study drug administration;

         20. positive pregnancy test at screening or at baseline (female subjects only);

         21. history within the past 3 months of eating disorders or other conditions which may
