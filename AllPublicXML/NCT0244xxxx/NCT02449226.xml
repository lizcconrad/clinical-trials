  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ICU patients are at high risk of ionic or metabolic disturbances during the course of their
      critical illness. Some of these disturbances might be life-threatening and require rapid
      response from physicians. Point-of-Care determination of electrolytes, glucose, hemoglobin
      and hematocrit ensures early detection (within 1 minute) of abnormal values and allows rapid
      and appropriate therapy. This technology has largely improved the quality of care in ICU.
      However, the accuracy of the measurement of those parameters had to be close enough to the
      reference method, usually perfomed in the central lab but time consuming. Recently, a novel
      generation of blood gas analyser has been released. Among them, the RapidPoint 500 is mounted
      with a 28-day cartridge which provides automatic calibrations and quality controls several
      times a day. Such a technology dramatically decreases the need for labs technical
      interventions. To date, there is no data reporting the accuracy of this device. Therefore,
      the investigators' aim is to compare the accuracy of the RapidPoint 500 with a reference
      measurement performed at the central laboratory (Beckman&amp;Coulter AU5800 for electrolytes and
      Beckman&amp;Coulter DXH for hemoglobin).

        All patients staying in our ICU and equipped with an indwelling arterial catheter for whom
        clinicians prescribe together an arterial blood gas analysis and a biological laboratory
        analysis.

        The study will take place over a 1 month period. A total of 300 pairs of samples is
        targeted.
