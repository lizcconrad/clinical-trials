  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving extra arginine to patients with
      sickle cell disease seeking treatment for vaso-occlusive painful events (VOE) will decrease
      pain scores, decrease need for pain medications or decrease length of hospital stay or
      emergency department visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arginine is a simple amino acid that is found in many foods and is part of the proteins in a
      human's body. Patients with sickle cell disease have low levels of the amino acid arginine
      and these low levels may be related to pain episodes. Increasing levels of arginine in the
      blood may lower pain and/or lower the amount of pain medication (like morphine) that is
      needed to treated them. It may also decrease the amount of time spent in the hospital.

    <description>Total time plasma arginine levels are maintained above the half-saturating concentration (Km) of cationic amino acid transporter protein-1 (CAT-1), which is 150 µM (normal range of extracellular plasma arginine concentration). pK samples will be collected at 6 time-points within 8 hours: prior to arginine treatment (time 0), and at 60, 90, 120 minutes, 4 and 8 hours after the initiation of arginine therapy, and then every 24 hours up to 7 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 1 and through study completion, an average of up to 7 days</time_frame>
