  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Missed health care appointments present a serious challenge to patient care. Especially in
      government funded health systems like that of Chile, missed appointments can lead to delayed
      care, wasted resources, and escalating costs.

      This private-public-research collaboration seeks to provide a rigorous, practical evaluation
      of a new patient reminder system, evaluate how health beliefs impact patient attendance, and
      capture the potential for scaling up this or other health technology systems. Using a
      mixed-methods approach this study will provide contextualized, triangulated analysis of
      pediatric patient attendance in Chile.

      The Health Call study is divided into two phases. The first phase is a randomized controlled
      trial and side-by- side cost-benefit analysis. Enrolled guardians of pediatric patients will
      complete a questionnaire at the point of referral and then be randomized to intervention, the
      automated reminder system, or no reminder. The investigators will then monitor attendance
      status at their subsequent appointment and evaluate whether the appointment reminders
      affected attendance as well as the cost-benefit ratio of using the reminder system.

      The second phase will involve interviewing guardians and healthcare professionals. These
      interviews have two foci. First, combined with patient, guardian, and/or household data from
      the randomized trial, these results will be used to develop a more comprehensive
      understanding of why pediatric patients attend appointments. The second focus is on improving
      the reminder system and developing new health technology interventions that can increase
      patient attendance.
