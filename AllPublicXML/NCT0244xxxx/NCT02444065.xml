    <textblock>
      Treatments for bulimia nervosa (BN) have relatively high rates of nonremission and relapse,
      meaning that improving treatments is a high priority in this area. Rapid response to
      treatment -cessation of binge eating and vomiting symptoms within the first weeks of
      treatment - is a robust predictor of improved post-treatment outcomes and lower relapse
      rates, but no study has tried to facilitate rapid response as a means of improving treatment
      outcomes. The present study responds to this gap in the literature by testing a 4-session
      CBT-based individual intervention for rapid response (i.e., &quot;CBT-RR&quot;), designed to augment
      standard day hospital (DH) treatment for BN and Purging Disorder (PD) by focusing on
      strategies and skills for rapid symptom interruption. CBT-RR will be compared to a
      matched-intensity augmentative motivational interviewing (MI) intervention. Participants will
      be recruited from a hospital-based day program for eating disorders, and will be randomly
      assigned to one of the two conditions in addition to the DH as usual. participants will be
      assessed at pre-intervention, post-intervention, week 4 of DH, post-DH, and 6 months
      follow-up. It is hypothesized that compared to those who receive MI, patients who receive
      CBT-RR will be more likely to exhibit a rapid response to day hospital treatment (i.e., &lt;/= 3
      binge eating and/or vomiting episodes in the first 4 weeks). It is further hypothesized that
      patients who receive CBT-RR will exhibit fewer binge eating and/or vomiting episodes at
      post-DH and at 6-month follow-up. Potential mediators and moderators of these hypothesized
      treatment effects will be examined on an exploratory basis, including self-efficacy,
      motivation, and hope (potential mediators), and emotion regulation, depression, cognitive
      psychopathology of eating disorders, and working alliance with the therapist (potential
      moderators).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is the most empirically supported treatment for bulimia
      nervosa (BN) and related disorders, yet approximately 1/3 of completers do not remit, there
      is a substantial treatment attrition rate, and 1/3 of remitted patients will relapse within
      the first 2 years. Improving CBT is an important research prerogative. Motivational
      interviewing (MI) is an augmentative intervention that has been investigated to improve CBT,
      but reviews indicate that it is not efficacious with eating disorders. The failure of MI with
      eating disorders has led to consideration that focusing on early behaviour change might be a
      more productive therapeutic strategy. Rapid response to treatment for eating disorders has
      been reliably identified as a prognostic indicator in eating disorders. For BN and similar
      disorders, rapid response is the rapid reduction of binge eating, vomiting, and dietary
      restriction during the first few weeks of treatment. Numerous studies have indicated that
      patients who rapidly respond to treatment are significantly more likely to be remitted at
      post treatment and significantly less likely to relapse, compared to those who respond more
      slowly. No preexisting clinical, demographic, personality or other factors have clearly
      emerged to account for this effect. Given that rapid response has clear prognostic
      importance, and given that research has failed to identify mechanisms driving this finding,
      this study seeks to determine whether rapid response can be facilitated clinically using a
      targeted intervention designed to provide patients with specific behavioural skills to
      decrease their bulimic symptoms rapidly. Improving remission and relapse rates is a high
      priority in the eating disorders research field. the investigators already know that
      cognitive and behavioural strategies have efficacy for eating disorders, but existing
      treatments need improvement. Rapid response is an area that has been frequently described and
      has clear prognostic importance and no clear mechanism accounting for why some patients
      rapidly respond, suggesting that perhaps rapid response could be facilitated if patients are
      provided with the skills, mindset, and support to do so. However, no study to date has sought
      to answer this question and determine whether rapid response can be facilitated in order to
      improve patient prognoses. Thus, this study seeks to examine whether rapid response to day
      hospital treatment can be facilitated clinically using an augmentative CBT based intervention
      targeting early symptom change. The CBT intervention will be compared to a matched-intensity
      motivational interviewing (MI) intervention. The rationale for using MI is because MI is
      frequently used to augment standard treatments, it provides an active treatment comparison,
      and because the rationale for the present study emerged partly from research aimed at
      understanding some of the limitations of MI in treating eating disorders. Thus, MI provides a
      theoretically-driven comparison group. It is predicted that individuals who receive CBT
      (versus MI) will be more likely to be classified as rapid responders, and will have fewer
      bulimic symptoms at post-day hospital and 6-month follow-up. As well, it is hypothesized that
      changes in self-efficacy, motivation, or hopefulness may help to account for these findings.
