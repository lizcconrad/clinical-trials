  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multiple-center, double-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical study to
      evaluate the antalgic effects between distal-proximal acupoints combination and regional
      acupoints combination stimulated with electroacupuncture on patients undergoing Off-Pump
      Coronary-Artery Bypass Grafting(OP-CABG).This clinical trial is to investigate whether
      electroacupuncture(EA) anesthesia can reduce analgesic in OP-CABG surgery in distal-proximal
      group.The origins of therapeutic acupuncture can be traced back at least 2,500 years in
      China. There has been an explosion of interest in Western medicine within the United States
      and Europe in application of acupuncture technique. Acupuncture enjoys worldwide acceptance
      for treating diseases such as migraine, chronic low back pain, and knee osteoarthritis. In
      2002, WHO recommended 107 symptoms, syndromes, and diseases definitively shown to be
      effectively treated by acupuncture. Coronary heart disease (angina pectoris) is among these
      pathologies. A recent clinical trial demonstrated an acupuncture-assisted anesthesia strategy
      reduces postoperative morbidity and medical costs in open-heart surgery under cardiopulmonary
      bypass. Previous researches in animal models have demonstrated that electroacupuncture
      pretreatment protects the heart from ischemic injury. The investigators observed that
      electroacupuncture pretreatment (EAP, 30-minute electric stimulation through 4 electrodes
      attached to the bilateral forearm acupoints) before surgery significantly attenuated serum
      troponin levels during and shortly post-surgery in adult heart valve replacement patients and
      children undergoing cardiac surgery correcting congenital heart malformation.However, whether
      electroacupuncture anesthesia may reduce analgesic in OP-CABG surgery,especially in different
      combination of acupoints,has never been previously investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anesthesia will be performed in a standard way. The propofol and sufentanil will be
      infused in target-controlled infusion mode. The dosage of analgesic will be assessed by the
      consumption of sufentanil. And the electroacupuncture anesthesia will be implemented by a
      device named &quot;Hua Tuo&quot; electronic acupuncture treatment instrument.
