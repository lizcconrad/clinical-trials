  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, the rising incidence of obesity has led to the identification of an obesity
      related syndrome, called metabolic. This syndrome is characterized by central obesity,
      hypertension, insulin resistance and altered lipid levels.

      Taking into consideration the rising incidence of obesity, anesthetists will more frequently
      encounter patients with metabolic syndrome, in their everyday practice. Moreover, the
      comorbidities that are related to the metabolic syndrome, increase the risk for perioperative
      complications. Therefore, strategies that will evaluate and modify the risk will be of great
      importance in the management of these patients, in order to maximize peri-anaesthetic and
      surgical safety.

      The aim of the study is to assess the incidence of metabolic syndrome and the impact of its
      presence on the outcome of patients undergoing elective laparotomy.

        Study population: Adult patients are undergoing elective laparotomy of estimated duration
        of more than one hour. All operations will be performed under general anesthesia.

        Group sample sizes of 42 in group one and 42 in group two achieve 90% power to detect a
        difference between the group proportions of 0,2500. The proportion in group one (MetS
        group) is assumed to be 0,0500 under the null hypothesis and 0,3000 under the alternative
        hypothesis. The proportion in group two (the Non-MetS group) is 0,0500. The test statistic
        used is the two-sided Likelihood Ratio test. The significance level of the test was
        targeted at 0,0500. The significance level actually achieved by this design is 0,0909.
