    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a prehabilitation
      program at Barnes Jewish Hospital for liver transplant candidates. Those patients who consent
      to participate in the study and are placed on the transplant list will be randomized into
      either the control or intervention group. The intervention group receives a personalized home
      exercise program along with weekly phone calls to provide coaching, mentoring and motivation.
      Data collected at baseline, post-transplant and, post-transplant follow up will be compared
      among the two study groups. The secondary outcomes include: normative data of functional
      measures for patients with end stage liver disease and to determine the effect size for
      future research on prehabilitation in the patient population.
