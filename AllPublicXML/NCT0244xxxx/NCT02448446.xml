      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of intravitreally administered 0.3mg ranibizumab in
      subjects with diabetic macular edema and lipid exudates in the central subfield.

      Consented, enrolled subjects will receive multiple open-label intravitreal injections on
      0.3mg ranibizumab administered every 30 days for 12 months per the treatment algorithm.

      The patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Group 1: Treatment algorithm
      based on the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) protocol I 4:2:7 strategy based on
      the presence of macular edema.

      Group 2: Continue treatment until not only the macular edema is resolved but also until the
      lipid exudate is resolved.

      Sample size: 30 eyes Follow-up Schedule: Every 4 weeks throughout the study.

             or patch.

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
