      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefits of SYSTANE® ULTRA Lubricant
      Eye Drops using total ocular surface staining scores in subjects with dry eye administering
      it either as a scheduled regimen or as-needed after 28 days of treatment.

      This study consists of a 14-day Run-in Phase (between the Screening Visit and Baseline/Visit
      1) and a Treatment Phase. During the Run-in Phase, subjects will discontinue current
      artificial tears and will be dispensed SYSTANE® ULTRA to be administered 1 drop in each eye
      as needed (PRN). Subjects who meet the re-evaluation criteria after the Run-in Phase will be
      randomized in a 1:2 manner to receive treatment with SYSTANE® ULTRA 4 times per day (QID) or
      PRN, respectively, for 28 days.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Ocular Surface Staining (TOSS) Score at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The TOSS score is a cumulative cornea and conjunctival staining score. After instilling ophthalmic dye in the eye, the investigator graded three areas of the ocular surface for dryness on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is &quot;Absent&quot; and 5 is &quot;Severe.&quot; The three scores were summed for a resultant overall 0-15 score. The change from baseline was calculated as the TOSS score at Day 28 minus the TOSS score at baseline. A more negative change value indicates greater efficacy. One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye and only the study eye was used for eye-level efficacy analyses.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Impact of Dry Eye on Everyday Life Symptom-Bother (IDEEL SB) Score at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The IDEEL SB module is a 20 question patient reported outcome questionnaire that assesses the subject's symptoms of dry eye. An overall resultant calculated score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater symptom bother. One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye and only the study eye was used for eye-level efficacy analyses.</description>

    <description>The IDEEL is 10-question patient-reported outcome questionnaire that assesses the subject's general satisfaction with treatment use (Treatment Effectiveness and Treatment Inconvenience). A resultant overall 0-100 treatment satisfaction score was calculated separately for Treatment Effectiveness and Treatment Inconvenience, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction and less treatment-related bother.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Ocular Surface Staining (TOSS) Score at Day 28</title>
        <description>The TOSS score is a cumulative cornea and conjunctival staining score. After instilling ophthalmic dye in the eye, the investigator graded three areas of the ocular surface for dryness on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is &quot;Absent&quot; and 5 is &quot;Severe.&quot; The three scores were summed for a resultant overall 0-15 score. The change from baseline was calculated as the TOSS score at Day 28 minus the TOSS score at baseline. A more negative change value indicates greater efficacy. One eye from each subject was chosen as the study eye and only the study eye was used for eye-level efficacy analyses.</description>
