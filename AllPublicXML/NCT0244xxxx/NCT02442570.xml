      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, exploratory, dose-ranging Phase
      IIa study in multiple sclerosis patients to evaluate the safety, tolerability, T-cell
      tolerance inducing effect, clinical effects and pharmacokinetics of intravenous DC-TAB, a
      solution of recombinant human alpha B-crystallin.

      At entry, patients were randomized to one of the treatments, placebo, 7.5 mg DC-TAB, 12.5 mg
      DC-TAB or 17.5 mg DC-TAB in a 1:1:1:1 fashion. Patients received a single intravenous bolus
      injection which was repeated twice with 2-month intervals during the 6-month monitoring
      period. The goal of such injection was to induce antigen-specific T-cell tolerance. The study
      consisted of two parts, a treatment period of 24 weeks, and a follow-up period of an
      additional 24 weeks. Patients returned to the hospital weekly during the first month, and
      monthly thereafter.

      The primary analysis was performed on data collected in the treatment period, and was
      performed after all patients had completed 24 weeks into the study. An additional analysis
      was performed once all patients had completed the full 48 weeks of the study. Patients and
      site study personnel remained blinded throughout the study.

      After 12 and 24 patients completed 4 weeks into the study, and after 24 patients had
      completed 12 weeks of follow-up, a partially blinded safety review was conducted by an
      independent drug safety monitoring board to verify safety of the intervention in MS patients.
