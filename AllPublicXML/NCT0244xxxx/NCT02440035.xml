  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intramuscular
      homologous and heterologous prime-boost regimens of Ad35.RSV.FA2 (human adenovirus-vectored
      vaccine candidate) and Ad26.RSV.FA2 in healthy participants.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), double-blind
      (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is
      receiving) and Phase 1 study in healthy participants. The study comprises a 4-week screening
      period; vaccination for each participant on Days 1, 85, and, 169; a 28-day follow-up period
      performed after each vaccination and a final visit at Day 323 or 351. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the 4 treatment groups (Group 1/2/3/4) to receive either
      Ad35.RSV.FA2 or Ad26.RSV.FA2 or placebo. The study duration will be approximately 52 weeks.
      Blood samples for immunogenicity will be collected. Participant's safety will be evaluated
      throughout the study.

             disorders, bleeding/clotting disorder, autoimmune disease, active malignancy, poorly
             controlled asthma, active tuberculosis or other systemic infections)

          -  Participant has had major surgery within the 4 weeks prior to randomization or has
             planned major surgery through the course of the study
