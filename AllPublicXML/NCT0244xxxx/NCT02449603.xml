  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label, randomized, parallel trial to compare the effect of
      Exenatide versus Biphasic insulin Aspart 30 on glucose variability and inflammatory markers
      in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients inadequately controlled with metformin
      monotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have showed that fluctuations of glucose seem to have more deleterious effects than
      sustained hyperglycaemia in the development of diabetic complications. The present randomized
      controlled trial was designed with primary aim to evaluate glycaemic fluctuation in the
      comparison between twice-daily Exenatide and other treatment paradigm (e.g. insulin Aspart
      30).
