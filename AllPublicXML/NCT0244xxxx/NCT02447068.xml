      This is a proof of concept, investigator blinded study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      a novel combination of a home narrow band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) lamp with an occlusive
      dressing in adult subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis vulgaris. Four interpatient arms
      will be used to compare the efficacy of combination of NBUVB with an occlusive dressing to
      the light alone and to dressing alone and no treatment. Ten patients will be enrolled in this
      6 weeks study.

          -  Has at least 4 plaques of at least 10 cm2 with TPA scores not differing from each
             other by a score of more than 1

          -  Is in good general health as determined by the Investigator based on the subject's
             medical history, vital signs and physical examination.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have negative urine pregnancy test results.

          -  Females of childbearing potential agree to use acceptable methods of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of psoriasis that was previously treated with prescription medications prior
             to the Screening visit and was non-responsive to treatment, as determined by the
