  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OncoVAX速 is the first cancer vaccine that both prevents cancer recurrence and

      addresses the diversity of cancer cells. In this pivotal randomized, multicenter Phase

      IIIb study in patients with Stage II colon cancer, OncoVAX is designed to use a patient's

      own cancer cells to mobilize the body's immune system to prevent the return of colon

      cancer following surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OncoVAX is an active specific immunotherapeutic (ASI) stimulating a patient's immune

      response to autologous (patient-specific) tumor cells. It is comprised of sterile, live but

      non-dividing tumor cells obtained following standard-of-care surgical tumor resection for

      Stage II colon cancer. Within 35 days following surgery, patients are immunized with

      OncoVAX to prevent disease recurrence, which is incurable and occurs in up to 35% of

      patients. Patients are given three vaccinations once per week for three weeks, followed

      by a booster vaccination after six months. A previously completed Phase III trial

      published in The Lancet showed that OncoVAX cut the risk of recurrence by 61% in

      patients with Stage II colon cancer. The primary endpoint is Disease-Free Survival:

      defined as the time from curative surgery to the objective test confirming tumor

      recurrence or death due to any cause. The secondary endpoints are Overall Survival

      and Recurrence-Free-Interval. An interim analysis will be performed at a significance

      level of 0.005 once 2/3 of anticipated events have occurred, resulting in a significance

      level of 0.0483 at the end of the study. A total of 550 patients is planned, randomized

      1:1 to receive OncoVAX速 plus surgery (n=275) or surgery alone (n=275).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have Stage II (IIA = T3N0M0, IIB = T4aN0M0, IIC = T4bN0M0) disease.

          -  Patients must have undergone curative resection and have no evidence of residual or
             metastatic disease.

          -  Following curative resection patients must have a CEA within normal limits. If
             elevated prior to resection, it must return to normal within 21 days post surgery and
             prior to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy or a prior malignancy of any
             type will be excluded. However, subjects with prior, curatively-treated squamous cell
             or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix will be
             eligible for participation in this study.

          -  Patients with more than one malignant primary colon cancer will be excluded.
