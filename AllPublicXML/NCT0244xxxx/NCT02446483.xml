  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-sequence, two-period crossover study,
      separated by 7 days washout interval from the first study drug administration.

      In this study, the bioavailability of Rabeprazole from Idiazole 20 milligram (mg) delayed
      release (DR) tablets and PARIET 20 mg DR tablets after a single oral dose administration of
      each to healthy adults under fasting conditions, will be investigated by determining the 90%
      confidence limits for the log-transformed ratio (Test product / Reference product) for the
      bioequivalence parameters. The influence of sequence, product and period effect will be
      tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA).

      In this study a total of 60 subjects plus 1-4 additional subjects will be enrolled and split
      into two groups (Group A and B) of 30 each. For each subject, a total of 33 blood draws will
      be done and the volume of blood will not exceed 300 milliliters (mL) for the study.

    <measure>Mean Maximal Measured Plasma Concentration (Cmax) After a Single Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0.00) and 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.33, 2.66, 3.00, 3.33, 3.66, 4.00, 4.33, 4.66, 5.00, 5.33, 5.66, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00 and 14.00 h post-dose in each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis were drawn at indicated time points of each treatment period. Cmax was defined as maximal measured plasma concentration over the time span specified. Values were reported as Least Squares Geometric Means with respective Geometric Coefficient of Variation (% CV).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Measurable Concentration (AUC0-t) and Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-infinity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0.00) and 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.33, 2.66, 3.00, 3.33, 3.66, 4.00, 4.33, 4.66, 5.00, 5.33, 5.66, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00 and 14.00 h post-dose in each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for PK analysis were drawn at indicated time points of each treatment period. AUC0-t was calculated by the linear trapezoidal method. AUC0-infinity was calculated as the sum of the AUC0-t plus the ratio of the last measurable plasma concentration to the elimination rate constant, where first-order elimination or terminal rate constant was calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The parameter was calculated by linear least-squares regression analysis using the last three (or more) non-zero plasma concentrations. Values were reported as Least Squares Geometric Means with respective % CV.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of the Maximum Plasma Concentration (T-max) and Terminal Half-life (T-half)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose (0.00) and 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.33, 2.66, 3.00, 3.33, 3.66, 4.00, 4.33, 4.66, 5.00, 5.33, 5.66, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00 and 14.00 h post-dose in each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for PK analysis were drawn at indicated time points of each treatment period. If the maximum value occurs at more than one point T-max was defined as the first time point with this value. The elimination or terminal half-life was calculated by dividing 0.693 (natural logarithm of 2) with b obtained as the slope of the linear regression of the logarithmically transformed plasma concentrations versus time in the terminal period of the plasma curve.</description>

          <description>In each period of the study, participants received one tablet of treatment A (rabeprazole 20 mg enteric coated tablet) or treatment B (rabeprazole 20 mg gastro-resistant tablet), given with 240 mL water according to a plan of randomization. Water was at room temperature and measured with a 250 mL cylinder. Participants were admitted the night before study drug administration, supervised for at least 10 h of overnight fasting, and confined until collecting 12 h blood sample during study drug administration of each period. The study drug administration took place between 10:00 am and 10:51 am on Day 1 of each study period. The two treatment periods were separated by a washout period of 7 days.</description>
