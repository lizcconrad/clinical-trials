  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is a debilitating chronic illness characterized by periods of elation and
      depression. Since deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill over 40 years ago, families have
      become major caregivers for patients with bipolar disorder . This illness imposes a
      substantial and chronic burden on family caregivers Despite their persistent stress and
      burden, these caregivers have been largely ignored. Interventions to help them have been very
      limited. One comprehensive intervention was developed and implemented by Miklowitz (2008) and
      has shown to be effective in reducing caregiver depression and improving health outcomes.
      However, this intervention and is highly complex, long, and was given on an individual basis,
      significantly raising the cost of the program. One core component of the Miklowitz (2008)
      intervention is psychoeducation, which provides the fundamental support and information
      needed to caregivers on an individual basis.

      In this pilot study, the intervention group will receive 7 weekly psychoeducation sessions.
      After completion of these sessions in the intervention group, the wait list control group
      will receive the same weekly sessions. In this study, the investigators plan to test the
      feasibility and potential efficacy of this specific psychoeducation intervention implemented
      in a group setting. The investigators will also examine the effects of this psychosocial
      intervention on biological mechanisms (cortisol and inflammatory biomarkers) and health
      outcomes.

      The specific aims are to:

        1. Test the feasibility of implementing a 7-week group psychoeducation program for family
           caregivers of patients with bipolar disorder by assessing recruitment and retention
           rates, attendance, satisfaction with the program, and data and sample collection rate.

        2. Explore the effect of the intervention on caregiver outcomes (depression, burden, health
           status, mental wellbeing, cortisol, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 levels.

      The intervention will be delivered by at the University of Texas Health Science Center at
      Houston Center of Excellence for Mood Disorders (CEMD) and at the University of Texas Health
      Science Center at Houston School of Nursing. Forty family caregivers of patients with bipolar
      disorder will be recruited into the study.

    <description>The experimental group will receive a 7-week group psychoeducation intervention. Caregivers will meet once a week for 90-minute sessions in a group setting. Dates and times of the group sessions will be arranged according to the convenience of the subjects. The major content will include the causes of bipolar disorder, signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder, the role of stress and life events, types of medications and what they do, self-management of the disorder, understanding the course of the disorder, genetic and biological predispositions, how the family can help, management of relapse.</description>
