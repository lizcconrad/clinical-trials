      The key goals of EUROSCA-NHS is to determine and compare the rate of disease progression in
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6 including determination of the order and occurrence of non-ataxia
      symptoms, assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL), and
      identification of predictors of disease progression and survival.

      The key goal of EUROSCA-NHS is to determine and compare the rate of disease progression in
      SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6. To this end, a newly developed and validated ataxia scale (Scale
      for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, SARA) will be used. EUROSCA-NHS has a number of
      secondary aims including determination of the order and occurrence of non-ataxia symptoms,
      assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and quality of life (QoL), and identification
      of predictors of disease progression and survival. Substudies will deal with the development
      of brain atrophy, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), progression of peripheral
      neuropathy, as assessed by nerve conduction studies, and specific clinical aspects of SCA.

    <measure>Scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients are first seen at a baseline visit, followed by annual visits for 3 years scheduled ± 3 months around the specified time point. After the initial 3 year observation period, visits are done at irregular intervals each time they went to hospital.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression of ataxia is measured using a newly developed and validated ataxia scale, SARA. SARA was evaluated in two large validation trials performed by the EUROSCA clinical group and was found to be easy to use, reliable, and valid.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease stages</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients are first seen at a baseline visit, followed by annual visits for 3 years scheduled ± 3 months around the specified time point. After the initial 3 year observation period, visits are done at irregular intervals each time they went to hospital.</time_frame>
    <description>Disease stages are measured using the 5 point scale ranging from 0 to 4 proposed by Klockgether et al., 1998.</description>

    <measure>Inventory of non-ataxia signs (INAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients are first seen at a baseline visit, followed by annual visits for 3 years scheduled ± 3 months around the specified time point. After the initial 3 year observation period, visits are done at irregular intervals each time they went to hospital.</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of accompanying non-ataxia symptoms is recorded using INAS. In the SARA validation trials, INAS was applied to a large number of SCA patients. Statistical evaluation showed good reliability.</description>

    <measure>UHDRS part IV</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients are first seen at a baseline visit, followed by annual visits for 3 years scheduled ± 3 months around the specified time point. After the initial 3 year observation period, visits are done at irregular intervals each time they went to hospital.</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability in ADL is assessed using the Functional assessment part of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) (Huntington Study Group, 1996). This 25-item assessment has been used in SCA patients throughout the SARA validation study with good practicality.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients are first seen at a baseline visit, followed by annual visits for 3 years scheduled ± 3 months around the specified time point. After the initial 3 year observation period, visits are done at irregular intervals each time they went to hospital.</time_frame>
    <description>Health related Quality of life is assessed using EQ-5D, a generic instrument that has been developed and validated by the EuroQuol Group (1990) and is available in validated translations for use as a questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PHQ-9</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients are first seen at a baseline visit, followed by annual visits for 3 years scheduled ± 3 months around the specified time point. After the initial 3 year observation period, visits are done at irregular intervals each time they went to hospital.</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of depressive symptoms is done using a validated 9-item short form of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), a questionnaire that has been developed to screen for psychiatric co-morbidity in unselected populations (Spitzer et al. 1999).</description>

    <description>Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are autosomal dominantly inherited progressive ataxia disorders. An epidemiological study performed in the Netherlands found a prevalence of 3.0 : 100,000 (van de Warrenburg et al. 2002). The SCA´s are genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorders with SCA1, SCA2, SCA3 and SCA6 being the most frequent genotypes worldwide. While SCA1, SCA2 and SCA3 have a complex phenotype, SCA6 patients usually present with pure cerebellar ataxia (Schols et al. 2004). Although precise knowledge of the rate of disease progression is a prerequisite for the biometrical design of future therapeutical trials, prospective studies of the natural history of SCA´s have not been performed. Similarly, the occurrence and evolution of accompanying non-ataxia symptoms have not been studied prospectively.</description>
