  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flavanols are plant-derived compounds commonly present in the human diet. Examples of
      flavanol-containing foods and beverages are apples, chocolate, tea, wine, berries,
      pomegranate and nuts. The consumption of flavanol-containing foods and beverages has been
      associated with improvements in cardiovascular health. In this study, the investigators hope
      to learn more about the effects of the consumption of increasing amounts of cocoa flavanols
      on blood pressure, platelet function and other metabolic parameters in healthy humans. This
      study was followed by a second study that aimed at investigating the effects of long term
      consumptions of cocoa flavanols on blood pressure, platelet function and other metabolic
      parameters in healthy humans.
