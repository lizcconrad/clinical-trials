  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of CKD-related anemia at an early
      stage through screening of high-risk patients in Pakistan at the level of physicians,
      cardiologists, and diabetologists. The information gathered may serve as a foundation in
      formulating national guidelines for better early diagnosis and management of patients with
      CKD.

    <description>Hypertensive and diabetic patients who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled and evaluated for the presence of anemia secondary to CKD. The first visit will capture medical history including risk factors for CKD; laboratory assessments will be performed at the second and third visits to evaluate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and anemia profile, respectively. Participants who are not diagnosted with CKD based upon the second visit will not return for the third visit.</description>
