      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of full
      endoscopic lumbar discectomy versus open lumbar decompression for the treatment of lumbar
      herniated discs in which the patient's leg pain is greater than back pain.

      The study will be performed utilizing a prospective multi-center randomized model.
      Approximately 7 centers will be included in the study as listed above. Patients will be
      informed of clinical trial and asked if they would like to participate. Patients are informed
      that participation is optional. Patients may withdraw from study any time prior to or after
      surgery. Patients will be randomized 2:1 ratio endoscopic:open surgery. Both the endoscopic
      and open surgical techniques are utilized in standard of care. If a subject requires an open
      surgery approach (based on the surgeons assessment at the time of surgery pre or post
      incision) after they are randomized to the endoscopic arm, they will be switched to the open
      arm and included in the open crossover arm of the study.

      Study procedures will occur at the following time points; Pre-op, 6 wk, 3 mon, 6 mon, 1 yr
      and 2 yr follow-up.Subjects will complete questionnaires that assess pain level and location,
      functional capacity, work and health status, medication usage and duration of symptoms.
