      To determine whether three new oral formulations of a strong pain killer release the drug
      into the body in a similar pattern as the already marketed reference capsule formulation with
      or without food

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparisons will be made between three new oral formulations and an existing marketed
      reference capsule formulation to determine whether the release rates of the products are
      similar or equivalent in a fed or fasted state. Determination is by measurement of drug
      concentrations in the blood at serial collection time points pre-dose until 72 hours
      post-dose, following an administration of a single oral dose. Pharmacokinetics parameters of
      AUC and Cmax are the primary endpoints
