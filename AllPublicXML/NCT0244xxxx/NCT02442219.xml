      Persons with coeliac disease treated with a gluten free diet will be asked to give blood for
      a new diagnostic blood test. In this test investigators will use multimerized HLA bound to
      different gliadin-peptides (tetramer) and with the help of a flow-cytometer identify (along
      with other relevant T-cell-markers) gluten specific T-cells. Investigators believe that these
      cells will be present in persons with coeliac disease regardless of gluten-intake.
      Investigators will compare their findings with two control groups; Persons on a gluten free
      diet where celiac disease is excluded (gluten sensitive group) and persons on a gluten
      containing diet (healthy control group). In the initial and main study investigators will
      look at HLA DQ2.5 individuals, which comprise &gt;90% of all persons with coeliac disease.

      A tetramerbased bloodtest which will bind and identify gluten specific T-cells by the use of
      a flow cytometer. 50 ml blood will be needed for this test, along with characterization of
      other blood values (eg. Hb, leukocytes, transferrin binding, B12, biobanking etc).
