    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving sustained
      virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12) in adults with genotype 1 (GT1) chronic
      HCV infection, who received treatment with 3 direct-acting antiviral agents (3-DAAs;
      ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir) with or without ribavirin.

    <time_frame>12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>SVR12 was defined as plasma hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) level less than the lower limit of quantification [&lt;LLOQ]) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Participants with missing data were counted as failures.</description>

    <description>SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA level &lt;LLOQ 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Data are presented by prior HCV treatment experience. Data are provided by participants' prior HCV treatment experience at screening. Participants with missing data were counted as failures.</description>

    <measure>Hepatitis C Virus Patient-Reported Outcomes Instrument (HCV-PRO) Total Score: Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), 12 weeks after the last actual dose of the study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The HCV-PRO has been developed to capture the function and well-being impact of HCV conditions and treatment and contains 16 items important to HCV-infected patients; items were totaled to a summary score. Scores range from 0 to 100. A higher HCV-PRO score indicates a better state of health and a decrease from baseline represents worsening. If a participant answered at least 12 of the 16 items, the missing items were imputed with the mean score of the answered items; if a participant did not answer at least 12 of the items, the total score was considered missing.</description>

    <measure>Short-Form 36 Version 2 Health Survey (SF-36v2) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Scores: Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose of Study Drug</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Baseline), 12 weeks after the last actual dose of the study drug</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36v2 is a non-disease specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument. The SF-36v2 comprises 36 total items (questions) targeting a subject's functional health and well-being in 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health) with a recall period of four weeks. Domain scores are aggregated into a Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. SF-36v2 scores range from 1-100: higher scores indicate a better state of health and a decrease from baseline represents worsening. If a participant answered at least 50% of the items in a multi-item scale of the SF-36v2, the missing items were imputed with the average score of the answered items in the same domain. In cases where the participant did not answer at least 50% of the items, the score for that domain was considered missing. The SF-36v2 MCS and PCS scores were not computed if any domain</description>

        <description>The SF-36v2 is a non-disease specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument. The SF-36v2 comprises 36 total items (questions) targeting a subject's functional health and well-being in 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health) with a recall period of four weeks. Domain scores are aggregated into a Physical Component Summary (PCS) score and a Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. SF-36v2 scores range from 1-100: higher scores indicate a better state of health and a decrease from baseline represents worsening. If a participant answered at least 50% of the items in a multi-item scale of the SF-36v2, the missing items were imputed with the average score of the answered items in the same domain. In cases where the participant did not answer at least 50% of the items, the score for that domain was considered missing.

        <title>(SF-36v2) Mental Component Summary (MCS) Scores: Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks After the Last Dose of Study Drug</title>
        <description>The SF-36v2 is a non-disease specific Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument. The SF-36v2 comprises 36 total items (questions) targeting a subject's functional health and well-being in 8 domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health) with a recall period of four weeks. Domain scores are aggregated into a PCS score and a MCS score. Scores SF-36v2 scores range from 1-100: higher scores indicate a better state of health and a decrease from baseline represents worsening. If a participant answered at least 50% of the items in a multi-item scale of the SF-36v2, the missing items were imputed with the average score of the answered items in the same domain. In cases where the participant did not answer at least 50% of the items, the score for that domain was considered missing. The SF-36v2 MCS and PCS scores were not computed if any domain was missing.</description>
