    <textblock>
      Transpulmonary pressure, which is the pressure at the airway opening minus pleural pressure,
      is frequently monitored in patients with mechanical ventilation. Because pleural pressure is
      difficult to measure in most clinical situations, esophageal pressure (Pes) is used as a
      surrogate. Catheter with air balloon is the most commonly used method to measure the Pes.
      Right position of the balloon is the key factor in accurate measurement of Pes, and the lower
      third part of esophagus is recommended as the target position of the balloon. The catheter is
      usually inserted into the stomach first, and then slowly withdrawn into the esophagus after
      inflation of the balloon. A negative pressure deflection replacing the positive pressure
      deflection during inspiration generally indicates the balloon's entering into the esophagus.
      This confirmation method depends on the normal function of diaphragm. However, it may not
      always be possible to obtain the standard pressure deflections in patients with mechanical
      ventilation, especially in those with diaphragmatic paralysis.

      In present study, the investigators developed a simple method to confirm the balloon position
      by using a modified SmartcathG esophageal balloon catheter. The objective was to evaluate the
      validity of this method and to investigate the relationship between the cardiac artifacts of
      the Pes tracings and the position of the balloon.

    <description>Esophagus balloon catheter will be inserted and the position of the balloon will be confirmed by a air injection test.A bolus of 30 ml of air was injected to the gastric lumen of the catheter just next to the distal edge of the balloon, during the onset of end-expiratory phase. The presence of a positive disturbing wave (PDW) in esophageal pressure waveform to this air injection will be the indicator of the right balloon position.</description>
