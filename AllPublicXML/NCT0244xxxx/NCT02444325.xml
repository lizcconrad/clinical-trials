      The investigators primary objective is to conduct a pilot randomized trial to determine the
      effect of group prenatal care on self-care activities in women with diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term, the investigators aim to test the central hypothesis that group prenatal care,
      compared to traditional prenatal care, will improve glycemic control and, ultimately,
      maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with type 2 and gestational diabetes. The objective
      of this proposal is to conduct a pilot randomized trial to determine the effect of group
      prenatal care on self-care activities, which have been associated with improved glycemic
      control, in women with diabetes.

    <description>Subjects randomized to routine care will receive their care in the usual diabetic clinic attended by residents and faculty. They will receive consultation with the diabetes educator at diagnosis and as needed. Patients are seen every 2 weeks (or more by provider discretion) until 37 weeks and weekly until delivery. Visits are 10-15 minutes and focus on routine screening tests and review of blood sugar logs/medication titration. Each subject's medical chart will be reviewed for demographics, antenatal management, maternal and neonatal outcomes.</description>

    <description>Group visits will be held every 2 weeks in a continuous cycle through a four session curriculum. Women will have weekly visits beginning at 37 weeks with traditional prenatal visits on the weeks when the group does not meet. Groups of 4-12 women will meet for two hour visits and much of that time will be spent on pregnancy, behavioral health, diabetes and nutrition education. Groups will be co-facilitated by 2 CenteringPregnancy trained providers at each site and an obstetric provider. Women may be instructed to have additional visits in the traditional clinic at the discretion of the obstetric provider.</description>
