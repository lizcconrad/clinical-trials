      Cesarean deliveries are prevalent. Unlike other operations, quick recovery is required for
      the mother to nurture the newborn child and establishing an appropriate mother-child bonding.
      Therefore, effective pain management is crucial. In this study we would like to compare
      between two pain relievers' administration protocols:

        1. Oral pain relievers' administration in fix protocol without need for patient demand

        2. Spinal morphine given during the spinal anesthesia in the cesarean section

    <description>During 48 hours following surgery pain medications will be given as followed (listed in brackets are the generic names of each medication):
At patient arrival to the department: Intravenous Tramadol hydrochloride 100 milligrams + TAB. Paracetamol 500 milligrams + TAB. Diclofenac 100 milligrams
After 6 hours from patient arrival and every 6 hours: TAB. Zaldiar (Paracetamol 650 milligrams + Tramadol 75 milligrams).
After 12, 24 and 48 hours from patient arrival: TAB. Diclofenac 100 milligrams.
Rescue medication: TAB. Percocet (Oxycodone 5MG/Paracetamol 325 MG)as necessary up to 4 times per day.
The total amount of paracetamol is limited to 4 gr per day.</description>
