  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinsonian syndrome is clinically characterized by the presence of resting tremor,
      rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Parkinsonian disorders include Parkinson's
      disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal dementia (CBD), multiple
      system atrophy (MSA) and vascular parkinsonism (VP). Each of these diseases has a singular
      physiopathological origin, course and prognosis. Numerous imaging studies consequently aimed
      at finding markers to early make the distinction between the different types of parkinsonism,
      in order to identify patients who could benefit from dopaminergic agonist therapy.

      Excessive iron deposition in the subcortical and brainstem nuclei has been described in
      numerous neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease. Increased iron levels are
      more frequent in area that are rich in dopaminergic neurons and have been implicated in the
      development of movement disorders, the distribution of areas with increased iron deposition
      however varying according to parkinsonism types. Iron deposition quantification could thus
      potentially help in differentiating parkinsonism types and could improve therapy guidance.
      Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) locally estimates the magnetic susceptibility of
      brain tissues based on gradient-echo signal phase. The local susceptibility being sensitive
      to the presence of paramagnetic susbtances, QSM allows the non-invasive evaluation of iron
      distribution and quantification in the brain with high image quality (Liu et al., 2013).
      However, since iron deposition followed an exponential curve during normal aging in most of
      the basal ganglia the potential of QSM to distinguish between healthy and parkinsonian
      subjects in elderly remains unclear.

      The aim of this study was thus to determine susceptibility values in the basal ganglia of
      elderly patients with parkinsonian syndromes, to compare these values to healthy aged-matched
      controls and between parkinsonian syndrome types. Secondly, investigators aimed to evaluate
      microstructural changes in the basal ganglia using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in the same
      population and to determine whether susceptibility and DTI parameter changes are correlated.
      Finally investigators sought to assess the relation between susceptibility/DTI parameter
      values in the basal ganglia and behavioral measures of motor and cognitive abilities.

      Elderly patients with parkinsonian syndrome and healthy age-matched controls are enrolled in
      this study. The subjects all undergo a brain MRI exam. Controls are selected to match the age
      distribution of patients.

      Clinical evaluation The day of the brain MRI examination, all patients undergo a neurological
      and neuropsychological evaluation. Diagnoses are established by a neurologist experienced
      with parkinsonian syndromes according to established guidelines: the UK Parkinson's Disease
      Society Brain Bank criteria for idiopathic PD, the National Institute of Neurological
      Disorders and Stroke and the Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy criteria for
      progressive supranuclear palsy, Lang's criteria for corticobasal dementia, Gilman's criteria
      for multiple system atrophy and Zijlmans's criteria for vascular parkinsonism.

      Impairment of the motor function related to parkinsonian syndrome is assessed using the Hoehn
      and Yahr scale (range 0-5), the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living scale (range
      0-100%), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, range 0-199) and the Short
      Motor Disability scale (range 0-17).

      Cognitive impairment is assessed using the Mini Mental Sate Examination (MMSE) score (range
      0-30), the Grober and Buschke verbal-learning test (range 0-16), a semantic-processing task
      (LEXIS test, range 0-64), the forward/backward Digit span task (range 0-17) of the third
      Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex-Figure (ROCF) test (range
      0-36) to assess visuospatial abilities, attention, executive function and working memory.

      The Mattis Dementia-Rating scale (range 0-144) and the Beck Depression Inventory (range 0-63)
      are performed to look for depression. The Educational Attainment and the National Institute
      of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) (range 0-42) are also recorded.

      MRI acquisition and processing. All patients undergo a brain MRI on a 3-Tesla scanner
      including 3D triple echo gradient echo acquisition to generate susceptibility weighted
      images, T1-weighted magnetisation-prepared rapid 3D gradient-echo (MPRAGE) and diffusion
      tensor imaging acquisition.

      Susceptibility weighted imaging raw data are preprocessed to obtain magnitude and phase
      images for each echo time. Quantitative susceptibility maps are then generated using SPM8
      software (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology,
      Institute of Neurology, London, UK; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/, Matlab 2014a, The
      MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).
