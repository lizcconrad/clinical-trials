    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of oral doses of
      pilocarpine on salivary secretion in healthy male and female subjects. In addition,
      pharmacodynamic effect on static pupillometry will be evaluated as well as pharmacokinetics
      and safety and tolerability of oral doses of pilocarpine in healthy subjects.
