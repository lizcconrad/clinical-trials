  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcer is the most common cause of non traumatic lower extremity amputations
      (LEA) associated with diabetes. Traditionally general and spinal anesthesia were the
      preferred modality of anesthesia. The use of sciatic nerve block has recently gained
      popularity, however, without the supporting evidence of any benefits. This study was to
      evaluate the comparison of anesthesia modalities for hemodynamic stability and postoperative
      pain in diabetic foot patients undergoing minor LEA.
