      Sepsis is a common cause for morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. In USA, the
      incidence of sepsis is about 3/1000 population. However, the incidence of sepsis varies among
      different clinic trails. In addition, clinician empirical select antibiotic according to the
      epidemiology of sepsis, however, the etiology of sepsis is various in different studies. In
      China, the MDRO is much higher than western country. There is no study about the epidemiology
      of sepsis in China. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a study about it in China.

      Sepsis,especially severe sepsis is a major cause of admission to the intensive care unit
      (ICU) and death. In USA, the incidence of sepsis is about 3/1000 population. However, the
      incidence of sepsis varies among different clinic trails. Between 6 and 54% of patients
      admitted to ICUs have severe sepsis and the mortality rate for these patients varies from 20
      to 60%. There is no exactly results of incidence of sepsis in China.

      In addition, clinician empirical select antibiotic according to the epidemiology of sepsis,
      however, the etiology of sepsis is various in different studies. In EPIC II study, the
      organisms of sepsis include Gram-positive microorganisms (69.8%),Gram-negative
      microorganisms(62.2%) and fungi (17%). In China, the MDRO is much higher than western
      country. In contrast to EPIC II study, one study in China showed that the organisms of sepsis
      include Gram-positive microorganisms (14.5%),Gram-negative microorganisms(62.5%) and fungi
      (2.2%). Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a study about epidemiology of sepsis in China.
