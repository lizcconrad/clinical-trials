      To observe the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis(OA) and its efficacy on
      cartilage restoration,acupuncture and physiotherapy treatment were respectively given to two
      random groups. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was
      used to evaluate the motor function of knee joints, followed by magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scanning to measure T2 values in ten cartilage sub-regions in tibiofemoral joints.

      To observe the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on osteoarthritis and its efficacy on
      cartilage restoration,one hundred knees of 50 patients with knee osteoarthritis were randomly
      divided into acupuncture group and physiotherapy group which were respectively received
      acupuncture and physiotherapy treatment for four weeks. Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was used to evaluate the motor function of knee
      joints, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning to measure T2 values in ten
      cartilage sub-regions in tibiofemoral joints.
