  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of aztreonam for inhalation
      solution (AZLI) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and lung infection due to Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (PA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with CF often have lung infections that occur repeatedly or worsen over time. The
      lung infections are often caused by a bacteria called PA. Treatment with antibiotics can stop
      or slow down the growth of the bacteria. The antibiotics may be given by mouth, intravenously
      (IV), or by inhalation as a mist. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of aztreonam for inhalation solution (AZLI), an investigational formulation of the
      antibiotic administered using the eFlowÂ® Electronic Nebulizer by PARI GmbH, in CF patients
      with PA.

      In this study, participants were screened for eligibility at Visit 1 (Day -42) and returned
      to the center for Visit 2 after a 14-day evaluation period. At Visit 2 (Day -28),
      participants began a 28-day course of open-label Tobramycin Inhalation Solution (TIS). At
      Visit 3 (Day 0), following completion of the 28-day course of TIS, participants began
      randomized, blinded treatment with either AZLI twice a day (BID) or three times a day (TID)
      or placebo BID or TID, and continued treatment for a total of 28 days, with a clinic visit at
      Day 14 (Visit 4) and at the end of treatment (Visit 5 [Day 28]). Participants returned for
      visits every 2 weeks for 8 weeks after the end of the blinded treatment (Visits 6 to 9 [Days
      42 to 84]).

      Two hundred and forty-seven participants were treated in the TIS phase of this study. Two
      hundred and eleven subjects completed the TIS phase and were treated in the
      placebo-controlled phase with study drug (AZLI or placebo).

    <measure>Time to Need for Inhaled or Intravenous (IV) Antipseudomonal Antibiotics</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 84 (end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was time to need for a course of inhaled or IV antipseudomonal antibiotics with documented physician assessment of need for antibiotics. Antipseudomonal Antibiotic need was documented based on the presence of at least one of the following four symptoms predictive of pulmonary exacerbation: decreased exercise tolerance, increased cough, increased sputum / chest congestion, decreased appetite, or other.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire - Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Symptoms Scale (RSS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ-R was administered at Day -28, baseline, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 84 (end of study). The endpoint was change in respiratory symptoms from baseline, assessed with the CFQ-R RSS (range of scores [units]: 0-100; higher scores indicate fewer symptoms).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) (L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was performed at each visit. FEV1 was recorded according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines.
FEV1(L) is the measurement of the volume of air (expressed in liters) exhaled in 1 second.
The percent change in this parameter from Day 0 to Day 28 was determined for each treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Number of Hospitalization Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Details of all hospitalizations, including the dates of admission and discharge, were recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA) Log10 Colony Forming Units (CFU) Per Gram of Sputum</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum samples were collected at all participant visits of the study for analysis of microbiology endpoints. Sputum samples were processed for qualitative and quantitative culture of PA (each morphotype). Due to the skewness of the distribution of CFU data, the data were transformed using the base 10 logarithm, in an attempt to normalize the data and allow for parametric tests, before calculating changes. To account for zero values, 1 was added to each CFU measurement before being transformed. Any CFU data values where PA was not isolated from a valid culture were set to zero.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were randomized in 1:1:2:2 ratio to placebo twice a day (BID) or three times a day (TID) and AZLI BID or TID, respectively. A total of 211 subjects were included in the ITT analyses: 38 placebo BID, 38 placebo TID, 69 AZLI BID, and 66 AZLI TID. All analyses were conducted on pooled placebo (n = 76) versus pooled AZLI (n = 135) groups.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Sputum samples were collected at all participant visits of the study for analysis of microbiology endpoints. Sputum samples were processed for qualitative and quantitative culture of PA (each morphotype). Due to the skewness of the distribution of CFU data, the data were transformed using the base 10 logarithm, in an attempt to normalize the data and allow for parametric tests, before calculating changes. To account for zero values, 1 was added to each CFU measurement before being transformed. Any CFU data values where PA was not isolated from a valid culture were set to zero.</description>

          <description>Sputum samples were collected at all participant visits of the study for analysis of microbiology endpoints. Sputum samples were processed for qualitative and quantitative culture of PA (each morphotype). Due to the skewness of the distribution of CFU data, the data were transformed using the base 10 logarithm, in an attempt to normalize the data and allow for parametric tests, before calculating changes. To account for zero values, 1 was added to each CFU measurement before being transformed. Any CFU data values where PA was not isolated from a valid culture were set to zero.</description>
