  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to compare the impact of a new Internet Dyspnea
      Self-Management Program (eDSMP) with an established face-to-face Dyspnea Self-Management
      Program (DSMP) in patients with COPD. The primary aim of the study is to test the following
      two hypotheses: 1. The eDSMP and the DSMP will have comparable improvements in the primary
      outcomes of shortness of breath (dyspnea) with activities of daily living (ADL), exercise
      adherence and performance, and pulmonary exacerbations (frequency and duration) at 3 and 6
      months. 2. The eDSMP and the DSMP will have comparable improvements in the secondary outcomes
      of perception of support, self-efficacy for exercise and managing dyspnea, and health
      resource utilization at 3 and 6 months. This study is a randomized, longitudinal, repeated
      measures design with measurement times at 0, 3, and 6 months.

      Despite optimal medical treatment, people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      continue to experience dyspnea or shortness of breath. This study will evaluate two different
      ways to provide education and support to help patients manage their shortness of breath. One
      program will be conducted in a face-to-face setting and a second through the Internet. The
      main difference between the two programs is the way they are administered. The education,
      exercise, and monitoring components are the same. The overall goal of this study is to find
      out whether the two programs are comparable in their effect on shortness of breath (dyspnea)
      with activities of daily living, exercise adherence and performance, and pulmonary
      exacerbations (frequency and duration) at 3 and 6 months. Perception of support,
      self-efficacy for exercise and managing dyspnea, and health resource utilization will also be
      measured at 3 and 6 months. This study is a randomized, longitudinal, repeated measures
      design with measurement times at 0, 3, and 6 months.
