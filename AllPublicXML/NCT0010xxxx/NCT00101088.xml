      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when given with
      imatinib mesylate in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as temsirolimus, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Imatinib mesylate may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving temsirolimus with imatinib mesylate may kill more cancer cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of temsirolimus when administered with imatinib
      mesylate in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      II. Determine potential dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine, preliminarily, hematologic and cytogenetic response rates in patients treated
      with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once on days 1, 8, 15, and
      22 and oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients receive 2 additional
      courses beyond maximal response. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      temsirolimus until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.
