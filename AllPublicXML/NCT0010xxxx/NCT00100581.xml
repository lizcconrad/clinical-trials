  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A significant proportion of HIV infected people in the U.S. are also infected with hepatitis
      C virus (HCV). The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of anti-HIV therapy on
      treatment of HCV with pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (PEG/RBV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 15% to 30% of HIV infected people in the U.S. are also infected with HCV. Since
      the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the treatment of HIV, HCV infection has
      emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in HCV/HIV coinfected patients. One
      infection often accelerates the progression of the other, and effective management strategies
      for both infections need to be developed for HCV/HIV coinfected patients. This study will
      determine whether HIV ART followed by HCV therapy taken concurrently with ART results in
      better treatment outcomes compared to HCV therapy alone.

      This study will last up to 102 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      arms. Arm A participants will receive 24 to 30 weeks of ART consisting of tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) and either efavirenz (EFV) or
      lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). If deemed eligible, Arm A participants will continue their ART
      regimen and begin a concurrent PEG/RBV regimen for up to 48 weeks. At Week 48, participants
      in Arm A will stop PEG/RBV and will be followed for an additional 24 weeks on ART alone.

      Arm B participants will receive PEG/RBV alone for up to 48 weeks. At Week 48, participants in
      Arm B will be followed for an additional 48 weeks with no treatment.

      There will be 20 study visits over 102 weeks for Arm A participants and 18 study visits over
      96 weeks for Arm B participants. Blood collection and clinical assessment will occur at all
      visits, and urine collection will occur at selected visits. Participants will also be asked
      to complete adherence questionnaires. Participants in this study are encouraged to also
      enroll in ACTG A5128.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for Step 1:

          -  HIV infected

          -  HIV viral load of greater than 1000 copies/ml within 45 days of study entry

          -  HCV genotype 1 infected

          -  CD4 count of 300 cells/mm3 or greater within 45 days prior to study entry

          -  ART-naive or off ART for at least 6 months

          -  Willing to accept randomly assigned study treatment

          -  Willing to use acceptable forms of contraception during the study and for 6 months
             after stopping all study medications

          -  Chronic liver disease consistent with chronic viral hepatitis as indicated by either
             liver biopsy within 2 years prior to study entry or a physician's report of hepatitis
             C infection for more than 6 months. Participants with cirrhosis or without a liver
             biopsy result within 2 years of study entry must have a serum alpha-fetoprotein of 100
             ng/ml or less and a Child-Pugh score of 6 or higher within 45 days prior to study
