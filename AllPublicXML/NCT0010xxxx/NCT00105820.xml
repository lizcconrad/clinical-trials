  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the impact on veteranï¿½s health status and treatment cost, depression is
      under-diagnosed and under-treated. The goal of this study is to learn how to implement a
      previously tested, effective collaborative care model for improving the quality of depression
      care across multiple Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs). To achieve this goal, we
      are conducting a randomized controlled trial of evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI), a
      dissemination method that relies on expert design and local implementation of evidence-based
      practice interventions. We hypothesize that EBQI will result in increased rates of assessment
      and appropriate management of depression. Results will be useful in designing realistic
      chronic care programs and performance measures for continuing care improvement.

      Objectives: Our primary objective is to evaluate whether collaborative care EBQI results in
      increased rates of assessment and appropriate management of depression and decreased
      depressive symptomatology for veterans. Our secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of
      EBQI on organizational outcomes.

      Methods: Three VISNs, 10, 16 and 23, are participating. Three primary care clinics within
      each VISN are randomized, two to the intervention and one to usual care, for a total of nine
      study sites. In the intervention clinics, VA leadership, assisted by study staff, tailor and
      implement a depression care program for patient assessment, patient self-management support,
      provider education, primary and mental health collaboration, and care management. The usual
      care clinics participate only in the evaluation. Patient recruitment is through a telephone
      interview. Patients who are at risk for major depression are recruited, 67 from each site.
      Patient outcomes including depression symptom severity on the PHQ-9 and the VA SF-12 are
      being assessed by telephone at six months post enrollment. Other outcome variables are
      adequacy of antidepressant trials, psychotherapy and specialty care visits, and treatment
      adherence. A utilization and cost analysis will be conducted. VISN and VAMC leadership are
      surveyed to assess organizational outcomes. Data is being collected through VA administrative
      databases, patient and staff interviews, and study records. Power calculations and data
      analysis planning reflect the clustered sample design.
