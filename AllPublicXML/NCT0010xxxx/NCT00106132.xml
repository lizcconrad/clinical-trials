      This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of two treatments-injections of
      triamcinolone acetonide into the eye vs. standard laser therapy-for macular edema (swelling
      in the center of the retina) that is caused by blockage in a retinal blood vessel. Edema
      caused by blockage in a large vessel is called central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Edema
      caused by blockage in a smaller vein is called branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).
      Triamcinolone acetonide is a steroid drug that reduces swelling; the Food and Drug
      Administration has approved it for injection into joints and muscles to treat inflammatory
      conditions.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with macular edema due to CRVO or BRVO of between 3 and 18
      months' duration may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical
      history, blood pressure measurement, and urine pregnancy test for women who can become
      pregnant. Screening also includes the following procedures:

        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity and eye pressure, and to examine the cornea,
           lens, and retina. The pupils are dilated with drops for this examination.

        -  Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel
           abnormality.

        -  Optical coherence tomography to measure retinal thickness. The eye is examined with a
           machine that produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. The patient is seated in
           front of a machine and looks at a pattern of flashing and rotating red and green lights,
           first with one eye and then with the other.

        -  Fundus photography to help evaluate the status of the retina and changes that may occur
           in the future. Photographs of the retina are taken using a camera that flashes a bright
           light into the eye.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive triamcinolone injections or standard treatment.
      Triamcinolone is given in either a 1-mg or 4-mg dose. Standard treatment for CRVO and for
      BRVO with excessive blood in the retina is observation. Standard treatment for BRVO without
      excessive blood is laser therapy. Patients with BRVO who do not qualify for laser therapy
      when they enter the study may have it later if blood clears enough to permit treatment. The
      procedures for triamcinolone injections and laser therapy are as follows:

        -  Triamcinolone acetonide: The eye is numbed with anesthetic drops and the study drug is
           injected into the vitreous, the jelly-like substance located between the back of the
           lens and the retina. Patients apply antibiotic drops at home for 3 days following the
           procedure.

        -  Laser treatment: The eye is numbed with anesthetic drops and a special contact lens is
           placed on the eye during the laser beam application.

      All patients are followed every 4 months for 3 years. Additional visits may be scheduled if
      needed. Patients who receive triamcinolone injections are also examined within 1 week of each
      injection and 1 month after each injection. At the 4-month visits patients undergo repeat eye
      examination and fundus photography. Optical coherence tomography is done at some visits, and
      fluorescein angiography is repeated at months 4, 12 and 24. Blood pressure is measured at
      months 12, 24 and 36. Patients may be retreated with triamcinolone injections or laser
      therapy as often as every 4 months, depending on their response to treatment.

    <textblock>
      Macular edema is a major cause of vision loss in patients with central retinal vein occlusion
      (CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Currently, there is no effective treatment
      for macular edema associated with CRVO. For macular edema associated with BRVO, grid laser
      photocoagulation may be an effective treatment, but many patients derive limited benefit from
      this treatment. Therefore, the development of new treatment modalities to treat macular edema
      caused by these two conditions is an important research goal. The Standard Care vs.
      COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study will compare the efficacy and safety
      of standard care with intravitreal injection(s) of triamcinolone acetonide to treat macular
      edema associated with CRVO and BRVO.

      The SCORE Study is designed as a multicenter, randomized, Phase III trial to compare the
      efficacy and safety of standard care versus triamcinolone acetonide injection(s) for the
      treatment of macular edema associated with CRVO and BRVO. In each of the two disease areas,
      630 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups: standard care,
      intravitreal triamcinolone 4 mg, or intravitreal triamcinolone 1 mg. For CRVO participants,
      standard care consists of observation of the macular edema. For BRVO participants, standard
      care consists of immediate grid laser photocoagulation for study eyes without a dense macular
      hemorrhage. For study eyes of BRVO participants with a dense macular hemorrhage, standard
      care is observation followed by grid laser photocoagulation if and when clearing of the
      hemorrhage permits grid laser photocoagulation. For all three groups, neovascular
      complications will be treated as necessary. Repeat treatments will be provided as clinically
      indicated based on protocol-specific guidelines. Participants will be followed for 3 years
      after randomization. The primary efficacy outcome of this study is improvement by 15 or more
      letters from baseline in best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score at the 12-month visit.
      Secondary efficacy outcomes include change between baseline and each efficacy outcome
      assessment visit in best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score, change in retinal thickness at
      the center of the macula and change in area of retinal thickening as assessed by stereoscopic
      color fundus photography, and change in retinal thickness and calculated retinal thickening
      as assessed by optical coherence tomography. Safety outcomes include injection-related
      adverse events such as infectious endophthalmitis, non-infectious endophthalmitis, retinal
      detachment, and vitreous hemorrhage and steroid-related adverse events, which include
      cataract and elevated intraocular pressure.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        General Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent.

          -  Sex: Participants may be male or female.

          -  Age: 18 years or older

        Ocular Inclusion Criteria (study eye):

        A. Participants must have center-involved macular edema secondary to either CRVO or BRVO.
        Eyes may be enrolled if macular edema has been documented for at least 3 months and not
        longer than 18 months (by patient history or ophthalmologic diagnosis). The following
        definitions are used for the purposes of the SCORE Study:

          -  A CRVO is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhage or other biomicroscopic
             evidence of retinal vein occlusion (e.g. telangiectatic capillary bed) and a dilated
             venous system (or previously dilated venous system) in all 4 quadrants.

          -  A BRVO is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhage or other biomicroscopic
             evidence of retinal vein occlusion (e.g. telangiectatic capillary bed) and a dilated
             venous system (or previously dilated venous system) in 1 quadrant or less of retina
             drained by the affected vein.

          -  A hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO) is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhage
             or other biomicroscopic evidence of retinal vein occlusion (e.g. telangiectatic
             capillary bed) and a dilated venous system (or previously dilated venous system) in
             more than 1 quadrant but less than all 4 quadrants. Typically, a HRVO is a retinal
             vein occlusion that involves 2 altitudinal quadrants. For the purposes of the SCORE
             Study, eyes with HRVO will be treated as eyes with BRVO and analyzed with the BRVO
             group.

        B. ETDRS visual acuity score of greater than or equal to 34 letters (approximately 20/200)
        and less than or equal to 73 letters (approximately 20/40) by the ETDRS visual acuity
        protocol at the screening visit.

        C. Mean retinal thickness on two OCT measurements greater than or equal to 250 microns
        (central subfield) at the screening visit.

        D. Media clarity, pupillary dilation and participant cooperation sufficient for adequate
        fundus photographs.

        E. Stable visual acuity. This is defined as a less than 10 letter improvement in
        best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity score between the screening visit and the randomization
        visit. Those patients with a 10 or more letter improvement between the screening and
        randomization visits will be declared temporarily ineligible.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        General Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants with any of the following conditions are ineligible:

        A. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
        the study (e.g., chronic alcoholism or drug abuse, personality disorder or use of major
        tranquilizers indicating difficulty in long term follow-up, likelihood of survival of less
        than 3 years).

        B. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of study entry that involved
        treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at time of study entry.

        C. History of allergy to any corticosteroid or component of the delivery vehicle.

        D. Sitting systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure
        greater than 110 mmHg at the screening visit. If the initial reading exceeds these values,
        a second reading may be taken two or more hours later; the patient may be included (if all
        other inclusion criteria are met) in the study if the second reading demonstrates a
        systolic blood pressure equal to or less than 180 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure is
        110 mmHg or less. If the blood pressure is brought to 180 mmHg systolic or less and 110
        mmHg diastolic or less by antihypertensive treatment, the patient can become eligible.

        E. The participant will be moving out of the area of the clinical center to an area not
        covered by another clinical center during the 3 years of the study.

        F. History of systemic (e.g., oral, IV, IM, epidural, bursal) corticosteroids within 4
        months prior to randomization or topical, rectal or inhaled corticosteroids in current use
        more than 2 times per week.

        G. Positive urine pregnancy test: all women of childbearing potential (those who are
        pre-menopausal and not surgically sterilized) may participate only if they have a negative
        urine pregnancy test (at either the screening visit or randomization visit), if they do not
        intend to become pregnant during the timeframe of the study and if they agree to use at
        least one of the following birth control methods: hormonal therapy such as oral,
        implantable or injectable chemical contraceptives; mechanical therapy such as spermicide in
        conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or diaphragm; intrauterine device (IUD); or
        surgical sterilization of partner.

        Ocular Exclusion Criteria (study eye):

        A. Exam evidence of vitreoretinal interface disease (e.g. vitreomacular traction,
        epiretinal membrane), either on clinical examination or optical coherence tomography
        thought to be contributing to macular edema.

        B. An eye that, in the investigator's opinion, would not benefit from resolution of macular
        edema such as eyes with foveal atrophy, dense pigmentary changes or dense subfoveal hard
        exudates.

        C. Presence of an ocular condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might affect
        macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of the study (e.g., age-related
        macular degeneration, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, neovascular glaucoma,
        Irvine-Gass Syndrome, prior macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment).

        D. Presence of a substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely
        to be decreasing visual acuity by 3 lines or more (i.e. a 20/40 cataract).

        E. History of grid laser photocoagulation for macular edema.

        F. History of intravitreal corticosteroid injection.

        G. History of peribulbar or retrobulbar corticosteroid use for any reason within 6 months
        prior to randomization.

        H. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) or sector laser photocoagulation
        within four months prior to randomization or anticipated within the next four months
        following randomization.

        I. History of pars plana vitrectomy.

        J. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any
        intraocular surgery, etc.) within 6 months prior to randomization or anticipated within the

        O. History of open angle glaucoma (either primary open angle glaucoma or other cause of
        open angle glaucoma; note: prior angle closure glaucoma is not an exclusion).

          -  A history of ocular hypertension (or IOP greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg without a
             prior diagnosis of ocular hypertension) is not an exclusion as long as (1) IOP is less
             than 25 mm Hg, (2) the patient is using no more than one topical glaucoma medication,
             (3) the most recent visual field, performed within the last 12 months, is normal (if

          -  A history of ocular hypertension (or IOP greater than or equal to 22 mm Hg without a
             prior diagnosis of ocular hypertension) is not an exclusion as long as (1) IOP is less
             than 25 mm Hg, (2) the patient is using no more than one topical glaucoma medication,
             (3) the most recent visual field, performed within the last 12 months, is normal (if
