      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and leucovorin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with fluorouracil and leucovorin may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with
      fluorouracil and leucovorin works in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable
      stomach cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine response in patients with previously treated metastatic or unresectable
           gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma treated with bortezomib,
           fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium.

      Secondary

        -  Determine time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, and 15. One hour after
      completion of bortezomib, patients receive leucovorin calcium IV and fluorouracil IV followed
      by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study.
