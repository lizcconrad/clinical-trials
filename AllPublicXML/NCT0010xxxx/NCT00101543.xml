      Conventional rehabilitation does not restore normal, safe gait to many stroke survivors.
      Functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) using intramuscular (IM) electrodes (FNS-IM)
      improved persistent gait deficits for patients with chronic stroke (1-7 years post stroke),
      but required a long protocol of 6-18 months. For chronic deficits, a shortened response to
      treatment (3 months) was obtained by combining FNS-IM with body weight-supported treadmill
      training (BWSTT). Gains included strength, coordination, gait kinematics, walking endurance,
      and quality of life. Gait deficits treated in the chronic phase are more resistant to
      treatment than in the early recovery phase, because chronic, abnormal movement patterns are
      more ingrained. Therefore, during the early recovery phase, it is likely that a relatively
      greater treatment response will be obtained. The purpose of the proposed work is to test the
      combination FNS-IM + BWSTT during the early recovery phase following stroke. Hypothesis I is:
      FNS-IM + BWSTT will restore volitional gait more completely for subjects during the early
      recovery phase following stroke, compared to BWSTT alone. Subjects will be admitted at 1-11
      months after stroke. Thirty five subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment
      groups. They will be treated for 48 sessions, four sessions/week. Primary outcome measures
      will be: kinematic swing phase gait components, energy cost of gait, and an index of walking
      endurance. Secondary outcome measures will be kinematic stance phase gait components and gait
      speed. The second set of hypotheses will test the relationship between restoration of
      mobility and measurements of impairment, function and quality of life.

      will be: kinematic swing phase gait components, energy cost of gait, and an index of walking
      endurance. Secondary outcome measures will be kinematic stance phase gait components and gait
      speed. The second set of hypotheses will test the relationship between restoration of
      mobility and measurements of impairment, function and quality of life. Additionally,
      co-variates will be assessed at entry into the study: gender, age, mood, co-morbidities, time
      since stroke, and weeks of prior rehabilitation. Data for outcome measures will be collected
      at weeks 1, 6, 12, and 6 months after the end of treatment. For Hypothesis I testing,
      contrasts will be made between the two treatment groups. A separate regression model will be
      analyzed for each outcome measure. The post-test score for a given primary outcome measure
      will serve as the dependent variable in a regression model. The two independent variables
      will be the treatment assignment information (as a dichotomous variable) and the pretest
      score on the given outcome measure (the covariate). In additional model analyses for the
      second set of hypotheses, the relationships will be ascertained between mobility restoration
      and impairment, function, and quality of life. Mobility deficits following stroke pose a
      significant economic, social, and psychological hardship to the individual and to society.
      Development of techniques that improve lower extremity function will improve the quality of
      life and reduce associated health care costs for patients after stroke. The results of the
      proposed study have the potential to provide a new acute stroke treatment that will increase
      the rate of recovery, produce a more comprehensive recovery of motor function, safer gait,
      greater functional independence, and enhanced quality of life.
