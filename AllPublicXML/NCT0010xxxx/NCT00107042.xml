  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate 2 licensed vaccine products (Recombivax and Twinrix) given in a
      two-dose schedule to youth at risk for hepatitis B and HIV infection to evaluate
      immunogenicity of the products in this population, barriers to vaccine delivery, and factors
      which predict a diminished immune response. Since these youths are also potential candidates
      for future HIV vaccine trials, this study will also include preliminary assessment of youths'
      understanding of informed consent forms, and willingness to participate in a vaccine trial
      and return for multiple visits (including blood draws for immunologic assessment).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B (HBV) prophylactic immunization has been recommended for at-risk adolescents for
      more than 10 years although universal coverage has not been achieved. Vaccine response in
      healthy adolescents has generally been reported to be excellent. But, data from the study
      Reaching for Excellence in Adolescent Care and Health (REACH) that studied HIV-negative
      adolescents who were at-risk of acquiring Hepatitis B infection through sexual or needle
      sharing behaviors has demonstrated a much lower than expected vaccine response rate in this
      population using standard vaccine dosing. Some data suggest that factors such as gender or
      body mass index might be responsible for the differences in response to the vaccine observed
      in individuals. The reason for the diminished vaccine response in this population is unclear.
      If in fact, Hepatitis B vaccine response is diminished in this population, then efforts to
      determine correlates of response and to improve the response are warranted. The proposed
      trial will evaluate 2 licensed vaccine products given in a two-dose schedule in youth at risk
      for hepatitis B and HIV infection to evaluate immunogenicity of the products in this
      population, barriers to vaccine delivery, and factors which predict a diminished immune
      response.

      Since these youths are also potential candidates for future HIV vaccine trials, participation
      in such trials will require ability to understand and willingness to volunteer for such
      trials, ability to return for multiple vaccinations and blood draws to assess vaccine
      response, and willingness to participate in HIV prevention education. A hepatitis B vaccine
      trial will provide a licensed vaccine to youth in whom the vaccine is indicated and will
      allow preliminary assessment of youth's willingness to participate in a vaccine trial that
      involves blood draws for immunologic assessment.

      Tools that will be necessary for HIV vaccine trials in youth include a youth-friendly
      simplified vaccine trial education component with a required written test for the
      participant, a standardized risk reduction education program, and a computer-assisted
      assessment of youth behaviors. These tools can be finalized and field tested in youth
      participating in the hepatitis B vaccine trial without promoting a false sense of protection
      from HIV. Secondary objectives of this trial will include assessment of a number of ancillary
      tools crucial for future HIV vaccine trials. This Hepatitis B vaccine trial will also serve
      as a HIV vaccine preparedness trial for youth at risk for both Hepatitis B and HIV.

      Design: This is a phase II, randomized, single-blinded trial of two hepatitis B immunization
      regimens in 150 HIV-negative, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen and
      surface antibody negative youth. Vaccinations will be given in a two-dose regimen at 0 and
      six months (75 subjects in each arm) and the primary outcome will be seroresponsiveness one
      month after the 6-month dose. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed.

            <groups_desc>The study wasn't powered to compare the 2 arms but to detect a large difference. A quantitative antibody (a'body) response was measured, but for sample size and power considerations, the outcome was considered to be binary. The primary analysis involved straightforward computation of point estimates and exact confidence intervals of immunogenicity in each arm. The data for primary analysis used the Intent-to-Treat for subjects who were vaccinated at least once. Missing titers were not imputed.</groups_desc>

        <description>Qualitative Vaccine Response to Hepatitis B (Hep B) Surface Antigen is defined as a “Responder” if serum a'body level is &gt;= 10 mIU/mL and a “Non- Responder” if a serum antibody level is &lt; 10 mIU/mL. Sexual identity was analyzed as a potential impact factor and was measured and examined for the association with both the presence of adequate response as well as the quantitative titer one month post 2 vaccine doses.</description>

        <description>Qualitative Vaccine Response to Hepatitis B (Hep B) Surface Antigen is defined as a “Responder” if serum a'body level is &gt;= 10 mIU/mL and a “Non- Responder” if a serum antibody level is &lt; 10 mIU/mL. Total number of lifetime male sex partners was analyzed as a potential impact factor and was measured and examined for the association with both the presence of adequate response as well as the quantitative titer one month post 2 vaccine doses.</description>

        <population>Participants who had a Wk 28 Hep B a'body titer were included. One subject had no results at Wk 28 but had results at entry and end of study (EOS). Since the EOS titer was &gt; 10, this subject was included as a responder in qualitative analyses, but not in quantitative analyses, since the EOS titer is not sufficiently predictive of the Wk 28 titer.</population>

          <description>Qualitative Vaccine Response to Hepatitis B (Hep B) Surface Antigen is defined as a “Responder” if serum a'body level is &gt;= 10 mIU/mL and a “Non- Responder” if a serum antibody level is &lt; 10 mIU/mL. Whether participants ever smoked marijuana was analyzed as a potential impact factor and was measured and examined for the association with both the presence of adequate response as well as the quantitative titer one month post 2 vaccine doses.</description>
          <population>Participants who had a Wk 28 Hep B a'body titer were included. One subject had no results at Wk 28 but had results at entry and end of study (EOS). Since the EOS titer was &gt; 10, this subject was included as a responder in qualitative analyses, but not in quantitative analyses, since the EOS titer is not sufficiently predictive of the Wk 28 titer.</population>
