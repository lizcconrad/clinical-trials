      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing,
      or coming back. The use of celecoxib may prevent or treat head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying celecoxib to see how well it works
      compared to placebo in preventing head and neck cancer in patients with oral leukoplakia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the clinical efficacy of celecoxib vs placebo, in terms of inducing regression
           of oral leukoplakia lesions, in patients with hyperplastic or dysplastic oral
           leukoplakia.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this drug in modulating multiple intermediate biomarkers (e.g.,
           COX-2, PPARγ, or PPARδ) in normal and hyperplastic or dysplastic oral epithelia of these
           patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the cost-effectiveness of this drug as a chemopreventative agent in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Patients
      are stratified according to the pathology of the leukoplakia lesion (dysplasia vs
      hyperplasia). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 3 months.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 3 months. All patients undergo
           biopsy. Patients then cross-over to the opposite treatment arm for 3 months.

      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      Patients are followed at 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-60 patients (18-40 for study drug, 9-20 for placebo before
      cross-over) will be accrued for this study.
