      The purpose of this study is to determine whether deferiprone has superior efficacy in
      removing excess iron from the heart when compared with deferoxamine.

      This study is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trial. The study
      population is participants with thalassemia major who are receiving regular chelation therapy
      with deferoxamine. A total of sixty (60) participants will be enrolled among the
      investigative sites.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether deferiprone exhibits superior
      efficacy in removing excess iron from the heart compared to that of the standard therapy,
      deferoxamine.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the relative efficacy of deferiprone with respect to
      that of deferoxamine as assessed by serum ferritin concentration and liver iron
      concentration.

      The primary efficacy measure in this study will be the participants' cardiac iron status, as
      determined by heart MRI T2* assessments.

      The secondary efficacy measure will be by serum ferritin concentration and liver iron
      concentration. This will be measured by the Superconducting Quantum-Interference Device
      (SQUID) BioSusceptometer.

      The duration of treatment is 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of thalassemia major as confirmed by laboratory and clinical criteria

          -  Participants who are well transfused-maintaining a mean pre-transfusion Hb
             (hemoglobin) no less than 9 g/dL.

          -  Between 18 and 36 years of age.

          -  Receiving ongoing chelation therapy with deferoxamine for at least the past five
             years. Those who have been exposed to deferiprone for

             ≤ 6 months but not within the last 2 years prior to commencement of this study will be
             considered eligible to participate.

          -  Abnormal heart MRI T2* greater than or equal to 8 ms and &lt; 20 ms.

          -  If female, fertile, and is neither pregnant nor lactating, confirms she will use an
             effective method of contraception for the length of the trial and has a negative
             pregnancy test immediately prior to commencement of study drug OR has had a tubal
             ligation OR a hysterectomy OR is post menopausal (at least 1 year no menses prior to
             enrollment in the study) OR their only sexual partner has been sterilized (if male).

          -  If male and fertile, he confirms that he and/or his partner will use an effective
             method of contraception for the length of the trial.

          -  Provide a signed and witnessed written informed consent obtained prior to the first
             study intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have anemia other than thalassemia.

          -  HIV antibody positive.

          -  Clinical evidence of cardiomyopathy as shown by LV Shortening Fraction &lt; 30 % and/or
             CMR derived LV (left ventricular) Ejection Fraction &lt; 56 %.

          -  Severe/significant arrhythmia, including those who have had atrial fibrillation
             (participants with occasional ectopic beats and normal echo can be included) or those
             requiring treatment.

          -  Previously discontinued therapy with deferiprone or deferoxamine because of an adverse
             drug reaction to either chelator.

          -  Have received deferiprone in the last five years. However those who have been exposed
             to deferiprone for ≤ 6 months but not within the last 2 years prior to commencement of
             this study will be considered eligible to participate.

             except for participants who have been treated with interferon and in whom the ANC has
             fully recovered. Participants with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in the last year,
