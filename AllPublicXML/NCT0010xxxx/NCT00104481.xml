  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of group therapy for cigarette
      smoking cessation. The group meets for 8 sessions and includes education and group discussion
      about the effects of smoking and ways to cope with withdrawal symptoms and other challenges
      to maintaining abstinence. In one condition, the groups also learn techniques based on
      cognitive therapy, to help cope with negative feelings.

      The comparison condition is the same length as the cognitive behavior therapy condition but
      omits the cognitive restructuring component. In both conditions, smokers prepare for a quit
      date by using scheduled reduced smoking, which involves smoking on a set schedule that
      gradually reduces the number of cigarettes smoked. Post-treatment assessments occur one week
      after the end of treatment, and at 3-month followup.

      Pre- and post-treatment assessments include measures of coping skills and emotional
      acceptance, as well as smoking rate.
