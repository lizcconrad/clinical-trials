      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of Talaporfin Sodium
      (LS11) Photodynamic Therapy in patients with late stage Age-Related Macular Disease (AMD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 study is a safety and tolerability investigation of LS11 photodynamic therapy in
      subjects with persistent leaking neovascular membranes in patients with AMD who have a visual
      acuity of 20/200 or less. This is a sequential group dose escalation trial with the cohorts
      defined by increasing the light dose. Within each light-dose cohort, three (3) subjects will
      be treated at a drug dose of 0.2 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg.
