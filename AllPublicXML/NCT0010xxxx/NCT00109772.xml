  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult subjects with Complex
      Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Type 1.

      One hundred eighty (180) subjects diagnosed with unilateral CRPS Type 1 will be enrolled and
      randomized to receive orally either 10 mg/day of lenalidomide or placebo (90 subjects per
      treatment arm). For each subject, the study consists of three phases: Pre-randomization Phase
      (2 weeks), Treatment Phase (12 weeks) and Extension Phase where subjects have the opportunity
      to receive lenalidomide treatment as long as a benefit is derived from the drug. Subjects who
      complete all 12 weeks of the treatment phase may be eligible to receive lenalidomide in the
      extension phase. Subject may continue in the extension phase as long as a benefit is derived
      from the drug.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily Sleep Assessment Average Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated how much CRPS pain interfered with their sleep each day in a diary. The Sleep Assessment uses an eleven point scale for four questions. Questions concern ability to fall asleep, ability to stay asleep, how refreshed the participant feels upon waking and how alert the participant is during the day. All use a scale of 0-10, where the higher number is the positive response (e.g. 0=Pain completely interferes with sleep and 10=Pain does not interfere). The mean of all four responses was calculated if at least 3 of the 4 questions had a value. Week 12 values are compared to baseline values. Positive change values indicate improvement.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form

          -  Understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form

          -  A diagnosis of CRPS Type 1, as defined by modified International Association for the
             Study of Pain criteria for at least a one-year duration. Unilateral involvement of a
             distal limb (hand or foot) with or without proximal spread must be present. In the
             presence of upper and lower limb involvement, the most severely affected limb will be
             designated the CRPS-affected limb.

          -  Screening: CRPS pain intensity score in the CRPS-affected limb must be at least 4 on
             an 11-point (0-10) Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS).

          -  Randomization: Average PI-NRS score for randomization purposes will be based on AM and
             PM assessments made during the 7 days prior to randomization. At least eight PI-NRS
             scores during this 7-day period are required and the Average PI-NRS score in the
             CRPS-affected limb during this period must be at least 4 on an 11-point (0-10) PI-NRS.

          -  Measurable (by electrophysiology methods) sural, median sensory, median motor and
             peroneal motor nerves at the screening nerve conduction study.

          -  Opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
             anticonvulsants, antidepressant drugs and other non-drug therapies may be continued
             provided that the subject is on stable doses/regimens for at least four weeks prior to
             the start of the Treatment Phase (Visit 2).

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must agree to practice complete abstinence from
             heterosexual intercourse or to use two methods of contraception beginning 4 weeks
             prior to the start of study drug (Day 1) while on study drug (including dose
             interruptions) and 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The two methods of
             contraception must include one highly effective method (i.e. intrauterine device
             [IUD], hormonal [birth control pills, injections, or implants only if used in
             conjunction with a low-dose (81 mg/day) aspirin regimen], tubal ligation, partner's
             vasectomy) and one additional effective (barrier) method (i.e. latex condom,
             diaphragm, cervical cap). If a hormonal method (birth control pills, injections, or
             implants) or IUD is not medically possible for the subject, two of the barrier methods
             will be acceptable.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have two negative pregnancy tests
             (sensitivity of at least 50 mlU/mL) prior to starting study drug treatment. The first
             test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second within 24 hours of starting
             study drug. Once treatment has started, it is recommended that subjects have weekly
             pregnancy test during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Thereafter, subjects are
             required to have pregnancy testing every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual
             cycles and every 2 weeks in females with irregular cycles.

          -  Males (including those who have had a vasectomy) must use barrier contraception (latex
             condoms) when engaging in reproductive sexual activity with WCBP while on study drug
             and for 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment:

          -  History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or stroke in the past 5 years.

          -  Bilirubin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) or alkaline
             phosphatase levels more than two times the upper limit of the normal range at
             screening.

          -  Abnormal thyroid function test values at screening.

          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Use of concomitant medication(s), which could increase the risk for developing DVT,
             except for steroid-based contraceptives (oral injectable, implantable) and hormone
             replacement therapies only if used in conjunction with a low-dose (81 mg/day) aspirin
             regimen.

          -  Concurrent use of thalidomide.

          -  Prior development of an allergic reaction/hypersensitivity while taking thalidomide.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily Sleep Assessment Average Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Participants rated how much CRPS pain interfered with their sleep each day in a diary. The Sleep Assessment uses an eleven point scale for four questions. Questions concern ability to fall asleep, ability to stay asleep, how refreshed the participant feels upon waking and how alert the participant is during the day. All use a scale of 0-10, where the higher number is the positive response (e.g. 0=Pain completely interferes with sleep and 10=Pain does not interfere). The mean of all four responses was calculated if at least 3 of the 4 questions had a value. Week 12 values are compared to baseline values. Positive change values indicate improvement.</description>

BPI contains questions that concern the level of pain over the last week and the level of pain right now, the extent to which pain interfered with sleep, normal activities, ability to work, relationships, walking etc. Week 12 values are compared to baseline values. Negative change values indicate improvement.</description>

The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3.0 was used by the investigator to grade the severity of the AEs: Grade 1=Mild AE, Grade 2=Moderate AE, Grade 3=Severe AE, Grade 4=Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5=Death related to AE.
AEs are also summarized by whether they were serious, related to treatment and whether the AE caused treatment to be altered.
A serious AE (SAE) was any event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly/birth defect or was an important medical event could have jeopardized the patient's safety or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
