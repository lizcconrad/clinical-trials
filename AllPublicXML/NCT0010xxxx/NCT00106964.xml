  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B is a contagious virus that can damage a person's liver. It can be prevented by
      vaccination, but for many HIV-positive people, the vaccines do not help them achieve adequate
      protection against this virus. In an attempt to improve response to vaccination and achieve
      protection from hepatitis B, this trial will compare the immune system response to 3
      hepatitis B vaccine regimens in HIV-positive adolescents 12 through 24 years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suboptimal response to hepatitis B vaccination in HIV+ adults and children has been well
      documented in the literature. Given the importance of preventing hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      co-infection in HIV+ youth and the poor response rates in this population, this study will
      attempt to improve the immediate and long-term sero-response rates by undertaking a
      randomized, open-label trial of three hepatitis B vaccination schemas, as follows:

        1. standard adult dosing of HBV-only vaccine: Engerix-B 20 mcg at Entry, Week 4 and Week 24

        2. increased adult dosing of HBV-only vaccine: Engerix-B 40 mcg at Entry, Week 4 and Week
           24

        3. standard adult dosing of combined HBV/hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine: Twinrix 720
           enzyme immunoassay (EIA) HAV Ag plus 20 mcg HBsAg at Entry, Week 4 and Week 24.

      This study will also describe the safety of administration of an increased dose of the
      hepatitis B vaccine in this population. In general, patients undergoing dialysis who have
      received the dosing regimen recommended for immunocompromised individuals have tolerated the
      vaccine series well.

      Design: This is a stratified, block-randomized, open-label trial of three hepatitis B
      vaccination schemas in HIV-infected and HBV-uninfected youth. Once randomized, there will be
      a total of 6 study visits in a 72 week period. Vaccination will occur at Entry, Week 4 and
      Week 24. Primary sero-response will be evaluated at Week 28 and sustainability of response
      will be evaluated at Weeks 48 and 72 for those who achieve a primary antibody response of &gt;=
      10 IU/ml. Primary non-responders (antibody response of &lt; 10 IU/ml) will be provided with a
      booster vaccine using the increased-dose Engerix-B vaccine at Week 48 and evaluated for
      responsiveness at Week 72.

    <description>The primary outcome, percentage positive sero-response, was compared between Arm 1 and each of the two alternative strategy arms (Arm 2 and Arm 3) and measured 4 weeks after the third vaccination at Week 28. Response is defined as greater than or equal to 10 IU/mL of serum being present; non-response is defined as less than 10 IU/mL.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The number of adverse events and subjects with the events were described by study arm. The proportion of subjects with abnormal labs in Arms 1 and each of the two alternative strategy arms (Arm 2 and Arm 3) were compared to assess whether or not there is a difference in subjects with grade 3 or 4 toxicity. The laboratory events included are AEs classified as probably, possibly, or definitely related to study drug as classified by the Site Investigator.</description>

    <time_frame>Entry through Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>Within each arm, the duration of response in HIV-infected youth was analyzed for all subjects who were responders at 28 weeks. The possible values for response duration could be 20 weeks or less (responder at 28 weeks but not at 48 weeks), 20 to 44 weeks (responder at 28 and 48 weeks but not at 72 weeks), or greater than 44 weeks (responder at 28, 48, and 72 weeks). A response of greater than 20 weeks includes those who responded after 20 weeks, but whose exact response duration was unknown.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This is a multi-site study. Accrual was open between April 2006 and January 2008. Participants were enrolled in the United States, South Africa, Brazil, and the Bahamas.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects were randomized into one of three arms using blocks of six and stratified by absolute CD4 count (less than 500 and 500 cells/mL or greater) and previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination (0,1). The randomization was restricted so that the percentage of subjects with CD4 count &lt; = 200 cells/mL would not exceed 15% of subjects on any arm.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Response Rates in HIV+ Youth Within Each Study Arm by Study Duration</title>
        <description>Within each arm, the duration of response in HIV-infected youth was analyzed for all subjects who were responders at 28 weeks. The possible values for response duration could be 20 weeks or less (responder at 28 weeks but not at 48 weeks), 20 to 44 weeks (responder at 28 and 48 weeks but not at 72 weeks), or greater than 44 weeks (responder at 28, 48, and 72 weeks). A response of greater than 20 weeks includes those who responded after 20 weeks, but whose exact response duration was unknown.</description>
