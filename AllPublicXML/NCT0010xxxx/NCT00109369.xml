    <textblock>
      The Vermont Diabetes Information System (VDIS) is a registry-based decision support and
      reminder system based on the Chronic Care Model and targeted to primary care physicians and
      their patients with diabetes. It will be evaluated by a randomized, controlled study in 60
      Primary Care practices in Vermont and nearby New York.

    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of the Vermont Diabetes Information System is to reduce morbidity and
      mortality from diabetes mellitus. The project will implement and evaluate a state-wide system
      to support evidence-based disease management by primary care providers, their practices, and
      their patients in the community. The primary study question is: &quot;What is the effect of a
      Diabetes Information System (including education, feedback and decision support) upon disease
      control measured by glycated hemoglobin?&quot; Secondary questions address the effect of the
      system upon adherence to guideline recommendations, blood pressure control, patient
      satisfaction, medication use, and functional status. We hypothesize that the information
      system will result in improvements in the process and outcomes of clinical care. There are
      two specific aims:

      Aim 1: Implement the Diabetes Information System. Objective 1.1: Develop a registry of
      patients with diabetes in primary care practices in Vermont; Objective 1.2: Provide education
      and feedback to providers regarding their patients with diabetes; Objective 1.3: Deliver
      decision support (flow sheets, alerts and reminders) based on the registry and targeted at
      primary care providers and patients, to prompt ideal management of diabetes.

      Aim 2: Assess the Diabetes Information System. Objective 2.1: Assess disease control and
      guideline adherence by examining registry data in all subjects in a prospective, two-year,
      randomized, controlled trial in 60 primary care practices; Objective 2.2: Assess outcomes
      (blood pressure control, obesity, functional status, symptoms, medication use, and
      satisfaction) by interview and examination in a sub-sample of patients from the controlled
      trial.
