  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to identify a dose of Liposome Entrapped c-raf Antisense
      Oligonucleotide Easy-to-Use (LErafAON-ETU) which maximizes potential benefits of the compound
      to patients with advanced cancer, without compromising their safety. This study will also
      assess the processing of LErafAON-ETU by the body over time. Patients will receive an
      intravenous infusion of LErafAON-ETU each week. Multiple blood samples will be taken for
      pharmacokinetic analysis during the first treatment; two samples will be taken during both
      the second and third treatments. Patients will be eligible to continue treatment until the
      occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      In LErafAON-ETU, antisense oligonucleotides specific to c-raf, are associated with liposomes,
      which are microscopic membrane-like structures created from lipids (fats). Raf-1 is a protein
      which plays a critical role in many aspects of cellular activation and growth. Therefore, it
      is thought to be an important factor that may support tumor development. LErafAON-ETU
      potentially limits the ability of a cell to produce the Raf-1 protein.

      This Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study is designed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of LErafAON-ETU in patients who have advanced cancer considered unresponsive
      to available, conventional modalities or treatments. LErafAON-ETU will be administered as an
      IV infusion once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (a Treatment Cycle). A complete
      pharmacokinetic profile of raf-1 antisense oligonucleotide will be assessed in week 1 only;
      limited pharmacokinetic sampling will be done prior to and at the end of infusion in weeks 2
      and 3 only. Tumor/disease evaluation will be performed upon completion of 6 infusions (2
      Cycles). Dose escalation will not occur until the safety and tolerability at a given dose
      level has been confirmed for 1 Cycle.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included in this study, patients must meet the following criteria:

          -  Be ≥18 years of age.

          -  Have advanced (local and/or metastatic) histologically documented cancer not
             considered responsive to available conventional modalities or treatment (i.e., no life
             prolonging therapy or therapy with a greater potential for patient benefit is
             available).

          -  Have an ECOG Performance status of 0-1.

          -  Have a life expectancy of &gt;12 weeks.

          -  Have recovered from acute toxicities of prior treatment: *No treatment with
             radiotherapy or with cytotoxic or biologic agents within 3 weeks prior to study entry.
             At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since any prior surgery or granulocyte-stimulating
             growth factor therapy. Chronic treatment with non-investigational
             gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or other hormonal or supportive care is
             permitted. Concurrent bisphosphonate treatment is permitted if initiated ≥90 days
             prior to study entry. *Chronic Grade 1 toxicities due to prior treatment or other
             causes are permitted.

          -  Be in adequate condition as evidenced by the following clinical laboratory values:
