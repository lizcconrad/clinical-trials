      This research study is being done to evaluate the safety of BHT-3009 alone and when combined
      with atorvastatin (Lipitor) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Patients with MS are thought to have an immune response that attacks certain proteins in the
      brain, including myelin basic protein. (Myelin basic protein is a protein that makes up part
      of the outside layer of nerve cells.) BHT-3009 is an investigational immunotherapy product
      that is designed to alter the immune response to myelin basic protein and make the response
      less harmful. BHT-3009 contains the DNA (gene) for myelin basic protein.

      Three different doses of BHT-3009 will be tested to determine if there are any differences in
      safety or effects on immunity. This is the first clinical research study of BHT-3009.
      Laboratory studies have shown that BHT-3009 and atorvastatin given together alters the immune
      response to myelin basic protein and makes the response less harmful.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Definite diagnosis of multiple sclerosis by the McDonald criteria.

          -  Patients with relapsing remitting MS or secondary progressive MS are eligible.

          -  1-5 gadolinium enhancing (Gd+) lesions on the first Screening MRI or relapse in the
             previous 2 years, or disease worsening in the previous 2 years

          -  Clinically stable for &gt; 1 month before screening evaluation and during screening.
             Patients who are stable on approved therapy are eligible only if they have intolerable
             side effects or other medical reasons for discontinuing approved therapy.

          -  Off interferon for &gt; 1 month before screening evaluation.

          -  Off immunosuppressive and cytotoxic therapy (e.g. mitoxantrone, cladrabine) &gt;12 months
             or &gt; 6 months with CD4 count &gt; 400.

          -  EDSS â‰¥ 2.5 and &lt; 7.0.

          -  Female or male, age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Able to give informed consent.

          -  WBC and platelets in normal range, hemoglobin &gt; 10.0 g/dl.

          -  AST, ALT, bilirubin &lt; upper limit of normal.

          -  Creatinine &lt; upper limit of normal.

          -  CPK &lt; upper limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  High-dose corticosteroids (e.g. &gt;500 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent) within
             previous month.

          -  &gt;5 Gd+ lesions on the first Screening MRI.

          -  Previous vaccine therapy, stem cell transplantation or total lymphoid radiation.

          -  Glatiramer within previous 12 months.

          -  Treatment with any statin in the previous 6 months or elevated cholesterol that
             requires treatment with a statin.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Unwilling to use a medically acceptable form of birth control.

          -  History of positive test for HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

          -  Clinically significant ECG abnormalities.

          -  Medical condition or social circumstances that would in the opinion of the
             investigator prevent full participation in the trial or evaluation of study endpoints.

          -  Implanted pacemakers, defibrillators or other metallic objects on or inside the body
             that limit performing MRI scans.

          -  History of intolerable adverse events with statin therapy.
