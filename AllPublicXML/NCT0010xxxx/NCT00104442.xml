  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is a medical illness that damages the brain and causes problems with
      memory, mood and behavior. A substance called acetylcholine (ACh), which is naturally
      produced in the body, plays an important role in the normal functioning of the brain. In
      subjects with Alzheimer's disease, the level of ACh is greatly reduced. Currently, there are
      three commonly prescribed drugs used for treating the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by
      helping to maintain the level of ACh in the brain. This study will evaluate how much each of
      these drugs changes the levels of certain brain chemicals that are known to, or may play an
      important role in, Alzheimer's disease and its symptoms.
