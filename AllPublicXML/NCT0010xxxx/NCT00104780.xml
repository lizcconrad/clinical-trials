      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an effective immune response
      to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients
      with stage IIIB, stage IV, or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with HLA-A2-positive, stage IIIB or IV or
           recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with vaccine therapy comprising
           EP-2101 emulsified in montanide ISA-51 with that of historical controls and patients
           with HLA-A2-negative, stage IIIB or IV or recurrent NSCLC who undergo observation only.

        -  Determine the safety of this vaccine in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine progression-free survival of patients treated with this vaccine.

        -  Determine the frequency, magnitude, and breadth of cytotoxic and helper T-cell response
           to vaccine epitopes in patients treated with this vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      groups according to HLA-A2 status.

        -  Group I (HLA-A2 positive): Patients receive vaccine therapy comprising EP-2101
           emulsified in montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously once in weeks 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15.

        -  Group II (HLA-A2 negative): Patients undergo observation in weeks 9 and 18. After
           completion of study treatment, patients in group I are followed at 3 weeks. All patients
           are then followed at months 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8, every 3 months for 2 years, and then
           annually for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
