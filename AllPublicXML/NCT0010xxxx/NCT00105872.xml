      Insomnia reduces quality of life, increases risks for other illnesses, and enhances health
      care costs/utilization. Several efficacy studies have shown that Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT) for insomnia improves sleep and diurnal complaints among highly screened samples;
      however, its effectiveness among �real-world� primary care patients is yet to be tested. This
      project is highly relevant to the VA health care mission, given the high prevalence of
      insomnia in middle-aged and older adults. Pilot data from this VA suggest that 40% of primary
      care patients report trouble sleeping.

      Background:

      Insomnia reduces quality of life, increases risks for other illnesses, and enhances health
      care costs/utilization. Several efficacy studies have shown that Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT) for insomnia improves sleep and diurnal complaints among highly screened samples;
      however, its effectiveness among �real-world� primary care patients is yet to be tested. This
      project is highly relevant to the VA health care mission, given the high prevalence of
      insomnia in middle-aged and older adults. Pilot data from this VA suggest that 40% of primary
      care patients report trouble sleeping.

      Objectives:

      This project tests the incremental benefits of adding CBT to usual primary care for reducing
      sleep disturbance, diurnal dysfunction, quality of life concerns and health care utilization
      among veterans enrolled in the DVAMC Primary Care Clinics. Study hypotheses predict that
      patients who receive CBT along with usual care will show greater improvements in sleep, mood,
      and quality of life, as well as larger reductions in health care utilization than will those
      who receive usual care alone.

      Methods:

      This is a single-blind, randomized, parallel group, clinical effectiveness study of 106
      veteran insomnia sufferers. Eligibility criteria include: meeting structured interview
      criteria for insomnia, mean subjective total wake time of &gt; 60 minutes per night, mental
      status score &gt; 27 on Folstein MMSE, no unstable medical or psychiatric disorder, no
      polysomnographic evidence of sleep apnea or periodic limb movements, and approval of primary
      provider. Participants are randomly assigned to CBT + Usual Care or to Usual Care Control
      condition which provides therapist contact but no active behavioral treatment. Measures of
      sleep, mood, and quality of life are obtained before and after treatment and at a 6-month
      follow up. Computerized utilization data is obtained for the six months preceding and
      following treatment. A series of multivariate and univariate statistical tests will be
      conducted.

      Status:

      Major activities over the past year involved ongoing recruiting and enrolling participants.
      The study closed to enrollment on 7/19/05. Of 357 patients who completed screening
      procedures, 81 were eligible and enrolled in the project. Of these, five are in the
      pre-treatment phase, one is in the treatment phase, and 12 are in the post-treatment phase.
      Fifty-one patients have completed all study procedures. Eleven patients dropped out prior to
      completing the study, and one patient withdrew consent. A 1-year no cost extension was
      requested on 7/26/05 because of unavoidable delays in subject recruitment and enrollment, and
      we are awaiting a response.
