  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential dose escalation
      study conducted at a single clinical center. The study was designed to evaluate up to 6
      treatment cohorts of 9 participants with CKD not on dialysis in the first cohort and 5
      participants in each subsequent cohort. In each treatment cohort, participants were randomly
      assigned to receive either a single dose of peginesatide (n=7 in the first cohort, n=4 in
      subsequent cohorts) or placebo (n=2 in the first cohort, n=1 in subsequent cohorts).
      Participants were followed for a minimum of 28 days.
