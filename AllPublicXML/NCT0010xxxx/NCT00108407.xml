    <textblock>
      Depression is the most frequent co-occuring mental health disorder among adults with
      substance use disorders, and such comorbidity is often associated with poorer treatment
      outcomes. Although there is an urgent need for effective treatments specific for
      dual-diagnosis adults, few studies have been conducted to address this need.

      Comparison: This study will compare substance use and depression symptoms of individuals in
      two different psychotherapy groups: Integrated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Twelve Step
      Facilitation Therapy. Symptoms and substance use will be compared during the active treatment
      phase (24 weeks) and for one year following the end of the active treatment.
