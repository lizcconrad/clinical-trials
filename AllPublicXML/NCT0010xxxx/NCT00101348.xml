  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects, best way to give, and best dose of
      erlotinib and bevacizumab when given with cetuximab and how well giving erlotinib and
      cetuximab together with or without bevacizumab works in treating patients with metastatic or
      unresectable kidney, colorectal, head and neck, pancreatic, or non-small cell lung cancer.
      Erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab and bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor
      cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Cetuximab and bevacizumab
      may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving erlotinib
      together with cetuximab and/or bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of erlotinib when combined with cetuximab in
      patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell, colorectal, head and neck, pancreatic,
      or non-small cell lung cancer (part 1).

      II. Determine the MTD of bevacizumab when combined with cetuximab and erlotinib in these
      patients (part 2).

      III. Determine the toxic effects, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of these regimens in
      these patients.

      IV. Determine the antitumor activity of these regimens, in terms of tumor response,
      short-term survival, and progression-free survival, in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare, preliminarily, the toxicity and antitumor activity profiles of these regimens in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib and
      bevacizumab.

      Part 1: Patients receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-28. Patients also receive
      cetuximab IV over 3 hours on day 1 and over 1 hour on days 8, 15, and 22.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Part 2: Patients receive erlotinib as in part 1 at the MTD and cetuximab as in part 1.
      Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 1Â½ hours on day 1 and over 1 hour on day 15.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab until the MTD is determined.
      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      In both groups, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month.
