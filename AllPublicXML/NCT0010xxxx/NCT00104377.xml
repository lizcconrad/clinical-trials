  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Grass MATA (modified pollen allergen tyrosine adsorbate) has been developed to provide
      pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients with hypersensitivity to grass and rye
      pollen. Different doses of Grass MATA will be administered and immunological changes
      following this treatment will be assessed.

      Grass MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients
      with proven type I hypersensitivity to cross reacting grass pollens.

      The grass pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient, an
      allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities, is not seen.

      MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A), a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of
      Salmonella minnesota, is included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the
      immunogenic effect of the product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to
      a TH1-like T cell profile.

      The purpose of this study is to assess specific immunological changes (IgG, IgG1, IgG4 and
      IgE) in allergic subjects following 2 subcutaneous injections of different doses of study
      medication (Grass MATA or placebo) administered 3 weeks apart. The immunological changes will
      be used to assess the performance of the R7 IgG reactivity assay over a range of clinically
      efficacious doses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of childbearing potential may enter the study if they have a negative urine
             pregnancy test and they have been practicing adequate contraception for 3 months prior
             to the study and continue to do so during the study

          -  History of at least 1 season of moderate to severe seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis
             without bronchial asthma due to an IgE mediated allergy to pollen from grasses and rye

          -  Positive skin prick test to grass pollen and to rye pollen allergen extract

          -  Positive skin prick test to positive histamine control

          -  Negative skin prick test to negative control

          -  Specific IgE for grass and rye as documented by a RAST or equivalent test

          -  Moderate/severe allergy symptoms in the past spring season

          -  Spirometry at Screening demonstrates FEV1 &gt;= 80% predicted and FEV1/FVC &gt;= 70%.

          -  History or presence of acute or subacute atopic dermatitis, chronic dermatitis,
             urticaria factitia, or urticaria due to physical/chemical influence or any other skin
             conditions which might interfere with the interpretation of skin prick test results

          -  Visual inspection of the forearms indicates potential problems with the conduct or
             interpretation of the screening skin prick tests; both forearms must be available for
             testing
