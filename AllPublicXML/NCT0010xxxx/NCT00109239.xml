      This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled, open-label trial is designed to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of rhuMAb VEGF when combined with
      capecitabine compared with capecitabine alone in subjects with previously treated metastatic
      breast cancer.

          -  Known HER2-positive status (either 3+ by immunohistochemistry or positive by FISH), as
             evaluated at the institution, unless the subject has previously relapsed following
             Herceptin(R) therapy. Subjects may not continue Herceptin therapy while enrolled in
             this trial.

          -  Other primary malignancies (other than basal cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ
             cervical cancer) within the 5 years preceding Day 0

          -  Prior radiotherapy to a measurable metastatic lesion(s) if it is to be used as the
             only lesion to measure response, unless the target lesion within the radiation field
             is actively progressing and radiotherapy was completed &gt;=6 months prior to
             randomization

          -  Radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, or chemotherapy for metastatic
             breast cancer within 21 days prior to Day 0

          -  Use of bisphosphonates unless initiated at least 21 days before Day 0

          -  Previous treatment with capecitabine

          -  Previous treatment with rhuMAb VEGF

          -  History or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease (e.g., primary brain
             tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain metastases, or
             history of stroke; all subjects must have a baseline CT or MRI of the head.)

          -  Serious, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension,
             myocardial infarction, unstable angina), New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or
             greater congestive heart failure, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, or
             Grade II or greater peripheral vascular disease within 1 year prior to Day 0

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day 0, or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course
             of the study; fine needle aspirations other than in the breast within 7 days prior to
             Day 0; placement of a vascular access device within 7 days prior to Day 0

             adversely affect the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine

          -  History of allergy to iodine-containing contrast that required treatment and that

          -  Screening clinical laboratory values: *ANC of &lt;1500/uL; *Platelet count of &lt;75,000/uL;
             *INR of &gt;=1.5; *Total bilirubin of &gt;1.5 times upper limit of normal; *AST or ALT &gt;2.5
             times the upper limit of normal (&gt;5 times the upper limit of normal in subjects with
             known metastatic disease in the liver); *Serum creatinine of &gt;2.0 mg/dL; *Hemoglobin

             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the
