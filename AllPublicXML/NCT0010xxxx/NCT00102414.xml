  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the time to progressive disease in patients
      treated with gemcitabine plus carboplatin versus carboplatin monotherapy. Patients will have
      advanced epithelial ovarian cancer and have failed first-line platinum-containing therapy 6
      months after treatment discontinuation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carboplatin is commonly used for the treatment of ovarian cancer in first- and second-line
      therapy. The efficacy of gemcitabine in ovarian carcinoma was researched in various Phase 2
      studies.

          -  Histologically proven ovarian cancer with evidence of recurrence or progression

          -  Failed first-line platinum containing therapy after 6 months of treatment
             discontinuation

          -  Documented lesion as evidenced by appropriate computerized tomography (CT), magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan, chest x-ray, or ultrasound.

          -  Clinical evidence of central nervous system metastases

          -  Active infection

          -  Cannot adequately be followed up for the duration of the study

          -  A second primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately
             treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin)

          -  Use of any investigational agent in the 3 weeks prior to inclusion

          -  Serious concomitant systematic disorders incompatible with the study

          -  Received more than one previous chemotherapy regimen or had prior gemcitabine
             treatment

          -  Patients with tumor of borderline malignancy

          -  Patients with estimated GFR ≤ 50 mL/min
