  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide new information and to determine which kinds of
      brief, tolerable, experimental pain are affected by the drugs being studied in patients with
      irritable bowel syndrome, a disease that causes chronic abdominal pain. The effects of
      dextromethorphan, naloxone, and fentanyl on experimental pain stimuli will be tested in these
      studies to better understand what causes irritable bowel syndrome.
