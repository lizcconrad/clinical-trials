  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of an experimental tracking device
      for locating abnormalities during invasive procedures, such as biopsy or ablation, that
      cannot easily be visualized by usual imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT)
      scans or ultrasound. Some lesions, such as certain liver or kidney tumors, small endocrine
      abnormalities, and others, may be hard to find or only visible for a few seconds. The new
      method uses a needle with a miniature tracking device buried inside the metal that tells
      where the tip of the needle is located, somewhat like a mini GPS, or global positioning
      system. It uses a very weak magnet to localize the device like a miniature satellite system.
      This study will explore whether this system can be used in the future to more accurately
      place the needle in or near the desired location or abnormality.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who have a lesion that needs to be biopsied or an ablation
      procedure that requires CT guidance may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened
      with a medical history and review of medical records, including imaging studies.

      Participants undergo the biopsy or ablation procedure as they normally would, with the
      following exceptions: some stickers are placed on the skin before the procedure and a very
      weak magnet is placed nearby. The needles used are similar to the ones that would normally be
      used except that they contain a metal coil or spring buried deep within the needle metal. The
      procedure involves the following steps:

        1. Small 1-cm plastic donuts are place on the skin with tape.

        2. A planning CT scan is done.

        3. The CT scan is sent to the computer and matched to the patient's body location with the
           help of a very weak magnet.

        4. The needle used for the procedure is placed towards the target tissue or abnormality and
           the &quot;smart needle&quot; location lights up on the old CT scan.

        5. A repeat CT is done as it normally is to look for the location of the needle.

        6. After the procedure the CT scans are examined to determine how well the new tool located
           the needle in the old scan.

      Background:

      The effectiveness of targeting lesions or a specific area for surgery, angiography,
      CT-guided, or ultrasound-guided biopsy, or ablation, currently may be limited by the
      visibility of a target during the procedure. Accurate therapeutic intervention may depend
      upon accurate device placement, which may be very difficult in certain settings, such as when
      a liver tumor only is visible for a brief moment in time during the transient arterial phase
      of a contrast injection, soon disappearing on dynamic imaging. Surgery, angiography, image
      guided therapies and diagnostic procedures could be vastly improved by enabling the use of
      pre-procedural imaging during the procedure [such as location of difficult to visualize or
      transiently visible targets]. Tracking devices allow the use of pre-operative imaging during
      the procedure. Having this information available could vastly improve targeting accuracy of
      surgery, angiography, CT-guided, or ultrasound-guided biopsy or ablation.

      A method of improving targeting could potentially benefit patients in the future by reducing
      total radiation exposure during CT scan or fluoroscopic monitoring of a biopsy, or decreasing
      certain surgical risks, although these are not specific subjects of this study. Various
      methods of device tracking have been used in the past throughout the 20th century in
      neurosurgery with the use of stereotactic frames for a similar purpose, to register
      pre-operative imaging to the patient during invasive procedures to guide treatment.

      Objectives:

      To define the clinical utility of electromagnetic tracking during interventional procedures
      in specific patient populations.

      Eligibility:

        1. All patients must have a pre-operative CT, MR, or PET scan performed at NIH.

        2. Age greater than 18 years.

        3. Patients must be actively enrolled on an NIH protocol and be scheduled for surgery,
           angiography, or CT- or ultrasound-guided biopsy.

      Design:

      This is an exploratory interventional study examining the use of a guidance system for
      navigating and monitoring devices like biopsy and ablation needles, ultrasound transducers,
      needle guides, guidewires, scalpels, and cauterization devices (herein referred to as
      device(s) ) for localization in relation to pre-operative images.There are 9 cohorts included
      in this protocol. The Open/Laparoscopic surgery and Angiography surgery cohorts are no longer
      open for accrual.

        1. Prostate biopsy

        2. Percutaneous biopsy for diagnostic correlation

        3. percutaneous ablation for needle placement compilations

        4. Open/Laparoscopic surgery

        5. Angiography

        6. Auto registration for biopsy

        7. Auto registration for ablation

        8. PET registration

        9. prostate biopsy on which to determine the predictive value and relative strength of each
           MRI sequence in predicting cancer at a specific prostate core location.

      The total accrual ceiling for this protocol is 3195 subjects.

      All cohorts open for accrual are using exploratory interventions to define the specific
      patient population where fusion used during interventional procedures may have clinical
      value, and to characterize that clinical value in a specific patient population, such as but
      not limited to patients with specific regions of the prostate targeted, specific prostate
      volumes, prior negative prostate biopsies, or PSA values within a specific range.
