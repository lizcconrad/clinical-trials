      The purpose of this study is to determine whether prazosin will reduce the incidence of
      nightmares, sleep disturbance, and overall symptoms in combat trauma-exposed individuals with
      PTSD.

    <textblock>
      The combat stress-related nightmares and sleep disturbance that often follow exposure to
      military combat are distressing and frequently persistent symptoms that impair quality of
      life and both occupational and social (e.g., family) function. One of the most frequently
      reported and most troubling symptoms of PTSD is trauma-content nightmares. These nighttime
      symptoms have been notoriously resistant to treatment with psychotropic medications such as
      anxiolytics, the SSRIs, and sedating antihistamines such as cyproheptadine. The SSRIs
      sertraline (Zoloft®) and paroxetine (Paxil®) are the only drugs FDA approved for PTSD. This
      approval was based on modest overall PTSD improvement compared to placebo in large
      multicenter trials that enrolled almost exclusively noncombat trauma subjects.
      Placebo-controlled SSRI trials for PTSD in combat veterans have been negative or equivocal.

      Neurobiologic data suggest that combat stress-related nightmares and sleep disturbance in
      PTSD are related to enhanced central nervous system (CNS) adrenergic activity, particularly
      at night. Prazosin is a CNS-active, non-sedating alpha-1 antagonist that has long been
      generically available for the treatment of hypertension and benign prostatic hypertrophy. We
      recently demonstrated in Vietnam combat veterans with chronic PTSD that prazosin is robustly
      effective for previously treatment refractory combat trauma related nightmares, sleep
      disturbance and overall PTSD severity and functional impairment.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of prazosin compared to
      placebo for combat stress-related nightmares, sleep disturbance and overall function in
      combat-trauma exposed persons with PTSD.

      Primary outcome measures will be Clinical Global Impression of Change, Recurrent Distressing
      Dreams and Difficulty Falling and Staying Asleep items of the CAPS, total CAPS (exclusive of
      the dreams and sleep items), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Depression and quality
      of life also will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Combat-trauma exposed persons with a diagnosis of PTSD

          -  No diagnosis of lifetime schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder,
             psychotic disorder, or any DSM-IV cognitive disorder; current delirium, or substance
             dependence disorder within 3 months of the study or current substance use other than
             alcohol (no more than 2 drinks/day); severe psychiatric instability or situational
             life crises, including evidence of being actively suicidal or homicidal, or any
             behavior which poses an immediate danger to patient or others

          -  In good general medical health (no acute or significant chronic medical illness,
             including unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, history of congestive heart
             failure, preexisting hypotension [systolic &lt;110] or orthostatic hypotension [systolic
             drop &gt; 20 mmHg after two minutes standing or any drop with dizziness];
             insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; chronic renal or hepatic failure, pancreatitis,
             gout, Meniere's disease, benign positional vertigo, narcolepsy, allergy or previous
             adverse reaction to prazosin or other alpha-1 antagonist, or any unstable medical
             condition).

          -  Stable dose of nonexcluded medications for concurrent stable medical conditions for at
             least 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Specific criteria used to validate presence of combat stress-related nightmares and
             sleep disturbance will include: score &gt; 5 (of a maximum score of 8) on the CAPS
             Recurrent Distressing Dreams item. (CAPS score &gt;5 places subjects in the upper third
             of nightmare severity) or score &gt; 5 (of a maximum score of 8) on the CAPS Difficulty
             Falling or Staying Asleep item.
