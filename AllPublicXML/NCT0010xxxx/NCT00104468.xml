  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, single-arm, open-label, multi-center study of rising doses of Troxatyl™
      whose purpose is to determine the safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics, and to establish
      the recommended infusion schedule of Troxatyl™.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) refractory to prior therapy
             and/or unlikely to benefit from known therapies.

          -  Subjects must have adequate organ and immune function as indicated by the following
             laboratory values: *Creatinine clearance ≥5 L/hr (83mL/min), *Total Bilirubin ≤2.0
             mg/dL (≤34.2 µmol/L), *AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) ≤3 x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical evidence of active central nervous system (CNS) leukemic involvement

          -  Active and uncontrolled infection

          -  Uncontrolled medical problems unrelated to the malignancy that impair their ability to
             give informed consent or unacceptably reduce the safety of the proposed treatment

          -  Neurologic or psychiatric disorders that would interfere with informed consent or
             study follow-up

          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to the investigational new drug or
             closely related compounds like lamivudine, and/or a recent history of alcohol or other
             substance abuse.

          -  Also not eligible are subjects who have used another investigational agent or
             participated in a clinical trial within the last 14 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Females with a positive pregnancy test at screening or subjects that have previously
             been enrolled into this study and subsequently withdrew.
