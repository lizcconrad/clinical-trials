      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether eplerenone has a beneficial effect
      on improving exercise ability in patients with diastolic heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are: 1) To evaluate the effect of eplerenone, an aldosterone
      antagonist, on intermediate functional outcomes in patients with DHF (diastolic heart
      failure); 2) To evaluate the effect of eplerenone, an aldosterone antagonist, on
      echocardiographic measures of diastolic dysfunction in patients with DHF.

      The study is an double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of eplerenone
      compared to placebo in patients with DHF. A total of 48 patients with DHF will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to 1) Placebo (n=24) or to 2) Eplerenone (n=24) in a dose of 25 mg a day for
      the first 2 weeks followed by uptitration to 50 mg a day for 22 weeks. The primary outcome is
      an improvement in functional capacity, measured by the distance covered in a 6-minute walk
      test. Secondary Outcomes include : Change echocardiographic measures of diastolic
      dysfunction, change in levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)and change in quality of
      life.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients must have DHF as defined by all 3 of the following criteria:

             i)Presence of clinical heart failure for greater than or equal to 2 months before the
             screening visit. At the time of enrollment they should have NYHA functional class II
             or III heart failure symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue on exertion, paroxysmal
             nocturnal dyspnea, and orthopnea.

             ii)Left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50% (by echo,
             radionuclide angiography or contrast angiography) within 2 months of screening iii)
             BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) greater than or equal to 62 pg/ml within 2 months of
             screening

          2. Patients euvolemic on clinical examination. If patients are not euvolemic, all
             attempts will be made to achieve a euvolemic state with change in diuretic doses prior
             to enrollment into the study
