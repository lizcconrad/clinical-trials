      RATIONALE: Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using
      letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes.
      Zoledronate may prevent bone loss in patients who are receiving letrozole. It is not yet
      known which schedule of zoledronate is more effective in preventing bone loss in patients
      with breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different schedules of zoledronate
      to compare how well they work in preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women who are
      receiving letrozole for stage I, stage II, or stage IIIA breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the effectiveness of zoledronate vs standard care in reducing bone loss during
           the first 12 months of study treatment in postmenopausal women with stage I-IIIA breast
           cancer initiating letrozole after prior treatment with tamoxifen.

        -  Compare the effect of immediate vs delayed zoledronate, annually at 2-5 years
           post-baseline, in reducing bone loss in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to duration of prior tamoxifen therapy (≤ 2 years vs &gt; 2 years); time since
      tamoxifen therapy was discontinued (&lt; 1 vs ≥ 1 year); prior adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs
      no); and baseline total lumbar spine or femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) T-score (&gt; -1
      standard deviation [SD] vs between -1 to -2 SD). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I (immediate therapy): Patients receive oral letrozole once daily. Patients also
           receive zoledronate IV over 15 minutes once every 6 months.

        -  Arm II (delayed therapy): Patients receive oral letrozole as in arm I. Patients with
           radiologic evidence of bone loss after 1 year of letrozole therapy receive zoledronate
           as in arm I.

      In both arms, treatment continues for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 550 patients (275 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 28 months.
