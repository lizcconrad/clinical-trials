      The purpose of this study is to investigate and compare the use of herbal medicine among
      Dominicans in New York City and the Dominican Republic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the 2000 U.S. Census Report, Dominicans constitute the largest Hispanic
      immigrant group in New York City. Studies have shown that immigrants' use of traditional and
      herbal medicine is close to that of native-born Americans. However, minority immigrants often
      have limited access to traditional health care; as a result, they may be more likely to
      consult with traditional healers and use medicinal plants than nonimmigrants. This study is
      designed to increase knowledge about immigrants' health and to contribute to more
      culturally-sensitive health care. The purpose of this study is to determine medical plant
      knowledge and use among Dominican traditional healers and patients in New York City and in
      the Dominican Republic.

      This study will comprise two parts. In Part I, Dominican medicinal plant users and Dominican
      traditional healers in New York City will be questioned about the medicinal plant species
      they know and how they are used for prevalent illnesses. The same number of participants will
      be interviewed in the Dominican Republic, allowing for detailed comparisons between the two
      study sites.

      In Part II, the most frequently-cited medicinal plant species will be subjected to a thorough
      literature review on their pharmacologic activity and the chemical composition of their
      active constituents. Two in vitro assays will be used to measure the anti-inflammatory
      activity of certain plant extracts, and their anti-inflammatory compounds will be isolated
      and characterized for the purpose of standardization of active extracts. On the basis of
      these results, recommendations will be formulated for future studies and community use of
      selected medicinal plant species.
