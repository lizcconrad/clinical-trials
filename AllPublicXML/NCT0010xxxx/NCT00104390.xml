      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the residual allergenicity of Grass MATA (modified
      pollen allergen tyrosine adsorbate) by skin prick testing. This is done by a comparison of
      the wheal response after skin prick testing with aqueous native and modified allergen,
      modified tyrosine adsorbed allergen and Grass MATA MPL (modified tyrosine adsorbed + MPL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grass MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients
      with proven type I hypersensitivity to cross reacting grass pollens.

      MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid A), a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of
      Salmonella minnesota, is included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the
      immunogenic effect of the product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to
      a TH1-like T cell profile.

      The grass pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient, an
      allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities, is not seen.

      The modification is greater than 75 %, so that only a small amount of unmodified allergen is
      remaining in the product. The purpose of this study is to assess residual allergenicity of
      the modified grass/rye pollen in Grass MATA MPL using skin prick testing.

      In this skin prick test, the following test products will be compared:

        -  7 concentrations of aqueous native allergen

        -  aqueous modified allergen

        -  modified tyrosine adsorbed allergen

        -  Grass MATA MPL (modified tyrosine adsorbed + MPL)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive skin prick test to grass and rye pollen allergen extract

          -  Positive skin prick test to positive histamine control

          -  Negative skin prick test to negative control

          -  Specific IgE for grass and rye as documented by a RAST or equivalent test

          -  Females of childbearing potential may enter the study if they have a negative urine
             pregnancy test and they have been practicing adequate contraception for 3 months prior
             to the study and continue to do so during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of acute or subacute atopic dermatitis, chronic dermatitis,
             urticaria factitia, or urticaria due to physical/chemical influence or any other skin
             conditions which might interfere with the interpretation of skin prick test results

          -  Visual inspection of the forearms indicates potential problems with the conduct or
             interpretation of the skin prick tests; both forearms must be available for testing

          -  Subject has bronchial asthma or other lower respiratory tract condition (i.e.,
             emphysema, bronchiectasis)

          -  History or presence of diabetes, cancer or any clinically significant cardiac,
             metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, venereal, hematologic,
             neurologic or psychiatric diseases or disorders

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value at Visit 1

          -  Clinically relevant sensitivity to any common perennial allergen: house dust mites,
             molds, or epithelia (cat, dog, and horse). Sensitivity will be determined by a skin
             prick test at Visit 1, a RAST (or equivalent method) at Visit 1, or a documented
             history of symptoms to perennial allergens. Subjects may be enrolled in the study if
             they test positive, but have no current or historical symptoms to perennial allergens.
