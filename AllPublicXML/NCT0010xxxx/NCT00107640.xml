  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults become more sensitive to alcohol, and alcohol also interacts adversely with
      their common medical conditions and medications. The aim of Project SHARE (Senior Health and
      Alcohol Risk Education) is to see whether patient and provider education can decrease risky
      alcohol use and reduce health care costs in persons 60 years of age and older.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use in the elderly is an increasingly important public health problem.
      Alcohol-related risks and problems in older persons may come from the interaction between
      alcohol and diminished health or medication use. The proposed study is a randomized trial of
      the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an integrated patient-provider intervention to
      prevent risky alcohol use among older adults. The intervention will include a tested
      screening and education system that was developed especially for older adults and their
      providers, supplemented by a well-established intervention for physicians. The proposed
      research design involves randomization of 31 primary care physicians in seven clinics and
      their eligible patients aged 60+ to the intervention versus &quot;usual care.&quot;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>At-risk drinking at 6 month followup</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>At-risk drinking is alcohol use that (either alone or in conjunction with selected comorbidities, symptoms and/or medications) poses health risks. It is measured using the CARET instrument developed by Moore and colleagues.</description>

    <measure>Mental Composite Score at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We used self-reported SF12 data from baseline, 6- and 12-month written surveys to construct Mental Composite Score (MCS) and Physical Composite Score (PCS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthcare utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (cumulative)</time_frame>
    <description>We used self-reported data from 3-month, 6-month and 12-month written patient surveys to measure cumulative healthcare utilization by type (e.g., hospitalizations, emergency department visits, physician visits, etc.) over the twelve months following baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Outpatient service costs</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (cumulative)</time_frame>
    <description>We used administrative data on clinic-based services linked to Medicare fee schedules to construct cumulative measures of outpatient service costs (from the Medicare perspective) for the twelve months following baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Direct recruitment and intervention costs</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (cumulative)</time_frame>
    <description>We collected data on the resources used directly for recruitment (e.g., clinic-based staff time, phones, postage, etc.) and the intervention (e.g., cost of health educator time, supplies, opportunity costs of the physician's time, etc.) spent on the intervention, to construct overall measures of the per-patient cost of recruitment and intervention.</description>
