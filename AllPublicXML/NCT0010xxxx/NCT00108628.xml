    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two cognitive behavioral group
      psychotherapy interventions in controlling the subjective sleep disturbance in veterans with
      Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive, stereotypical nightmares and insomnia commonly characterize post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). Identifying the pathophysiological mechanisms of disrupted sleep in PTSD has
      therefore assumed considerable clinical importance. We previously reported an increase in
      rapid eye movement activity (REM activity) during REM sleep (REMS) in Vietnam War combat
      veterans with PTSD, and this finding can be seen as consistent with the view that most,
      although not all, dreaming occurs during REMS and the repeated observation that REM activity
      correlates with the intensity of dream mentation. There is a growing body of evidence that
      post-traumatic nightmares can respond to psychological treatment interventions. Namely, a
      cognitive-behavioral technique entitled imagery rehearsal (IR) has been reported to be
      effective in the treatment of such nightmares in victims of crime and in women who have been
      sexually assaulted. In a small pilot study, it has also been reported to be effective in the
      treatment of Vietnam veterans with combat-related PTSD. The two objectives of this proposal
      are: 1. To compare, in a study with random assignment and a parallel group design, the
      effectiveness in controlling the subjective sleep disturbance in veterans with PTSD of IR and
      Sleep and Nightmare Management (SN), a psychological treatment that targets life stressors
      and problems with sleep hygiene that may exacerbate insomnia and nightmares. 2. In a subset
      of these subjects, to compare the effectiveness in reducing REM activity of IR and SN.

Imagery Rehearsal: IR is a manual-based CBT predicated on the idea that waking mental activity influences nighttime dreams. Veterans examine the content of a recurrent nightmare, use imagery to alter disturbing aspects of the nightmare to promote mastery and control, and rehearse the new dream nightly, before bedtime.</description>

Sleep and Nightmare Management: This comparison condition involved psychoeducation about PTSD, sleep and nightmares, progressive muscle relaxation and standard CBT for insomnia. This latter part included education about sleep hygiene (e.g., avoidance of caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime, benefit of regular bed time routines), stimulus control and sleep restriction (i.e., reestablishing a conditioned association between the bed/bedroom and sleep by reducing time spent tossing and turning in bed).

        <description>This self-report questionnaire assesses psychosocial impairment attributed to nightmares. Eleven self-report questions are rated on a scale of zero to four. The individual scores are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 44 (reported in the Table). Higher scores reflect greater impairment.</description>

        <title>SF-36 Mental Component</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) determines participants' overall quality of life by assessing 1) limitations in physical functioning due to health problems; 2) limitations in usual role because of physical health problems; 3) bodily pain; 4) general health perceptions; 5) vitality; 6) limitations in social functioning because of physical or emotional problems; 7) limitations in usual role due to emotional problems; and 8) general mental health. Scales 5-8 primarily contribute to the mental component summary score (PCS) of the SF-36. Scores on each scale are summed and averaged (range = 0 &quot;worst&quot;-100 &quot;best&quot;).</description>

Imagery Rehearsal: IR is a manual-based CBT predicated on the idea that waking mental activity influences nighttime dreams. Veterans examine the content of a recurrent nightmare, use imagery to alter disturbing aspects of the nightmare to promote mastery and control, and rehearse the new dream nightly, before bedtime.</description>

Sleep and Nightmare Management: This comparison condition involved psychoeducation about PTSD, sleep and nightmares, progressive muscle relaxation and standard CBT for insomnia. This latter part included education about sleep hygiene (e.g., avoidance of caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime, benefit of regular bed time routines), stimulus control and sleep restriction (i.e., reestablishing a conditioned association between the bed/bedroom and sleep by reducing time spent tossing and turning in bed). Therapists worked with patients to identify problem areas in their sleep habits and to problem-solve about possible treatment targets</description>
