  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exenatide LAR is a long-acting release formulation of exenatide, which is a twice-daily
      dosage form currently under investigation as a potential treatment for people with type 2
      diabetes mellitus. This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      Exenatide LAR administered weekly by subcutaneous injection in people with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.
