      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells and white blood cells may make the body
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) may stimulate
      the white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive
      immunotherapy, stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving vaccine
      therapy with IL-2 may be a more effective treatment for Ewing's sarcoma or neuroblastoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy when given with
      IL-2 in treating young patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing's sarcoma or neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of vaccination comprising autologous tumor cells fused with
           Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cells followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2)
           in children with relapsed or refractory Ewing's sarcoma or neuroblastoma.

        -  Determine antitumor immunity by examining cell phenotype and function in patients
           treated with this vaccine and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL).

        -  Determine the safety of CTL and IL-2 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Tumor cells and blood cells are collected from patients and expanded in vitro. Tumor cells
      and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cells (derived from blood cells) are
      fused together to produce the vaccine.

        -  Vaccination: Patients receive vaccine comprising autologous tumor cells fused with
           Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cells subcutaneously (SC) once on days
           0, 14, and 28 and interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC twice daily on days 1-7, 15-21, and 29-35.

        -  Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL): After vaccination, patients with evidence of antitumor
           immunity undergo leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for CTL expansion. Some of
           these patients then receive CTL IV once on days 0, 14, and 28 and IL-2 SC twice daily on
           days 1-7, 15-21, and 29-35.

      Patients are followed weekly for 2 weeks, every 2 weeks for 1 month, monthly for 3 months,
      and then every 2 months for up to 1 year post-vaccination. Patients who receive CTL are also
      followed annually for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
