  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether interleukin-2 given 3 times weekly for 8
      weeks in combination with rituximab is effective and safe when compared to rituximab given
      alone in the treatment of follicular NHL subjects that have never received rituximab as a
      treatment and are refractory or relapsed after previous chemotherapy.
