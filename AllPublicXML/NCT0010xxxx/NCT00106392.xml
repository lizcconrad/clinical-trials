    <measure>Erectile Function Domain Score Between Treated and Untreated Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, which consists of 15 questions. The erectile function domain score is calculated as a sum of scores from questions 1-5 and 15. A clinically meaningful difference is 5 points. The scores range from 1 to 30 points where a higher score indicates better erectile function. Normal erectile function is defined as greater than or equal to 24 points.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Achieving Normal Spontaneous Erectile Function as Measured by the Erectile Function (EF) Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, which consists of 15 questions. The erectile function domain score is calculated as a sum of scores from questions 1-5 and 15. A clinically meaningful difference is 5 points. The scores range from 1 to 30 points where a higher score indicates better erectile function. Normal erectile function is defined as greater than or equal to 24 points.
Percentages represent the proportions of participants who achieved normal erectile function at any time during the 24 months.</description>

    <description>Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, which consists of 15 questions. The EF domain score is calculated as a sum of scores from questions 1-5 and 15. A clinically meaningful difference is 5 points. Scores range from 1-30 points where a higher score indicates better erectile function. Normal erectile function is defined as greater than or equal to 24 points.Time to achieve normalization of the EF domain score was calculated based on the date of the assessment during which the EF domain score was first greater than or equal to 24.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Considered Successful Responders to Impotence Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were identified as successful responders if they answered affirmatively in the Patient Sexual Encounter Diary regarding successful sexual intercourse after using impotence medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Achieve Response to Impotence Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to achieve response to impotence medication was calculated based on the date of the assessment during which the first successful response was recorded. The specific date of the actual response is not reflected; only that it occurred since the previous study visit.</description>

    <measure>Continence Level as Quantified by Part I of the Prostate Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Part 1 Urinary Function- Prostate Health-Related Quality-of-Life (QOL) Questionnaire consists of 16 questions asking patients about their continence and urinary habits over the previous four weeks. The responses to all 16 of these questions were added together to calculate an overall score for urinary function. The minimum possible score is 16 and the maximum possible score is 79. A higher score indicates a lower continence level.</description>

        <title>Erectile Function Domain Score Between Treated and Untreated Groups</title>
        <description>Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire, which consists of 15 questions. The erectile function domain score is calculated as a sum of scores from questions 1-5 and 15. A clinically meaningful difference is 5 points. The scores range from 1 to 30 points where a higher score indicates better erectile function. Normal erectile function is defined as greater than or equal to 24 points.</description>

          <title>Continence Level as Quantified by Part I of the Prostate Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire</title>
          <description>Part 1 Urinary Function- Prostate Health-Related Quality-of-Life (QOL) Questionnaire consists of 16 questions asking patients about their continence and urinary habits over the previous four weeks. The responses to all 16 of these questions were added together to calculate an overall score for urinary function. The minimum possible score is 16 and the maximum possible score is 79. A higher score indicates a lower continence level.</description>
          <population>The number of participants analyzed represents Full Analysis Set (FAS), which is defined as participants evaluated for Efficacy and Safety.
Only participants with a Prostate Health-Related QOL questionnaire at 24 months were included in the calculation.</population>
