      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of one treatment of S-Caine™ Peel (skin
      numbing cream) applied on healthy skin before a painful dermatologic procedure in adults.
      This study will also evaluate how well the S-Caine™ Peel eases the pain of the procedure.

      The practice of dermatology is seeing a rise in the number of surgical and laser procedures
      as technological advances have expanded the number of conditions amenable to these evolving
      therapies. Skin biopsies, shave excisions, deep excisions, electro-surgical procedures,
      intralesional injections, and laser surgery are frequently performed by dermatologists on a
      daily basis. Some pain accompanies almost all of these procedures, and a local anesthetic is
      commonly used. Traditionally, intracutaneous injection of lidocaine (with or without
      epinephrine) has been the anesthetic of choice. However, patients undergoing these procedures
      are often afraid of needles and syringes and the pain associated with injections. As a
      result, topical anesthetic agents have been explored and developed as painless alternatives
      to injected anesthesia.

      S-Caine™ Peel (lidocaine 7% and tetracaine 7% cream) consists of a new eutectic formulation
      of lidocaine and tetracaine. S-Caine Peel is a topical local anesthetic cream that forms a
      pliable peel on the skin when exposed to air. S-Caine Peel is not occluded during
      application.

      The purpose of this study is to gain additional safety information for S-Caine Peel when used
      in minor and major dermal procedures in adults.
