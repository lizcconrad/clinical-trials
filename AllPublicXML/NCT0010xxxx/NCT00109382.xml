      Current management of patients with TIA (transient ischemic attack) or minor stroke includes
      the prompt investigation and treatment in the days and weeks after the event. However, new
      evidence shows patients are at the highest risk of stroke in the first few days after the
      TIA, with 50% of strokes which happen in the three months following TIA occurring within
      48-72 hours. To date, there is no evidence to guide physicians on how to safely reduce this
      risk.

      The FASTER trial is focusing on the initial period of high risk, starting patients on stroke
      prevention treatments in the hours following a TIA or minor stroke. The drugs to be tested
      have been shown to be effective in the similar setting of cardiology, reducing recurrent
      cardiac events in patients with unstable angina when commenced with the same speed after an
      event.

      All patients will be on aspirin. The trial will see if adding another drug, clopidogrel, has
      an additional benefit in reducing the number of strokes after TIA or minor stroke within
      three months of TIA or minor stroke. It will also look if the very early introduction of
      simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering therapy, reduces stroke after TIA or minor stroke, both
      by itself and in addition to clopidogrel. The final aim of the trial is to ensure that these
      treatments are safe to be used in this population of patients.

      The Fast Assessment of Stroke and Transient ischemic attack to prevent Early Recurrence
      (FASTER) is a randomized clinical trial designed to investigate the effect of hyper-acute
      initiation of stroke prevention treatments in patients with a minor stroke or transient
      ischemic attack (TIA).

      This group of individuals has been recognized as being at high risk of recurrent events.
      Johnston et al. (2000) were the first to suggest that the risk of stroke after TIA was
      front-loaded in the first few days. This has been confirmed elsewhere with Lovett et al.
      (2003) having shown in the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project that the 7-day risk of
      recurrent stroke was 8.6%, and a 30-day risk of 12.0%. These findings are similarly found in
      the Oxford Vascular Study; 8.0% and 11.5% respectively for a recurrent event (Coull et al.,
      2004). The NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) study also
      supports the finding of high risk of early recurrent stroke. 8.5% of patients with a
      hemispheric TIA suffered a recurrent stroke within one week rising to 20% at 90-days
      (Eliasziw et al., 2004). This data suggest that patients with carotid stenosis are at the
      highest risk of early recurrent stoke.

      Only one in four patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within three hours of symptom
      onset are being treated with t-PA (Barber et al., 2001). The most common reason for exclusion
      from treatment is that a patient's deficit will be too mild for treatment or will have
      completely resolved thereby not meriting the risks of treatment with tPA. These are the
      patients that have a higher risk of early recurrence. The clinical imperative is to identify
      hyper-acute treatment strategies to minimize that risk.

      FASTER is a double blind, randomized controlled trial with a 2x2 factorial design with
      patients followed for 90-days. Patients will be randomized within 24 hours of symptom onset
      to one of four possible treatment arms:

        -  Aspirin

        -  Aspirin and Clopidogrel

        -  Aspirin and Simvastatin

        -  Aspirin and Clopidogrel and Simvastatin

      Study Hypotheses

      A. A rapid commencement of clopidogrel plus aspirin within 24 hours of acute TIA or minor
      stroke is more effective than aspirin in reducing the 90-day risk of stroke by an absolute
      difference of 2%.

      B. A rapid commencement of simvastatin plus aspirin within 24 hours of acute TIA or minor
      stroke is more effective than aspirin in reducing the 90-day risk of stroke by an absolute
      difference of 2%.

      C. A rapid commencement of clopidogrel plus aspirin plus simvastatin within 24 hours of acute
      TIA or minor stroke is more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the 90-day risk of
      stroke by an absolute difference of 4%.

      D. The incidence of adverse events is not different among treatment groups.
