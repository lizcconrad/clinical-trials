  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with malignant
      mesothelioma. Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate (partial response (PR) and complete response (CR)) in
      patients with malignant mesothelioma treated with BAY 43-9006.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine 3-month failure free survival in patients with malignant mesothelioma treated
      with BAY 43-9006.

      II. To describe the median and overall survival of malignant mesothelioma patients treated
      with BAY 43-9006.

      III. To describe the toxicity profile of BAY 43-9006 in patients with malignant mesothelioma.

      IV. To determine whether mesotheliomas contain mutations in exons 11 and 15 of the B-raf gene
      and correlate these findings with anti-tumor activity of BAY 43-9006.

      V. To determine whether the amount of expression of phospho-ERK1/2, as determined by
      immunohistochemistry from pre-treatment tumor specimens, correlates with anti-tumor activity
      of BAY 43-9006 in patients with mesothelioma.

      VI. To determine whether baseline levels and changes following BAY 43-9006 treatment in
      angiogenic cytokines (VEGF and PDGF) correlate with anti-tumor activity of BAY 43-9006.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 2 months for 1
      year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented malignant mesothelioma, epithelial, sarcomatoid or mixed
             type, not amenable to curative surgery; any site of origin of malignant mesothelioma,
             including but not limited to: pleura, peritoneum, pericardium and tunica vaginalis is
             allowed

          -  Pathology blocks or slides from a core surgical biopsy must be available for
             evaluation of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation by immunohistochemistry and for sequencing of
             B-raf exons 11 and 15

          -  Chemotherapy naive or no more than one pemetrexed containing chemotherapy regimen;
             chemotherapy may have been pemetrexed alone or in combination with any other agent

          -  No prior tyrosine kinase/signal transduction/angiogenesis inhibitor therapy

          -  Prior intracavitary cytotoxic or sclerosing therapy (including bleomycin) are
             acceptable; prior intrapleural cytotoxic chemotherapy will not be considered systemic
             chemotherapy

          -  &gt;= 3 weeks since major surgery

          -  &gt;= 4 weeks since completion of prior radiation therapy, as long as measurable disease
             lies outside of the radiation port

          -  &gt;= 4 weeks since the completion of prior pemetrexed-containing chemotherapy

          -  No treatment with an investigational agent currently or within the last 28 days

          -  No patients with known brain metastases; patients with known brain metastases should
             be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they
             often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events

          -  Patients with pleural rind only disease must have at least one level with one rind
             measurement &gt;= 1.5 cm

          -  Measurable disease is defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least
             one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional
             techniques (CT, MRI, x-ray) or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral CT scan

          -  ECOG Performance status of 0-1

          -  No prior history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to BAY 43-9006

          -  Non-pregnant and non-nursing because the effects of BAY 43-9006 on the fetus/infant
             are unknown; in addition, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             an appropriate method of birth control throughout their participation in this study;
             appropriate methods of birth control include abstinence, oral contraceptives,
             implantable hormonal contraceptives (Norplant), or double barrier methods (diaphragm
             plus condom)

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy other than non melanoma skin
             cancers and carcinoma in situ of the cervix are not eligible; patients are not
             considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy if they have completed
             therapy and are considered to have a less than 30% chance of risk of relapse

          -  No patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to:
             ongoing active infections, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  No patients on therapeutic anticoagulation; prophylactic anticoagulation (i.e., low
             dose warfarin) of venous or arterial access devices is allowed provided that the
             requirements for INR are met

          -  No evidence of bleeding diathesis

          -  No HIV positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy; patients with
             immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving combination
             anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with BAY 43-9006

          -  Granulocytes &gt;= 1,500/ul

          -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000/μl
