  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Tipifarnib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and daunorubicin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving tipifarnib together with cytarabine and daunorubicin may
      kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when
      given with cytarabine and daunorubicin in treating older patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tipifarnib when administered with cytarabine and
           daunorubicin in older patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib.

      Induction therapy (1 course): Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-7,
      daunorubicin IV on days 6-8, and oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 6-15 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete remission proceed to consolidation
      therapy.

      Consolidation therapy (1 course): After hematologic recovery, patients begin consolidation
      therapy 35-60 days after the start of induction therapy. Patients receive cytarabine,
      daunorubicin, and tipifarnib as in induction therapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 10 patients are treated at the
      recommended phase II dose.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-28 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-22
      months.
