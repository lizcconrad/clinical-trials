      Bipolar disorder affects 2.4 million adults in the USA between the ages of 18-65 and has
      considerable economic impact on our society. Bipolar mania accounts for 1 in 7 psychiatric
      emergencies and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the
      study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of open-label memantine in the acute management
      of adults with bipolar I disorder hospitalized for mania.
