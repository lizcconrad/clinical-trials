      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and capecitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one chemotherapy drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cyclophosphamide together with
      capecitabine works in treating women with stage IV breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate (complete and partial, confirmed and unconfirmed) in women
           with stage IV breast cancer treated with oral cyclophosphamide and oral capecitabine.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide once daily on days 1-14 and oral capecitabine twice
      daily on days 8-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at weeks 7, 13, 19, and 25.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 96 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.

    <description>Complete Response (CR) is complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease. No new lesions, no disease related symptoms. Normalization of markers and other abnormal lab values. Partial Response (PR) is greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of longest diameters of all target measurable lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease. No new lesions. Confirmation of CR or PR means a repeat scan at least 4 weeks apart documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration. Progression is 20% increase in sum of longest diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed and/or unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease and/or appearance of new lesion/site or death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration is global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression.</description>

    <description>Progression-Free Survival: From date of registration to time of first documentation of progression or symptomatic deterioration, or death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive and progression-free are censored at last date of contact.
Overall Survival: From date of registration to date of death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive are censored at last date of contact.
Progression is 20% increase in sum of longest diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed and/or unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease and/or appearance of new lesion/site or death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration is global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression.</description>

        <description>Complete Response (CR) is complete disappearance of all measurable and non-measurable disease. No new lesions, no disease related symptoms. Normalization of markers and other abnormal lab values. Partial Response (PR) is greater than or equal to 30% decrease under baseline of the sum of longest diameters of all target measurable lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease. No new lesions. Confirmation of CR or PR means a repeat scan at least 4 weeks apart documented before progression or symptomatic deterioration. Progression is 20% increase in sum of longest diameters of target measurable lesions over smallest sum observed and/or unequivocal progression of non-measurable disease and/or appearance of new lesion/site or death due to disease without prior documentation of progression and without symptomatic deterioration. Symptomatic deterioration is global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of progression.</description>
