      The purpose of the study is to determine the dose of the combination of trabectedin
      (Yondelis) and Doxorubicin for which neutropenia (low white blood cell counts) could be
      managed with filgrastim (a Granulocyte-Colony Stimulation Factor that is used to help control
      neutropenia) in patients with a type of cancer called soft tissue sarcoma.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label (identity of the assigned study treatments will be known to
      patients and study staff) study to determine the dose of the combination of trabectedin
      (Yondelis) and Doxorubicin for which the neutropenia (low white blood cell counts) is
      manageable with the use of filgrastim (an agent used to manage neutropenia) and associated
      with clinically acceptable number of side effects severe enough to continuation of treatment
      in patients with recurrent or persistent soft tissue sarcoma (STS, a malignant tumor that
      attacks the body's infrastructure of fat, muscles, nerves, joints, blood vessels, or deep
      skin tissues). Patients will be enrolled in the study after all study-specific entry criteria
      are met and informed consent is obtained. Patients will be required to attend regular clinic
      visits to receive study medication and have their status monitored. A detailed explanation
      can be provided by the study physician (Investigator) conducting this study. Doxorubicin (50
      to 75 mg/m2) will be given as a 10-15 minute intravenous (i.v.) infusion on Day 1 via a
      central venous catheter which is a tube placed into a large vein. Trabectedin (0.9 to 1.3
      mg/m2) will be given as a 3 hour i.v. infusion, immediately following the administration of
      doxorubicin. Dexamethasone 20 mg will be given within 1 hour before the start of each
      doxorubicin i.v. infusion and filgrastim will be administered according to manufacturer's
      instructions.
