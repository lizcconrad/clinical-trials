      The project's aim is to provide a targeted, computer-administered intervention to facilitate
      tobacco cessation for clients in alcohol treatment. The main focus of &quot;On the Air: A tobacco
      cessation program for adults in alcohol recovery&quot; is to reduce tobacco use of clients in
      alcohol treatment. The program will be offered through inpatient, residential, and outpatient
      treatment programs to help those struggling with alcohol addiction to understand, reduce, and
      stop tobacco use. Clients will develop a personalized tobacco cessation plan relevant to
      their readiness to quit tobacco use. Based on the metaphor of a television network, this
      tobacco cessation program contains information on personal risks, peer stories, cravings and
      withdrawal, a variety of interactive activities and tools, and also motivational feedback and
      tips to assist in the quitting process. Phase I was a proof of concept phase, in which we
      delivered a prototype CD-ROM on tobacco cessation. Phase II will involve completing the
      development of a functional CD-ROM tool which will be subjected to a clinical field trial
      with a group of adults (n=196) in treatment facilities for alcohol recovery. The clinical
      field study will involve finalizing the content, interface, and interactive features of the
      CD-ROM. We will also gather satisfaction data from both clients and counselors in the various
      treatment facilities.
