  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a form of electrical acupuncture, called
      percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (PENS), can reduce pain and disability in older
      adults with chronic low back pain (LBP). This study will also determine the effects of
      general conditioning and aerobic exercise (GCAE) on chronic LBP.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, a significant number of elderly individuals experience at least one episode of
      LBP. When LBP becomes chronic, it can lead to functional and emotional impairment, increased
      health care utilization, and decreased quality of life. Standard treatment for LBP typically
      consists of non-opioid analgesics and physical therapy; however, analgesic-associated
      morbidity in older adults often limits their utility. This study will determine the efficacy
      of PENS treatment, a neuroanatomically guided form of electroacupuncture, and exercise in
      reducing pain in older adults with chronic LBP.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: PENS alone, PENS
      placebo, PENS plus GCAE, or PENS placebo plus GCAE. The treatments will be given twice weekly
      for 6 weeks. Pain intensity, physical function, health care utilization, and psychosocial
      function will be assessed with self-report and performance-based measures. These assessments
      will be conducted at study start, immediately after the last treatment session, and 6 months
      after study completion.
