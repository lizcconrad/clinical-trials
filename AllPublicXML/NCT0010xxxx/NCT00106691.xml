      The purpose of this study is to determine if toremifene citrate is effective and safe in the
      prevention of prostate cancer in men who have been diagnosed with high grade prostatic
      intraepithelial neoplasia. Men who have ever been diagnosed with high grade PIN will be
      enrolled into an 36 month trial and will be assigned to either 20 mg of study drug or placebo
      per day. Subjects will undergo safety evaluations at Month 3, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18,
      Month 24, Month 30 and Month 36 along with prostate biopsies at Month 12 and Month 24 and
      Month 36 to determine efficacy.

          -  Be male, aged ≥ 30 years

          -  Have a diagnosis of high grade PIN from any previous prostate biopsy. The diagnosis of
             high grade PIN must be confirmed by the central pathologist

          -  Have had a prostate biopsy in the last 6 months with a minimum of 10 cores that shows
             no evidence of cancer as confirmed by the central pathologist; OR, have had 2 prostate
             biopsies (each with a minimum of 6 cores) in the 12 months prior to screening with at
             least one of the biopsies occurring within 6 months prior to the screening visit. Both
             biopsies should have no evidence of cancer as confirmed by the central pathologist

          -  Have a serum PSA of ≤ 10 ng/mL

          -  Agree to provide tablet containers for tablet counts
