      This 2-phase study will determine the safety of treating patients with prostate cancer with
      the genetically engineered HyperAcute-Prostate cancer vaccine. It will establish the proper
      vaccine dose and will examine side effects and potential benefits of the treatment. The
      vaccine contains killed prostate cancer cells containing a mouse gene that causes the
      production of a foreign pattern of protein-sugars on the cell surface. It is hoped that the
      immune response to the foreign substance will stimulate the immune system to attack the
      patient's own cancer cells that have similar proteins without this sugar pattern, causing the
      tumor to remain stable or shrink.

      Patients 19 years of age or older with hormone refractory prostate cancer that has recurred
      or no longer responds to standard treatment may be eligible for this study. Candidates will
      be screened with medical history and physical examination, blood tests, urinalysis, chest
      x-rays and CT scans. MRI, PET, and ultrasound scans may be obtained if needed.

      Participants will receive twelve vaccinations two weeks apart from each other. The vaccines
      will be injected under the skin, similar to the way a tuberculosis skin test is given. Phase
      I of the study will treat successive groups of patients with increasing numbers of the
      vaccine cells to evaluate side effects of the treatment and determine the optimum dose. Phase
      II will look for any beneficial effects of the vaccine given at the highest dose found to be
      safe in Phase I. Monthly blood samples will be drawn during the 6 months of vaccine
      treatment. In addition, patient follow-up visits will be scheduled every 2 months for the
      remaining first year (6 months) after vaccination and then every 3 months for the next 2
      years for the following tests and procedures to evaluate treatment response and side effects:

        -  Medical history and physical examination

        -  Blood tests

        -  X-rays and various scans (nuclear medicine/CT/MRI)

        -  FACT-P Assessment questionnaire to measure the impact of treatment on the patient's
           general well-being. The questionnaire is administered before beginning treatment,
           monthly during treatment, and during follow-up visits after completing the treatment. It
           includes questions on the severity of prostate cancer symptoms and the ability to
           perform normal activities of daily life.

    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer found in American men, other than skin
      cancer. The American Cancer Society estimated that there were about 230,900 new cases of
      prostate cancer in the United States in the year 2004. About 29,900 men will die of this
      disease. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, exceeded only by
      lung cancer. This protocol attempts to exploit an approach to prostate cancer immunotherapy
      using a naturally occurring barrier to xenotransplantation in humans in an attempt to
      vaccinate patients against their prostate cancer. The expression of the murine alpha (1,3)
      galactosyltransferase [alpha (1,3) GT] gene results in the cell surface expression of alpha
      (1,3) galactosyl-epitopes (alpha-gal) on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids. These
      epitopes are the major target of the hyperacute rejection response that occurs when organs
      are transplanted from non-primate donor species into man. Human hosts often have pre-existing
      anti-alpha-gal antibodies that bind alpha-gal epitopes and lead to rapid activation of
      complement and cell lysis. The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibodies found in most
      individuals are thought to be due to exposure to alpha-gal epitopes that are naturally
      expressed on normal gut flora leading to chronic immunological stimulation. These antibodies
      may comprise up to 1% of serum IgG. In this Phase I/II trial, patients with hormone
      refractory prostate cancer will undergo a series of twelve intradermal injections with a
      vaccine composed of irradiated allogeneic prostate cancer cell lines (HAP-1 and HAP-2) that
      have been transduced with a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-based
      retroviral vector expressing the murine alpha (1,3) GT gene. Endpoints of the study include
      determination of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), tumor and
      immunological responses.

    <description>Before enrollment in the Phase I and Phase II- Arm A studies, the patient must be determined to have measurable disease with biopsies on first recurrence or bone metastases. In the Phase II- Arm B study, patients will be men with non-measurable progressive disease as evidenced by elevated PSA only. Cells will be injected intradermally every two weeks for 12 cycles on a prime-boost regimen. Dosage will vary from 30 million to 500 million HAP cells.</description>
