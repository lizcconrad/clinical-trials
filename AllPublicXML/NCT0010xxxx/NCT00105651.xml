    <textblock>
      Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry indicates
      that head and neck cancers (HN Ca) are nearly twice as common in veterans as non-veterans. HN
      Ca patients are at an increased risk for smoking, alcohol consumption and depression, all of
      which contribute to a further decline in their quality of life (QoL). In the HN Ca
      population, diagnosis and treatment of smoking, alcohol intake and depression are
      sub-optimal, thereby affecting QoL and survival. Numerous studies have documented that
      smoking, alcohol and depression are interrelated and research on multi-modal interventions
      has been suggested.

      Background:

      Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry indicates
      that head and neck cancers (HN Ca) are nearly twice as common in veterans as non-veterans. HN
      Ca patients are at an increased risk for smoking, alcohol consumption and depression, all of
      which contribute to a further decline in their quality of life (QoL). In the HN Ca
      population, diagnosis and treatment of smoking, alcohol intake and depression are
      sub-optimal, thereby affecting QoL and survival. Numerous studies have documented that
      smoking, alcohol and depression are interrelated and research on multi-modal interventions
      has been suggested.

      Objectives:

      To determine whether a combined intervention for smoking, alcohol intake, and depression
      improves the QoL of veterans with HN Ca.

      Methods:

      Patients from three VA medical centers (Ann Arbor, MI; Dallas, TX; Gainesville, FL) who have
      at least one of the three disorders of smoking, drinking and depression were randomized to
      either usual care or the combined intervention. Data was collected on smoking, alcohol
      consumption, depression and QoL at baseline, 6- and 12- months after the intervention (or
      non-intervention). The main analyses consisted of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare
      the scores on the SF-36 mental health scores and on the emotional domain of Head and Neck
      Quality of Life Questionnaire between the experimental and control group at 6- and 12- month
      follow up. Additional analyses examineded smoking, alcohol intake, and depression scores at
      these same time points.

      Status:

      Completed.
