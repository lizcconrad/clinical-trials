  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intake of high doses of corticosteroids is known to play an important role in the
      weakening of the bones and is thus an increasing fracture risk. Zoledronic acid (Aclasta) is
      a drug known for its protective effect in some bone diseases (tumors, paget). This study will
      test the safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid in the prevention and treatment of
      corticosteroid induced osteoporosis in male and female patients.
