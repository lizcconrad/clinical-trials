  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1b study is a multi-center trial designed to test the safety, tolerability,
      biologic activity of escalating doses of FG-3019 in up to 20 patients with type 1 or type 2
      diabetes and microalbuminuria (early-stage kidney disease). Patients will receive either 3 or
      10 mg/kg of FG-3019 administered every two weeks as an infusion for a total of four doses.
      The ability of FG-3019 to reduce the excretion of protein in the urine is being measured as a
      secondary endpoint.
