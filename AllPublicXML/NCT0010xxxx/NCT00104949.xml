      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Trastuzumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well trastuzumab works in treating patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate (confirmed complete response and partial response) in
           patients with HER2/neu-overexpressing locally advanced or metastatic synovial sarcoma
           treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin^®).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, SYT-SSX translocation, HER2/neu expression, and monophasic and
           biphasic phenotype with clinical outcomes in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin^®) IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 2 years from study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-40
      months.
