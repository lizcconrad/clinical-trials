  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide in treating
      young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors or myelodysplastic syndromes.
      Lenalidomide may stop the growth of solid tumors or myelodysplastic syndromes by blocking
      blood flow to the cancer. It may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop
      cancer cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of lenalidomide in
      pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine, preliminarily, the feasibility of administering this drug to pediatric patients
      with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndromes.

      II. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this drug in both patient
      populations.

      III. Determine immunologic changes in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      diagnosis (solid tumor vs myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS]).

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients with solid tumors receive escalating doses of lenalidomide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients with MDS receive a fixed
      dose (do not undergo dose escalation) of lenalidomide. After completion of study treatment,
      patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
