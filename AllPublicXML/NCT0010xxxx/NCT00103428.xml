      V-0039 is a Phase 1/2 dose escalation trial of CG7870 in combination with Docetaxel in
      metastatic hormone-refractory patients who have not received chemotherapy.

      All patients will receive docetaxel. In the dose escalation phase of the study, patients will
      receive treatment intravenously with CG7870 at one of up to four dose levels. In the Phase 2
      portion of this study, additional patients will be added at the maximum tolerated dose that
      is determined in Phase 1.
