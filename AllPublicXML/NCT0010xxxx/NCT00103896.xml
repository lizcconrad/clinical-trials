  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is Phase II of a three stage project whose overall goals are to develop viable
      community-based HIV prevention interventions and to form and maintain the necessary community
      collaborations to support such Adolescent Trials Network (ATN) research activities.

      This phase will describe specific locations within high-risk areas where youth, ages 12-24,
      spend time. HIV risk behaviors, social networking patterns and HIV prevalence among youth at
      these venues will be assessed by administering anonymous computerized interviews to eligible
      and willing youth. This information will be shared with community partners during scheduled
      working group meetings.

      This is Phase II of a three stage project whose overall goals are to develop viable
      community-based HIV prevention interventions and to form and maintain the necessary community
      collaborations to support such ATN research activities.

      During this phase, each ATN site will gather additional information within high-risk areas
      and solicit community partner input to ultimately pinpoint the specific locations where
      at-risk youths, ages 12-24, may be recruited for interventions. This will be done by the
      following methods:

      Venues will be identified by HIV+ youth at the ATN site by participation in an anonymous
      computerized interview. Site staff will then perform brief venue interviews (BVIs) at
      selected venues to assess the potential yield of youths 12-24 years old. Community partners
      will also provide the site staff with information on known high-risk venues. High-risk venues
      will further be identified by the results of anonymous computerized interviews and HIV assays
      obtained from eligible and willing youth participants at the venues. The interviews will
      gather information on HIV risk behaviors, social networking patterns and HIV prevalence among
      youths at these venues. This information will be shared with community partners during
      scheduled working group meetings.

        HIV infected youth, ages 12 through 24 years old, in treatment/care at each of the 15 ATN
        sites will be interviewed using ACASI technology to reveal possible venues where youth at
        high risk for acquiring the HIV may be found. Individuals approached at 3-5 of these
        identified venues who appear to be 12 through 24 years will be offered a brief venue
        interview. Anonymous HIV serosurvey (ACASI and HIV-Ab assay) will be administered to 20-30
        young women at 2-3 identified high-risk venues, and 20-30 young men at 2-3 identified
        high-risk venues, who provide verbal confirmation of being 12 through 24 years old, and
        whose HIV status is unknown to the site staff.
