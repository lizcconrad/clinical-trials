  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to improve treatment outcome for marijuana-dependent
      individuals. The current study builds on the findings of our prior NIDA-funded marijuana
      treatment study in which improved client outcomes were associated with greater treatment
      attendance, greater client self-efficacy, and greater use of coping skills. We will use a
      contingency management paradigm to provide tangible reinforcement for completing homework
      assignments that are designed to enhance coping skills. It is anticipated that this will
      result in greater homework compliance, leading to greater self-efficacy regarding one's
      ability to cope with high-risk situations. Improved self-efficacy will enhance the likelihood
      of employing coping skills in high-risk situations, thereby increasing the probability of
      achieving and maintaining abstinence.

      Participants will receive an intervention combining one session of motivational enhancement
      therapy with eight sessions of cognitive-behavioral coping skills therapy (MET+CBT). A
      contingency management procedure will be added to this intervention, providing reinforcement
      for completion of homework, as verified by call-ins to an Interactive Voice Recording (IVR)
      system. Outcomes will be compared to an MET+CBT intervention in which reinforcement will be
      provided for marijuana-free urine specimens, and to a control group that receives Case
      Management. Recruitment of 234 marijuana-dependent participants will occur over a three-year
      period. They will be randomly assigned to one of the three 9-session interventions. Treatment
      will be individual, manualized, and provided on an outpatient basis. Pretreatment assessments
      will obtain baseline data; follow-up assessments at three-month intervals for one year will
      evaluate marijuana use outcomes, other drug or alcohol use, and psychosocial functioning. It
      is anticipated that the intervention in which completion of homework is reinforced will
      result in the best outcomes. The mechanisms by which the interventions result in behavior
      change will be the specific focus of attention in this study.
