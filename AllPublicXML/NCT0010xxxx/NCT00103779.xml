    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-dose, Phase I, dose escalation study to define the safety
      profile and preliminary anti-tumor activity of SGN-40 in patients with refractory or
      recurrent non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas.

    <textblock>
      A minimum of 3 patients will be entered into each dose-level cohort for 5 weeks. A
      dose-escalation schema will be employed in cohorts. The initial dose starts at 1 mg/kg on Day
      1 and 4 followed by 2mg/kg on Day 8. Dose escalation will occur on weeks 3-5 with a maximum
      weekly dose of 8 mg/kg. Patients who meet criteria of at least partial response will be
      eligible for additional 4 weekly doses at highest dose tolerated.

             following the last dose of study drug.

          -  If a deep venous thrombosis or other vascular even has required medical or surgical
             intervention in the past year, patients must either be on stable dose of anticoagulant
             therapy for at least 3 weeks or have completed anticoagulant therapy at least 3 months
