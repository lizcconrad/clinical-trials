      The purpose of this study is to measure the immune response (how the body fights infection)
      to an experimental preparation of live Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). A better
      understanding of this virus may be useful in development of vaccines and treatments.
      Participants will include 20 healthy adults age 21-40. Study procedures will include drawing
      blood, urine samples, respiratory exams, vital signs and temperature, diary cards, nasal
      mucus weight and nasal washes and swabs. All participants will receive vaccine via nose
      drops. Patients will participate in the study for about 2 months.

      Respiratory infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Recently,
      respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been shown to account for a significant portion of
      these illnesses. The causative factors associated with severe RSV disease in the elderly are
      not well understood. The contribution of viral load, host inflammatory responses and the
      cellular immune response to disease pathogenesis are unknown. A better understanding of these
      processes may be useful in the development of vaccines and therapeutics for RSV disease.
      Although the adult groups at highest risk for serious RSV disease are elderly and high-risk
      adults, we propose to use the challenge model in young healthy adults to determine optimal
      timing of specimen collection and the feasibility of performing certain tests before moving
      ahead to the target groups with natural infection. The purpose of this study is to measure
      the immune response (how the body fights infection) to an experimental preparation of live
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV. Participants will include 20 healthy adults age 21-40.
      Study procedures will include drawing blood, urine samples, respiratory exams, vital signs
      and temperature, diary cards, nasal mucus weight and nasal washes and swabs. All participants
      will receive vaccine via nose drops. Patients will participate in the study for about 2
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy adults ages 21 to 40 years. Able to and has given informed consent to participate.
        Negative urine pregnancy test, if female. Pre-challenge serum neutralizing titer to RSV A2
        by microneutalization (MNA) of &lt;/= 1:657 (9.36 log2) Non-smoker No significant health
        abnormalities detected by evaluation of medical history, general physical examination,
        vital signs and laboratory tests.

        Willingness to remain in isolation for 11 nights and comply with all study requirements.

        Willingness to remain in the Rochester area for the 28 days of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Volunteers with any of the following conditions will not be eligible to participate:

        Chronic medical conditions requiring medical followup within the last 6 months. Serologic
        evidence of infection with HIV or hepatitis C virus, or presence of hepatitis B surface
        antigen in serum.

        History of medically documented asthma requiring treatment (including over-the-counter
        medications) at any time.

        Any abnormal laboratory results which would render challenge with RSV unsafe or interfere
        with the interpretation of the subject's response to challenge, e.g., AST, ALT, Bilirubin,
        BUN, creatinine. ( see Appendix II) Individuals requiring concurrent therapy with
        medications likely to interfere with evaluation of the response to infection, e.g.
        antipyretics, anti-inflammatory medications Close contact with children aged less than 2
        years, with any individuals with significant immunosuppression, or with individuals greater
        than 65 years of age.

        Health care workers with any patient contact during the two weeks following challenge
        Pregnancy or uncertain status regarding pregnancy Acute respiratory infection or fever
        within 1 week of challenge Previous enrollment in a study evaluating RSV challenge viruses
        or RSV vaccines.

        Known glucose intolerance (history of abnormal glucose tolerance test or medical history of
        diabetes mellitus).

        History of chronic obstructive disease, emphysema or other serious or evolving pulmonary
        disease.

        Any condition in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with study objectives or
        pose excessive risks to subjects.

        History of previous hospitalization for a pulmonary condition (ie. Pneumonia, asthma,
        spontaneous pneumothorax, or severe sinus disease requiring a surgical procedure.

        History of frequent serious bacterial infections associated with low white blood cell count
        (below 4,000 per microgram)
