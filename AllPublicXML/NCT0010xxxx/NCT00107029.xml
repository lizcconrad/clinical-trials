      This protocol is a study of HIV+ young people who were identified as having certain HIV-1
      specific T-cell responses and genetic markers while previously enrolled in the 5-year
      longitudinal adolescent study, &quot;REACH.&quot; Blood samples will be collected, a medical and
      medication history and physical examination will be performed every 6 months for a total of 2
      years.

      Numerous studies have demonstrated an association between HLA class I genotypes with
      differing progression to AIDS in individuals who are followed after being off antiretroviral
      therapy. These studies do not always associate the same HLA class I alleles with the risks of
      HIV-1 disease progression; however they consistently demonstrated that HLA-B*35 and B*53
      portend a bad outcome compared to the better outcome observed in HLA-B*27 and B*57 carriers.
      Despite this information, very little data exists to explain the mechanism of this
      association.

      This longitudinal study will look at the HIV-1 specific CD8+ T-cell responses and the
      dominant HIV-1 genotype among individuals identified as HLA-B*27, B*35, B*53 and B*57
      positive through studies done in collaboration with the REACH project.

      Biomedical HIV-1 related data and samples are available for the time the subjects were
      enrolled in REACH. HIV-1 genotyping will certainly be possible from these retrospective
      samples and the stored PBMCs will be evaluated for usefulness in the HIV-1 specific assays.
      Prospectively, samples will be collected every six months over a two-year period to evaluate
      both HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cell responses and the dominant HIV-1 genotype longitudinally.
