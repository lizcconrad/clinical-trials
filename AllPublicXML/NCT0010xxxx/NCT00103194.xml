    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well lapatinib ditosylate works in treating patients with a
      rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a protein made by the prostate gland, indicating that
      prostate cancer has come back after previous treatment. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may delay or
      prevent the progression of prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the percentage of patients with hormone sensitive prostate cancer who
      experience &gt; 50% decline in serum PSA during treatment with GW572016 (lapatinib ditosylate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the duration of PSA decline. II. To characterize the change in PSA slope with
      GW572016. III. To characterize the safety and tolerability of GW572016 in this patient
      population.

      IV. To estimate the time to progression (TTP) and progression-free survival at 2 years (from
      start of therapy).

      V. To evaluate the correlation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      expression/signaling (from available prostate biopsy specimens or prostatectomy blocks) and
      its relationship to change in PSA in patients treated with GW572016.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months if patient is &lt;
      2 years from study entry, every 6 months if patient is 2-5 years from study entry, or every
      year if patient is 5-10 years from study entry for 10 years.

    <measure>Number of Patients With PSA Response, Defined as a 50% or Greater Decline in the Serum PSA Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every cycle while on treatment; after being off-treatment, assessed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually for 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PSA response is defined as either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) observed at any time during the entire measurement time period.
CR: In patients treated with prior radical prostatectomy, a PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/mL confirmed by a repeat PSA at least one month apart was considered a complete biochemical response. In patients treated with radiation therapy only, a PSA &lt; 1 ng/mL on three separate occasions taken at least one month apart was considered a complete biochemical response.
PR: A reduction in PSA by &gt; 50% from baseline, confirmed by repeat PSA 1 month later.</description>

    <measure>The Change in PSA Slope With GW572016 (Lapatinib)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every cycle while on treatment; after being off-treatment, assessed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually, for 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>PSA was evaluated every cycle while on treatment. PSA test results show the level of PSA detected in the blood. These results were reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. PSA slope is the change in PSA level over time. A sharp rise in the PSA level raises the suspicion of cancer and may indicate a fast-growing cancer.</description>

        <title>Number of Patients With PSA Response, Defined as a 50% or Greater Decline in the Serum PSA Level</title>
        <description>PSA response is defined as either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) observed at any time during the entire measurement time period.
CR: In patients treated with prior radical prostatectomy, a PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/mL confirmed by a repeat PSA at least one month apart was considered a complete biochemical response. In patients treated with radiation therapy only, a PSA &lt; 1 ng/mL on three separate occasions taken at least one month apart was considered a complete biochemical response.
PR: A reduction in PSA by &gt; 50% from baseline, confirmed by repeat PSA 1 month later.</description>

        <title>The Change in PSA Slope With GW572016 (Lapatinib)</title>
        <description>PSA was evaluated every cycle while on treatment. PSA test results show the level of PSA detected in the blood. These results were reported as nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood. PSA slope is the change in PSA level over time. A sharp rise in the PSA level raises the suspicion of cancer and may indicate a fast-growing cancer.</description>
        <time_frame>Assessed every cycle while on treatment; after being off-treatment, assessed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, then annually, for 5 years</time_frame>
        <population>One patient who withdrew from study after receiving 4 days of treatment and did not have any follow-up PSA measurements was excluded from this analysis, so the number of participants analyzed is 34.</population>
