    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in subjects with refractory colorectal carcinoma with
      unresectable liver metastases. The purposes of the study are:

        -  to evaluate the safety and any harmful effects of an intravenous injection of Ad.hIFN-β;

        -  help determine whether the virus carrying the interferon-beta gene will enter the
           bloodstream and liver tumor cells and cause the cancer cells to die.

      This trial is a clinical research study of Ad.hIFN-β, an investigational,
      replication-defective, recombinant adenovirus containing the human interferon beta gene, for
      people that have refractory colorectal carcinoma with liver metastases. Scientists have been
      exploring a variety of approaches to develop medications to treat patients with refractory
      colorectal carcinoma with liver metastases; a disease for which current treatment provides
      only limited relief, so there is a need for new medications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with histologically confirmed hepatic metastases from primary colorectal
             carcinoma.

             Principal Investigator (PI).

          -  Tumor progression after prior therapy for colorectal carcinoma, including
             fluoropyrimidine (5 FU or capecitabine), irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or cetuximab.

          -  One or more metastatic hepatic tumors that is measurable on CT scan. In addition,
             subjects may have nonhepatic metastatic tumors.

          -  Men and women of reproductive potential must be willing to follow accepted birth
             control methods during treatment and for 3 months after completion of treatment.

          -  Acceptable liver function:

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal;

               -  AST, ALT ≤ 2.0 x upper limit of normal;

               -  Albumin ≤ 3.0 g/dL.

          -  Acceptable hematologic status:

               -  Granulocyte ≥ 1000 cells/mm3;

               -  Platelet count ≥ 150,000 plts/mm3;

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL.

          -  Acceptable coagulation status: INR within normal limits.

          -  Acceptable kidney function: Serum creatinine within normal limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction
             within the past 6 months prior to Day 1, unstable arrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia
             on ECG within 14 days prior to Day 1.

          -  Seizure disorders requiring anticonvulsant therapy.

          -  Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with hypoxemia.

          -  Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within 4 weeks prior to Day 1.

          -  Active uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, requiring systemic
             therapy.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

          -  Treatment with radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, or investigational therapy

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with procedures required in this protocol.

          -  Known infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.

          -  Serious nonmalignant disease (e.g., hydronephrosis, liver failure, or other
             conditions) that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the
             investigator and/or the sponsor.

          -  Clinically significant bleeding event within the last 3 months, unrelated to trauma.

          -  More than 50% of liver replaced by tumor (estimated by the PI from CT scan within 14
             days of Day 1).

          -  Previous treatment with Ad.hIFN-β.

          -  Any prior treatment with a gene delivery vector or an adenovirus therapeutic agent.
