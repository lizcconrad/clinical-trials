      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of ICA-17043 to placebo with or without
      hydroxyurea (an oral drug used for treatment of sickle cell disease) in patients with sickle
      cell disease who have had 2 or more acute sickle-related painful crises requiring a visit to
      a medical facility within the past 12 months.
