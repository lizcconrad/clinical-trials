  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infected children and adolescents who have taken many anti-HIV drugs may have limited
      treatment options and are at high risk for progressing to AIDS. The purpose of this study is
      to determine whether an anti-HIV treatment regimen of 2 protease inhibitors (PIs) and 2
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) is more effective than a regimen of 4
      NRTIs in treatment-experienced children and adolescents who have failed previous anti-HIV
      treatment.

      HIV infected children and adolescents on anti-HIV treatment regimens have traditionally had
      more difficulty with non-adherence and drug resistance than adults, often resulting in
      virologic failure. Additionally, HIV infected children with extensive exposure to
      antiretrovirals (ARVs) are likely to have fewer therapeutic options for salvage therapy, and
      their physicians find it difficult to choose regimens that will keep the HIV infection under
      control. This study will compare the efficacy of three 4-drug ARV salvage regimens in
      treatment-experienced, HIV infected children and adolescents who have experienced virologic
      failure.

      This study will last at least 96 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      three groups. Group 1A will receive a dual-PI based regimen of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r),
      saquinavir (SQV), and the NRTIs emtricitabine (FTC) and abacavir sulfate (ABC). Group 1B will
      receive a dual-PI based regimen of LPV/r, SQV, FTC, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).
      Group 2 will receive an NRTI-only regimen of ABC, lamivudine, zidovudine, and TDF.

      There will be 11 study visits during Step I of this study. Medical history, a physical exam,
      and blood collection will occur at all visits. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans
      will occur at study entry and at Weeks 24, 48, 72, and 96. Urine collection will occur at
      most visits; participants will also take part in adherence modules at most visits.
      Participants will be asked to complete a pill count form at Weeks 4 and 24. Additionally,
      some study participants will be asked to participate in an intensive pharmacokinetics study
      at Week 4.
