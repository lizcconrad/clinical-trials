  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study on subjects with advanced solid tumors.
      This is the first study of hCBE-11 in humans and is designed to determine the safety and how
      well patients tolerate this investigational drug. The study duration is two years with
      treatment visits occurring weekly for either 4 or 8 weeks, follow-up for 8 weeks and
      long-term follow-up contact every 3 months thereafter.
