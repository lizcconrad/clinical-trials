  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-center, open-label, escalating dose study is to assess the safety
      and tolerability of PPI-2458 in subjects with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL)and solid tumors.
      Subjects will be treated every other day (QOD) with PPI-2458 while being monitored closely
      for adverse events.

      The study will first determine the dose level that maximally inhibits MetAP2 in white blood
      cells (WBC). Once this dose level is reached, the study will proceed into the next cohort
      (dose level) to investigate the dose level that maximally inhibits MetAP2 in tumor tissue
      biopsies. Free MetAP2 levels (WBC and/or tumor tissue) will be analyzed during the first
      cycle (28 days) of treatment. Cohorts are expected to enroll every two cycles until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD)is determined.

      After the Initial Treatment Phase of two treatment cycles of PPI-2458, subjects may continue
      into a Continuous Treatment Phase at the discretion of the Investigator. In order to be
      eligible for the Continuous Treatment Phase of the protocol, subjects must have received some
      benefit (e.g., stable disease) as assessed by the Investigator within the Initial Treatment
      Phase and must continue to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria.
