        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have pathologically documented precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic
             leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL), relapsed or refractory to standard therapy, or not be a
             candidate for standard myelosuppressive chemotherapy due to age or comorbid disease.

          -  Patient must have performance status &lt;2 on the ECOG performance status for patients
             &gt;16 years old; Lansky performance level &gt;50 for patients 12 months to less than or
             equal to 16 years old.

          -  Patient must have adequate renal and liver function as indicated by the laboratory
             values performed within 14 days of receiving the first dose of study drug.

          -  Patient must have fully recovered from any chemotherapy and be greater than 2 weeks
             from radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or systemic steroid therapy with the exception of
             hydroxyurea, intrathecal therapy, or immunosuppressant therapy for chronic
             graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis following allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

          -  Patient must be greater than 2 months following bone marrow or peripheral blood stem
             cell transplantation and off all immunosuppressant therapy (with the exception of
             patients taking immunosuppressant therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease
             prophylaxis following allogeneic bone marrow transplant).

          -  Men and women of reproductive potential must use an effective contraceptive method
             while enrolled in the study.

          -  Patient or the patient's legal representative must be able to understand the study and
             give written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has had treatment with any investigational therapy during the preceding 30
             days.

          -  Patient has uncontrolled congestive heart failure, angina, or had a myocardial
             infarction in the preceding 3 months.

          -  Patient has known hypersensitivity to the components of study drug, its analogs, or to
             allopurinol.

          -  Patient has active or uncontrolled infection.

          -  Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Patient is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patient has any other severe concurrent disease which would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Patient is known to be HIV positive or who has an AIDS-related illness.

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin
             cancer should not be enrolled.

          -  Patient has isolated CNS disease.
