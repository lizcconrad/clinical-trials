  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Emmy trial is set up to evaluate the safety and efficacy of uterine artery embolization
      (UAE) in comparison to hysterectomy for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. UAE
      was considered equivalent to hysterectomy when at least 75% of patients had normalization of
      heavy menstrual blood loss after treatment.

    <textblock>
      Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) is a new treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding caused by
      uterine fibroids. UAE is already being performed on a regular basis, without profound
      evidence: no good quality randomized controlled trials have been conducted. The EMMY trial
      evaluates the safety and efficacy of UAE in a randomized comparison to hysterectomy. Patients
      were included when they had uterine fibroids and menorrhagia, and were eligible for
      hysterectomy. The primary endpoint is the elimination of menorrhagia after a two-year
      follow-up period. Secondary endpoints comprise: effect on complaints of pain and pressure,
      quality of life issues, uterine volume reduction, effect on ovarian function and
      cost-effectiveness. Patients were randomly assigned to either UAE or hysterectomy (1:1). All
      patients were followed for two years after treatment. Whether UAE can be an alternative to
      hysterectomy as treatment of first choice depends on the balance of efficacy, costs, and
      quality of life.
