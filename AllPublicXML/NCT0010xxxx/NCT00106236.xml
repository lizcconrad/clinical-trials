      The purpose of the study is to determine whether exercise has further beneficial effects on
      improving cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol level or
      diabetes mellitus, when added to the standard program of health check followed by life style
      recommendations.

      Multiple risk factors contribute to the causation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
      Past studies indicate that exercise exerts its protective effects on the disease through
      actions on multiple cardiovascular risk factors simultaneously; however, the studies focused
      on the effect of exercise predominantly on subjects with a single risk factor. Does exercise
      differentially act on various risk factors in the same subject? Do subjects with multiple
      risk factors respond differently to exercise than those predominantly with a single risk
      factor do? To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to test the efficacy of
      exercise on subjects with multiple risk factors. Exercise in fitness clubs has uniquely
      fitting features for middle to older aged people with multiple risk factors: access is
      relatively easy because there are usually many clubs throughout the city; the control of
      exercise intensity or heart rate is made precise, rendering exercise safer when treadmills or
      bicycles are used as a mainstay of aerobic exercise as in this study; and cardiac arrest, the
      most feared complication of exercise, will be most likely to be properly handled since in
      recent years the installment of automated external defibrillators has been increasingly
      popular in many clubs.

      Comparison: Exercise vs. standard care comparison is to be made only for the first 6-month
      period. The second 6-month period is for follow-up and other purposes.
