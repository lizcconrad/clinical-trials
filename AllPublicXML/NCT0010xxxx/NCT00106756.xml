      This study will examine the extent of the vision problem in familial exudative
      vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) and try to identify the genes responsible for this hereditary eye
      disorder. Patients with FEVR have incomplete formation of blood vessels in the periphery of
      the retina (the inner part of the eye that is responsible for vision). As a result, abnormal
      vessels can form and retinal detachment and vitreous bleeding can occur, causing significant
      vision loss. Vision loss usually begins in childhood, gradually worsening over time. Some
      patients eventually become blind.

      Patients of all ages with FEVR and their family members may be eligible for this study.
      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Family history, especially regarding eye disease. A family tree is drawn.

        -  Blood draw for genetic testing related to FEVR.

        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and eye pressure, and to
           examine pupils, lens, retina and eye movements. The pupils are dilated with drops for
           this examination.

        -  Fluorescein angiography to evaluate the eye's blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected
           into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures of the retina
           are taken using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if
           any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel
           abnormality.

        -  Patients affected with FEVR will also undergo DEXA scan to look for osteoporosis. X-rays
           are used to scan the hip, forearm and spine for bone density measurements.

      Background: Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a rare hereditary disorder of the
      retinal vasculature characterized by abrupt cessation of the growth of peripheral retinal
      capillaries. FEVR seems to exhibit significant phenotypic and genotypic variability but since
      this is a rare disease the clinical and genetic characteristics of the disease have not been
      extensively studied so far. Correlation of phenotypes with certain genotypes have not been
      made yet. Clinical findings can vary from very mild disease with only subtle changes of the
      peripheral retinal vasculature without symptoms to severe disease with retinal
      neovascularization, retinal exudates, vitreoretinal adhesions, peripheral vitreous opacities,
      retinal folds and tractional retinal detachment. The condition remarkably resembles
      retinopathy of prematurity but affected patients do not have a history of prematurity or
      supplementary oxygen use.

      The disorder is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait but few families show
      x-linked or autosomal recessive inheritance. A significant number of patients with autosomal
      dominant FEVR show linkage to 11q13-q23 (EVR1). Two genes in this locus have recently been
      shown to be associated with the disease. FZD4, the gene that encodes for Frizzled-4, the Wnt
      receptor, is one of them. It has been estimated by recent studies that 20-30% of patients
      with autosomal dominant FEVR show mutations in FZD4. LRP5 (low-density-lipoprotein
      receptor-related protein 5), a Wnt co-receptor, was recently shown to be mutated in
      approximately 15% of cases. One large autosomal dominant pedigree has shown linkage to
      11p13-p12 locus (EVR3) and this gene has not yet been identified. It now becomes obvious that
      more genes are associated with the autosomal dominant type of the disease. Most of the
      patients with the x-linked type have mutations in the Norrie disease gene (EVR2). The
      autosomal recessive form of the disease is much rarer and linkage studies have not yet been
      performed.

      Aims: The objectives of this protocol are to study the clinical characteristics of FEVR, and
      also to assist in identifying the location and sequence of corresponding genes. Since one of
      the genes so far identified, LRP5, is also causing the osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome, an
      inherited disorder with severe osteoporosis, we would also like to know if FEVR patients,
      especially those with mutations in LRP5 also have some degree of osteoporosis. Localization
      and identification of the responsible gene will help us understand the pathogenesis of FEVR
      and possibly the mechanism of retinal angiogenesis and lead to potential treatments.

      Methods: Patients as well as available family members are to be evaluated by physical
      examination and fluorescein angiography, in order to clinically characterize the inheritance
      pattern in each family. Blood will be obtained by all participating subjects for the
      molecular studies.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The patients must carry the clinical diagnosis of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy.
        Whenever a patient fulfills the above requirement additional family members can be included
        in the study as participants. Subjects of any ethnic background, gender, age, sexual
        orientation, or health status will be included.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Prematurity and supplemental oxygen use at bith can cause a clinical picture similar to
        familial exudative vitreoretinopathy. The existence of either of those factors in the past
        medical history of a patient will necessitate exclusion from the study. Since fluorescein
        angiography is crucial for the correct diagnosis of the syndrome, patients with a previous
        allergic reaction to fluorescein dye will also be excluded. Patients inability or
        unwillingness to provide a blood sample is an exclusion criterion as well.
