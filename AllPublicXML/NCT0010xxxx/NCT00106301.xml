      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of extended treatment
      with FK228 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma or hormone refractory prostate
      cancer who have at least demonstrated stable disease on prior Fujisawa sponsored FK228
      clinical trials.
