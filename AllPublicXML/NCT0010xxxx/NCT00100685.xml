    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being conducted to determine tumor response and preliminary safety of
      a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a cell surface receptor (α5β1 integrin) and
      is required for the establishment of new blood vessels during tumor growth, a process known
      as angiogenesis.
