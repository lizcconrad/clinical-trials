  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effectiveness of unilateral versus bilateral exercise training
      for recovering movement abilities in chronic stroke patients. After a stroke, some people
      have improved their movement ability by exercising the arm affected by the stroke. Others
      have improved by exercising both arms together. This study will compare these two kinds of
      exercise to see which might work best.

      Healthy volunteers and people who have had a stroke more than 6 months ago may be eligible
      for this study. Stroke patients must have some weakness in their stroke-affected arm. All
      participants must be 18 years of age or older. Candidates are screened with a clinical and
      neurological examination. Women who can become pregnant have a pregnancy test. Stroke
      patients have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the brain if they have not had one
      in the last year.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

      MRI: This procedure uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues
      and organs. The subject lies on a table that slides into the scanner (a narrow cylinder),
      wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking sounds that occur during the scanning process. The
      procedure lasts about 45 minutes, during which time the subject must lie still for up to 30
      minutes.

      Testing sessions: There are six test sessions - two to familiarize the subject with the
      reaching test, two to do the reaching test plus transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
      before and after an exercise session, and two to do the reaching test plus TMS one day after
      the exercise session. The sessions are on consecutive days, with a 1-week break after session
      3. The procedures involved are:

        -  Reaching test: The subject responds as quickly as possible to a &quot;GO&quot; signal presented on
           a computer monitor by performing a reaching movement with his or her arm. The activity
           from the arm muscles is recorded using surface electrodes. During this test, a
           questionnaire is used to determine the subject's attention, fatigue, and mood.

        -  TMS: For this test, a wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is
           passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the
           stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other
           simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg,
           and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the
           coil. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with small metal disk electrodes
           taped onto the skin of the arms. The subject performs the reaching test while TMS is
           delivered at various times after getting the &quot;GO&quot; signal.

        -  Arm exercises: The subject is seated in front of an exercise device that has two handles
           that slide forward and backward along a set of tracks. The subject is asked to slide
           either one or both handles back and forth repeatedly, alternating 5 minutes of arm
           exercise with 5 minutes of rest for 30 minutes.

      Objective:

      It has been proposed that individuals with stroke may benefit to a greater degree by training
      with both arms simultaneously than by training with the paretic arm alone. The purpose of
      this protocol is to identify the extent and the mechanisms of paretic arm performance
      improvement after a single session of bilateral arm training compared to a single session of
      unilateral paretic arm training in individuals with moderate-severity chronic stroke.

      Study population:

      The study population will consist of individuals with chronic stroke.

      Design:

      A single-blinded, counterbalanced, crossover design will be used.

      Outcome measures:

      Endpoint measures will include paretic arm peak acceleration and disinhibition of the
      stroke-affected cortical hemisphere as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in
      the context of a reaching task. These measures will be compared after a unilateral vs. a
      bilateral arm training session in individuals with chronic stroke.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals with Chronic Stroke (n=40):

        We will include individuals at least 6 months post thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic
        hemispheric or hemorrhagic hemispheric lesion. We will select individuals who initially had
        severe hemiparesis but who recovered to the point of having moderate motor impairment.
        Individuals with moderate motor impairment will be defined by a Fugl-Meyer score of at
        least 30, and the inability to actively extend the paretic wrist and fingers at least 20
        degrees. Assessment of severity of initial hemiparesis will be taken either from patient
        report or medical records.

        We would also like to study a smaller group (n=10) of individuals with mild motor
        impairment due to stroke. Individuals with mild motor impairment will be defined by an
        Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer score of 50 or greater (maximum score = 66), and the ability to
        actively extend the paretic wrist and fingers 20 degrees or more. We will also enroll 10
        healthy volunteers.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy Volunteers:

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness, including depression.

          -  History of neurological disorder or disease, including epilepsy.

          -  History of orthopedic injury or disorder affecting the upper extremities.

          -  Less than 18 years of age.

          -  Have a pacemaker, implanted pumps or stimulators, or metal objects inside the eye or
             skull.

        Individuals with Chronic Stroke (Moderate and Mild Impairment Groups):

          -  Unable to perform the task (rapid forward reaching task) with the affected arm.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness,

          -  History of neurological disorder or disease, including epilepsy.

          -  History of orthopedic injury or disorder affecting the upper extremities.

          -  Less than 18 years of age.

          -  Cerebellar or brainstem lesions.

          -  Severe uncontrolled medical problems (e.g. cardiovascular disease, severe rheumatoid
             arthritis, arthritic joint deformity, active cancer or renal disease).

          -  Taking medications that act primarily on the central nervous system.

          -  Pregnancy - if MRI was not performed within the past 6 months and therefore needs to
             be attained.

          -  Serious cognitive deficits (defined as equivalent to a mini-mental state exam score of
             23 or less) that would prevent their ability to give informed consent and/or perform
             the study tasks.

          -  Have a pacemaker, implanted pumps or stimulators, or metal objects inside the eye or
             skull.
