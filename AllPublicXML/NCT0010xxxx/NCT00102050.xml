  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NM-702 oral tablets are being developed for the treatment of Intermittent Claudication, a
      primary early stage indication of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This trial is designed
      to assess the safety and efficacy of 4 mg and/or 8 mg NM-702 taken twice a day (BID) for 24
      weeks to see if it improves peak walking time (PWT) more than placebo for the treatment of
      Intermittent Claudication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stable, symptomatic, intermittent claudication due to occlusive atherosclerotic
             disease of the lower extremities

          -  Median treadmill peak walking time between 90 and 600 seconds

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptoms of limb threatening ischemia (ischemic rest pain, ischemic ulceration and/or
             gangrene)

          -  Clinically significant pulmonary, neurological or skeletal dysfunction (e.g., lumbar
             canal stenosis, emphysema, uncontrolled angina, multiple sclerosis, or gait altering
             amputation) that would directly interfere or limit exercise testing

          -  Subjects who have had, or will require, a peripheral revascularization procedure
             within 12 weeks prior to or following treatment initiation.

          -  A resting blood pressure greater than 150/100 and other clinically significant
             results.
