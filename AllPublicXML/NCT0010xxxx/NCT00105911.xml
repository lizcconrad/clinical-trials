      The literature and our preliminary studies found that in COPD patients, psychosocial factors
      affect quality of life (QOL) and functioning more than would be expected given the severity
      of their disease. To improve QOL and functioning in the approximately 50% of COPD patients
      with significant anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, interventions are needed. Much research
      documents the utility of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating depression and
      anxiety, showing it to have promise as a self-management intervention to improve QOL in COPD
      patients.

      Background:

      The literature and our preliminary studies found that in COPD patients, psychosocial factors
      affect quality of life (QOL) and functioning more than would be expected given the severity
      of their disease. To improve QOL and functioning in the approximately 50% of COPD patients
      with significant anxiety and/or depressive symptoms, interventions are needed. Much research
      documents the utility of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating depression and
      anxiety, showing it to have promise as a self-management intervention to improve QOL in COPD
      patients.

      Objectives:

      Objectives were to compare CBT for anxiety and depression with COPD education for COPD
      patients with moderate-to-severe anxiety and/or depressive symptoms.

      Methods:

      Veterans were recruited from VAMC clinics and through press releases. Two hundred and
      thirty-eight COPD patients with comorbid anxiety and/or depressive symptoms were randomized
      to either 8 weeks of CBT/usual care or 8 weeks of COPD Education/usual care. We hypothesized
      that COPD patients receiving CBT/usual care would improve more than COPD patients receiving
      COPD Education/usual care. Improvement was defined as increased disease-specific QOL, generic
      QOL, and 6-minute walk distance; and decreased depression, anxiety, and health service use.
      Outcomes were examined pre-, mid- and post-treatment and at 4, 8 and 12 months.

      Status:

      The study was scheduled to officially end December 31, 2005, but was granted a no-cost
      extension by HSR&amp;D to complete data analyses and prepare final papers. The extension was
      granted through June 30, 2006. As of the date of this final report, the study is complete.
