  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is characterized by in situ
      thrombosis and increased thromboxane A2 (Tx-M) synthesis. While both may be attributable to
      abnormal platelet function, there are no studies of anti-platelet therapy in IPAH.

      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of aspirin (ASA) and
      clopidogrel on platelet function and eicosanoid metabolism in patients with IPAH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of aspirin 81 mg once
      daily and clopidogrel 75 mg once daily. Platelet function is assessed with plasma P-selectin
      levels and aggregometry after exposure to adenosine diphosphate, arachidonic acid, and
      collagen. We will assess serum levels of thromboxane B2 and urinary metabolites of
      thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin I2 (Tx-M and PGI-M, respectively).
