  <brief_title>Trial to Compare Alfuzosin Versus Placebo in the Treatment of Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomized Multicenter Double-Blind Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 10mg Alfuzosin in the Treatment of Chronic Prostatitis / Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS) in Recently-Diagnosed and/or Newly-Symptomatic Alpha-blocker Naïve Patients</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      alpha adrenergic blocker Alfuzosin (Uroxatral) in men with relatively new onset of chronic
      prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). Alfuzosin is a once daily (10 mg
      capsule), FDA approved medication for an indication in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
      The effectiveness of alfuzosin in improving lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with BPH
      has been documented in a number of placebo-controlled studies. A number of small studies have
      also suggested that alfuzosin ameliorates CP/CPPS symptoms through a similar alpha-blockade
      mechanism. This study will enable further testing of this hypothesis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The two primary objectives of this study are:

        -  To compare 12 weeks of treatment with alfuzosin versus placebo in newly-diagnosed,
           alpha-blocker naïve CP/CPPS participants with respect to the primary endpoint in the
           NIH-CPSI.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of alfuzosin in newly-diagnosed,
           alpha-blocker naïve CP/CPPS participants.

      The proportion of &quot;responders&quot; in each treatment arm will be compared to evaluate the overall
      safety and efficacy of alfuzosin as compared to placebo. Approximately 270 eligible patients,
      135 per treatment arm, will be randomized and followed for a period of twelve (12) weeks
      after randomization. There will be four clinic visits.
