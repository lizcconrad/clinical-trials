  <brief_title>Efficacy and Safety of a Long Acting Anti-Psychotic Versus Placebo in Patients With Schizophrenia</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy (how well the drug works), safety, and
      side effects of paliperidone palmitate compared to placebo in the treatment of the symptoms
      of schizophrenia in adults. The placebo used in this study was a nutritional substance known
      as 20% Intralipid emulsion given to patients requiring intravenous feedings.

      Many patients with schizophrenia have difficulty adhering to a daily oral treatment regimen.
      Long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations may provide therapeutic plasma concentrations over
      several weeks, thereby eliminating the need for daily oral medication and making compliance
      easier. This is a randomized (patients will be assigned to different treatment groups based
      solely on chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician will know if placebo
      or drug is being given and at what dose), placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter,
      dose-response study in adults who have schizophrenia. The study consists of a screening
      period of no more than 7 days and a 13-week double-blind treatment period. The screening
      period includes 4 days for tolerability testing, if necessary. In the double-blind treatment
      period, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (3 fixed doses of
      paliperidone palmitate or placebo) to receive 4 i.m. injections of paliperidone palmitate or
      placebo on Days 1, 8, 36, and 64. The study, including the screening period, will last
      approximately 14 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed throughout the study using the Positive and
      Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity
      (CGI-S), and the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP). Safety will be evaluated
      throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) rating scales
      scores, clinical laboratory test results; vital signs and body weight measurements;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs); and physical examination findings. In addition, the tolerability
      of injections will be assessed. ER OROS paliperidone 3 mg/day for 4 days. Injections (i.m.)
      of paliperidone palmitate (25, 50, or 100 mg eq.) will be given on Days 1, 8, 36, and 64.
