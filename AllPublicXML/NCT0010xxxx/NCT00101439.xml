    <textblock>
      A study to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering effects of ezetimibe in participants with
      primary hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) after eating a meal that is high in
      cholesterol. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with ezetimibe 10 mg/day reduces the
      cholesterol concentration of the chylomicron-containing Sf≥400 fraction following a
      cholesterol-enriched test meal.

    <measure>Total Cholesterol Concentration of Chylomicron (Sf≥400) Fractions After a Cholesterol-Rich Test Meal</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately prior to consumption of the test meal (baseline) and at 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after test meal on Day 28 of each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>On each of 2 days prior to the last day of each treatment period, participants consumed 2 large eggs in the evening. On the morning of the final day of each treatment period, fasting participants were given a site-prepared, cholesterol-enriched milkshake that provided 1114 calories of total energy (~44% of calories from fat, ~40% of calories from carbohydrate and ~17% of calories from protein) and 504 mg of cholesterol. The milkshake was consumed over a 15-minute period. Plasma samples were collected immediately prior to consumption of the test meal (baseline) and at 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours afterwards for isolation and analysis of lipoprotein fractions. The geometric mean concentration level was calculated using data obtained at all timepoints.</description>

        <title>Total Cholesterol Concentration of Chylomicron-remnant (Sf 60-400) Subfractions After a Cholesterol-Rich Test Meal</title>
        <description>On each of 2 days prior to the last day of each treatment period, participants consumed 2 large eggs in the evening. On the morning of the final day of each treatment period, fasting participants were given a site-prepared, cholesterol-enriched milkshake that provided 1114 calories of total energy (~44% of calories from fat, ~40% of calories from carbohydrate and ~17% of calories from protein) and 504 mg of cholesterol. The milkshake was consumed over a 15-minute period. Plasma samples were collected immediately prior to consumption of the test meal (baseline) and at 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours afterwards for isolation and analysis of lipoprotein subfractions. The geometric mean concentration level was calculated using data obtained at all timepoints.</description>
