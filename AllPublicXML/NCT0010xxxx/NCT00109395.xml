  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is being performed under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act,
      signed into law in 2002 in order to improve pediatric labeling for off-patent drugs. The
      purpose of this study is to make sure that lorazepam, when given to children who are very
      sick in the Intensive Care Unit and who are on a breathing machine, is safe and works as well
      as a drug called midazolam. Midazolam is already approved by the FDA for this use, but
      lorazepam is not, even though both drugs are commonly used for sedation.

    <textblock>
      Lorazepam is used clinically for sedation of mechanically ventilated children, but has not
      been approved by the FDA for this indication in children. The purpose of this study, in
      response to the Written Request by FDA, is to determine the safety, efficacy, and dosage
      required for lorazepam compared with midazolam, which is approved by FDA for children for
      this indication.

      Study participants must be children who are critically ill and receiving mechanical
      ventilation who require sedation. Participants will be randomized to lorazepam (intermittent
      bolus or continuous infusion) or midazolam (continuous infusion). Sedation will be monitored
      using the COMFORT score. Blood will be drawn to measure lorazepam/midazolam plasma
      concentrations, and to measure the plasma concentrations of excipients (benzyl alcohol and
      glycols) in patients receiving lorazepam.
