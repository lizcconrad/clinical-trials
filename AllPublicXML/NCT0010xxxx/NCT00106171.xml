  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is not known if anti-HIV treatment for recently infected patients improves long-term
      patient prognosis. The purpose of this study is to determine if a one year course of anti-HIV
      medications slows progression of HIV disease in adults recently infected with HIV.

      Study hypothesis: A one-year course of HAART administered during acute or early
      seroconversion may slow the progression of HIV infection.

      Although some doctors favor starting anti-HIV treatment as soon as possible after patients
      learn they are infected, it is not known if treatment for recently infected patients results
      in slower progression of HIV disease. This study will compare the virologic outcomes of
      recently infected adults who receive highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with those
      who receive no treatment. This study will also compare the effects of treatment on patients
      who enroll within 3 months of seroconversion (acute seroconverters) with patients who enroll
      within 3 to 12 months of seroconversion (early seroconverters).

      This study will last at least 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups. Group 1 will receive HAART for 1 year; Group 2 will receive no treatment. There will
      be at least 20 study visits over the 3-year study period. Blood collection will occur at all
      study visits. A physical exam, medical and medication history, and risk behavior assessment
      will occur at most visits; participants will also be asked to complete an adherence
      questionnaire at most visits.

             in the study protocol

          -  Antiretroviral naive. Participants who have taken antiretrovirals for postexposure
             prophylaxis are eligible for this study.

          -  Willing to use acceptable forms of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Physician unable to design a potentially effective HAART regimen based on results of
             genotypic resistance testing

          -  Two CD4 counts of less than 350 cells/mm3 obtained at least 7 days apart within 30
             days of study entry

          -  Viral load less than 5,000 copies/ml within 30 days of study entry in participants who
             have been infected with HIV-1 for more than six months prior to study entry

          -  Use of systemic cancer chemotherapy, systemic investigational agents, specific
             antiretroviral medications, or immunomodulators (growth factors, systemic
             corticosteroids, HIV vaccines, immune globulin, interleukins, interferons) within 30
             days prior to study entry

          -  Current alcohol or drug use that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere
             with the study

          -  Serious illness requiring systemic treatment or hospitalization until participant
             either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy for at least 7 days prior
             to study entry
