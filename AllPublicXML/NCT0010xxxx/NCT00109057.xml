  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label extension study. Subjects who have received rhuMAb VEGF
      (Avastin) therapy in any Genentech-sponsored Phase I or Phase II cancer study and who did not
      show evidence of disease progression at completion of the parent study will be eligible for
      inclusion in this trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous participation in and completion of a Genentech-sponsored rhuMAb VEGF Phase I
             or Phase II cancer study

          -  No evidence of progressive disease at completion of the parent study

          -  For women of childbearing potential, use of an effective means of contraception

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any unresolved or irreversible rhuMAb VEGF-related ongoing serious adverse events
             occurring during the parent study

          -  Any history of central nervous system disease (e.g., primary brain tumor or seizures
             within 12 months of the first infusion on this study), and/or any evidence of brain
             metastases

          -  Compromised renal or hepatic function, as defined in the parent protocol

          -  Anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia, as defined in the parent protocol

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation

          -  Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned
             participation in an experimental drug study other than a Genentech-sponsored rhuMAb
             VEGF cancer study

          -  Recent (within 3 weeks of the first infusion of this study) major surgical procedure,
             biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or significant traumatic injury

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension [blood
             pressure of &gt;160/110 mmHg on medication], myocardial infarction, unstable angina), New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure, serious
             cardiac dysrhythmia requiring medication, or peripheral vascular disease (Grade II or
             greater)

          -  Serious, nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture

          -  Current or recent (within 10 days of the first infusion on this study) use of oral or
             parenteral anticoagulants or aspirin (except as required to maintain patency of
             permanent indwelling intravenous [IV] catheters)

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from
             treatment complications
