  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-blind, inpatient study followed by outpatient,
      placebo-controlled, single-dose, dose-escalation evaluation of the safety and tolerability of
      PPI-1019 in patients with mild-moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Up to 12 sequential cohorts
      of 8 patients (6 active and 2 placebo) will be given a single PPI-1019 dose intravenously
      (IV) over 1 minute in order to determine a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MTD will be the
      dose immediately below the not-tolerated dose.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written
             informed consent, and abide by the requirements of the study.

          -  Patient has a caregiver willing to assist the patient’s involvement in the study.

          -  Patient is a male or female between the ages of 50 and 80 with a body mass index (BMI)
             below 31. Females must be post-menopausal at least

             1 year or surgically sterilized.

          -  Patient must have a cognitive deficit present for at least one year and meet DSM IV
             criteria for Alzheimer’s Disease and meet National Institute of Neurological and
             Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders
             Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for the presence of probable Alzheimer’s Disease.

          -  Patient’s severity of Alzheimer’s disease must be mild-moderate, documented with a
             Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score of 12-26.

          -  Patient has a computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             within the prior 12 months which is compatible with a diagnosis of probable AD.

          -  If a patient is being treated for Alzheimer’s disease, it must be with a single agent
             (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, or memantine) and with a dose which has been
             stable for at least 3 months.

          -  Patient is otherwise in good general health. Treatment of hypertension with no more
             than 2 medications and for hyperlipidemia with one agent is acceptable provided drugs
             and dosages have been stable for at least 30 days.

          -  Patient agrees to abstain from alcohol and not take any other drugs, dietary
             supplements, or herbal therapies other than Mylanta®, ibuprofen, or a multivitamin for
             the length of the study (screening to follow-up visit Day 22).

          -  Patient agrees not to donate blood or blood products while participating in this study
             and for at least 60 days after discontinuing from the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has participated in a clinical trial of another investigational drug or
             device, or has taken any experimental drug within 30 days prior to screening.

          -  Patient has a history compatible with vascular dementia as evidenced by a score of 5
             or greater on the modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale.

          -  Patient has evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, or metabolic disease within the past 6 months (as
             determined by medical history, ECG results, chest x-ray, or physical examination).
             Findings of potential significance must be discussed with an appropriate sponsor
             clinician (or PRAECIS’ designee) prior to patient entry.

          -  Patient has a systolic blood pressure (sitting) of greater than 150 mmHg, a diastolic
             (sitting) greater than 95 mmHg, a decrease in systolic blood pressure of more than 30
             mmHg upon standing for 2 minutes from a sitting or supine position, or a pulse
             (sitting or supine) less than 55 or greater than 85.

          -  Patient has any visual, hearing, or communication disabilities impairing his or her
             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Patient intends to use any concomitant medications during the study other than those
             described in Inclusion Criteria.

          -  Patient has taken any concomitant medication without the approval of the investigator
             within 7 days prior to Day 1.

          -  Patient has tested positive for drugs of abuse (benzodiazepines, narcotics,
             amphetamines, barbiturates, sedatives, hypnotics, cocaine, phencyclidine, alcohol, or
             cannabinoids) on drug screening or Day -1.

          -  Patient has any elevations (&gt; 1.2 x ULN) on screening or Day -1 for ALT, AST,
             bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, or alkaline phosphatase.

          -  Patient has any other screening or Day -1 laboratory values outside the normal ranges
             that are deemed clinically significant by the investigator.
