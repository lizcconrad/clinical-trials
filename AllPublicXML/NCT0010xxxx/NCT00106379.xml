      The purpose of this study is to provide long-term clinical safety and efficacy data for
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine in HIV-infected patients experiencing various
      degrees of renal impairment.

      The primary objective of this study is as follows:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of tenofovir following administration of
           tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg for 48 weeks in HIV-infected patients experiencing
           various degrees of renal impairment.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of emtricitabine following administration of
           emtricitabine 200 mg for 48 weeks in HIV-infected patients experiencing various degrees
           of renal impairment.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in combination with
           emtricitabine in renally-impaired HIV-infected patients.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir and emtricitabine in renally-impaired
           HIV-infected patients.

          -  Either antiretroviral therapy-naive requiring antiretroviral treatment with HIV-1 RNA
             greater than 400 copies/mL or antiretroviral therapy-experienced on a stable
             antiretroviral regimen for at least 3 mos. with HIV-1 RNA less than or equal to 50
             copies/mL at screening.

          -  No active opportunistic infection within 45 days prior to baseline.
