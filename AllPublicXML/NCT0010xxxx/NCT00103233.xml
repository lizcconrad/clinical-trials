      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Trastuzumab may also help vinorelbine work
      better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving vinorelbine together with
      trastuzumab may be an effective treatment for breast cancer. It is not yet known whether
      giving vinorelbine together with trastuzumab is more effective than vinorelbine alone in
      treating breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying vinorelbine and trastuzumab to see how
      well they work compared to vinorelbine alone in treating women with progressive metastatic
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare progression-free survival (PFS) of women with HER2-positive progressive
           metastatic breast cancer treated with vinorelbine with or without trastuzumab
           (Herceptin®).

        -  Compare overall survival and time to treatment failure in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the response rate (complete and partial, confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients
           with measurable disease treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate baseline circulating tumor cells (CTC) with PFS, overall survival, and disease
           progression status at 9 weeks in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Correlate 4-week CTC with subsequent PFS and overall survival of patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 90 minutes and vinorelbine IV
           over 10 minutes on day 1 of course 1. Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes
           and vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in all subsequent courses.
           If trastuzumab is discontinued due to toxicity, patients may continue to receive
           vinorelbine alone.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease
      progression and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 292 patients (146 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
