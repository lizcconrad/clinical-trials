    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the safety and tolerability of a new investigational
      vaccine referred to as VEE IA/B V3526, which may induce production of specific antibodies in
      vaccinated humans, and may protect them against infection with the Venezuelan Equine
      Encephalitis (VEE) Virus.

      Safety Objectives: 1) To determine preliminary safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of
      VEE IA/B V3526 in VEE-naïve healthy volunteers after single dose subcutaneous (SC)
      administration; 2) To evaluate virological safety by assessing serum viremia and viral
      shedding in nose and throat.

      Immunogenicity Objectives: 1) To assess the humoral immune response (plaque reduction
      neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT)) against VEE subtype IA/B after SC administration of
      different dose-levels of the VEE IA/B V3526 vaccine candidate; 2) To assess duration of
      immune response over six months after the VEE IA/B V3526 vaccination based on PRNT; and 3) To
      identify two suitable VEE IA/B V3526 vaccine dose-levels for future administration in dose
      optimization and expanded safety studies.

      Exploratory Objectives: 1) To collect and store serum for future development of
      immunogenicity assays (e.g., ELISA) against multiple VEE subtypes IA/B, IE, IIIA, and other
      possible subtypes; 2) To collect and store serum for future use in the development of a
      passive transfer challenge model; 3) Collect VEE IA/B V3526 positive serum (Positive Control
      Serum) at the Day 21 visit.

             report form.

          -  The volunteer is unwilling to comply with all aspects of the protocol through the post
             vaccination Day 180 (±7 days) assessment, or the volunteer's medical or psychiatric
             condition or occupational responsibilities preclude compliance with the
             protocol-specified procedures.

          -  The volunteer has screening laboratory values for total WBC, Hemoglobin, platelets,
             LFT (AST, ALT, ALP, Bilirubin) that are not within normal range and/or a positive
             urine test for proteinuria.
