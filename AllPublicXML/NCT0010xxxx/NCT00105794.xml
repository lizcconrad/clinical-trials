      During a psychiatric crisis, persons with severe mental illness (SMI) confront complex
      challenges concerning treatment choices and are often ill equipped or unable to make mental
      health care decisions. Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs) are legal documents that allow
      competent persons to declare their treatment preferences in advance of a mental health
      crisis, when they may lose capacity to make reliable health care decisions. The use of PADs
      is consistent with recommendations of the President�s New Freedom Commission on Mental
      Illness and the Patient Self-Determination Act; 25 states have now adopted PAD legislation.
      VA does not have a specific policy for PADs or mechanisms to notify veterans of their right
      to prepare PADs. The downstream effects of PADs on patient care, crisis management, service
      use, and clinical outcomes are unknown.

      Background:

      During a psychiatric crisis, persons with severe mental illness (SMI) confront complex
      challenges concerning treatment choices and are often ill equipped or unable to make mental
      health care decisions. Psychiatric Advance Directives (PADs) are legal documents that allow
      competent persons to declare their treatment preferences in advance of a mental health
      crisis, when they may lose capacity to make reliable health care decisions. The use of PADs
      is consistent with recommendations of the President�s New Freedom Commission on Mental
      Illness and the Patient Self-Determination Act; 25 states have now adopted PAD legislation.
      VA does not have a specific policy for PADs or mechanisms to notify veterans of their right
      to prepare PADs. The downstream effects of PADs on patient care, crisis management, service
      use, and clinical outcomes are unknown.

      Objectives:

      This project examined the effects of a facilitated PAD intervention on guiding patients�
      treatment during a future mental health crisis, patients� treatment engagement, and patients�
      mental health service use and clinical outcomes. An additional objective was to describe
      veterans� preferences for PAD content and completion. Study hypotheses predicted that, as
      compared to controls, veterans with PAD would have fewer involuntary hospitalizations, great
      satisfaction with care, less coercion and more autonomy, greater treatment motivation,
      stronger working alliances, less ER use and fewer rehospitalizations, and improved clinical
      outcomes.

      Methods:

      A total of 240 psychiatrically hospitalized veterans with severe mental illness were enrolled
      in this prospective, randomized, clinical intervention trial: 120 were randomized to �usual
      care� and received information about PADs; 120 were randomized to the PAD condition. All
      participants and their clinicians received information about PADs. Those randomized to the
      PAD condition were also offered the opportunity to complete a facilitated PAD. The
      facilitated PAD consisted of a 60-minute meeting with a clinician, who provided education
      about PADs and conducted a semi-structured interview to assess the patient�s wishes and
      preferences for future treatment during a mental health crisis. The clinician then assisted
      the patient to prepare a PAD document. Patients in both groups completed follow-up
      assessments at 1, 6, and 12 months post-enrollment. Those rehospitalized at Durham VAMC
      during the 12-month follow up period completed an additional assessment interview at each
      rehospitalization.

      Status:

      Complete. Activities completed in the past 12 months include collection of follow-up data on
      final subset of enrollees, extraction of utilization data (clinic stops) at one-year
      post-enrollment from VA system healthcare database (Austin, TX) and from local healthcare
      database (CPRS), completion of statistical analyses of outcome measures and preparation of
      scientific reports summarizing final results.
