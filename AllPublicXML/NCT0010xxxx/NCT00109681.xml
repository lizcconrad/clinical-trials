  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether iloprost inhalation solution is
      safe in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and elevated pulmonary arterial
      pressure. The secondary purpose is to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment in
      subjects with this disease.

      While there are no FDA approved therapies for the treatment of IPF, there are therapies that
      have been shown to be effective in ameliorating the effects of pulmonary hypertension in
      patients with PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), including inhaled iloprost. However,
      these therapies have not been used extensively in patients with IPF who have pulmonary
      hypertension as a complication. The potential benefits of treatment of pulmonary hypertension
      complicating IPF include: improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics, with reduction in pulmonary
      artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, and increase in cardiac output.
