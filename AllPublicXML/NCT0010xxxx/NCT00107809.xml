      The primary objectives of the study are to determine the effectiveness of PROVIGIL treatment,
      compared to placebo treatment, in children and adolescents with excessive sleepiness (ES)
      associated with obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), as assessed by:

        -  mean sleep latency from the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) (average of 4 naps
           performed at 0900, 1100, 1300, and 1500) at the last post baseline observation (week 6
           or early termination)

        -  the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) ratings for ES, at the last post
           baseline observation (week 6 or early termination).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A boy or girl aged 6 through 16 years, inclusive

          -  Meet the minimal criteria established by the International Classification of Sleep
             Disorders (ICSD) manual of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) for OSAHS as
             assessed by all of the following: *clinical history;

             *have a previous diagnosis of OSAHS on the basis of NPSG (nocturnal polysomnogram)
             and/or MSLT at any time before the screening visit. If the patient is a current user
             of CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy and is appropriately titrated on
             CPAP, the AHI ≥5 inclusion criterion is not applicable; *NPSG (nocturnal
             polysomnogram) (as evaluated by the investigator) to rule out other sleep disorders
             (ie, narcolepsy and periodic limb movement with sleep [PLMs]).

          -  Have ES (CGI-S [Clinical Global Impression of Severity] ≥4) that is not a direct
             result of inadequate sleep hygiene or other medical disorder

          -  Are in good health as determined by a medical and psychiatric history, physical
             examination, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  For patients who are not current users of CPAP therapy or who are not appropriately
             titrated on CPAP: have an average of 5 or more apneic/hypopneic episodes per hour of
             nocturnal sleep, as assessed by the NPSG at the baseline visit (AHI [apnea/hypopnea
             index] ≥5)

          -  Are currently users of CPAP therapy or have tried and not tolerated the current
             standards of care for OSAHS and continue to have residual sleepiness (ie, patients who
             comply with CPAP use, patients who are unable to tolerate or comply with CPAP therapy,
             patients who have had surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids or for whom this
             surgery is not warranted, and patients who have attempted or are on an ongoing weight
             loss program)

          -  Have an O2 saturation of at least 85%, based on the investigator's assessment of the
             patient's health

          -  Have blood pressure values greater than those for the 5th percentile and less than the
             95th percentile for age on the National High Blood Pressure Education Program
             guidelines for blood pressure levels for boys and girls ages 6 through 16 years

          -  Girls who are post menarche or sexually active must have a negative urine pregnancy
             test prior to the baseline visit, must be using a medically acceptable method of birth
             control, and must agree to continue use of this method for the duration of the study
             (and for 30 days after participation in the study). Acceptable methods of birth
             control include: barrier method with spermicide; steroidal contraceptive (eg, oral,
             transdermal, implanted, or injected) in conjunction with a barrier method;
             intrauterine device (IUD); or abstinence.

          -  Be able to swallow a placebo tablet the same size and shape as the study drug tablet

          -  Negative UDS (urine drug screen) for any illicit drug, alcohol (ethanol), stimulants,
             or modafinil at screening; if positive for stimulants or modafinil (prescribed for ES)
             at the screening visit, UDS to be repeated after washout period and before the

          -  Have a history of suicide attempt, or are at suicidal risk

          -  A clinically significant drug sensitivity to stimulants such as amphetamine,
             dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, or pemoline; and/or modafinil or any of its
