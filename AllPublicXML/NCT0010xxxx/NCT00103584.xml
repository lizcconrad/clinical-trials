    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of LC16m8, a modified
      vaccinia vaccine. After consent and thorough screening (including safety labs, EKG, and
      medical history), healthy, previously unvaccinated volunteers between the ages of 18-34 will
      receive a single vaccination of either LC16m8 or the current US-licensed smallpox vaccine,
      Dryvax. Volunteers will be blindly randomized to a treatment group in a 4:1 ratio (4 LC16m8
      to 1 Dryvax recipient). Follow-up clinical evaluations, laboratory testing, EKGs and cardiac
      assessments will be done at regularly scheduled follow-up visits for 1 year after
      vaccination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to understand the study and give written informed consent. A signed informed
             consent must be in place prior to any study procedures being performed.

          -  Male or female aged 18-34 years old (inclusive; year of birth = 1971-1987).

          -  No history of smallpox vaccination or evidence of vaccine site scar.

          -  Willing and able to return for all follow-up visits, study procedures, and blood draws
             for the duration of the study.

          -  In good health, as ascertained by medical history, clinical assessment, and baseline
             (screening) laboratory assessments.

          -  Negative ELISA for HIV or, if indeterminate, Western blot or other assay confirming
             that the serostatus does not reflect HIV infection.

          -  Negative Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) serology.

          -  Negative urine glucose by urinalysis (UA).

          -  ALT &lt;1.5 times upper limit of normal.

          -  Adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL; urine protein &lt;100
             mg/dL, or trace or negative proteinuria by UA, and an estimated creatinine clearance
             of &gt;55 mL/min. Renal function is measured to ensure that subjects could meet criteria
             for use of Vistide, should this be needed.

          -  Hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cell count (WBC) within normal
             limits for males and females.

          -  EKG and EEG (for those being tested) baseline readings within normal limits (these
             will be read at a central site).

          -  Willing to refrain from donating blood (other than study-related) throughout the study
             and for a period of at least 21 days (or until scab separation) after vaccination. In
             some cases, state laws are more restrictive.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for females at screening and within 2 days prior to
             vaccination.

          -  If the volunteer is female and of childbearing potential, she must agree to use
             effective birth control methods and not become pregnant during the course of the
             study. A female is considered to have childbearing potential unless post-menopausal or
             surgically sterilized. Effective birth control methods include licensed, approved
             hormonal methods such as pills, patch, injection, or implant.
