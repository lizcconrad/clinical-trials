      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses a drug that becomes active when it is exposed to a
      certain kind of light. When the drug is active, tumor cells are killed. Photodynamic therapy
      using silicon phthalocyanine 4 may be effective against skin cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of photodynamic
      therapy using silicon phthalocyanine 4 in treating patients with actinic keratosis, Bowen's
      disease, skin cancer, or stage I or stage II mycosis fungoides.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of photodynamic therapy using topically delivered
           silicon phthalocyanine 4 in patients with actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, squamous
           cell or basal cell skin cancer, or stage IA, IB, IIA, or IIB mycosis fungoides.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this therapy with emphasis on whether it induces
           photosensitivity in non-treated sites in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor mechanism of this therapy, by monitoring tissue changes via
           clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and other biochemical markers, in these
           patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the dose of this therapy that results in highest clearing
           rates in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive topical silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4). One hour later, patients undergo
      photodynamic therapy. Treatment repeats weekly for up to 3 weeks (up to 3 total treatments
      for the same lesion OR up to 3 lesions treated if multiple lesions are present).

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of Pc 4 and visible light until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1
      of 3 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity. Three additional patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for up to 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-45 patients will be accrued for this study.
