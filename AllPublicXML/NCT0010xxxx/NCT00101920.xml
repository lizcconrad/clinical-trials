    <textblock>
      Rationale: Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been observed in
      kidney, prostate, colon, lung, breast, and other cancers, and is often associated with a poor
      prognosis. TGFa and EGF, the ligands for EGFR, are also overexpressed in some of these tumor
      types, suggesting a self-propagating stimulus that may be responsible for rapid tumor growth.
      Blocking this stimulus by blocking activation of EGFR with ABX-EGF, a fully human monoclonal
      antibody against EGFR, may prevent tumor growth and perhaps shrink tumors. Purpose: This is a
      Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ABX-EGF in the treatment of
      advanced NSCLC following failure of paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy on treatment arm 1 of
      Immunex Protocol 054.0004 (Amgen Protocol 20025404), Part 2.
