    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the investigational
      ketoprofen patch with a controlled heating patch, compared to placebo (inactive substance)
      for the treatment of pain caused by osteoarthritis.

      Proof-of-concept study, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a transdermal
      ketoprofen patch with CHADD heat versus a placebo patch with dummy heat in patients with mild
      to moderate pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. After screening, patients
      discontinue all analgesic medication (except ≤325 mg aspirin daily for cardioprotective
      purposes). Patients selected a target knee (right or left), and all efficacy evaluations were
      completed with respect to this target knee. After discontinuing analgesics for at least 48
      hours, and when the average pain intensity over the previous 24 hours for the target knee was
      ≥40 mm using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to
      receive treatment with either the transdermal ketoprofen patch with CHADD heat or the placebo
      patch with dummy heat. Patients treated the target knee each night for 12 hours (± 1 hour)
      for 4 weeks. Patients returned to the study site every 7 days (± 1 day) for study
      evaluations. Throughout the study, patients were allowed to take up to 2000 mg acetaminophen
      per day as rescue medication; however, rescue medication was not allowed within the 48 hours
      prior to efficacy evaluations.
