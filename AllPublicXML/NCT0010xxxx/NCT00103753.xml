  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemia major is a genetic disorder affecting hemoglobin synthesis, rendering individuals
      dependent upon lifelong blood transfusions. Consequently, iron overload occurs and patients
      have shortened life expectancy with the most common cause of death being heart failure. This
      trial tests whether the combination of traditional therapy (deferoxamine) with a newer drug
      (deferiprone) will prove more effective in removing cardiac iron than deferoxamine alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemia Major (TM) is a hereditary anemia resulting from a single gene defect that
      results in abnormal red cell production. The survival of affected individuals is dependent
      upon lifelong blood transfusions. Unfortunately, this causes total body iron overload, and
      50% of the patients in the UK are dead by the age of 35. Approximately 70% of these deaths
      result from heart failure which results as a consequence of cardiac iron toxicity.

      A Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) technique (which exploits the fact that T2* signal
      decay relates to tissue iron) developed at the Royal Brompton Hospital provides a
      non-invasive and reproducible assessment of cardiac iron. CMR therefore provides a very
      useful method to assess response to new treatments in this condition. Using cardiac T2* as a
      primary endpoint, we will investigate whether the oral chelator, deferiprone in combination
      with traditional treatment (deferoxamine), is superior in removing cardiac iron as compared
      to deferoxamine alone. This trial will provide the first randomized controlled,
      double-blinded, evidence for the efficacy of combination treatment in TM.
