    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a contrast imaging agent
      ferumoxytol (ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite) in improving viewing tumors in
      patients with high-grade brain tumors or cancer that has spread to the brain. Diagnostic
      procedures, such as MRI, may help find and diagnose brain tumors and find out how far the
      disease has spread. The contrast imaging agent ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite
      consists of small iron particles taken by the blood stream to the brain and to the area of
      the tumor. It may help visualize the blood flow going through the tumor better than the
      standard substance gadolinium-based contrast agent.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Investigate the utility of ferumoxytol and gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) for
      improved imaging biomarkers of malignant brain tumors in a single imaging session by
      comparing dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) determined relative cerebral blood volume
      (rCBV) and dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) determined vascular permeability (derived
      transfer coefficient [Ktrans]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare and evaluate magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with ferumoxytol between
      different time points.

      II. Assess number and size of tumors imaged. III. Assess tumor vascularity. IV. Assess
      histology and electron microscopy (EM) on tissue samples. V. Assess differences in subjects
      with prior therapy versus (vs.) no prior therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapy).

      VI. Assess the long term imaging characteristics of different tumors using DSC and DCE.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ferumoxytol non-stoichiometric magnetite intravenously (IV) beginning
      approximately 15 seconds after start of 3T DSC-MRI and GBCA IV approximately 1 minute and 50
      seconds after start of 3T DCE-MRI on day 1. Patients also undergo MRI without contrast at
      baseline and on day 2. Imaging with ferumoxytol, GBCA, and without contrast repeats every 3
      weeks for a total of 6 more imaging sessions over up to 5 years.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at approximately 4-6 weeks.

    <description>To evaluate the value of rCBV for improved clinical management, overall survival times will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates and will compare patients with rCBV =&lt; 1.75 and those with rCBV &gt; 1.75 using the log-rank test. In addition, the Cox proportional hazard model will be used to estimate hazard ratios while adjusting for potential confounding variables if necessary. This analysis will be conducted for subjects of high-grade brain tumors, and other subjects separately.</description>
