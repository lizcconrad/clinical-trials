      Foot ulcers remain the most common reason for hospital admission among veterans with
      diabetes. Healing and preventing these wounds should be a high priority for clinicians
      treating these high-risk patients. Previous work by the investigators has suggested that
      diabetic foot ulcers are preceded by inflammation, which can potentially be detected with a
      thermometer.

      Background:

      Foot ulcers remain the most common reason for hospital admission among veterans with
      diabetes. Healing and preventing these wounds should be a high priority for clinicians
      treating these high-risk patients. Previous work by the investigators has suggested that
      diabetic foot ulcers are preceded by inflammation, which can potentially be detected with a
      thermometer.

      Objectives:

      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the utility of a novel personal dermal thermometry
      system to empower patients and caregivers and thereby reduce the risk for lower extremity
      ulceration and amputation in veterans at high risk for these complications.

      Methods:

      In this randomized clinical trial, 384 patients are being enrolled and assigned to either
      standard of care (SC) or SC plus a personal dermal thermometer (DT) to evaluate and log their
      plantar skin temperatures. All patients are given access to a 24 hour &quot;hot foot line&quot; to call
      for immediate access to care if they identify a hot spot (DT group) or a site of concern on
      standard self-evaluation (SC). All patients are assigned a sophisticated computerized
      activity monitor, which allows investigators access to time and magnitude of activity,
      downloaded at regular patient visits.

      Status:

      Project work is complete
