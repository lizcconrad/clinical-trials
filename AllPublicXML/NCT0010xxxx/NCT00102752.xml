      This study, TH-CR-301, is a Phase 1/2 study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      glufosfamide in combination with gemcitabine in advanced solid tumors or in first line
      treatment of pancreatic cancer.

      Study Hypothesis: Glufosfamide in combination with gemcitabine may provide benefits in
      survival to patients with advanced solid tumors or metastatic pancreatic cancer.
