    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when given
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and to see how well they work in treating women with
      breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Tipifarnib is a drug that binds to
      specific proteins on the tumor cells and then kills these cells. Gemcitabine hydrochloride is
      a chemotherapy drug that may kill tumor cells by preventing cells from dividing. Giving
      tipifarnib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response rate of the combination of gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride) and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib (R115777) in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To evaluate the duration of response, time to disease progression in patients with
      metastatic breast cancer treated with the combination of gemcitabine and tipifarnib
      (R115777).

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of tipifarnib followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive tipifarnib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
