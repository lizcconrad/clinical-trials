    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAHA administered every 12 hours for 14
           consecutive days followed by 7 days of rest during the first two cycles (i.e., first 6
           weeks) in patients with advanced multiple myeloma;

        -  To assess the safety and overall response rate to SAHA in patients with advanced
           multiple myeloma.
