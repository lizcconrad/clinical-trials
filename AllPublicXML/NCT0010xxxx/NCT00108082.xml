  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the effects of COREG MR (carvedilol modified release
      formulation) to atenolol on indices of left ventricular dimensions when added to standardized
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, and to the effect of ACE inhibition alone.
      Subjects with LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) and hypertension will be studied. The
      primary endpoint will be the change in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) characterized by
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) following 12 months of treatment. Secondary endpoints
      include the change in LV (left ventricular) mass, LV wall thickness, diastolic left
      ventricular filling parameters, and left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiographic
      methods at Treatment Month 12. Composite outcomes and individual event data will also be
      evaluated by treatment group.

    <measure>Model-adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular Mass Indexed (LVMI) by Body Surface Area as Measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12 (If Month 12 data were not available, the Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF] analysis, which includes data collected on or after Month 9 of treatment to Month 12 of treatment, was used)</time_frame>
    <description>LVMI was measured by MRI at Baseline and after 12 months of treatment/Month 12. A reduction in left ventricular mass, calculated as LVMI, of 5 g/m^2 was assumed to be clinically meaningful. Change in Baseline was calculated as Month 12 value (or value after 12 months of treatment) minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <measure>Model-adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular Mass Indexed by Height (LVMIH) as Measured by MRI at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12 (If Month 12 data were not available, the LOCF analysis, which includes data collected on or after Month 9 of treatment to Month 12 of treatment, was used)</time_frame>
    <description>LVMIH was measured by MRI at Baseline and after 12 months of treatment/Month 12. Change in Baseline was calculated as Month 12 value (or value after 12 months of treatment) minus the Baseline value. LV mass depends on body size. One method of determining whether an individual has LV hypertrophy relates LV mass to height raised to a power of 2.7.</description>

Change in Baseline was calculated as Month 12 value (or value after 12 months of treatment) minus the Baseline value. These filling parameters represent the volumes of blood filling the ventricle during the passive filling phase (E-volume) and the active filling phase caused by atrial contraction (A-volume).</description>

        <description>Plasma lipid concentrations (milligrams per deciliter) were measured at Baseline and after 12 months of treatment/Month 12.
