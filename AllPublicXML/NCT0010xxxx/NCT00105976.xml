    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to see if an experimental drug, called MM-093, is safe
      and effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. MM-093 is a genetically engineered
      version of a naturally occurring protein called alpha fetoprotein (AFP). Adults normally have
      very small amounts of AFP in their bloodstream. However, during pregnancy, AFP levels in both
      the mother and the fetus are much higher than normal. It has been observed that women with RA
      (Rheumatoid Arthritis) have fewer symptoms during pregnancy, particularly during the third
      trimester. At this time, the levels of AFP in the blood of the mother and fetus are the
      highest. This observation led researchers to begin examining AFP as a possible treatment for
      RA.
