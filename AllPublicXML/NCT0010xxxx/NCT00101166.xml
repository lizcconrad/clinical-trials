  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and/or bad) this new cancer
      vaccine has on the patient and their cancer, whether it is safe and whether it can help get
      rid of their cancer (malignant melanoma). We want to check how the patient's immune system
      reacts, both before and after the vaccine treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine will be made by mixing two kinds of cells: 1) some of the patient's own malignant
      melanoma cells which were removed by surgery and then processed in the Cell Therapy
      Laboratory, and 2) experimental &quot;bystander&quot; cells. All the cells in the vaccine will be
      treated with high-dose X-rays to make sure that none of them grow and cause more cancer. The
      bystander cells, called &quot;GM.CD40L&quot;, are human cells that have been genetically changed. The
      original cells, called K562, had the genes for human GM-CSF and CD40L inserted into them.
      These changes are designed to help boost the patient's immune system to better fight the
      cancer in their body.

          <description>Response and progression were evaluated using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>
