  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase III, randomized, active-controlled trial to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of rhuMAb VEGF (Avastin) added to the standard first-line chemotherapy
      used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. This trial will enroll approximately 900 subjects
      with histologically confirmed, previously untreated, bi-dimensionally measurable metastatic
      colorectal cancer.

             warfarin, international normalized ratio [INR] of &lt;1.5; appropriate use of heparin
             should be discussed with the Medical Monitor)

          -  Chronic, daily treatment with aspirin (&gt;325 mg/day) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory

          -  Current or recent (within the 28 days prior to Day 0) participation in another
             experimental drug study

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension,

             *INR of &gt;=1.5; *Total bilirubin of &gt;1.6 mg/dL; *AST or ALT &gt;=5 times upper limit of
             normal for subjects with documented liver metastases (&gt;2.5 times the upper limit of
             normal for subjects without evidence of liver metastases); *Serum creatinine of &gt;2.0
             mg/dL; *Hemoglobin of &lt;9 gm/dL (may be transfused to maintain or exceed this level)

          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation of
             the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from treatment
             complications
