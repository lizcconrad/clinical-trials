  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, inpatient study followed by an outpatient,
      placebo-controlled, multiple-IV injection evaluation of the safety and tolerability of
      PPI-1019 in subjects with mild-moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The primary objective of
      the study is to assess the safety of multiple IV injections of PPI-1019 in subjects with
      mild-moderate Alzheimer’s disease.

             criteria for Alzheimer’s disease and meet National Institute of Neurological and
             Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders
             Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) criteria for the presence of probable Alzheimer’s disease.

          -  Subject’s severity of Alzheimer’s disease must be mild-moderate, documented with a
             Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score of 12-26.

          -  Subject has a computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
             within the prior 12 months which is compatible with a diagnosis of probable AD.

          -  If a subject is being treated for Alzheimer’s disease, it must be with a single
             cholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine), with or without
             memantine, and with a dose which has been stable for at least 3 months prior to
             dosing.

          -  Subject performance status is ≤ 3 on items 1 through 5 and ≤ 2 on item 6 from the
             Degree of Disability Section of the “Rapid Disability Scale-2”

          -  Subject agrees not to donate blood or blood products while participating in this study
             and for at least 60 days after discontinuing from the study.

          -  Subject has a history compatible with vascular dementia as evidenced by a score of 5
             or greater on the modified Hachinski Ischemia Scale.

          -  Subject has evidence of clinically significant unstable cardiovascular, renal,
             hepatic, gastrointestinal, neurological, or metabolic disease within the past 6 months
             (as determined by medical history, ECG results, chest x-ray, or physical examination).

          -  Subject performance status is &gt; 3 on items 1 through 5 and &gt; 2 on item 6 from the
             Degree of Disability Section of the “Rapid Disability Scale-2.”

          -  Subject is being treated with anticholinergics and/or clinically relevant cytochrome
             P450 3A4 inducers/inhibitors. The use of other concomitant medications for stable
             medical conditions is acceptable provided drug and dosage are stable for at least 4
             weeks prior to dosing.

          -  Subject is currently taking herbal supplements which interfere with drug metabolism,
             e.g. St. John’s wort, ginkgo biloba.
