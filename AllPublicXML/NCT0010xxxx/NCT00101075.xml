    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out how effective oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine are against advanced cancer of the salivary gland. The safety of this treatment
      as well as how long the cancer responds or stays in a stable state due to the treatment will
      also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of two investigational agents called oxaliplatin and capecitabine.

      Investigational agents have not received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the
      way they are being used in this study. This means an investigation drug is still under study
      to determine what a safe dose is, what the side effects are and whether or not it is
      effective in the disease or condition being studied.

      Oxaliplatin and capecitabine are chemotherapy agents that have been approved by the FDA for
      use in other cancers.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologic diagnosis of any of the following malignancies originating from salivary
             tissue: adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma,
             malignant mixed tumor, polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated
             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma.

          -  Patients must be incurable on the basis of unresectable local or distant disease as
             determined by the patient's surgeon and not be potentially curable by radiation
             therapy as determined by a radiation oncologist.

          -  Patients may have received radiation to any site with the following caveat: the sites
             used for evaluation for response are either not previously irradiated or they have
             shown progression of disease post radiation and there has been a time interval of one
             month since these sites were radiated.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of less than 3.

          -  Patients must have at least uni-dimensionally measurable disease documented within one
             month of initiation of treatment. Measurement may be by physical exam or
             radiologically. Attempts should be made to photo document all tumor sites assessed by
             physical examination with a metric ruler within the photo for measurement
             confirmation.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to go through the process of informed consent.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy exceeding 3 months.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years old.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function as defined by the following tests to be
             performed within 14 days of therapy initiation:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1999 cells x 10 6/L

               -  Platelet count &gt; 99,999 cells x 10 6/L

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;8.5 gm/di or HCT &gt; 25%

               -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limits of normal (ULN) or creatinine
                  clearance measured by 24 hour urine collection as at least 50% of institutional
                  lower limit of normal.

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;2 x institutional ULN

               -  AST (SGOT) &lt;2 x institutional ULN*

                    -  * If from documented liver involvement with cancer, may be up to &lt; 5 x
                       institutional ULN Alkaline Phosphatase &lt; 5 x institutional ULN #

                    -  # If from documented bone or liver involvement with cancer, no upper limit
                       restriction.

             cancer. Previous immunologic, hormonal, homeopathic, natural, or alternative medicine
             therapies are acceptable provided treatment ended greater than 28 days prior to
             protocol therapy. Patients may have received chemotherapy given concomitantly with
             radiation therapy in an adjuvant setting with curative intent.

          -  Patients must not receive any form (including radiotherapeutic, immunologic,
             hormonal,homeopathic, natural, or alternative medicine) of anti-neoplastic therapy
             other than XELOX while participating in this study.

          -  Patients must not have a history of any invasive neoplasm within three years of trial
             entry, excepting curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical cancer.

          -  Pregnant and breast feeding women are not eligible for this study. No pregnancy test
             is required. Women of childbearing potential must be counseled on the use of effective
