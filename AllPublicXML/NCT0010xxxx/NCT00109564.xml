  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ispronicline
      (TC-1734-112) compared to placebo (inactive substance pill) in patients with age associated
      memory impairment (AAMI). AAMI is characterized as cognitive impairment including memory loss
      and poor concentration associated with aging.
