          <description>The Sitagliptin 100 mg q.d.

Note: In this double-blind, double-dummy study, randomized patients in the base study received a total of 7 tablets (active or placebo) per day administered in the specified tablet images as follows: sitagliptin 50 mg 2 tablets in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening, metformin 500 mg 2 tablets b.i.d. (b.i.d. = twice daily). In the extension study, patients received a total of 7 tablets (active or placebo) per day. Tablets in the image of sitagliptin (active or placebo) were administered as sitagliptin 100 mg 1 tablet in the morning and sitagliptin 50 mg 1 tablet b.i.d.

          <title>Sitagliptin 50 mg b.i.d + Metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. OLC</title>
          <description>The Sitagliptin 50 mg b.i.d + Metformin 1000 mg b.i.d. (b.i.d. = twice daily) OLC (Open-label Cohort) includes data from non-randomized patients assigned to receive treatment with open-label, oral tablets of sitagliptin and metformin. Treatment was co-administered as sitagliptin 50 mg q.d. (q.d. = once daily) and metformin 500 mg q.d. beginning on Day 1. The dose of sitagliptin was increased after 1-week to 50 mg b.i.d and the dose of metformin was increased over 4 weeks by increments of 500 mg per week to 1000 mg b.i.d. Patients continued to take open-label sitagliptin 50 mg b.i.d. and metformin 1000 mg b.i.d for the remainder of the Phase A treatment period of up to 24 weeks. Results presented for the OLC are through Week 24. Patients in the OLC completed the study at Week 24.</description>

Note: In this double-blind, double-dummy study, randomized patients in the base study received a total of 7 tablets (active or placebo) per day administered in the specified tablet images as follows: sitagliptin 50 mg 2 tablets in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening, metformin 500 mg 2 tablets b.i.d. (b.i.d. = twice daily). In the extension study, patients received a total of 7 tablets (active or placebo) per day. Tablets in the image of sitagliptin (active or placebo) were administered as sitagliptin 100 mg 1 tablet in the morning and sitagliptin 50 mg 1 tablet b.i.d. Metformin administration occurred in the same manner as specified in the base study.</description>

Note: In this double-blind, double-dummy study, randomized patients in the base study received a total of 7 tablets (active or placebo) per day administered in the specified tablet images as follows: sitagliptin 50 mg 2 tablets in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening, metformin 500 mg 2 tablets b.i.d. (b.i.d. = twice daily). In the extension study, patients received a total of 7 tablets (active or placebo) per day. Tablets in the image of sitagliptin (active or placebo) were administered as sitagliptin 100 mg 1 tablet in the morning and sitagliptin 50 mg 1 tablet b.i.d.

          <description>The Sitagliptin 100 mg q.d. (q.d. = once daily) group includes data from patients randomized to receive treatment with two 50 mg oral tablets of sitagliptin once daily for up to 104 weeks (including the 54-week base study [24-week, placebo-controlled Phase A and 30-week, active-controlled Phase B] and 50-week extension study). Note: In this double-blind, double-dummy study, randomized patients in the base study received a total of 7 tablets (active or placebo) per day administered in the specified tablet images as follows: sitagliptin 50 mg 2 tablets in the morning and 1 tablet in the evening, metformin 500 mg 2 tablets b.i.d. (b.i.d. = twice daily). In the extension study, patients received a total of 7 tablets (active or placebo) per day. Tablets in the image of sitagliptin (active or placebo) were administered as sitagliptin 100 mg 1 tablet in the morning and sitagliptin 50 mg 1 tablet b.i.d. Metformin administration occurred in the same manner as specified in the base study.</description>
