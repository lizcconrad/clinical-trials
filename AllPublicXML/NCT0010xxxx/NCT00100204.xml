      This study will examine saliva samples from healthy volunteers and patients with various
      diseases to learn more about how disease affects the mouth and salivary glands. It will use a
      method called salivary proteomics to identify multiple proteins in saliva and discover if
      there are protein patterns unique to specific diseases. The study will:

        -  Characterize the salivary proteome in patients with Sjogren's syndrome,
           graft-versus-host disease, diabetes, sarcoidosis, cystinosis, dental caries, and
           immunodeficiencies and in patients who have had head and neck radiation

        -  Evaluate the possible use of salivary proteomics for early diagnosis

        -  Evaluate the potential use of salivary proteomics for prognosis and treatment

      Patients participating in NIH clinical studies who have Sjogren's syndrome, graft-versus-host
      disease, diabetes, sarcoidosis, cystinosis, dental caries, or an immunodeficiency, or
      patients undergoing head and neck radiation may be eligible for this study. Candidates are
      screened with a medical and dental history, head and neck examination, and photographs of any
      mouth sores or disease. Healthy volunteers also have blood drawn for routine laboratory
      testing.

      Participants have saliva collected from the floor of the mouth, the parotid salivary glands
      in the cheek, and the submandibular and sublingual salivary glands under the tongue. Patients
      with certain diseases also provide a urine sample. Saliva samples are collected as follows:

        -  One time from healthy volunteers and patients with Sjogren's syndrome, diabetes,
           sarcoidosis, cystinosis and immunodeficiencies

        -  Five times from patients undergoing stem cell transplant: at baseline before transplant
           and about 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after transplant.

        -  Three times from patients undergoing head and neck radiation: at baseline before
           radiation and at 3 and 6 months after the conclusion of radiation.

      The diagnostic potential of the proteomic methods has been explored by several groups in
      recent years. Saliva contains many proteins, some of which are altered in various disease
      states. In this study, saliva is to be sampled in patients with head and neck radiation,
      diabetes, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, Sjogren's syndrome, cystinuria, methylmalonic
      acidemia and other conditions. Various novel analytical and data-processing tools will be
      used to infer characteristic salivary protein and salivary analyte signatures of these
      disorders. In some cases, these data will be evaluated with data for the oral flora present
      in the saliva and plaque of these patient groups and relate the presence and levels of
      particular bacteria to the proteomic profile.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Male and female subjects of all ages and racial groups will be included. The
                  lower age limit will be determined by the ability to cooperate with saliva
                  collection methods: i.e. 6 months to 100 years old.

               2. Patients will be recruited from current NIH Clinical Center pools or the outside
                  community. Patients must be diagnosed with cystinosis, sarcoidosis, head and neck
                  cancer, Sjogren's syndrome or diabetes by their institute physician. Controls
                  will be recruited from various NIH populations who are generally healthy and
                  without one of the diseases listed above or through the NIH Healthy Volunteer
                  Program.

               3. Patients with both benign and malignant disease undergoing bone marrow transplant
                  or hematopoeitic stem cell transplant will be eligible. Among patients with
                  malignant disease both solid tumors and leukemias will be included. Patients who
                  can be diagnosed unequivocally with GVHD via biopsy of the affected organ system
                  will be included in the disease group. Patients will be included in control group
                  when GVHD can be reliably excluded.

               4. For caries studies, we will examine salivary samples already collected from a
                  large twin cohort study in Brazil. These samples were collected from twins and
                  their siblings as part of a study of early childhood caries. Results from that
                  study suggest that genetics has a role in the development of caries. Whole
                  salivary samples have been collected and frozen for further analysis. These
                  samples will be examined for differences in salivary proteins which may be
                  associated with the development of early childhood caries. Samples are coded with
                  a unique numerical identifier with clinical diagnosis for caries, as well as
                  subject age, gender and ethnicity. No other patient information is linked to this
                  identifier to ensure patient confidentiality.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients receiving autologous HCT or peripheral stem cell transplants.

          2. Patients unable to cooperate with saliva collection.

          3. Controls with a medical history or laboratory findings consistent with Sjogren's
             syndrome, sarcoidosis, diabetes, or generally poor health, or controls taking
             medications known to alter salivary protein profiles.
