  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CG53135-05, a recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-20 (rhFGF-20) protein, is under
      investigation for the prevention of oral mucositis. Oral mucositis is a commonly occurring
      side effect of high-dose chemotherapy in patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem
      cell transplant. The objective of this Phase II trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of CG53135-05 when administered as a single dose to patients at risk for developing oral
      mucositis.
