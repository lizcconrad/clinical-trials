      RATIONALE: Screening tests, such as sputum cytology, may help doctors find tumor cells early
      and plan better treatment for lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well sputum cytology works in screening heavy
      smokers for lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Classify annual sputum samples cytologically in participants with or without airflow
           obstruction and a heavy smoking history.

        -  Correlate sputum cytological atypia (moderate atypia or worse) with lung cancer
           incidence in these participants.

        -  Correlate changes in sputum cytology (i.e., changes toward higher grades of atypia) with
           lung cancer incidence in these participants.

      Secondary

        -  Determine other risk factors for lung cancer (e.g., diet, family history, smoking
           history, and medications) that may either confound or modify the association between
           sputum cytology and lung cancer risk in these participants.

      OUTLINE: Two 3-day pooled sputum samples are collected for 6 consecutive days from
      participants by the spontaneous cough technique for cytopathological evaluation. Participants
      also complete a risk factor questionnaire and undergo a pulmonary function test by spirometry
      and a blood draw.

      Participants complete a questionnaire updating smoking, vital, and lung cancer status and
      undergo sputum sample collection annually.

      Participants are informed of sputum cytology results.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3,400 participants (2,900 with airflow obstruction and 500
      without airflow obstruction) will be accrued for this study.
