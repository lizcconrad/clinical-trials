      <restrictive_agreement>Merck agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing.

    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to a 3:1 randomization of MK-0518 to placebo and more discontinuations for placebo in the doubleblind phase, exposure for MK-0518 and placebo differs significantly with follow-up times of 336.3 and 39.7 patient-years, respectively.</limitations_and_caveats>
