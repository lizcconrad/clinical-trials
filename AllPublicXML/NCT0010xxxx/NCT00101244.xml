  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of SB-715992 in treating
      patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as SB-715992, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of SB-715992 administered as a 1-hr intravenous
      infusion on days 1-3 of a 21-day cycle in patients with solid tumors.

      II. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      SB-715992 for this administration schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe clinical response of SB-715992 given days 1-3, every 21-days. II. To
      characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SB-715992 for this administration schedule.

      III. To explore drug metabolism, molecular and cellular predictors of efficacy (biomarkers)
      and toxicity and drug interaction potential.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive SB-715992 IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SB-715992 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 additional patients are treated at
      the MTD

      Patients are followed for 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-19
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
             unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or
             are no longer effective; patients with solid hematologic malignancies (Hodgkin's and
             non-Hodgkin's lymphomas) may be included as long as a bone marrow has been performed
             within 6 weeks of enrollment

          -  Prior chemotherapy is allowed; patients may not have received chemotherapy for 4 weeks
             prior to the initiation of study treatment and must have full recovery from the acute
             effects of any prior chemotherapy; patients must not have had nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C for 6 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed; patients must have completed radiation at least 4
             weeks prior to initiation of study treatment; patients who have received prior
             radiation to 50% or more of their total marrow volume will be excluded

          -  Prior treatment with EGFR inhibitors is allowed; prior experimental therapies (non
             FDA-approved agents) and immunotherapies are allowed; patients may not have received
             these therapies for 4 weeks prior to the initiation of study treatment and must have a
             full recovery from the acute effects of these therapies

          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 12 weeks

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL

             levels above institutional normal

          -  The effects of SB-715992 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason
             and because mitotic inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from acute AEs due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not receive any other anti-cancer therapy (cytotoxic, biologic,
             radiation, or hormonal other than for replacement) while on this study except for
             medications that are prescribed for supportive care but potentially may have
             anticancer effect (i.e. megestrol acetate, bisphosphonates); these medications must
             have been started 1 month prior to enrollment on study; in addition, men receiving
             treatment for prostate cancer will be maintained at castrate levels of testosterone by
             continuation of luteinizing- releasing hormone agonists

          -  Prohibited medications: SB-715992 is a moderate to significant in vitro inhibitor of
             CYP3A4; the following lists of medications/substances are moderate to significant
             inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 that, if administered concomitantly with SB-715992, may
             alter study drug exposure; the use of these medications/substances within 14 days (&gt;=
             6 months for amiodarone) prior to the administration of the first dose of SB-715992
             through discontinuation from the study is prohibited;

               -  Inhibitors of CYP3A4

                    -  Antibiotics: clarithromycin, erythromycin, troleandomycin

                    -  Antifungals: itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole (doses &gt; 200 mg/day),
                       voriconazole

                    -  Antidepressants: nefazodone, fluovoxamine

                    -  Calcium channel blockers: verapamil, diltiazem

                    -  Bitter Orange

                    -  Miscellaneous: amiodarone*, grapefruit juice**; *use of amiodarone within 6
                       months prior to the administration of the first dose of SB-715992 is
                       prohibited; ** use of grapefruit juice within 7 days prior to administration
                       of the first dose of SB-715992 is prohibited

               -  Inducers of CYP3A4

                    -  Anticonvulsants: phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital

                    -  Antibiotics: rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine

                    -  Miscellaneous: St. John's wort, modafinil, oxcarbazepine

          -  Patients with known, symptomatic or untreated brain metastases should be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SB-715992 is a mitotic inhibitor
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with SB-715992, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with SB-715992

          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; therefore, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with SB-715992; appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Patients are ineligible for participation in the Drug Interaction study, or can be
             deemed to be ineligible to receive certain drug probes, if they have:

               -  Sensitivity to sulfa drugs or adverse reactions to sulfonylureas

               -  Concurrent antifungal medications, or within the past 4 weeks

               -  Diabetes or other glucose imbalance

               -  Acidosis

               -  Concurrent alcohol use (based on the discretion of treating physician)

               -  Concurrent phenytoin or diazepam treatment, or within the past 4 weeks

               -  Previous intolerance to benzodiazepam therapies

               -  A patient maybe excluded from all or a portion of the Drug Interaction study
                  based on the medical discretion of the investigator

               -  EVEN THOUGH PATIENTS MAY BE INELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DRUG INTERACTION
                  STUDY, THEY CAN STILL PARTICIPATE IN THE PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL
