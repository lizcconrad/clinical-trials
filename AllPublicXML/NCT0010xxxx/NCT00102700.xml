      This is a single-arm, non-randomized study of ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine in
      adult patients with treatment-naïve, unresectable, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The
      study objectives are:

      Primary Objective:

        -  Assess the overall response rate (ORR) of patients treated with ARQ 501 in combination
           with gemcitabine.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Determine time to tumor progression (TTP) of patients treated with ARQ 501 in
           combination with gemcitabine

        -  Further characterize the safety of ARQ 501 in combination with gemcitabine

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable, metastatic pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma

          -  Be treatment-naïve.

          -  Have measurable disease per RECIST Criteria.

          -  Be ≥18 years old.

          -  Have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of ≥70%.

          -  Have an estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.

          -  Be male or a non-pregnant, non-lactating female patient. Patients who are fertile
             agree to use an effective barrier method of birth control (e.g., latex condom,
             diaphragm, or cervical cap) to avoid pregnancy.

          -  Have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug (if patient is a female of childbearing potential).

          -  Sign a written informed consent form.

          -  Have adequate organ function as indicated by acceptable laboratory values obtained
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received any prior therapy for the treatment of their pancreatic malignancy
             (including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, major
             surgery, or irradiation, whether conventional or investigational).

          -  Have an active, uncontrolled systemic infection considered opportunistic, life
             threatening or clinically significant at the time of treatment.

          -  Are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Have a psychiatric disorder(s) that would interfere with consent, study participation,
             or follow-up.

          -  Have any other severe concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

          -  Have symptomatic or untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases.

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to gemcitabine.
