  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a certain medication, alone or combined with
      another medication, will increase muscle activity in the upper airway in people who do and
      people who do not have sleep apnea. The medications being studied are paroxetine, a commonly
      used antidepressant, and 5 hydroxy-tryptophan (5HTP), which also can be used as a dietary
      supplement without a prescription. Because the effects of paroxetine in previous studies were
      not very large, we will also study it combined with 5HTP to see if the effect on the upper
      airway muscles is greater.
