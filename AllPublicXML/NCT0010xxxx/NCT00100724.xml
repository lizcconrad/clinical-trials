        In addition to the conditions listed above, the following may qualify as a reason to
        exclude a volunteer from the study: fever along with moderate or serious illness within 3
        days of vaccination or any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would render
        vaccination unsafe or would interfere with the study evaluations. Pending resolution of
        these symptoms, a volunteer may be reconsidered for vaccination.
