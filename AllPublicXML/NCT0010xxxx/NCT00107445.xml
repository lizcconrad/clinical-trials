  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well EF5 works in finding oxygen in tumor cells of
      patients who are undergoing surgery or biopsy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian
      epithelial cancer. Diagnostic procedures using the drug EF5 to find oxygen in tumor cells may
      help in planning cancer treatment

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate the level of EF5 binding with pre-treatment hemoglobin level and tumor grade and
      stage in patients undergoing surgery or biopsy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian
      epithelial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate pre-treatment tumor hypoxia (as measured by EF5 binding) with time to
      progression and time to recurrence in these patients.

      II. Correlate EF5 binding with CD-31 expression (tumor vasculature), Ki-67 expression
      (cellular proliferation), and erythropoietin signaling in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive EF5 IV over 1-2½ hours on day 1. Approximately 1-2 days later, patients
      undergo tumor resection or biopsy. Patients' tumor tissue samples undergo
      immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry to detect EF5 binding levels. Patients' blood is
      drawn immediately before and 30-60 minutes and 1-2 days after receiving EF5 to measure
      systemic EF5 binding levels.

      Patients are followed at 30-45 days after administration of EF5 and then every 3-6 months
      thereafter.
