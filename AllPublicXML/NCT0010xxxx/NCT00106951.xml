      To investigate the role of racial and socioeconomic disparities in coronary heart disease
      (CHD) mortality in the United States.

      BACKGROUND:

      Despite strong decreases in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality over past decades, there
      is evidence that racial and socioeconomic disparities in CHD mortality are increasing. CHD
      surveillance efforts that examine trends within these population subgroups are an important
      first step in quantifying and reducing disparities. The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
      (ARIC) Study has monitored rates and trends in validated hospitalized myocardial infarction
      and fatal CHD among black and white adults aged 35 to 74 years in four U.S. communities since
      1989.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study will expand the scope of ARIC surveillance by examining variations in the rates and
      temporal trends in CHD by socioeconomic status (SES), measured at the level of census tract.
      For CHD events already included in ARIC surveillance (1992-2002), addresses will be obtained
      from medical records and death certificates and geocoded so that they can be matched with
      identifiers for census based geographical areas. The ARIC study will contribute yearly
      updates of abstracted CHD events and addresses for subsequent years (2003-2005). Each event
      will be linked with census tract level SES indicators available from the 1990 and 2000
      censuses. This novel effort will permit an examination of disparities by SES in rates and
      trends in fatal CHD, hospitalized myocardial infarction, case fatality, use of invasive
      cardiac procedures and prescription of efficacious medication at time of hospital discharge.
      In addition, the extent to which racial disparities in CHD and associated treatments are
      explained by SES will also be explored.
