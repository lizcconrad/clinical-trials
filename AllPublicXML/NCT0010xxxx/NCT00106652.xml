  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to understand how genes, environment, and the interplay between
      the two, influences the development of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The causes and contributing factors for autism are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that
      incidence is increasing, but diagnostic changes and improvements may be playing a role. Both
      genetic and environmental factors appear to play a role. Autopsy studies demonstrate
      structural changes in the brain and clinical investigations reveal neurophysiologic
      differences in information processing in autistic versus normal children. Members of our team
      recently demonstrated altered levels of certain neuropeptides at birth in children who later
      developed autism.

      This case-control study is the first large-scale epidemiologic investigation of underlying
      causes for autism and triggers of regression. This study capitalizes on the strengths of the
      case-control design, which is well suited to examine a broad array of factors for rare
      conditions that are thought to be multifactorial. Comparisons will be made with both general
      population controls and mentally retarded children.

      The aims are to assess the influence of exogenous exposures, the role of susceptibility
      factors, and the interplay between these two in the etiology of autism and its phenotypic
      variation. Chemicals with known or suspected neurodevelopmental toxicity, such as PCB's,
      certain pesticides, and metals, are being investigated. This study pursues several hypotheses
      that have recently gained attention, including the combined measles, mumps, rubella vaccine
      and mercury present in vaccines given during infancy and early childhood. Additionally,
      biochemical susceptibility is examined through characterization of metabolic, immunologic,
      and neuronal gene expression profiles and genetic polymorphisms.
