      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such
      as goserelin, leuprolide, flutamide, or bicalutamide, may stop the adrenal glands from making
      androgens. Giving bortezomib with hormone therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib with or without hormone
      therapy works in treating patients with relapsed prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse after an observed rise in
           testosterone after combination treatment with hormone blockade and bortezomib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in combination with combined androgen blockade therapy
           in these patients.

        -  Determine the disease-free interval in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine time to tsetosterone rise in patients treated wtih this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive androgen blockade therapy comprising a 3-month subcutaneous injection of
      goserelin OR leuprolide OR other FDA-approved method of primary androgen suppression AND oral
      flutamide or bicalutamide once daily for 3 months. Patients also receive bortezomib IV over
      3-5 seconds on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment with bortezomib repeats every 28 days for 3
      courses. Patients achieving a CR discontinue treatment and are observed for PSA or metastatic
      disease recurrence. Patients with a PR or stable disease receive additional combined androgen
      blockade therapy and 3 additional courses of bortezomib as above. Patients with progressive
      disease are removed from the study.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-42 patients will be accrued for this study.
