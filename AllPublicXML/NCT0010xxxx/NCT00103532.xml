  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Risk behaviors and their associated adverse health outcomes are becoming increasingly
      problematic among HIV-infected youth. This study is being conducted to test whether a brief
      motivational enhancement (ME) intervention will help reduce health risk behaviors (drug and
      alcohol use, sexual risk behavior, poor adherence to medications) among HIV+ youth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy Choices is a randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of motivational
      enhancement in reducing risk and promoting healthy behaviors. This study will use a sample of
      225 youth (180 after attrition), ages 16-24, of whom 90 will receive the intervention,
      referral, and standard care, and 90 will receive referral plus standard care. The sample will
      be drawn from five study sites. Using parallel screening, recruitment will target 100 youth
      with an adherence problem, 100 youth with a substance use problem, and 25 youth with a sexual
      risk problem. A repeated measures design will be used for the proposed study. Primary outcome
      measures are drug and alcohol use, condom use, and HIV medication adherence. Youth will
      complete an initial data collection session (baseline) during which questionnaire and
      interview measures will be administered. Blood specimens for viral load and CD4+ count will
      also be obtained.

      Randomization procedures will take place after completion of the baseline assessment.
      Participants who are randomized to the intervention group will participate in four sessions
      for approximately 3 months and will also receive standard care plus individualized referrals.
      The control group will receive standard care and individualized referrals. All five sites
      offer comprehensive, multidisciplinary care including social work and case management
      services and access to mental health services. Participants will receive a three-month
      post-test designed to coincide with ME completion. Subsequent post-tests will occur at 6, 9,
      12, and 15 months after baseline data collection (3, 6, 9, and 12 months after ME
      completion).
