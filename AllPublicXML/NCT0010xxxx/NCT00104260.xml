  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the degree and frequency of response to Phenoptin™
      (sapropterin dihydrochloride), as demonstrated by a reduction in blood phenylalanine (Phe)
      level among subjects with phenylketonuria (PKU) who have elevated Phe levels. A secondary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of Phenoptin™ treatment in this subject
      population, and identify individuals in this subject population who respond to Phenoptin™
      treatment with a reduction in blood Phe level.
