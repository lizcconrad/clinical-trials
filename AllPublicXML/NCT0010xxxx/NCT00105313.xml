  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For primary objectives, we will determine the MTD and examine clinical responses and immune
      cell populations to determine an OBD, and describe the safety and tolerability of MEDI-507.

      For the secondary objectives we will look at the antitumor activity of MEDI 507, PK, serum
      concentrations, and immunogenicity of MEDI-507, as well as time courses of depletion and
      recovery of CD2 positive and total T-Cell populations.

  <why_stopped>
    After review of safety events and have decided that further dose escalation of MEDI-507 as a
    single agent is not feasible.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Individuals may be eligible for this study if they are 18 years of age or older and:

          -  Have one of the following types of T-Cell Lymphoproliferative disorders such as
             Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL), Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PCTL), Large Cell
             Lymphoma (LGL), or Adult T-cell Lymphoma (ATL). Patients should have disease that is
             resistant or refractory to the front-line therapy, except ATL patients for whom there
             is no standard therapy.

          -  At least 30% of tumor cells must be CD2 positive.

          -  Karnofsky Performance status of greater than or equal to 70% (able to care for
             themselves; but unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work).

          -  At least 3 weeks must have passed since prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy,
             prolonged or cytolytic steroid therapy or major surgery, and all treatment-related
             toxicities must have resolved prior to the first MEDI-507 administration (except
             thrombocytopenia).

          -  Have no prior treatment with MEDI-507.
