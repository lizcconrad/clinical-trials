      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the residual allergenicity of Tree MATA (modified
      pollen allergen tyrosine adsorbate) by skin prick testing. This is done by a comparison of
      the wheal response after skin prick testing with aqueous native and modified allergen,
      modified tyrosine adsorbed allergen and Tree MATA MPL (modified tyrosine adsorbed + MPL
      [Monophosphoryl Lipid A]).

      Tree MATA MPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients
      with proven type I hypersensitivity to cross reacting tree pollens. MPL (Monophosphoryl Lipid
      A), a purified, detoxified glycolipid derived from the cell wall of Salmonella minnesota, is
      included in the product formulation as an adjuvant to increase the immunogenic effect of the
      product and to enhance the switch from an allergen-specific TH2 to a TH1-like profile.

      The tree pollen extract is modified with glutaraldehyde to produce the active ingredient, an
      allergoid. This modification reduces the reactivity of the extract with IgE antibody, thus
      reducing the risk of side effects. However, a simultaneous reduction in other important
      immunological properties, such as IgG and T cell reactivities is not seen.

      The purpose of this study is to assess residual allergenicity of the modified tree pollen in
      Tree MATA MPL using skin prick testing.

          -  The subject must demonstrate a negative skin prick test to negative control

          -  The subject must demonstrate a specific IgE for Birch, Hazel and Alder as documented
             by a RAST (radioallergosorbent test), or equivalent test
