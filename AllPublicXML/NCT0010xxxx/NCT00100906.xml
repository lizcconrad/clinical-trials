      RATIONALE: Tretinoin may help cells that are involved in the body's immune response to work
      better. Interleukin-2 may stimulate the white blood cells to kill kidney cancer cells. Giving
      tretinoin together with interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving three different doses of
      tretinoin together with interleukin-2 works in treating patients with stage IV kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the ratio of dendritic cells (DC) to circulating immature cells (ImC) before
           and after treatment with 3 different doses of tretinoin in patients with stage IV renal
           cell cancer.

        -  Assess in vitro immune response assays to tetanus toxoid and influenza virus peptide
           before and after treatment with tretinoin and interleukin-2 in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the frequency of treatment-related side effects in these patients.

        -  Determine clinical objective response and progression-free survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Correlate DC:ImC ratio with clinical objective response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Correlate the extent of change of the DC:ImC ratio with tretinoin dose and tretinoin
           blood levels in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Specimens are stratified according to
      patient prognostic factors, tumor bulk, and extent of dendritic cell to circulating immature
      cell ratio derangement. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 tretinoin doses.

      Patients are followed for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-36 patients (9-12 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 2 years.

    <description>Patients were assigned to one of three ATRA dose levels, at a 1:1:1 ratio, using a randomly permuted list assignments, with the assignment generally being made on the initial day of treatment.
Week 1: One dose daily of IL-2 for 5 days followed by 2 days off.
Weeks 2-6: One dose daily of IL-2 for 5 days followed by 2 days off.
After the IL-2: 2-3 weeks rest, with no treatment. During this time a repeat physical exam, history and X-ray scans will be performed. If there has not been progression (worsening) of the patient's tumor, they will continue to a second 8-week treatment schedule.
This schedule will be the same as the first, unless the patients dose had to be reduced. If so, patient's will get that reduced dose. It consists of 1 week of ATRA, 1 week of rest, followed by 6 weeks of IL-2. The same blood tests are collected during that second cycle.</description>
