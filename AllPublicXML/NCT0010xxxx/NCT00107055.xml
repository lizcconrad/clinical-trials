    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain initial safety and efficacy data on the experimental
      agent REN-1654 in patients with pain that radiates down the leg(s), and is typical of
      sciatica (lumbosacral radiculopathy). These patients will usually have a herniated disc that
      is causing compression on the nerves coming out of the spinal column.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the
      efficacy and tolerability of REN-1654 in subjects with sciatica. After screening and baseline
      clinical assessments, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive REN 1654 100 mg or
      matching placebo, once daily for 3 weeks. Leg pain, back pain and other efficacy measures
      will be assessed at 1 and 3 weeks after initiation of treatment. A subset of patients will
      undergo analysis of blood levels of REN-1654 during the course of the study
      (pharmacokinetics). Subjects will discontinue treatment after 3 weeks and return after a
      further 3 weeks off therapy for a final clinical assessment 6 weeks after initiation of
      treatment. If a subject does not return for follow-up, an effort will be made by telephone to
      document their clinical status and whether other interventions have been made.

          -  Leg pain severity on a screening Categorical Pain Intensity Rating (for the prior 24
             hour period) of at least 4, using an 11-point categorical pain intensity scale with 0
             = no pain and 10 = worst pain imaginable.

             back pain.

          -  Positive straight leg raising (SLR) test as defined in Appendix B of this protocol.

          -  Subjects who are compliant in maintaining a Pain Diary between screening and baseline
             visits, and who record a 24-hour average Categorical Pain Intensity Rating score of at
             least 4 or greater on at least 3 days during the week prior to baseline visit.

          -  Subject who can maintain stable pharmacologic treatments for sciatica symptoms taken
             prior to dosing including analgesics, anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. NSAIDS),

             on stable doses of such medications for 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit, and
             maintained on the same doses throughout the study. Medications taken on an as-needed
             basis are permitted, and subjects will be asked to record daily usage of such
             medications in the subject diary.

          -  Subjects who at screening are receiving adjunctive analgesic therapy such as
             acupuncture or biofeedback should either discontinue it or establish a schedule of
             treatments that will remain consistent for 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit, and
             throughout the study.

          -  Subject with screening laboratory values within normal limits, or if abnormal must be
             considered not clinically significant and in the opinion of the Investigator not to

             neurological, endocrine (including diabetes), metabolic, pulmonary, immunological
             (including HIV infection) or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would pose a significant safety risk for a subject exposed to an
             investigational compound such as REN-1654.

          -  History of the following ophthalmic disorders based upon general medical review at the
             screening visit. Subjects will further undergo a screening ophthalmologic assessment.

             the subject will be excluded from the study.

               -  Symptomatic cataract, resulting in any visual impairment (if a subject has been
                  diagnosed with cataract to a degree that the cataract interferes with daily
