      The purposes of this study are: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of Gemcitabine and
      Platinol followed by Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine in patients with advanced or metastatic
      transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium; To determine the safety of Gemcitabine and
      Platinol followed by Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine and any side effects that might be associated
      with the combination of these drugs; To determine whether Gemcitabine and Platinol followed
      by Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine can help patients with advanced bladder cancer live longer; To
      determine whether Gemcitabine and Platinol followed by Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine can make
      your tumor smaller or disappear, and for how long.
