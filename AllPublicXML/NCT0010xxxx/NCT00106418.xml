    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of romidepsin (depsipeptide,FK228) in
      patients with metastatic prostate cancer who have developed a rising prostate specific
      antigen (PSA) while undergoing hormonal therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males ≥18 years;

          -  Written informed consent/authorization;

          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of metastatic prostate cancer with documented
             progression on hormonal therapy (objective progressive disease [PD], new bone lesions,
             or stable soft tissue or bone lesions with PSA increase);

          -  Patients must have either measurable disease or bone metastasis. Patients with
             measurable disease are preferred;

          -  Rising PSA, with a minimum study entry PSA of ≥5 ng/mL;

          -  Karnofsky performance status of ≥80%;

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;12 weeks;

          -  For patients treated with anti-androgens, elevation of PSA must be demonstrated after
             cessation of anti-androgen treatment;

          -  Three lines of hormonal therapy are permitted prior to study entry (anti-androgen
             withdrawal is not considered as a second hormonal treatment);

          -  Serum testosterone level of &lt;50 ng/mL in patients without surgical castration;

          -  Patients must have serum potassium levels &gt;4.0 mEq/L and serum magnesium levels &gt;2.0
             mg/dL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant use of any anti-cancer therapy, except for continued use of luteinizing
             hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or antiandrogens, or bisphosphonates or
             steroids initiated at least 4 weeks prior to study entry;

          -  Concomitant use of any investigational agent, including PC-SPES;

          -  Use of any investigational agent within 4 weeks of study entry;

          -  Concomitant use of warfarin (due to a potential drug-to-drug interaction with
             depsipeptide);

          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks of study entry;

          -  Prior treatment with chemotherapy;

          -  Patients with known cardiac abnormalities such as:

          -  Congenital long QT syndrome;

          -  QTc interval &gt; 480 milliseconds;

          -  Patients who have had a myocardial infarction within 12 months of study entry;

          -  Patients who have a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) e.g., angina Canadian
             Class II IV (see Appendix K). In any patient in whom there is doubt, the patient
             should have a stress imaging study and, if abnormal, angiography to define whether or
             not CAD is present;

          -  Patients with an ECG recorded at screening showing evidence of cardiac ischemia (ST
             depression of ≥2 mm). If in any doubt, the patient should have a stress imaging study
             and, if abnormal, angiography to define whether or not CAD is present;

          -  Patients with congestive heart failure that meets NYHA Class II to IV (see Appendix J)
             definitions and/or ejection fraction &lt;40% by MUGA scan or &lt;50% by echocardiogram
             and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);

          -  Patients with a history of sustained VT, VF, Torsade de Pointes, or cardiac arrest
             unless currently addressed with an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator
             (AICD);

          -  Patients with hypertrophic cardiomegaly or restrictive cardiomyopathy from prior
             treatment or other causes (in doubt, see ejection fraction criteria above);

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypertension i.e., ≥160/95;

          -  Patients with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring anti-arrhythmic medication;

          -  Concomitant use of medications which may cause a prolongation of QT/QTc (see Appendix
             D) interval;

          -  Concomitant use of medications that are inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme
             CYP 3A4 (see Appendix E);

          -  Clinically significant active infection;

          -  Known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;

          -  Previous extensive radiotherapy involving 30% of bone marrow (e.g., whole of pelvis,
             half of spine);

          -  Clinical or radiological imaging evidence of brain metastasis (computed tomography
             [CT] or MRI scans are required only if brain metastasis is suspected clinically);

          -  Inadequate bone marrow or other organ function, as evidenced by:

               -  hemoglobin &lt;9.0 g/dL (transfusions and/or erythropoietin are permitted);

               -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≤1.5 x 109 cells/L;

               -  platelet count &lt;100 x 109 cells/L;

               -  total bilirubin &gt;1.25 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for institution or &gt;2.0 x ULN
                  in the presence of demonstrable liver metastases;

               -  aspartate transaminase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST/SGOT) and
                  alanine transaminase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT/SGPT) &gt;2.0 x ULN or
                  &gt;5.0 x ULN in the presence of demonstrable liver metastases;

               -  serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL;

          -  Serum potassium levels &lt; 4.0 mEq/L and serum magnesium levels &lt;2.0 mg/dL;

          -  Coexistent second malignancy or history of prior malignancy within previous 5 years
             (excluding basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been treated
             curatively); or

          -  Any significant medical or psychiatric condition that might prevent the patient from
             complying with all study procedures.
