      This trial will assess the ability of shoe inserts to relieve pain and disability in people
      with knee osteoarthritis (OA) in the inner (medial) aspect of the knee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common joint disease in humans, is a significant cause of pain
      and disability. Its prevalence increases with age, leading to about 65-85% of those age 65
      years and older having OA. Involvement of the knee with OA is the main reason for significant
      functional impairment as it alters ambulation through pain and stiffness. Nonpharmacological
      management of knee OA includes the use of orthotic supports such as wedged insoles for varus
      or valgus knee deformities to relieve pain and improve function in the early stages of this
      joint disease. Although these interventions are desirable because they are simple and
      inexpensive, we do not have a clear understanding about their efficacy in relieving pain and
      disability in people with knee OA. We also do not know whether there is a relationship
      between changes in joint biomechanics that occur with wedged insoles and changes in function
      and progression of OA. Furthermore, information is lacking regarding which patients would
      benefit from wedged insoles. Answering these questions will be critically important in the
      development of guidelines for the prescription of wedged insoles in knee OA. Patients in this
      study will be evaluated at baseline and after wearing the lateral-wedged insoles immediately
      and after wearing the insoles for four weeks. The participants will wear lateral-wedged
      insoles for the painful knee(s) for as many hours and for as many days of the week as they
      can tolerate. Some subjects may use a neutral position insole for an asymptomatic knee.
