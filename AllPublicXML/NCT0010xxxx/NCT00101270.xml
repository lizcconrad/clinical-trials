    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of oxaliplatin when given
      together with irinotecan in treating young patients with refractory solid tumors or
      lymphomas. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin and irinotecan, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Oxaliplatin may help irinotecan kill more cancer cells by making cancer cells more
      sensitive to the drug. Giving oxaliplatin together with irinotecan may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin when administered with irinotecan in
      pediatric patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas.

      II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      II. Correlate UGT and BCRP genotype with the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 8 and irinotecan IV over 1 hour on
      days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 17 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
