    <description>Patients receive a single dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) IV over 30 minutes to 4 hours on day 0. Patients undergo radiation dosimetry following the first dose of ^131I-MIBG to determine if a second dose can be safely administered. Some patients may receive a second dose of iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) 6-8 weeks after the first dose if response is achieved and patients do not experience major toxicity. After blood radioactivity has fallen below 1 Î¼Ci/mL, patients may undergo autologous stem cell transplantation.
After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4-6 weeks after ^131I-MIBG administration and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria for NB:

          -  Patients must have the diagnosis of NB in accordance with the International Criteria,
             i.e., either histopathology (confirmed by the MSKCC Department of Pathology) or BM
             involvement plus elevated urinary catecholamines.

          -  Must have a history of tumor progression or recurrence or failure to achieve complete
             response with standard therapy.

          -  Patients must have MIBG-avid NB and evaluable disease on MIBG scan at time of
             enrollment on protocol

          -  Prior Therapy: At least 2 weeks should have elapsed since any biologic therapy. Three
             weeks should have elapsed since last dose of chemotherapy.

          -  Age &gt;1 year with a determination that radiation safety restrictions during therapy
             period can be implemented.

          -  Stem cells: Patients must have an autologous hematopoietic stem cell product
             cryopreserved and available for re-infusion after MIBG treatment. The minimum dose for
             peripheral blood stem cells is 2 X106 CD34+ cells/kg.

          -  Minimum life expectancy of eight weeks

          -  Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this
             program.

        Inclusion criteria for malignant CCT:

          -  Patients must have the diagnosis of malignant CCT i.e. malignant pheochromocytoma or
             malignant paraganglioma

          -  Patients must have MIBG-avid malignant CCT and evaluable disease on MIBG scan at time
             of enrollment on protocol

          -  Prior Therapy: At least 2 weeks should have elapsed since any biologic therapy. Three
             weeks should have elapsed since last dose of chemotherapy.

          -  Age between 1 and 21 years and able to cooperate with radiation safety restrictions
             during therapy period

          -  Stem cells: Patients must have an autologous hematopoietic stem cell product
             cryopreserved and available for re-infusion after MIBG treatment. The minimum dose for
             peripheral blood stem cells is 2 X106 CD34+ cells/kg.

          -  Minimum life expectancy of eight weeks.

          -  Signed informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of this
             program.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe major organ toxicity. Specifically, renal, cardiac, hepatic, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal and neurologic toxicity should all be grade 2 or less. A grade 3
             hearing deficit is acceptable.

          -  Active serious infections not controlled by antibiotics.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded for fear of danger to the fetus. Therefore negative
             pregnancy test is required for all women of child-bearing age, and appropriate
             contraception is used during the study period.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with radiation safety procedures or protocol
             requirements.
