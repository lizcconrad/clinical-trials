  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to test whether a memory and organizational aid in the form of a
      document that summarizes and simplifies a study's key points can improve the decision-making
      abilities and competency of mild to early moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients reveal substantial variation in
      their ability to participate in an informed consent process. No published data show
      techniques that help an AD patient to participate in an informed consent. This research will
      address this issue by performing a randomized trial to test whether a memory and
      organizational aid can improve the decision-making abilities and competency of AD patients.

      This study will recruit 80 patients with mild to early moderate AD, and 30 non-demented
      elderly persons. The informed consent protocol for a hypothetical early-phase drug trial will
      be administered by a trained interviewer in the patient's home. The AD patients will be
      randomized to receive either the standard informed consent process or the intervention of the
      standard informed consent process plus the memory and organizational aid. All non-demented
      elderly individuals will receive the standard informed consent process. The interviewer will
      administer the protocol to participants and ask questions that will assess participant
      capacity to understand, appreciate, reason, and make a choice concerning enrollment in the
      hypothetical study.
