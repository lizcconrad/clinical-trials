  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 3 arm study will compare the safety and efficacy, with respect to a reduction in signs
      and symptoms and prevention of joint damage, of tocilizumab versus placebo, both in
      combination with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid
      arthritis. Patients will be randomized to receive tocilizumab 4 mg/kg IV, tocilizumab 8 mg/kg
      IV or placebo IV, every 4 weeks. All patients will also receive methotrexate, 10-25 mg/week.
      The anticipated time on study treatment is 1-2 years and the target sample size is 500+
      individuals. After completion of the 2 year study participants could participate in the
      optional 3 year open label extension phase (year 3 to 5).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp-Genant Score at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographs were taken of each hand and foot at Baseline and Week 52 and evaluated at a central reading service by two independent radiologists using the Genant modified method according to Sharp. Erosion Score: A total of 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=Normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. Joint Narrowing Score: A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). The maximum total erosion score in the hands is 100 (normalized from 98) and in the feet 42, the maximum scores for joint space narrowing in the hands is 100 (normalized from 104) and in the feet 48. The maximum modified Sharp score achievable is 290. A lower number change from Baseline indicated a better score.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Function as Measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI consisted of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities rated on a 4-point scale where 0=without any difficulty to 3=unable to do. The sum of scores was divided by the number of domains with a score for a total possible score of 0 (best) to 3 (worst). Functional disability was determined as a cumulative measure of HAQ-DI over 1 year by using the AUC of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score through week 52. Decreases in AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI indicate a greater average improvement in physical function over time and represent a decrease in sustained impairment. For patients with missing week 52 HAQ-DI score, the AUC of the change from baseline was standardized to 52 weeks using the latest timepoint available for calculation of the AUC. The mean was adjusted for region. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status.</description>

        <title>Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI): Mean Change From Baseline at Week 24</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is a self-completed patient questionnaire specific for RA. It consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities. Each domain has at least 2 component questions. There are 4 possible responses for each component 0=without any difficulty 1=with some difficulty 2=with much difficulty 3=unable to do. Calculate HAQ-DI the patient must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains. The HAQ-DI is the sum of the scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score (in range 6-8) for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <description>Radiographs were taken of each hand and foot at Baseline and Week 52 and evaluated at a central reading service by two independent radiologists using the Genant modified method according to Sharp. Erosion Score: A total of 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=Normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. Joint Narrowing Score: A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). The maximum total erosion score in the hands is 100 (normalized from 98) and in the feet 42, the maximum scores for joint space narrowing in the hands is 100 (normalized from 104) and in the feet 48. The maximum modified Sharp score achievable is 290. A lower number change from Baseline indicated a better score.</description>

        <title>Change in Physical Function as Measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Disability Index at Week 52</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI consisted of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities rated on a 4-point scale where 0=without any difficulty to 3=unable to do. The sum of scores was divided by the number of domains with a score for a total possible score of 0 (best) to 3 (worst). Functional disability was determined as a cumulative measure of HAQ-DI over 1 year by using the AUC of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score through week 52. Decreases in AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI indicate a greater average improvement in physical function over time and represent a decrease in sustained impairment. For patients with missing week 52 HAQ-DI score, the AUC of the change from baseline was standardized to 52 weeks using the latest timepoint available for calculation of the AUC. The mean was adjusted for region. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Modified Total Sharp-Genant Score at Week 104</title>
        <description>Radiographs of each hand and foot were taken at Baseline and Week 104 and evaluated at a central reading service by two independent radiologists using the Genant modified method according to Sharp. Erosion Score: A total of 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=Normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. Joint Narrowing Score: A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). The maximum total erosion score in the hands is 100 and in the feet 42, the maximum scores for joint space narrowing in the hands is 100 and in the feet 48. The maximum modified Sharp score achievable is 290. A lower number change from Baseline indicated a better score.</description>

        <title>Change in Physical Function as Measured by the Area Under the Curve for the Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire- Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 104</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI consisted of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities rated on a 4-point scale where 0=without any difficulty to 3=unable to do. The sum of scores was divided by the number of domains with a score for a total possible score of 0 (best) to 3 (worst). Functional disability was determined as a cumulative measure of HAQ-DI over 2 years by using the AUC of the change from baseline in HAQ-DI score through week 104. Decreases in AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI indicated a gr eater average improvement in physical function over time and represent a decrease in sustained impairment. For patients with missing week 104 HAQ-DI score, the AUC of the change from baseline was standardized to 104 weeks using the latest timepoint available for calculation of the AUC. A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With ACR70 Response Maintained for 6 Consecutive Months</title>
          <description>ACR70 response is defined as a ≥ 70% improvement (reduction) compared with baseline for both total joint count-68 joints (TJC68) and swollen joint count-66 joints (SJC66), as well as for three of the additional five ACR core set variables: Patient's Assessment of Pain over the previous 24 hours: using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) left end of the line 0=no pain to right end of the line 100=unbearable pain; Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity over the previous 24 hours using a VAS where left end of the line 0=no disease activity to right end of the line 100=maximum disease activity; Health Assessment Questionnaire: 20 questions, 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; and acute-phase reactant, either C-reactive protein or Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-treat population included all randomized participants who received study drug. LOCF was used for tender and swollen joint counts, no imputation used for missing HAQ Score, CRP, ESR and VAS assessments. Patients who received escape therapy, withdrew prematurely or where an ACR could not be calculated, were set to 'Non Responder'.</population>

        <description>The ACRn is defined as each patient’s lowest percent improvement from Baseline of 3 measures: tender joint count (68 joints), swollen joint count (66 joints), and the improved score achieved in at least 3 of the 5 remaining ACR core components (physician global assessment, patient global assessment, pain, HAQ, and C-reactive protein or ESR, respectively). AUC of ACRn, a continuous variable, was calculated from Baseline to Week 24. A positive score change from Baseline indicated an improvement. The higher the ACRn score the better.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at Week 52</title>
          <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the subject's disease activity. It is based on the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity], and ESR. DAS28 total scores range from 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). DAS28 total scores range from 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control.

        <title>Area Under Curve (AUC) of Disease Activity Score (DAS28) at Week 104</title>
        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). DAS28 total scores range from 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. Higher calculated AUC values are worse (indicate higher disease activity).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp-Genant Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>Radiographs were taken of each hand and foot at Baseline and Week 24 and evaluated at a central reading service by two independent radiologists using the Genant modified method according to Sharp. Erosion Score: A total of 14 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for erosion using an 8-point scale where 0=Normal to 3.5=very severe erosion. Joint Narrowing Score: A total of 13 locations in each hand and wrist and 6 joints in the foot were evaluated for joint narrowing score using a 9-point scale where 0=Normal to 4.0=definite ankylosis (stiffness or fixation of a joint). The maximum total erosion score in the hands is 100 and in the feet 42, the maximum scores for joint space narrowing in the hands is 100 and in the feet 48. The maximum modified Sharp score achievable is 290. A lower number change from Baseline indicated a better score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 52</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI is a self-completed questionnaire specific for RA. It consists of 20 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; common daily activities. Each domain has at least 2 component questions. There are 4 possible responses for each component 0=without any difficulty 1=with some difficulty 2=with much difficulty 3=unable to do. To Calculate HAQ-DI the patient must have a domain score for at least 6 of 8 domains. The HAQ-DI is the sum of the scores, divided by the number of domains that have a score (in range 6-8) for a total possible score minimum/maximum 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A negative change from baseline indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SF-36 Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>The SF-36 is a questionnaire used to assess physical functioning and is made up of eight domains: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Health. Transforming and standardizing these domains leads to the calculation of the Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) Component Summary measures. Scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue (FACIT-F) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in FACIT-F Score at Week 104</title>
          <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Patients scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the patient's health status.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). DAS28 total scores range from 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. DAS28 Remission is defined as a DAS28 score &lt;2.6.</description>

The larger the patient's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the patient's fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the patient's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score).
