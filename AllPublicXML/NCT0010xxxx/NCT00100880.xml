  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide in treating
      young patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory CNS tumors. Lenalidomide may stop
      the growth of CNS tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It may also stimulate the
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the MTD of oral CC-5013 administered to children with recurrent or refractory
      primary CNS tumors once daily for 21 days of a 28 day course.

      II. To describe the toxicity profile and define the dose-limiting toxicity of CC-5013 in
      children with recurrent or refractory primary CNS tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of CC-5013 in children and adolescents. II. To
      characterize the pharmacogenetics of CC-5013 in children and adolescents.

      III. To evaluate changes in circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and circulating endothelial
      cell precursors (CEPs) in patients treated with CC-5013, and to investigate the correlation
      between changes in CECs and CEPs, plasma, serum and urine levels of proteins associated with
      angiogenesis including thrombospondin, b-FGF, TNF-α, IL-12, IL-8 and VEGF, and correlate
      these changes with changes in MR perfusion and clinical outcome.

      IV. To evaluate changes in MR perfusion and diffusion during treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 2-3 patients receive escalating doses of lenalidomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which an estimated 25% of
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      All patients are followed for at least 30 days after the last dose of lenalidomide. Patients
      with treatment-related toxicity are followed for up to 3 months.
