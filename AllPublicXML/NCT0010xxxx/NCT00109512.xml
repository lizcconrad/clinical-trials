    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study with subjects randomized to one of three treatment groups, placebo, 75 mg and 150 mg in
      a 1:1:1 ratio. Study drug was administered once daily for 12 weeks. After the last dose at
      the end of Week 12, follow-up continued every 4 weeks for 12 weeks.
