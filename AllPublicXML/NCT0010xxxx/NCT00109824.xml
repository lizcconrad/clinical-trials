  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Valproic acid
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Giving decitabine together with valproic acid may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of decitabine and
      valproic acid in treating patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the minimally effective pharmacological dose (MEPD) of single-agent decitabine
      in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of valproic acid when administered with the MEPD of
      decitabine in these patients.

      III. Determine the MEPD of valproic acid when administered with decitabine in these patients.

      IV. Determine the toxic effects of decitabine alone and in combination with valproic acid in
      these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate in patients treated with these drugs. II. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of these drugs in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment stages.

      STAGE 1: Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 or 1-10. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      STAGE 2: Patients receive decitabine as in stage 1 and valproic acid orally (PO) thrice daily
      (TID) on days 5-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      For both stages, patients who achieve an objective response (complete response [CR],
      unconfirmed CR, or partial response) may discontinue study treatment and undergo stem cell
      transplantation, if eligible.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-42 patients (18 for stage 1 and 24 for stage 2) will be
      accrued for this study.
