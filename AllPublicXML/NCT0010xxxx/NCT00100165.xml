    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that 3-2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene anabaseine (DMXB-A), an orally
      administered nicotinic cholinergic agonist, will improve attention and other
      neuropsychological dysfunctions in schizophrenia, leading to improved psychosocial outcome.

      The objective of the trial is to determine if dosing DMXB-A twice daily for 4 weeks will
      improve cognition and be safe. Secondary goals are to determine if these neurocognitive
      effects also have effects on neurobiological paradigms previously shown to be responsive to
      nicotinic receptor stimulation: suppression of P50 auditory evoked response, saccadic
      intrusions during smooth pursuit eye movements, and hemodynamic activity in the hippocampus
      during smooth pursuit eye movements as measured by fMRI. The purpose of these neurobiological
      measures is to assess whether the response to DMXB-A is consistent with activation of
      nicotinic receptors. In addition, the investigators will assess clinical response using a
      battery of clinical assessment scales and assessments of daily living functions. The purpose
      of these assessments is to address the FDA requirement of a clinical effect beyond change in
      laboratory neuropsychological performance. This study and the subsequent two studies will
      also include assessments of the safety of DMXB-A and related compounds.

      The purpose of the trial is to lay the groundwork for Phase III investigation. If this trial
      finds that DMXB-A has effects at a safe dose, without tachyphylaxis, then the investigators
      intend to proceed to a Phase III trial, where the clinical importance of this effect can be
      measured.

      The trial will be a double blind trial with placebo control. The order of doses and placebo
      will be randomized.

      The Phase 1 study was completed in January, 2005, with 12 non-smoking schizophrenics
      subjects. The subjects were concurrently treated with neuroleptics throughout the study. They
      received 3 treatments, each for 1 day, in a double-blind crossover design. The treatments
      were DMXB-A (150 mg + 75 mg 2 hours later), DMXB-A (75 mg + 37.5 mg 2 hours later), and
      placebo. A significant effect on neurocognition, as measured by the Repeatable Battery for
      Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, and on sensory gating, as measured by P50 auditory
      evoked potentials was observed. Subjects reported no significant symptoms. One subject's
      white blood cell count decreased from just above normal limits on placebo to just below
      normal levels on DMXBA (150 + 75 mg 2 hours later). He did not receive further exposure to
      drug and his white blood cell count returned to normal at the next testing, 2 days later.
