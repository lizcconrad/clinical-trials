      Immunotoxin therapy may be effective in treating malignant glioma. Immunotoxins can locate
      tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The patients must fulfill all the following criteria:

          -  Previous histologically-confirmed diagnosis of primary GBM (glioblastoma multiforme,
             glioma grade 4 at time of first diagnosis).

          -  Histologically-confirmed and MRI diagnosed recurrent or progressive GBM after previous
             resection (surgical or biopsy) and radiation therapy.

          -  Medically capable of undergoing the planned surgical gross total resection and the
             catheter placement.

          -  Age ≥ 18.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status of ≥ 70%.

          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months.

          -  Patients must already be taking or begin taking corticosteroids at a stable dose of 4
             mg every 6 hours for at least 72 hours prior to catheter placement.

          -  Patients must be capable of taking, or already taking, anticonvulsant medication.

          -  Patients must have read, signed, and dated an informed consent according to ICH-GCP,
             the local regulatory requirement and the rules followed at each institution.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients fulfilling any of the following criteria should not be enrolled in the study:

          -  Previous myelosuppressive chemotherapy within the past 4 weeks of the start of the
             infusion. Patients who have received more than two chemotherapy regimens (single
             therapy or combination therapy) are ineligible.

          -  Any form of brain radiation within 10 weeks of the start of the infusion.

          -  Previous gamma knife radiosurgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, and/or internal
             radiotherapy, unless the recurrence/progression is histologically confirmed
             (fine-needle biopsy).

          -  Prior intracavitary biologic response modifiers or monoclonal antibodies.

          -  Uncontrolled seizures.

          -  Bilateral or multifocal tumors.

          -  Evidence of cerebral uncal herniation.

          -  Midline brain shift on MRI scan of &gt; 0.5 cm prior to resection; patients with
             subfalcine herniation may be enrolled.

          -  Tumors involving the brainstem or cerebellum.

          -  Diffuse subependymal or CSF disease.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding. All women of child-bearing potential should
             be excluded unless they have a negative pregnancy test and are using adequate
             contraceptive measures or are surgically sterile. Post-menopausal women must be
             amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be considered non-childbearing.

          -  Fertile males not practicing adequate contraception and whose female partners are not
             using adequate contraceptive protection.

          -  Prior or concurrent investigational treatment within 30 days of study entry.

          -  Active infection requiring treatment or having an unexplained febrile illness.

          -  Systemic diseases or other conditions which may be associated with unacceptable
             anesthetic/operative risk and/or which would not allow safe completion of this study
             protocol.

          -  Prior or concurrent malignancy (curatively treated carcinoma-in-situ or basal cell
             carcinoma or patients who have been disease free for at least 5 years are eligible).
