    <textblock>
      In this study, Liposome Entrapped Paclitaxel Easy to Use (LEP-ETU) is being compared to
      Taxol® to examine whether the paclitaxel in these 2 formulations undergoes similar processing
      by the body. Safety and tolerability of LEP-ETU and Taxol will also be assessed. In this
      study, each patient will receive one intravenous infusion of LEP-ETU or Taxol, followed 3
      weeks later by an infusion of the other drug, at the same dose and infusion duration.
      Multiple blood samples will be taken for analysis before, during, and after both drug
      infusions. Upon completing these 2 Cycles of treatment, eligible patients may enroll in an
      extension study (LEP-ETU-102B) to continue treatment with LEP-ETU.

      LEP-ETU is a liposomal formulation of paclitaxel, a widely used anti-cancer drug. This
      LEP-ETU formulation of paclitaxel is being developed to potentially reduce toxicities
      associated with Taxol, by eliminating the drug formulation component polyoxyethylated castor
      oil (Cremophor® EL). In LEP-ETU, paclitaxel is associated with liposomes, which are
      microscopic membrane-like structures created from lipids (fats). Thus, the LEP-ETU
      formulation could potentially have reduced toxicity, while maintaining or enhancing efficacy.

      This Phase 1B, open-label, two-period crossover bioequivalence study is designed to compare
      the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LEP-ETU and Taxol in patients with advanced cancer. Patients are
      randomized to determine which drug is administered first. A single dose of LEP-ETU or Taxol
      (Cycle A) will be administered, followed 3 weeks later by a single dose of the other drug
      (Cycle B). Blood samples for PK analysis will be taken before, during, and after the infusion
      of each drug. Following successful completion of both Cycles in this study, patients may be
      eligible for additional cycles of treatment with LEP-ETU in the LEP-ETU-102B extension study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have advanced histologically diagnosed non-hematological malignancy for
             which there is no curative therapy and for which treatment with single agent
             paclitaxel is appropriate in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of 12 weeks or more.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG Performance Status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must have recovered from acute toxicities of prior treatment. Specifically:
             *4 or more weeks must have elapsed since receiving any investigational agent. *3 or
             more weeks must have elapsed since receiving any radiotherapy, or treatment with
             cytotoxic or biologic agents (6 weeks or more for mitomycin or nitrosureas). Chronic
             treatment with non-investigational gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs or other
             hormonal or supportive care is permitted. *2 or more weeks must have elapsed since any
             prior surgery or granulocyte-stimulating growth factor therapy.
