  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use dendritic cells transfected with amplified RNA from
      autologous tumor cells to develop a vaccine strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer in
      patients with disseminated disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims are: 1) to evaluate, in a phase I clinical trial, the safety of vaccinating
      patients with dendritic cells transfected with RNA from autologous cancer cells; 2) to
      analyze the T cell responses induced by the treatment; and 3) to improve the efficacy of the
      treatment by developing methods to increase the induction of CD4+T cell responses.
