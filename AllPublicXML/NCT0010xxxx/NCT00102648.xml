  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose of the new drug
      Sarasar (lonafarnib) that can be given together with Temodar (temozolomide) in a continuous
      daily dosing regimen to patients with brain tumors. The second goal is to learn if these
      drugs given in combination can shrink or slow the growth of brain tumors.

      This is an investigational study. Temozolomide is approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      some brain tumors. Lonafarnib is approved for research use only in the treatment of brain
      tumors. The use of these two drugs together is experimental.

      About 35 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Temozolomide is a chemotherapy drug that works by attacking cancer cells, causing them to
      die. Lonafarnib is a new drug that may slow down the growth of cancer cells. Used in
      combination, the two drugs may control the growth of brain tumors.

      Before treatment starts, you will have a complete physical exam, including height and weight
      measurements taken, as well as a neurological (brain) exam. Blood tests (less than 2
      tablespoons of blood) will be performed. A MRI scan of the brain will be done. Women who are
      able have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.

      If you are eligible to take part in the study, you will be given temozolomide and lonafarnib
      as treatment. The size of study drug doses being given will increase after every 3
      participants are enrolled on the study, until the highest safe dose of each drug, when given
      in combination, is found.

      If you are enrolled on the Phase Ib part of this study, you will be treated at the highest
      tolerable dose that was found in the Phase I part of the study. You will receive this dose of
      temozolomide on a 7-day on, 7-day off schedule. You will also receive Sarasar by mouth twice
      a day using a 7-day on, 7-day off schedule.

      Temozolomide and lonafarnib will be taken by mouth in this study. You will take temozolomide
      once a day for 7 days every other week (Days 1-7 and 15-21). You must not eat for 1 hour
      before and after taking the drug; drinking water is allowed. During the alternate weeks (Days
      8-14 and 22-28), you will take the lonafarnib tablet by mouth in the morning and evening,
      with water. You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are taking the
      study medication as this will affect how study medication is broken down in your body. This
      will be repeated every 28 days (1 study course). All treatment may be given on an outpatient
      basis, and so you will not require a hospital stay.

      You may keep on taking temozolomide and lonafarnib for up to 24 courses (about 2 years). You
      will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. You may
      not receive any other treatment for cancer (including surgery) while taking part in this
      study.

      You will come to the clinic to have a complete physical exam before each course of treatment.
      You will have a neurological exam within 14 days before every odd-numbered course (3, 5, 7,
      etc), or at any time that the doctor feels it is needed. Blood counts (about 1 teaspoon) will
      be done before every course of treatment and on Day 22 of each course. Blood chemistry tests
      and anticonvulsant levels, if applicable, (less than 1 tablespoon) will be repeated before
      each course of treatment. An MRI scan will be done before the odd-numbered (3, 5, 7, etc.)
      courses of treatment, or at any time that the doctor feels it is needed. Patients taking the
      blood thinner warfarin will have blood tests (less than 1 teaspoon) more often to check the
      effects of the drug.

      Your doctor may decide to take you off combination treatment before 2 years and give you only
      the lonafarnib alone. If you continue to receive lonafarnib by itself without the addition of
      temozolomide, after having received a minimum of 1 year of the combination therapy, you will
      have routine blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) tests every 4 weeks and an MRI with clinic follow-up
      for physical and neurological exams every 4 months while receiving continuation treatment.

      When you have finished the study treatment, you will have another complete physical and
      neurological exam. Blood tests (less than 2 tablespoons of blood) will be performed. Another
      MRI scan will be done.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically proven supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or
             gliosarcoma.

          2. Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence or progression by
             MRI scan after radiation therapy. The scan done prior to study entry documenting
             progression will be reviewed by the treating physician to document tumor volume
             changes to provide a gross assessment of growth rate.

          3. Patients may have had as many as 2 prior chemotherapy regimens for recurrent or
             progressive tumor. Patients must have had prior treatment with Temodar but may not
             have had prior treatment with farnesyl transferase inhibitors (Sarasar or Zarnestra).
             Patients in phase 1b expansion are required to have received a minimum of two cycles
             of adjuvant TMZ.

          4. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this study in keeping with the policies of this hospital.

          5. Patients must have shown unequivocal evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT scan.
             A scan should be performed within 14 days prior to registration and on a steroid dose
             that has been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days. If the steroid dose is
             increased between the date of imaging and registration a new baseline MR/CT is
             required. The same type of scan, i.e., MRI or CT must be used throughout the period of
             protocol treatment for tumor measurement.

          6. Pts having had recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor are eligible as long
             as: a) Patients must be status post surgical resection at least 2 weeks prior to study
             enrollment, have recovered from surgery, have adequate early wound healing and a
             Karnofsky performance status of &gt; or = 60.

          7. Continued from Inclusion #6. b) Residual disease following resection of recurrent
             tumor is not mandated for eligibility into the study. A CT/ MRI should be done within
             96 hrs post-op or at least 4 wks post-op (within 14 days of registration). If the
             steroid dose is increased between the scan date and registration, a new baseline
             MRI/CT is required on a stable steroid dose for 5 days.

          8. Patients must be &gt;/= 18 years of age.

          9. Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt;/= 60.

         10. Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 4 weeks from
             prior cytotoxic therapy and/or at least two weeks from vincristine, 6 weeks from
             nitrosoureas, 3 weeks from procarbazine administration, and 1 week for non-cytotoxic
             agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc.
             (radiosensitizer does not count). Any questions related to the definition of
             non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the Study Chair.

         11. Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (ANC &gt;/= 1,500/mm3 and platelet count
             of &gt;/= 100,000/mm3), adequate liver function (SGPT and alkaline phosphatase &lt;2.5 times
             normal, bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg%), and adequate renal function (BUN and creatinine &lt;1.5
             times institutional normal) prior to starting therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must not be taking primidone, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin
             anticonvulsants. Patients changing from these anticonvulsants to other allowable drugs
             that are not enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) must be off the drugs listed
             above for at least 72 hours prior the initiation of treatment.

          2. Patients with a history of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or
             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), are ineligible unless in complete remission and off
             of all therapy for that disease for a minimum of 3 years.

          3. Patients must not have: a) uncontrolled active infection b) disease that will obscure
             toxicity or dangerously alter drug metabolism c) serious intercurrent medical illness.
             d) prior recurrence with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor e) oral contraceptives and
             other hormonal methods (Depo-Provera) of birth control.
