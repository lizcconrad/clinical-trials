  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of oxaliplatin and etoposide in
      treating young patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphomas. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Oxaliplatin may
      also help etoposide work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving
      oxaliplatin together with etoposide may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin and etoposide in pediatric patients
      with recurrent or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. II. Correlate the
      extent of oxaliplatin and etoposide exposure with toxic effects and therapeutic effects of
      this regimen in these patients.

      III. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days
      1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin and etoposide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
