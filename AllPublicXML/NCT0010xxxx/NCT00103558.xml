    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase I/II, dose escalation research study of an investigational
      product called lumiliximab, given with FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved products
      fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). The study duration is 17 visits over 42
      months or until your disease progresses and you require additional CLL therapy. The total
      duration of participation in the study will be approximately 4 years, however your disease
      status will be followed indefinitely (forever).
