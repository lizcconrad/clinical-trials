      The purpose of this trial is to study MK0731 in patients with recurrent or non-responsive
      solid tumors, or cancers for which standard therapy does not exist.

      This is an early phase trial and some specific protocol information is proprietary and not
      publicly available at this time. (Full information is available to trial participants).
