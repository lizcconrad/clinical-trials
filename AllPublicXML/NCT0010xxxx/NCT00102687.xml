    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if azacitidine, combined with Best Supportive Care
      (BSC), is effective in treating myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) when given according to a
      different doses and dosing schedules.

      Comparison/Control Interventions: The comparison is azacitidine at different doses and
      schedules.

      Duration of Intervention: Treatment lasted for a maximum of 18 cycles, which is up to 24
      months.

    <measure>Number of Participants In Best Hematological Response Categories as Determined by the Investigator Using International Working Group 2000 (IWG 2000) Criteria For Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) During the Initial Study Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (randomization) to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participant counts by best hematological response; complete remission(CR) is better than a partial remission(PR) which is better than stable disease(SD).
Investigator determined responses followed IWG 2000 criteria for MDS CR: repeat bone marrow show &lt;5% myeloblasts, and peripheral blood evaluations lasting &gt;=2 months of hemoglobin(&gt;110 g/L), neutrophils(&gt;=1.5x10^9/L), platelets(&gt;=100x10^9/L), blasts (0%) and no dysplasia PR is the same as CR for peripheral blood: bone marrow shows blasts decrease by &gt;=50% or a less advanced FAB classification from pretreatment (see Population Descrip)</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Best Hematological Improvement Derived Using International Working Group 2000 (IWG 2000) Criteria for MDS During the Initial Study Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (randomization) to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>IWG 2000 Criteria: Pretreatment=hemoglobin &lt;110g/L or RBC transfusion-dependence, platelet count &lt;100x10^9/L or platelet transfusion dependence, absolute neutrophil count &lt;1.5x10^9/L.
Erythroid response: Major-&gt;20g/L increase in hemoglobin or transfusion independence. Minor- 10-20g/L increase in hemoglobin or &gt;=50% decrease in transfusion requirements.
Platelet response: Major-absolute increase of platelet count by &gt;=30x10^9/L or platelet transfusion independence. Minor-&gt;=50% increase in platelet count with net increase &gt;10x10^9/L but &lt;30x10^9/L.

    <description>Number of participants whose best hematological outcome was either complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) (as determined by the investigator), or any hematologic improvement (based on the IWG 2000 criteria for MDS).

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Improved or Maintained The Hematologic Response From the Initial Study Period (Based on IWG 2000 Criteria For MDS) During the Maintenance Period</measure>

    <description>Hematologic response during the maintenance period are compared to the response in the initial study period. Initial response could have been a complete remission, a partial remission, stable disease or a hematologic improvement. Maintenance period best response is after randomization to a maintenance arm for those randomized, and is after the start of cycle 7 for those remaining on initial period treatment throughout the study.</description>
