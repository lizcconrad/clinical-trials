  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of AMG 531 in the treatment of
      thrombocytopenia in subjects with ITP as measured by the platelet response. This study will
      also evaluate changes in Patient Reported Outcomes and Health Resource Utilization due to
      treatment with AMG 531.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of ITP according to American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines
             (Appendix F)

          -  Have had a splenectomy for the treatment of ITP greater than or equal to 24 weeks
             prior to study entry

          -  Subjects greater than 60 years of age must have a documented history of chronic ITP
             with a bone marrow report to confirm the diagnosis

          -  The platelet count (calculated from the mean of the 2 counts taken during the
             screening and pre-treatment periods) must be:

          -  * less than 30 x 10^9/L for those subjects not receiving any ITP therapy, with no
             count greater than 35 x 10^9/L,

          -  * less than 50 x 10^9/L for those subjects receiving a constant dose schedule of
             corticosteroids, azathioprine or danazol with no count greater than 55 x 10^9/L

          -  A serum creatinine concentration less than or equal to 2 mg/dl(less than or equal to

             danazol administered at a constant dose and schedule

          -  IV Ig or anti-D Ig within 2 weeks before the screening visit

          -  Rituximab (for any indication) within 14 weeks before the screening visit or
             anticipated use during the time of the proposed study

          -  Received hematopoietic growth factors, including IL-11 (oprelvekin) within 4 weeks
             before the screening visit

          -  Past or present participation in any study evaluating PEG-rHuMGDF, recombinant human
             thrombopoietin (rHuTPO), AMG 531 or related platelet product

          -  Received any aklylating agents within 8 weeks before the screening visit or
             anticipated use during the time of the proposed study

          -  Less than 4 weeks since receipt of any therapeutic drug or device that is not FDA
             approved for any indication before the screening period

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding
