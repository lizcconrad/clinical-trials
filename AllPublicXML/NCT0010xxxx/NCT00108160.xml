      The purpose of this study is to determine if mupirocin 2% in polyethylene glycol (PEG)
      ointment [Treatment Arm] is effective in preventing moderate to severe re-infection with
      Staphylococcus aureus compared with treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG) ointment
      [Placebo Arm].

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of staphylococcal carriage with the topical antibiotic, mupirocin, has led to
      decreased infections in some hemodialysis patients and intensive care unit (ICU) patients.
      However, most of these studies were not placebo controlled and only certain subsets of
      patients benefited. Relapse of colonization, generally within 90 days after treatment is
      stopped, presumably with increased risk of infection, approaches 50%. Continuous use of
      mupirocin on daily, three times weekly, or weekly basis has resulted in increased resistance
      to the drug. Despite this lack of evidence, the use of mupirocin has become commonplace
      because it is perceived as an effective and simple means to prevent infection. In a National
      Institutes on Aging/Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (NIA/OAIC)-sponsored
      proposal, we found that a 2 week treatment regimen with mupirocin ointment was effective in
      decolonizing older chronically ill nursing home residents of S. aureus when compared with
      placebo ointment. Decolonization began to decline by 3 months post-treatment, and resistance
      occurred only once in 52 treated patients. That study was not powered to detect differences
      in infection between the 2 study groups; the end point was eradication of colonization.
      However, a trend towards reduction in staphylococcal infection with mupirocin was seen. In
      addition, there were more therapeutic failures in residents who were colonized with
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) than methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA). We
      hypothesize that intermittent treatment with mupirocin ointment every 3 months may be an
      effective means of preventing recolonization and infection with S. aureus. We propose to
      study a patient population that has already had treatment for severe S. aureus infection and
      is at significant risk for a subsequent infection. Patients will receive mupirocin 2%
      polyethylene glycol (PEG) ointment [Treatment Arm] or polyethylene glycol (PEG) ointment
      [Placebo Arm] for 14 days every 3 months. The effect of these two regimens on S. aureus
      re-infection, re-colonization, and development of mupirocin resistance will be assessed.

    <measure>Re-infection With S. Aureus</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>During the study, patients with prior well-documented infections with Staphylococcus aureus who developed new signs and symptoms of infection, met standardized clinical criteria for infection, and had S. aureus isolated on culture were considered to have re-infection with S. aureus. The number of S. aureus re-infections were compared in the mupirocin ointment (Treatment Arm) versus polyethylene glycol ointment (Placebo Arm) for all participants enrolled in the study and in participants who completed each study time point (visit)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acquisition of New S. Aureus Strains</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the Mupirocin Ointment (Treatment) and Polyethylene Glycol (Placebo) Arms, S. aureus isolates (MSSA or MRSA) that caused infection prior to enrollment in the study were compared with S. aureus infecting isolates (MSSA or MRSA) that occurred during the study (re-infections). Infecting isolates that were found to be MRSA at enrollment and MRSA during the study were considered to be the same strain; this same strain definition was also applied to MSSA isolates. Infecting isolates that changed from MRSA at enrollment to MSSA during the study (or vice versa) were considered to be different strains.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>S. Aureus Re-infections (New or Recurrent)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The anatomic site of each S. infection at enrollment and S. aureus re-infection that occurred during the study was compared. S. aureus isolated from a different site of infection than at baseline was considered to represent a new infection. Isolation of S. aureus from the same site as the baseline infection was considered to represent a recurrent infection.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who receive care at Ann Arbor VA Medical Center, University of Michigan
             Medical Center, or St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, Ypsilanti who have been hospitalized for
             documented S. aureus infection will be eligible for enrollment. Staphylococcal
             infections may be community or hospital-acquired. Patients with S. aureus infection
             will be identified on a daily basis with the assistance of the Infection Control
             Practitioner, the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, the Infectious Diseases
             Consultation Services, and Infectious Diseases physicians caring for patients in their
             offices.

          -  Patients will provide written informed consent. The patient's guardian or next of kin
             will be contacted for informed consent in the event that the patient is incapable of
             doing so.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable to cooperate with treatment or follow-up.

          -  Patients who are not likely to survive beyond one month or those who are transferred
             back to another acute care hospital.

          -  Patients who require treatment with rifampin will be excluded since this drug is
             effective in decolonization of some staphylococcal carriers.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to mupirocin ointment or polyethylene glycol
             base.

          -  Patients with ulcers obviously related to pressure will be excluded because they are
             frequently large, difficult to keep clean, and infections are difficult to diagnose.

          -  Patients with small vascular or neuropathic ulcers &lt; 3 cm in circumference and &lt; 2 cm
             in depth may be enrolled.

          -  Pregnant women.

Infecting isolates that were found to be MRSA at enrollment and MRSA during the study were considered to be the same strain; this same strain definition was also applied to MSSA isolates.

          <description>The anatomic site of each S. infection at enrollment and S. aureus re-infection that occurred during the study was compared. S. aureus isolated from a different site of infection than at baseline was considered to represent a new infection. Isolation of S. aureus from the same site as the baseline infection was considered to represent a recurrent infection.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The study is underpowered to detect differences between the two treatment arms. We achieved only 75% of target enrollment, and 41.1% dropped out before reaching a primary endpoint. Our re-infection rate was also lower than anticipated (14.4%).</limitations_and_caveats>
