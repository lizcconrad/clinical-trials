  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dose that is safely tolerated of the
      experimental drug Rhenium Re 188 P2045. This will be done by first treating patients at
      relatively low doses of Rhenium Re 188 P2045, observing them closely to assure that there are
      no bad side effects, then increasing the dose when we are confident that it is safe to do so.

      We want to learn more about the side effect profile of both Technetium Tc 99m P2045 and
      Rhenium Re 188 P2045 and will do that by observing you closely after you receive the drug and
      by conducting multiple tests, as well as by asking you how you feel. We want to also learn if
      there is any benefit, in terms of lung cancer tumor reduction, as a result of treatment with
      Rhenium Re 188 P2045. This study has previously been posted by Berlex, Inc. Andarix
      Pharmaceuticals is the sponsor of the trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has histologically or cytologically documented Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) or
             Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and has advanced or recurrent IIIb or IV NSCLC
             (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell, mixed or not otherwise
             specified) or disseminated or recurrent SCLC or any lung cancer which has local
             recurrence.

          -  Has documentation of progressive disease following prior chemotherapy or who refused
             to receive standard chemotherapy.

          -  Has measurable tumor (at least 1 cm unidimensionally) in a previously non-irradiated
             area or, if in previously irradiated area, a substantial increase in size of tumor,
             based on CT scan within 8 weeks prior to enrollment; tumor in previously irradiated
             area only if it has increased by 50% or more from previous minimal diameter AND it is
             more than 8 weeks from the radiation.
