      Brief Summary: 800 RRMS Subjects currently treated with Avonex or Copaxone will be randomized
      to either continue on their current therapy or receive Rebif therapy. The subjects will be
      followed for 2 years. The primary objective is to compare the time to worsening to a medium
      level of concern as defined by the Canadian Multiple Sclerosis Working Group (CMSWG)
      treatment optimization recommendations.

             at any time within the past 12 months will be excluded); *Low Level of Concern: a) 1
             mild relapse (Mild severity - corticosteroids not required, minimal effect on
             Activities of Daily Living (ADL), only 1 Kurtzke Functional Systems (KFS) functional
             domain affected, no or mild motor/cerebellar involvement, no need for treatment or
             hospitalization and prompt recovery); *Medium Level of Concern: a) 2 mild relapses or
             1 moderate relapse (Moderate severity - corticosteroids may be required, at most
             moderate effect on ADL, &gt;1 KFS functional domain may be affected, moderate
             motor/cerebellar involvement, may require treatment but not hospitalization and
             incomplete recovery at 3 months but complete recovery by 6 months)

          -  If female, she must either:

               4. confirmation that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative
                  serum hCG pregnancy test within 30 days of Study Day 1 and a negative urine
                  pregnancy test on Study Day 1. A pregnancy test is required for all females that
                  are of childbearing potential.

          -  The small minority of subjects for whom Rebif therapy is not reimbursed by their
             insurance carrier may be considered for the study if otherwise eligible, but will
             require prior approval from the sponsor for coverage of the cost of their Rebif
             therapy
