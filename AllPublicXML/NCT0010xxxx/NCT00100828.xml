      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well irinotecan works in treating patients with
      metastatic or inoperable thyroid cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic or inoperable locoregional
           medullary thyroid cancer treated with irinotecan.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Response is
      assessed after completion of 4 courses. Patients achieving complete response (CR) or partial
      response (PR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or PR. Patients who have stable disease
      receive up to 12 total courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 33 patients will be accrued for this study.
