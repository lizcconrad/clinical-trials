      This is a continued access protocol to provide subjects who have completed Genentech, Inc.
      Study Q2143g, Q2195g, or Q2461g or Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation Study CIGE025 0010E1
      with continued Xolair treatment. Subject eligibility will be based on disease severity and
      asthma deterioration upon withdrawal of Xolair treatment. Subjects whose last Xolair dose was
      &lt;9 months prior to screening visit will continue with the same Xolair dosing regimen that
      they received in the previous Genentech or Novartis clinical study.

             in the study.

          -  Severe asthma as demonstrated by at least one of the following: *History of prior
             intubation for allergic asthma; *History of prior admission to an intensive care
             unit/pediatric ICU for asthma; *History of one or more hospitalizations, emergency
             room (ER) visits, or unscheduled office visits for asthma in the 12 months prior to
             first Xolair treatment; *More than 20 days missed from school/work because of allergic
             asthma in the 12 months prior to initiation of Xolair treatment

          -  Deterioration of asthma upon withdrawal of Xolair as demonstrated by meeting at least
             one of the following: *Worsening of pulmonary function tests (FEV1 &lt;80% predicted for
             height, age, and sex) and activity levels while off Xolair treatment; *Worsening of
             asthma exacerbations defined as doubling of inhaled steroid dose, increase in dose of
             oral steroids, or initiation of oral, intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous (SC)
             steroids while off Xolair treatment; *Increased use of rescue medications while off
             Xolair treatment; *ER visits or unscheduled office visits for asthma that may or may
