    <textblock>
      QVAR in a standard press and breath inhaler (QVAR-MDI) has been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the level of asthma control when comparing the safety and effectiveness of QVAR in two
      different devices, a metered dose inhaler (MDI) and a breath operated inhaler (BOI).
