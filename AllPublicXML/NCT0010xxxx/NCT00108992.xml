  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a recommended treatment for the
      symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. However, NSAIDs may cause a range of negative side
      effects, including stomach pain, heartburn, bleeding stomach ulcer, and liver or kidney
      abnormality. A topical NSAID may relieve pain and other symptoms of osteoarthritis of the
      knee, while minimizing the side effects common to oral NSAIDs. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the safety and effectiveness of a topical NSAID when used alone or when combined
      with an oral NSAID in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.

      During this 12-week study, patients will visit the study clinic 5 times. At the screening
      visit, the patient's demographic information, medical and medication history will be recorded
      and a physical examination performed. After washout of all NSAIDs/other analgesic medication,
      the patient will return for the baseline visit. During the treatment phase of the study, the
      patient will apply a topical solution to his/her osteoarthritic knee and take an oral study
      tablet. The patient may randomly receive active treatment with topical diclofenac, oral
      diclofenac, both, or neither (placebo). Follow-up clinic visits are conducted at 4, 8 and 12
      weeks. Routine laboratory analyses are done at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks.
