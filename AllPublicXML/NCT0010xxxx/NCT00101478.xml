      The purpose of this study is to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes in racial and
      ethnic minorities. Specifically, the study will aim to improve provider and patient
      approaches to treatment of hypertension and diabetes, respectively.

      BACKGROUND:

      While there has been great progress in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality in the U.S. over
      the past 40 years, some minority groups have not shared fully in this progress and continue
      to have lower life expectancy and higher CVD morbidity. On average, minorities have less
      access to medical care, receive less aggressive care and fewer diagnostic and therapeutic
      cardiac procedures, and adhere poorly to prescribed medical regimens. Thus, research to
      reduce health disparities by improving CVD outcomes in minorities offers potential for a
      substantial positive public heath impact. Academic medical centers and institutions capable
      of carrying out such research, however, often lack access to and the trust of minority
      patients. Minority patients often receive fragmented care because they lack access to regular
      medical care, present to emergency departments rather than primary care physicians for
      complications of an advanced chronic CVD condition, and are less likely to follow medical
      regimens. Minority communities often harbor distrust of clinical research. Minority patients
      report greater satisfaction when receiving care from minority providers and are reluctant to
      receive treatment outside their minority healthcare serving systems.

      In general, minorities have high rates of hypertension, elevated cholesterol, cigarette
      smoking, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes, as well as other behavioral,
      environmental, and occupational risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, such as sleep
      problems. These are all elements that contribute to excess CVD morbidity and mortality. The
      causes of minority health disparities are complex and incompletely understood. Although
      evidence of genetic, biologic, and environmental factors is well documented, poor outcomes
      are also attributed to under-treatment. Such under-treatment may be due to limited access to
      health care or, in some cases, break-down of the medical system, or failure of the physician
      and/or patient to allow for optimal health care, even when access is not impaired. The
      complex interactions of behavior, socio-economic status (SES), culture, and ethnicity are
      important predictors of health outcomes and sources of health disparities. Despite efforts to
      elucidate genetic and environmental risk factors and to promote cardiovascular health in
      high-risk populations, trends in CVD outcomes suggest that CVD health disparities continue to
      widen.

      The Partnerships Program to Reduce Cardiovascular Health Disparities involves collaboration
      between minority healthcare serving systems (MSSs) that lack a strong research program and
      research-intensive medical centers (RIMCs) that have a track record of NIH-supported research
      and patient care. Each Partnership Program will: a) design and carry out multiple
      interdisciplinary research projects that investigate complex biological, behavioral, and
      societal factors that contribute to CVD health disparities and facilitate clinical research
      within the MSS to improve CVD outcomes and reduce health disparities, and b) provide
      reciprocal educational and skills development programs so that investigators are able to
      conduct research aimed at reducing cardiovascular disparities, thereby enhancing research
      opportunities and enriching cultural sensitivity and cardiovascular research capabilities at
      both institutions.

      The Request for Applications for Partnership Programs to Reduce Cardiovascular Disparities
      was released in September 2003. The awards were made in September 2004.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The collaborative partnership between the Bon Secours Baltimore Health System (BSBHS) and the
      University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) seeks to improve provider and patient approaches to
      treatment of hypertension and diabetes, respectively. UMB also aims to modify
      physician-related barriers to minority enrollment in clinical trials, and BSBHS to improve
      patient adherence to treatment plans. Through didactic training, UMB aims to build a
      sustainable research program at BSBHS; through cultural sensitivity training, BSBHS expects
      to enhance the disparities program at UMB. The relative impact of physician and/or patient
      interventions for controlling hypertension and diabetes will be assessed. This will be a
      hypothesis-testing, prospective study, with an experimental 2 X 2 factorial design; it will
      be a four-arm randomized controlled trial. Outcomes will include adherence and improved
      knowledge/awareness of guidelines (of patients and their physicians), as well as patient
      clinical and quality of life measures. The study will be powered for the proportion of
      patients who attain the set goal. There will be a target enrollment of 800 patients (400 each
      for hypertension and diabetes), to afford 80% (up to 90%) power and allow for 25% attrition.
      Logistic regression will be used for the probability of reaching goal, multiple linear
      regression will be used for relative changes in mmHg (hypertension) and HbAlc (diabetes), and
      survival analysis will be used to model time to reach goal. Measurements will be taken of
      improved adherence of diabetes patients as a result of BSBHS actively identifying access
      barriers. Measurements will also be taken of changes in the willingness of patients to enroll
      in clinical trials as a result of physician-targeted education. The study seeks to
      demonstrate a best practice model, based on a collaborative partnership, and build a
      self-sustained research program at BSBHS and an enhanced cardiovascular disparities program
      at UMB. Community entities will have full access to resources at both institutions, which in
      turn will have access to invaluable input and support from community groups.
