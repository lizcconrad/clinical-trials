  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how nitrite infusions affect exercise tolerance (how much a person
      can exercise before having to stop). Exercise ability is limited by how fast oxygen can be
      delivered to the body and how fast the body can produce energy. Both of these processes are
      affected by nitric oxide (NO), a gas produced by cells that line blood vessels. NO is
      important in regulating blood vessel dilation, and consequently, blood flow. Nitrite may act
      as a storehouse for nitric oxide and be able to improve exercise tolerance.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 21 and 45 years of age who can use an exercise bicycle may
      be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical
      examination, electrocardiogram, breathing tests, blood tests, and a pregnancy test for women
      who are able to bear children. Pregnant women are excluded from the study. The screening
      session includes practice exercise on the bicycle.

      Participants exercise on a stationery exercise bicycle for about 30 minutes on each of two
      study days. During the test, they breathe in and out of a mouthpiece that allows inhaled and
      exhaled respiratory gases to be measured. Before subjects begin to exercise, a small tube is
      placed in the artery of their forearm inside the elbow. A longer tube called a central line
      is placed in a deeper vein in the neck after the area has been numbed. A thinner tube, called
      a pulmonary artery catheter, is placed through the central line and advanced into the
      chambers of the heart, through the heart valve, and into the lung artery. This catheter
      measures various pressures directly in the heart and lungs. Blood samples are drawn through
      the catheter also, to avoid the need for multiple needle sticks. Another tube is placed in
      the vein of the other arm to deliver medications.

      Thirty minutes after all the tubes are placed, a blood sample is drawn for baseline
      measurements. Then, either saline (sterile salt water) or nitrite is injected into the tube
      in the arm vein. Thirty minutes after the injection, the subject starts exercising on the
      bicycle. The work setting on the bicycle is increased every minute, and the subject pedals
      until he or she is too tired to continue. During the test, a small blood sample is collected
      every 2 minutes. Heart rate, blood pressure, and heart rhythms are continuously monitored.

      After the test on the first day, participants are admitted to the hospital to rest for the
      remainder of the afternoon and evening. The tubes are kept in place for the following
      morning, when the procedure is repeated exactly as before, except that subjects who received
      saline the first day are given nitrite the second day, and vice versa.

      During exercise, there is a lag in the rate at which oxygen uptake (VO2) rises to meet energy
      demand. It is uncertain whether this limitation is due to inadequate O2 delivery to working
      muscle, limitations to the rate at which mitochondria can generate ATP to meet demand, or by
      a combination of both. Both of these limitations may be modulated by nitric oxide. Nitric
      oxide (NO) has been implicated in numerous physiological functions, including control of
      skeletal muscle vasodilation and oxidative metabolism. During exercise, NO will both
      vasodilate skeletal muscle and modulate (inhibit) mitochondrial respiration. The latter
      effect could either decrease oxygen extraction by limiting the ability of mitochondria to
      utilize oxygen, or paradoxically increase oxygen utilization by inhibiting mitochondria
      proximal to blood vessels, an effect that facilitates oxygen diffusion to distal tissue and
      mitochondria (NO dependent facilitated oxygen diffusion). Previous studies have demonstrated
      that NO production increases during exercise and regional inhibition of NO production from
      endothelial NO synthase reduces exercise-dependent blood flow by approximately 10%. NOS
      inhibitors such as N(G) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) have been shown to decrease
      exercise tolerance, and NO precursors (L-arginine) to increase exercise tolerance.
      Administration of inhaled NO during exercise has not been shown to increase exercise
      tolerance.

      Considering the potential role of nitrite bioconversion to NO during hypoxia, is likely that
      nitrite plays an important role in modulating exercise physiology. We therefore hypothesize
      that during aerobic, and in particular anaerobic exercise, erythrocyte and plasma nitrite
      will be converted to NO and modulate muscle blood flow, mitochondrial respiration, oxygen
      diffusion and ultimately maximal oxygen consumption. While we expect these effects will
      increase maximal oxygen consumption and increase work output, it is also distinctly possible
      that NO production from nitrite during exercise will inhibit mitochondrial respiration and
      decrease maximal oxygen consumption. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the
      effects of aerobic-to-anaerobic exercise on circulating nitrite stores in erythrocytes and
      plasma in the arterial and central venous circulation and the effects of systemic nitrite
      infusion on aerobic and anaerobic exercise capacity. Physiological parameters including
      maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), maximal CO2 and NO production (VCO2max and VNOmax),
      maximal work, rate of perceived exertion (RPE), anaerobic threshold, and pulmonary gas
      exchange (VO2, VCO2, VE) will be monitored during exercise with and without nitrite
      infusions. Our primary endpoint will be VO2 max with nitrite infusion compared to VO2 max
      with saline placebo infusion.
