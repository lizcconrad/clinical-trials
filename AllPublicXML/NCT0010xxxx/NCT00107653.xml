    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 48 and Week 72</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a 10-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess tiredness, lack of energy, or total body give-out. Participants were to react to nine statements regarding fatigue over the previous 2 weeks, each on a scale (1 = completely agree, 7 = completely disagree). The FSS is the average of the scores on the 9 questions; ranging from 1-7, with lower scores indicating less fatigue. In addition, participants were to react to how much fatigue they had in the past 2 weeks by marking on a visual analogue scale (VAS) labelled at one end with &quot;no fatigue&quot; ('0' being the best) and at the other end with &quot;greater fatigue&quot; ('100' being the worst). Longer distance on the scale from &quot;no fatigue&quot; indicated &quot;greater fatigue&quot;. FSS values are presented based on questionnaire and visual analog scale. FSS values at week 48 and 72 are presented based on questionnaire and visual analog scale.</description>

    <description>The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item self-report questionnaire that includes 8 domain scales The 8 domains are incorporated into 2 components: mental and physical. The mental component (MC) includes social functioning, role limitations-emotional, mental health, and vitality. The physical component (PC) includes physical functioning, role limitations-physical, bodily pain, and general health perception. Raw domain scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, [0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score]. Two summary scale scores were computed based on weighted combinations of the 8 domain scores (Physical and the Mental Component) where no minimum or maximum score; higher score indicate better health status. The difference between study groups in change from baseline in SF-36 score at week 48 and 72 was analysed.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or results in disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Activity and Fibrosis Scores Based on METAVIR Activity at Week 72</title>
          <description>METAVIR activity scores are categorised as histological activity (A) 0 = none; A1 = mild; A2 = moderate; A3 = severe where ‘0’ being ‘No activity’ and ‘3’ being ‘the sever activity’. Changes in liver inflammation defined as Improved: Participants whose METAVIR activity score at up to Month-72 decreases by 1 or more units compared to baseline; stable: Participants whose METAVIR activity score at up to Month-72 is the same as the baseline score; worsened: Participants whose METAVIR activity score at up to Month-72 increases by 1 or more units compared to baseline. METAVIR fibrosis scores are categorised as fibrosis (F) 0 = no fibrosis; F1 = without septa; F 2 = with septa; F3 = many septa; F4 = cirrhosis where; ‘0’ being the best and ‘4’ being the worst. Decrease in score from baseline indicates improvement. The difference between study groups in change from baseline in activity and fibrosis scores based on METAVIR at week 72 was analysed.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Fatigue Severity Scale Score and Fatigue Severity Scale Score Item 10 Visual Analog Scale Score From Baseline at Week 48 and Week 72</title>
        <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a 10-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess tiredness, lack of energy, or total body give-out. Participants were to react to nine statements regarding fatigue over the previous 2 weeks, each on a scale (1 = completely agree, 7 = completely disagree). The FSS is the average of the scores on the 9 questions; ranging from 1-7, with lower scores indicating less fatigue. In addition, participants were to react to how much fatigue they had in the past 2 weeks by marking on a visual analogue scale (VAS) labelled at one end with “no fatigue” (‘0’ being the best) and at the other end with “greater fatigue” (‘100’ being the worst). Longer distance on the scale from “no fatigue” indicated “greater fatigue”. FSS values are presented based on questionnaire and visual analog scale. FSS values at week 48 and 72 are presented based on questionnaire and visual analog scale.</description>

        <description>The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item self-report questionnaire that includes 8 domain scales The 8 domains are incorporated into 2 components: mental and physical. The mental component (MC) includes social functioning, role limitations-emotional, mental health, and vitality. The physical component (PC) includes physical functioning, role limitations-physical, bodily pain, and general health perception. Raw domain scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, [0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score]. Two summary scale scores were computed based on weighted combinations of the 8 domain scores (Physical and the Mental Component) where no minimum or maximum score; higher score indicate better health status. The difference between study groups in change from baseline in SF-36 score at week 48 and 72 was analysed.</description>

          <description>The 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item self-report questionnaire that includes 8 domain scales The 8 domains are incorporated into 2 components: mental and physical. The mental component (MC) includes social functioning, role limitations-emotional, mental health, and vitality. The physical component (PC) includes physical functioning, role limitations-physical, bodily pain, and general health perception. Raw domain scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, [0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score]. Two summary scale scores were computed based on weighted combinations of the 8 domain scores (Physical and the Mental Component) where no minimum or maximum score; higher score indicate better health status. The difference between study groups in change from baseline in SF-36 score at week 48 and 72 was analysed.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event could therefore be any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Pre-existing conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events. A serious adverse event (SAE) was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or results in disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>
