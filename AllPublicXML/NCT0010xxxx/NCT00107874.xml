  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) ranks among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and
      mortality, both in developed and developing countries.

      With this trial, we sought to determine the effectiveness of oral misoprostol as an
      uterotonic drug in comparison with intravenous oxytocin, in patients with a low risk of PPH
      undergoing non-scheduled Cesarean section.

      We therefore compared the intra- and postoperative blood loss, as well as drug related side
      effects in patients, treated by the same surgical and anesthesiological team in one
      institution.

    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is still among the leading causes of maternal morbidity and
      mortality. The incidence of PPH is reduced by active management of the third stage of labor
      which includes the use of uterotonics for pharmacological prophylaxis. However, there is an
      on-going debate about the optimal drug selection since uterotonics such as oxytocin and
      methylergometrine are liable for specific side effects and complications when administered
      within a dose range needed to be effective for PPH. In the search for an alternative to these
      conventional standard uterotonics, misoprostol (prostaglandin E1) has turned out to be an
      effective therapeutic option and has been implemented in actual treatment regimens. The
      objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of oral applicated misoprostol
      versus intravenous oxytocin in reducing blood loss in low risk obstetric patients undergoing
      non-scheduled cesarean section (CS) under spinal anesthesia.

      Comparison:

      In this prospective, double blind study, parturients undergoing CS were randomized to receive
      either a) oral misoprostol and an infusion of normal saline supplemented with placebo, or b)
      an oral placebo and an infusion of normal saline, supplemented with oxytocin subsequently to
      intravenous oxytocin after cord clamping in both groups.

      The primary outcomes were the amount of intra- and postoperative blood loss and the
      occurrence of drug-related side effects.
