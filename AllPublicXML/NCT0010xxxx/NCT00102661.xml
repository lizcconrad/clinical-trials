      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving CAMPATH-1H first as an
      injection into a vein, then as an injection under the skin can shrink or slow the growth of
      the disease in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have already received
      standard therapy. Another goal is to learn if the side effects related to CAMPATH-1H
      treatment are less severe by giving the drug first as an injection into a vein then as an
      injection under the skin.

      The purposes of this trial are:

        1. To evaluate the response rate (CR+PR) to CAMPATH-1H given as continuous infusion
           followed by subcutaneous injection in patients with previously treated CLL who have
           failed fludarabine therapy.

        2. To evaluate whether CAMPATH-1H, given as a continuous infusion followed by subcutaneous
           injections to patients with previously treated CLL will improve tolerability of the
           agent and permit higher doses to be delivered through that route.

        3. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of CAMPATH-1H when given as a 24 hour continuous
           infusion followed by a subcutaneous injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years (CLL does not occur in the pediatric population).

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Patients with B-CLL who have received fludarabine and are either refractory to
             frontline therapy or have relapsed within six months from receiving fludarabine-based
             therapy. Patients previously treated with Campath-1H are eligible.

             normal (ULN) unless due to direct infiltration of the liver or kidney with malignant
             cells.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past history of anaphylaxis, following exposure to rat or mouse derived CDR-grafted
             humanized monoclonal antibodies.

          -  Prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or hormonal therapy within 2 weeks prior to study
             start. Hormonal replacement therapy is permitted. Prior therapy with monoclonal
             antibodies for at least 4 weeks prior to study start.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or any patient of childbearing age unwilling to practice an
             acceptable form of contraception.

          -  Patients with history of HIV positivity.

          -  Active uncontrolled infection or any major systemic or other illness that would, in
             the opinion of the investigator, interfere with the patient's ability to comply with
             the protocol, compromise patient safety or interfere with the interpretation of study
             results.
