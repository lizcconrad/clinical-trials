      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving trastuzumab together with capecitabine may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving trastuzumab together with
      capecitabine works in treating women with metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the median survival time and 2-year survival rate in women with taxane- and
           anthracycline-refractory HER2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer treated with
           trastuzumab (Herceptin®) and capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the clinical benefit rate of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior treatment
      with trastuzumab (Herceptin®) (yes vs no), HER2/neu status (3+ by immunohistochemistry vs
      positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization), and class of refractory disease (primary vs
      secondary vs treatment discontinuation due to adverse events).

      Patients receive oral capecitabine once daily on days 1-21 and trastuzumab IV on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
