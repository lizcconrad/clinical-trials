    <textblock>
      Pfizer suspended enrollment on 21 August 2006 as a precautionary measure in light of the
      mortality imbalance seen in a similar study, and terminated the study on April 6, 2007 due to
      factors affecting the timeline to completion, such as slow enrollment and inclusion of
      sufficient evaluable subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be eligible for this study, a patient must provide informed consent and must meet
             all of the following criteria. No study procedures, including any baseline tests,
             should be performed until the patient (or parent/legally acceptable representative, if
             appropriate) legally signs the informed consent form.

          -  Male or female, 18 years of age or older and &gt;= 40 kg body weight

          -  End-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis with: A) Signs and symptoms of a
             localized catheter-related infection (eg tenderness and/or pain, erythema, swelling,
             purulent exudates within 2 cm of entry site); OR B) A body temperature of &gt;= 38.0 C or
             &lt; 36.0 C (oral equivalent); OR C) A Gram-positive blood culture. If the Gram-positive
             isolate is S. aureus, it must be cultured from at least 1 culture bottle from either
             the peripheral set or the catheter set of culture bottles. For all other Gram-positive
             pathogens (eg, coagulase-negative staphylococci), isolates need to be cultured from at
             least 2 culture bottles of which one must be from the peripheral set. There must be no
             other obvious source of the bacteremia

          -  Presence of at least one of the following systemic signs of infection (may be obtained
             up to 24 hours prior to baseline): *Hypotension, defined as systolic blood pressure
             &lt;90 mmHg or its reduction by &gt;= 40 mmHg from the patient's baseline, in the absence of
             other causes for hypotension; *Tachycardia defined as a pulse rate &gt; 90 beats per
             minute; *Tachypnea defined as a respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths per minute or PACO2 &lt;32
