  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a behavioral clinical trial of aerobic exercise to determine dose-response
      effects on risk for type 2 diabetes, fatness, fitness, blood cholesterol levels, and other
      cardiovascular risk factors in overweight elementary schoolchildren.

      The hypothesis is that the more exercise a child does, the more benefit he or she will gain
      in reducing the risk of diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases.

      An ancillary study examined effects on cognition and achievement.

      The study is a behavioral clinical trial of aerobic exercise to determine dose-response
      effects on insulin response to the oral glucose tolerance test, body composition, fitness,
      lipid profile, inflammation and other metabolic syndrome components in overweight elementary
      schoolchildren.

      Blinded psychological assessments of cognition and achievement were obtained.
