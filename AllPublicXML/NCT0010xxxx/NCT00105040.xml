      A 12-week Evaluation Period will be used to characterize potential cognitive and
      neuropsychological effects of LEV (20 - 60 mg/kg/day), as adjunctive treatment in children 4
      - 16 years old, inclusive, with refractory partial onset seizures when compared to adjunctive
      treatment with placebo.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Leiter International Performance Scale-Revised (Leiter-R) Attention and Memory (AM) Battery's Memory Screen Composite Score from Baseline (Visit 2) to the end of the Evaluation Period (Week 12 or Early Discontinuation Visit)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 2) to the end of the Evaluation Period (Week 12 or Early Discontinuation Visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The Leiter-R includes two groupings of sub-tests: (1) the Visualization and Reasoning (VR) Battery with 10 sub-tests of nonverbal intellectual ability related to visualization, reasoning, and spatial ability; and (2) the Attention and Memory (AM) Battery with 10 sub-tests of nonverbal attention and memory function. The Examiner Rating Scale has 49 items that describe the child's activity level, attention, impulse control, and other emotional characteristics that may interact with test performance. The focus of the items is on actions, verbalizations, moods and other behaviors of the child. The examiner rates the child using the following scale: 0 = rarely or never; 1 = sometimes; 2 = often; 3 = usually or always.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning-Second Edition (WRAML-2) General Memory from Baseline to Week 12 or Early Discontinuation Visit (EDV)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12 or EDV</time_frame>
    <description>The WRAML-2 is comprised of 2 Verbal, 2 Visual, and 2 Attention-Concentration sub-tests, yielding a Verbal Memory Index, a Visual Memory Index and an Attention-Concentration Index. Together these sub-tests yield a General Memory Index. Scaled and standard scores allow performance comparisons based on age and 4 delayed recall sub-tests include guidelines for determining the level of recall. A composite General Memory Index score will be computed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric subjects (4 - 16 years old) diagnosed with refractory partial onset seizures
             for a minimum of six months prior to Visit 1 experiencing at least two partial onset
             seizures during the four weeks prior to Visit 1 will be enrolled

          -  Subjects should be on a stable regimen of one or a maximum of two other antiepileptic
             drugs (AEDs) for at least 2 weeks prior to Visit 1

          -  Subject must have an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) as assessed during Visit 1 of at least
             70

          -  Subject and parent/guardian should be fluent in English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must not have had previous treatment with levetiracetam unless, in the opinion
             of the investigator, the subject's previous treatment was inadequate in dose or
             duration to provide an accurate assessment of the therapy, or the effect of
             levetiracetam was confounded by concomitant medication

          -  Subject is receiving benzodiazepines on a routine or chronic basic and is unable to
             discontinue use four weeks prior to Visit 1

          -  Subject has seizures too close together to accurately count

          -  Subject has a current psychiatric disorder other than mild to moderate attention
             deficit, behavior, or learning disorders
