        Inclusion Criteria: - Have evaluable disease - Must be able to undergo MRI evaluation:

          1. Must not have cardiac pacemakers or neurostimulators not specifically approved for use
             in the MRI environment;

          2. Must not have metal implants, other than those approved as safe for use in MRI;

          3. Must not be claustrophobic or have physical characteristics that will preclude
             undergoing MRI; - Subjects enrolling to the Dose Expansion Cohort must have at least
             one tumor that is amenable to DCE-MRI evaluation (e.g., greater than or equal to 3 cm
             lesion outside the thoracic cavity) - Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             performance status of less than or equal to 2 - Adequate hematologic, renal and
             hepatic function Exclusion Criteria: - Presence of untreated CNS metastasis or
             symptoms of brain metastases - Presence of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome -
             History of high-dose chemotherapy requiring bone marrow or peripheral stem cell
             support - Unstable or uncontrolled disease or condition related to or impacting
             cardiac function (e.g., unstable angina, congestive heart failure [NYHA greater than
             class II], uncontrolled hypertension [diastolic greater than 85 mmHg; systolic greater
             than 145 mmHg] or cardiac arrhythmia) - History of arterial thrombosis (i.e., stroke,
             transient ischemic attack or myocardial infarction) within 6 months of study day 1 -
             History of bleeding diathesis or hypercoagulopathy within 6 months of study day 1 -
             Active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis - Unresolved toxicities from prior
             anti-cancer therapy, excluding alopecia - Anti-tumor treatment within 3 weeks of study
             day 1. If anti-tumor treatment was an antibody therapy, the interval must be 6 weeks -
             Anticoagulation therapy, except a low dose of Coumadinâ„¢ (less than 2 mg) for
             prophylaxis against central catheter-related thrombosis - Major surgery within 4 weeks
             of study day 1 - History of allergic reaction to bacterially produced proteins - Known
             positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, hepatitis C virus or
             chronic hepatitis B infection - Pregnant or breastfeeding - Not using adequate
             contraceptive precautions, in the judgment of the investigator
