  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the HOPE-2 study is to determine whether long term supplementation with folic
      acid, vitamins B6 and B12 aimed at homocyst(e)ine reduction reduces the rates of major fatal
      and nonfatal cardiovascular events in patients with established cardiovascular disease and/or
      diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in most
      developed countries and accounts for approximately 40% of all deaths in Canada. Reductions in
      cholesterol, lowering of blood pressure and smoking cessation have been shown to be effective
      strategies in cardiovascular prevention; however, these major &quot;classical cardiovascular risk
      factors&quot; along with nonmodifiable risk factors, cannot fully explain why certain individuals
      develop atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, while others do not. Other &quot;emerging&quot;
      cardiovascular risk factors are currently under investigation. There is a large body of
      consistent, biologically plausible evidence linking hyperhomocyst(e)inemia to cardiovascular
      risk and the association is graded. A simple, nontoxic therapeutic intervention in the form
      of multivitamins - folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 - has been shown to be highly effective
      in reducing homocyst(e)ine levels, irrespective of the underlying cause. To date, however,
      there are no good clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of homocyst(e)ine-lowering
      therapies in reducing major cardiovascular events. The impact of this simple intervention on
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remains to be demonstrated.

      Study Hypothesis: Evaluate if long-term therapy with folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12
      compared to placebo reduces the risk of major fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events.

      Importance of the Study: The &quot;homocyst(e)ine theory of atherosclerosis&quot; remains an important
      unanswered question in cardiovascular medicine. If indeed a combination of multivitamins is
      found to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events, it is expected that this safe,
      inexpensive and easily administered therapy would be widely used world-wide. Therefore, the
      results of this trial could have a significant public health impact.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women and men 55 years of age or over with established CVD and at high risk for future
             fatal and nonfatal CV events, defined as:

               1. Documented coronary artery disease (CAD);

               2. Documented peripheral vascular disease (PVD);

               3. Documented cerebrovascular disease;

               4. Diabetes with one of the following; additional cardiovascular risk factors:

             i) hypertension (BP &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg diastolic or on treatment); ii)
             total cholesterol &gt;5.2 mmol/L (&gt;200 mg/dl); iii) HDL cholesterol &lt;0.9 mmol/L (3.5
             mg/dl); iv) current cigarette smoker; v) any evidence of previous vascular disease

          -  Provision of informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use of any vitamin supplements containing folic acid &gt;200 micrograms/day. The
             patients taking such vitamin supplements can be asked if they agree to discontinue
             these supplements. If they agree, they can be randomized to the study following a one
             month wash-out period.

          -  Known previous adverse reactions to folic acid and/or vitamin B6 and/or B12.

          -  Planned cardiac, peripheral or cerebrovascular revascularization, defined as a
             decision taken by the patient and his or her physician(s) to perform surgical or
             percutaneous transluminal revascularization within the next 6 months.

          -  Hemodynamically significant primary valvular outflow tract obstruction (e.g. mitral
             stenosis, asymmetric septal hypertrophy, malfunctioning prosthetic valve).

          -  Constrictive pericarditis.

          -  Syncopal episodes presumed to be due to uncontrolled life-threatening arrhythmias
             (asymptomatic arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia are not exclusion
             criteria.
