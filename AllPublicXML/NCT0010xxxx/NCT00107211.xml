      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides and a person's white blood cells may help the body
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Injecting the vaccine directly into a
      lymph node may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. Giving vaccine
      therapy before surgery may be effective treatment for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best way to give vaccine therapy
      in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and safety of neoadjuvant ultrasound-guided intranodal vaccine
           therapy comprising autologous dendritic cells pulsed with recombinant HER2/neu peptides
           in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.

        -  Determine the sensitization of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to HER2/neu in patients treated
           with this vaccine.

        -  Determine clinical response in patients treated with this vaccine.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate post-vaccine sensitization of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to HER2/neu with clinical
           response in patients treated with this vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis over 2-3 hours to obtain lymphocytes and monocytes. Monocytes
      are cultured with sargramostim (GM-CSF), interleukin-4, interferon gamma, and
      lipopolysaccharides for the production of dendritic cells (DC). DC are then pulsed with
      recombinant HER2/neu peptides to produce the dendritic cell vaccine. Approximately 2 days
      after leukapheresis, patients receive the vaccine intranodally (into 2 different lymph nodes)
      by ultrasound guidance once a week for 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients then undergo a second leukapheresis to obtain T lymphocytes for immunologic
      analysis. Within 2-3 weeks after completion of vaccine therapy, patients undergo lumpectomy
      or mastectomy AND sentinel lymph node biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
