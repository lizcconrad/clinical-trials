      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Radiosurgery may be
      able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving
      radiation therapy or radiosurgery after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not
      yet known whether radiation therapy or radiosurgery is more effective than observation alone
      in treating benign meningioma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy or radiosurgery to see
      how well they work compared to observation alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed,
      benign meningioma that has been partially removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare progression-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed, incompletely
           resected, benign intracranial grade I meningioma treated with adjuvant conventional
           fractionated radiotherapy or radiosurgery vs observation only.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of a second surgery in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the incidence of acute and long-term neurotoxicity in patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      post-surgery MRI staging (3 vs 4 vs 5), skull base location (yes vs no), age (&lt; 60 vs â‰¥ 60),
      and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo observation only.

        -  Arm II: Within 4-7 months after surgery, patients undergo conventional fractionated
           radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 6 weeks OR a single treatment of high-dose
           radiosurgery in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 6 months after randomization, and then annually
      thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 and 6 months after
      randomization and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 478 patients (239 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3-4 years.
