      This study will evaluate whether interleukin-7 (IL-7) a drug similar to the natural IL-7
      protein produced by the body, is safe to use in people infected with HIV. IL-7 is important
      in immune system function. In humans, it can extend the life of immune cells called T-cells
      and increase their function and maturation; in mice, it can speed up immune system recovery
      following chemotherapy of transplantation; and in monkeys, it can make T-cells increase in
      numbers. If this study shows that IL-7 is safe, other trials will determine if it can improve
      the numbers or function of T-cells in HIV-infected people.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with HIV infection who have been taking anti-HIV
      medications for at least 12 months, whose CD4 counts are at least 100 cells/microliter, and
      whose viral load is no more than 50,000 copies/milliliter may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates are screened with a physical examination, blood and urine tests, including a blood
      test for HLA type (a genetic test of markers of the immune system), chest x-ray,
      electrocardiogram, and ultrasound of the spleen.

      Participants undergo the following tests and procedures during 9 visits, as follows:

      Pre-entry visit

        -  Brief physical examination, including examination of lymph nodes and spleen.

        -  Medical history, including questions about current and past medications.

        -  Urine pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant.

        -  Blood draw for viral load, immune responses, and other routine safety tests.

      Entry visit

        -  Complete physical examination, including examination of lymph nodes and spleen.

        -  Routine urine test and urine pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant.

        -  Blood draw for viral load, immune responses, and other routine safety tests.

        -  IL-7 dosing. Participants are randomly assigned to receive one of five doses of IL-7 (3,
           10, 30, 60 or 100 micrograms per kilogram of body weight) or placebo (a salt solution
           that does not contain IL-7). The dose may be given in one or more injections, with
           higher doses possibly requiring as many as seven or eight injections. The injections are
           given subcutaneously (under the skin), usually in the arm or leg. After the injection,
           patients are monitored closely for 12 hours for skin or allergic reactions. Blood is
           drawn before the injection and again at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 8 and 12 hours after the
           injection to check blood levels of the study medication.

      Follow-up visits

      Patients come to the clinic 7 times during follow-up-every day for the first 4 days after the
      injection, then at 14 days, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after the injection. At most study visits,
      patients have the following procedures:

        -  Brief physical examination, including examination of lymph nodes and spleen.

        -  Routine urine test and urine pregnancy test for women who are able to become pregnant.

        -  Blood draw for viral load, immune responses, and other routine safety tests.

        -  Blood test to measure the amount of study medication in the blood 1, 2, and 3 days after
           the injection

        -  Electrocardiogram 1 day after the injection

      Interleukin 7 is an essential cytokine for the thymic development and the post-thymic
      survival, expansion and maturation of the T lymphocytes in humans. Therapeutic use of IL7 in
      mouse models has shown enhancement of immune reconstitution after chemotherapy or bone marrow
      transplantation. The rationale for using IL-7 as immunotherapy in HIV infection would be to
      support the expansion, survival and functional properties of T lymphocytes and enhance immune
      reconstitution. More specifically, IL7 may provide the means to support CD4 expansions in
      patients with good viral suppression but persistent low CD4 counts (immunologic
      non-responders) or in patients who have no available antiretroviral options. Finally, given
      the role of IL7 in T cell memory maturation and survival, IL-7 may be a promising vaccine
      adjuvant.

      Studies of rhIL7 in non-human primates have shown that T cell proliferation and expansion can
      be achieved at doses that are well tolerated without significant toxicity. A safety study in
      cancer patients is currently ongoing at the NCI. A5214 (Pleiades) will be the first study of
      rhIL7 to evaluate the safety of a single subcutaneous injection in HIV infected adults.
      Eligible subjects (CD4 greater than 100 cells/micro l and VL less than 50,000 copies/ml, on
      antiretroviral therapy for at least one year) will be stratified by viral load (less than 50
      or 50-50,000 copies/ml) and will be randomized 3:1 to receive rhIL7 or placebo.

      Pleiades is a phase I, double-blind trial that will test the safety of a single subcutaneous
      injection of IL-7 at 5 different doses (3, 10, 30, 60 and 100 micro g/kg) tested
      sequentially. Four subjects will enroll in each dose level and dose escalation will occur
      only after all subjects complete four weeks without evidence of dose-limiting toxicities as
      reviewed by the safety monitoring committee. Secondary end points include a PK study of rhIL7
      as well as immunologic studies throughout the duration of the study to assess evidence of IL7
      biologic activity with markers of T cell activation, proliferation and differentiation as
      well as expression of the alpha chain of the IL7 receptor.

      This is an Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group (AACTG) study and the NIAID will participate as a
      site. The NIAID site will follow all NIAID IRB reporting requirements and all grade 1 and 2
      toxicities will be included in the annual review. Children will be excluded and a separate
      study will be required in the future after the safety and biologic activity of this agent is
      established in adults.

      The study will enroll a total of 40-80 patients followed for a total of eight weeks, with
      approximately 15-20 anticipated to enroll in our site.

        agree that two reliable methods of contraception will be used simultaneously while
        receiving the protocol-specified medication(s) and for 8 weeks after stopping the
        medication(s):
