  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, randomized, open-label, multicenter, comparative study designed to further
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous (i.v.) daptomycin and the safety and efficacy of
      daptomycin relative to comparator in the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure
      infections in patients with renal impairment.
