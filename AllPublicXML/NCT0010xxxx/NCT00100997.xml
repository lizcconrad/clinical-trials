      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. It may also stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin in treating patients with chronic phase chronic
      myelogenous leukemia that did not respond to imatinib mesylate.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of
           17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), in terms of frequency, severity, and
           duration of treatment-emergent adverse events, in patients with imatinib
           mesylate-resistant Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic phase chronic
           myelogenous leukemia.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug and its primary metabolite
           (17-amino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin) in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the hematologic response rate, in terms of WBC count, platelet count, and
           assessment of blast cells in peripheral blood, in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the cytogenic response rate, in terms of Ph-positive progenitor cells in the
           bone marrow, in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Assess the effect of this drug on pharmacodynamic markers (i.e., CRKL phosphorylation,
           BCR-ABL kinase activity, and BCR-ABL, RAF kinase, and HSP70 expression) in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 15 minutes or 1
      hour (depending on the dose administered) once on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or disease progression. Eligible patients may receive additional courses of 17-AAG at the
      discretion of the investigator.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 10 additional patients are treated at the
      MTD.

      Patients are followed for 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
