  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women or men greater than or equal to 18 years of age

          -  ECOG status less than or equal to 2 (a measurement to determine your ability to
             perform daily activities)

          -  In Parts I, III, and IV, patient must have a histologically confirmed, metastatic or
             locally advanced solid tumor that has failed to respond to standard therapy,
             progressed despite standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist.
             There is no limit on the number of prior treatment regimens

          -  In Part II, only breast cancer patients are eligible

          -  In Part V, only patients with Numb negative breast cancer (i.e., tumor shows Numb
             immunoreactivity in less than 10% of the neoplastic cells assessed) are eligible

          -  Patient has recovered from and is at least 2 weeks from previous antineoplastic
             therapy, including chemotherapy, biological therapy (including Herceptin), hormonal
             therapy, radiotherapy, or surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has had an investigational treatment in the preceding 21 days

          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction (heart attack) within 3
             months of study start

          -  History of hepatitis B or C or HIV

          -  Patient has the presence of clinically apparent central nervous system metastases or
             carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with CNS metastases who have completed a course of
             radiotherapy and are clinically stable in the judgment of the investigator are
             eligible

          -  Patients with &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin
             cancer, should not be enrolled. Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently
             active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy for prior malignancy and are
             considered by their physician to be at &lt;30% risk of relapse
