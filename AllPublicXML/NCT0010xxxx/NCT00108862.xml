      The purpose of this study is to determine the best time to begin anti-HIV treatment in
      individuals who have HIV and tuberculosis (TB).

      Study hypothesis: Immediate antiretroviral therapy (ART), initiated after approximately 2
      weeks of TB treatment, will reduce the frequency of other AIDS-defining illnesses and death
      in HIV-infected participants being treated for TB by at least 40% at week 48 when compared to
      deferred ART, initiated at after 8-12 weeks of TB treatment.

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) is the most important co-infection in the HIV epidemic; the bi-directional
      relationship between the two diseases is well established. HIV increases the risk for TB
      acquisition, reactivation, and reinfection, and reduces survival compared to patients with TB
      alone. In individuals with HIV, TB infection results in reduced survival, increased risk for
      opportunistic infections, and elevations in HIV replication. Improving the outcome of
      HIV-infected individuals who develop TB is of high importance. Initiating antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) shortly after initiating TB treatment may improve outcomes in individuals
      co-infected with HIV and TB. However, data to support this suggestion were limited before
      this study began. This study will determine the most appropriate time to initiate ART in
      HIV-infected individuals who recently initiated treatment for TB.

      This study lasted 48 weeks and comprised two steps. At study entry, participants underwent
      clinical assessment, drug adherence training, and blood collection. In Step 1, participants
      were randomly assigned to one of two arms. Participants in Arm A initiated ART after
      approximately 2 weeks of TB treatment. Participants in Arm B deferred ART until after 8 to 12
      weeks of TB treatment. In Step 2, Arm B participants initiated ART; Arm A participants did
      not enter Step 2. ART consisted of efavirenz (EFV) and emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF); FTC and TDF could be given as individual agents. Drug
      substitutions could be made for participants who could not tolerate the specified regimen.
      Blood collection and clinical assessments occurred at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48.

    <time_frame>Through week 48</time_frame>
    <description>As this was a study of the strategy of providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the initial treatment of TB versus deferring ART until TB was treated for 8-12 weeks, all eligible participants randomized were followed for 48 weeks, whether they started ART as scheduled, whether they started ART at all, or even if the participant did not have TB and discontinued TB treatment. The percent surviving without a new AIDS-defining illness was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier estimator with an associated standard error.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Participants With Confirmed or Probable Tuberculosis (TB) Whose TB Resolved, or Who Required TB Treatment Through the End of Follow-up, or Died, or Were Lost to Follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through week 48</time_frame>
    <description>TB treatment outcome was assessed in the 800 eligible participants who had confirmed or probable TB at study entry. The sites determined if the TB was resolved. If TB was not resolved, TB treatment outcome status was determined based on whether TB treatment was ongoing at the last study visit; if the participant died while TB treatment was ongoing; or if the participant was lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, or other reason for lacking TB resolution status. Percents were calculated with associated standard errors.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study participants were recruited at 26 sites from 13 countries: 4 each from U.S. and South Africa; 3 from Brazil; 2 each from Peru, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, and India; and 1 each from Haiti, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Thailand, between September 2006 and August 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>HIV-infected persons at least 13 years of age, naive to antiretroviral therapy, who had received 1-14 cumulative days of a rifamycin-based TB regimen within 28 days prior to study entry, and had a CD4 count &lt;250 cells/mm3. Randomization was stratified by screening CD4 (&lt;50 vs =&gt;50). Three participants were deemed ineligible and taken off study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Immediate ART</title>
          <description>These participants initiated HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 72 hours of randomization, which took place at most 2 weeks after initiating rifampin (RIF)- or other rifamycin-based TB treatment according to in-country national TB treatment guidelines. The study-provided drugs were efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg (provided to non-U.S. sites only; 1 tablet orally) and emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg (1 fixed-dose combination tablet orally) once daily. FTC 200 mg (1 capsule) and TDF 300 mg (1 tablet) could be substituted for the fixed-dose combination tablet and was provided by the study. Participants who could not tolerate EFV could be offered nevirapine (NVP) 200 mg daily for 14 days, then 200 mg twice daily. Substitutions with other locally-available U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or tentatively approved antiretrovirals (ARVs) that were compatible with TB therapy could be used at the discretion of the site investigator.</description>

        <title>Percent of Participants Who Survived Without AIDS Progression.</title>
        <description>As this was a study of the strategy of providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the initial treatment of TB versus deferring ART until TB was treated for 8-12 weeks, all eligible participants randomized were followed for 48 weeks, whether they started ART as scheduled, whether they started ART at all, or even if the participant did not have TB and discontinued TB treatment. The percent surviving without a new AIDS-defining illness was calculated using a Kaplan-Meier estimator with an associated standard error.</description>

The study-provided drugs were efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg (provided to non-U.S. sites only; 1 tablet orally) and emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg (1 fixed-dose combination tablet orally) once daily. FTC 200 mg (1 capsule) and TDF 300 mg (1 tablet) could be substituted for the fixed-dose combination tablet and was provided by the study. Participants who could not tolerate EFV could be offered nevirapine (NVP) 200 mg daily for 14 days, then 200 mg twice daily. Substitutions with other locally-available U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or tentatively approved antiretrovirals (ARVs) that were compatible with TB therapy could be used at the discretion of the site investigator.</description>

        <description>TB treatment outcome was assessed in the 800 eligible participants who had confirmed or probable TB at study entry. The sites determined if the TB was resolved. If TB was not resolved, TB treatment outcome status was determined based on whether TB treatment was ongoing at the last study visit; if the participant died while TB treatment was ongoing; or if the participant was lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, or other reason for lacking TB resolution status.

            <description>These participants initiated HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) within 72 hours of randomization, which took place at most 2 weeks after initiating rifampin (RIF)- or other rifamycin-based TB treatment according to in-country national TB treatment guidelines. The study-provided drugs were efavirenz (EFV) 600 mg (provided to non-U.S. sites only; 1 tablet orally) and emtricitabine (FTC) 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg (1 fixed-dose combination tablet orally) once daily. FTC 200 mg (1 capsule) and TDF 300 mg (1 tablet) could be substituted for the fixed-dose combination tablet and was provided by the study. Participants who could not tolerate EFV could be offered nevirapine (NVP) 200 mg daily for 14 days, then 200 mg twice daily. Substitutions with other locally-available U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved or tentatively approved antiretrovirals (ARVs) that were compatible with TB therapy could be used at the discretion of the site investigator.</description>
