    <description>XL999 was to be given biweekly to an initial cohort of subjects at 0.20 mg/kg and to successive cohorts at doses that escalated by cohort according to a design for safely determining an MTD. After determination of the MTD, one or more additional cohorts were to receive XL999 weekly at the MTD or a lower dose, as determined by the CRC on the basis of interim safety and PK data. By a protocol amendment after initiation of the study, subjects were to be enrolled in an additional cohort to receive a weekly XL999 dose of 200 mg.</description>
