  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research study is to see if the study drug, named CP-724,714, can
      help in the treatment of certain breast cancers that have spread to other locations in the
      body. Other goals of this study are to measure how long it may take for the cancer to get
      worse (progress), to see if there are any side effects from the study drug, to check the
      amount of study drug in the blood at different times, and to check to see if there is any
      relationship between certain blood tests and how patients may respond to the study drug.

      About 25 subjects at 4 sites (hospitals and clinics) in Bulgaria and Russia will be involved
      in the trial. Participation in this study can last up to 48 weeks, depending on the
      participant's toleration of the study drug and the response of her tumor(s) to the study
      drug. All participants will receive CP-724,714, at a daily dose of 250 mg (4 pills) every 12
      hours.

    <textblock>
      Pfizer decided to terminate clinical protocol A4031003 on October 7, 2005 due to the
      excessive number of patients with grade 3 liver function test elevations and lack of
      efficacy.
