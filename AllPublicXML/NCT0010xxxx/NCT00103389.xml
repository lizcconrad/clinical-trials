      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. PI-88
      may stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It may
      also help docetaxel work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving
      docetaxel together with PI-88 may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving
      docetaxel together with PI-88 is more effective than docetaxel alone in treating non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying docetaxel and PI-88 to see how well they
      work when given together compared to docetaxel alone in treating patients with stage IIIB or
      stage IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the safety and efficacy of docetaxel with vs without PI-88 in patients with
           stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy markers of docetaxel and PI-88 in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety and potential efficacy of PI-88 alone as maintenance therapy in
           patients whose disease has been controlled with docetaxel and PI-88 combination therapy.

        -  Determine the safety and potential efficacy of PI-88 alone as third-line therapy in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I. Patients also receive PI-88
           subcutaneously once daily on days 1-4, 8-11, and 15-18.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in arm II with stable or responding disease
      after 6 courses may continue to receive PI-88 alone as maintenance therapy. Patients in arm I
      with progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity before the completion of 6 courses may
      receive PI-88 alone as third-line therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 100 patients will be accrued for this study.
