  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy postmenopausal women not currently taking hormone replacement or hormone modulating
      therapy take a 3-month course of estradiol/raloxifene/placebo to evaluate the effects of each
      on vascular function, as indicated by PET coronary flow reserve studies and brachial artery
      ultrasound, before and after use of the therapies. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled,
      blinded study.
