          -  Clinically stable COPD within 4 weeks prior to baseline visit (B0).

          -  Availability of a chest x-ray dated a maximum of 6 months prior to study baseline
             visit (B0) or a willingness to have a chest x-ray performed at visit (B0).

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  COPD exacerbation indicated by a treatment with systemic glucocorticosteroids not
             stopped at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit (B0)

             (B0)

          -  Diagnosis of asthma and/or other relevant lung disease (e.g. history of
             bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitis, lung resection, lung cancer,
             interstitial lung disease [e.g. fibrosis, silicosis, sarcoidosis], and active

             contraceptive devices, unless she is surgically sterilized/hysterectomized or
             post-menopausal &gt; 1 year or any other criteria considered sufficiently reliable by the
             investigator in individual cases

          -  Participation in another study (use of investigational product) within 30 days
             preceding the baseline visit (B0) or re-entry of patients already enrolled in this
