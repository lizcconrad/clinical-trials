      The purpose of this research is to study the safety and effectiveness of bilateral
      stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus as adjunctive therapy for reducing the
      frequency of seizures in adults diagnosed with epilepsy characterized by partial-onset
      seizures, with or without secondary generalization, that are refractory to antiepileptic
      medications.

      Medtronic, Inc. is sponsoring an investigational study of the Medtronic DBS Therapy for
      epilepsy, the company's deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy for patients with refractory
      epilepsy. Epilepsy is a condition that affects 2.3 million Americans, and about one-third of
      these patients are refractory, or continue to experience seizures despite a wide range of
      treatment options.

      The prospective, randomized, double-blind trial uses existing technology to test whether
      bilateral stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus can safely and effectively
      reduce seizure frequency in patients with epilepsy. It includes enrollment of 157 patients at
      17 sites in the U.S. 110 patients were implanted and monitored for 13 months following
      implant, with long-term follow-up until the device is approved or the study is stopped. 109
      of the 110 implanted subjects were randomized to Active stimulation or Control.

      Patients in the active group, who received neurostimulation, were monitored for a reduction
      in seizure rates compared to the control group, who did not receive neurostimulation during
      the three-month double-blind phase. After the double-blind phase, all patients received
      neurostimulation.

      Candidates for the trial were adults with partial-onset epilepsy for whom at least three
      antiepileptic drugs have proven ineffective. They were to have had an average of six or more
      seizures per month. Candidates continued to receive their epilepsy medications while
      participating in the trial.

      Deep brain stimulation therapy has already received approval in the United States, Europe,
      Canada, and Australia for the treatment of Essential Tremor and Parkinson's disease. Deep
      brain stimulation is not approved in the United States for the treatment of epilepsy.

    <description>A protocol-prespecified generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis was used to evaluate the treatment effect on seizure frequency. The final GEE model for the primary objective evaluation included treatment effect, log of the baseline seizure count, log of age, visit (categorical), treatment-by-visit interaction (categorical), and the offset (the number of days the diary was recorded in each month).</description>

    <description>A generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis was used to evaluate the treatment effect on seizure frequency.

        Relevant Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria are listed below.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization. The final
             determination shall be made by the Investigator based on a clinical description of the
             seizures and previous diagnostic testing that includes, at a minimum, video/clinical
             EEG that captured at least one ictal event.

             between seizures during the Baseline Phase.

          -  Refractory to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Patients will be considered refractory if
             they have failed at least three AEDs due to lack of efficacy.

          -  Receiving one to four currently marketed AEDs

          -  Be between 18 and 65 years of age at the time of lead implant

          -  Symptomatic generalized epilepsy

          -  Previous diagnosis of psychogenic/non-epileptic seizures

          -  Presence of implanted electrical stimulation medical device anywhere in the body
             (e.g., cardiac pacemakers, spinal cord stimulator) or any metallic implants in the
             head (e.g., aneurysm clip, cochlear implant). Vagal nerve stimulators are allowed if
             the device has been turned off for at least 30 days prior to the Baseline Week -12

        <title>Primary Analysis: Change in Seizure Rate</title>
        <description>A protocol-prespecified generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis was used to evaluate the treatment effect on seizure frequency. The final GEE model for the primary objective evaluation included treatment effect, log of the baseline seizure count, log of age, visit (categorical), treatment-by-visit interaction (categorical), and the offset (the number of days the diary was recorded in each month).</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events were collected throughout the study. The summaries below include events that occurred during the blinded phase. A summary of device related events (operative phase through Year 2) is in the safety characterization objective.</time_frame>
      <desc>Adverse events collected during the blinded phase have been included, regardless of causality.
Because the primary purpose of this adverse event summary is to compare the randomization groups, and because the additional non-randomized subject did not have a similar follow-up schedule, the subject has not been included in these analyses.</desc>
