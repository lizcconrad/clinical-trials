  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective immune response
      to kill tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as GM-CSF, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate
      cancer cells. Drugs, such as bicalutamide and goserelin, may stop the adrenal glands from
      making androgens in patients whose tumor cells continue to grow. Giving vaccine therapy
      together with GM-CSF and, when needed, androgen ablation may be a more effective treatment
      for prostate cancer. This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together
      with GM-CSF works in treating patients with prostate cancer that progressed after surgery
      and/or radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of PROSTVAC-V/TRICOM (Vaccinia) on cycle 1 followed by
      PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM (Fowlpox) and GM-CSF on biochemical PSA progression at 6 months.

      II. To determine the change in PSA velocity pre-treatment to post-treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the percentage of patients experiencing a &gt;50% decline in serum PSA repeated
      at 4 weeks.

      II. To evaluate tolerability and any toxicity related to treatment with PSA vaccine and
      GM-CSF.

      III. To determine the effect of GM-CSF on PSA immediately after treatment (day 4) compared to
      a delayed effect (day 15).

      IV. To determine the PSA nadir, and percentage of patients with undetectable PSA, treated
      with combined vaccine and androgen ablation therapy over 12 months.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive vaccinia-PSA-TRICOM vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) SC on days 1-4 during weeks 1-4. Beginning in week 5, patients receive
      fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine SC on day 1 and GM-CSF SC on days 1-4. Treatment with
      fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine and GM-CSF repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses (weeks 5-16).
      Beginning in week 17, patients receive fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine and GM-CSF as above every
      12 weeks in the absence of clinical or biochemical disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients with biochemical or clinical disease progression receive androgen ablation therapy
      comprising oral bicalutamide once daily for 1 month and goserelin SC once every 4 weeks in
      addition to fowlpox-PSA-TRICOM vaccine and GM-CSF. Treatment continues in the absence of
      further clinical or biochemical disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.

    <time_frame>Assessed at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For patients who achieved a &gt; 50% decline in PSA, an increase in PSA value by 50% over the nadir, confirmed by a second PSA two weeks later is considered progressive disease. The PSA rise must be at least 5 ng/mL or back to pretreatment baseline, whichever is greater.
Changes in PSA below 5 ng/mL will not be considered assessable for progression.
For patients whose PSA has not decreased by 50%, an increase in PSA value &gt; 50% of baseline (on trial) or nadir PSA, whichever is lower, confirmed by a repeat PSA two weeks later is considered progressive disease. The PSA must have risen by at least 5 ng/mL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients With PSA Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed monthly during the first 24 weeks and then every 3 months for a maximum total of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSA response is defined as complete biochemical response or partial response.
Complete Response:
A PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/mL confirmed by a repeat PSA one month later is considered a complete biochemical response for patients with prior radical prostatectomy. A PSA &lt; 1 ng/mL on three separate occasions taken at least one month apart is considered a complete biochemical response in patients with radiation therapy only.
Partial Response:
A reduction in PSA by &gt; 50% from baseline, confirmed by repeat PSA 1 month later.</description>

    <measure>The Difference Between PSA Slopes Before and After Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed monthly during the first 24 weeks and then every 3 months for a maximum total of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>PSA slopes were assessed by multiple PSA values obtained prior to registration and during treatment. Only patients who completed at least 3 months of treatment were included in this analysis. The PSA slopes were calculated by a piecewise linear model using the three or four PSA values obtained prior to registration and PSA measurements obtained every 4 weeks for the first six months of treatment. Natural log transformed PSA levels were used in this analysis, and the difference between PSA slopes before and after treatment was calculated.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was activated on February 3, 2006 and terminated on December 11, 2007 after reaching its accrual goal. A total of 50 patients were recruited from ECOG member institutions.
Patients with biochemical or clinical progression during Step 1 were eligible to receive androgen blockade in Step 2. To date, 31 patients have registered to Step 2.</recruitment_details>

          <description>There are two steps in this study. Patients receive vaccine treatment in Step 1. Patients with biochemical or clinical progression during Step 1 were eligible to continue on to androgen blockade in Step 2. This report includes information collected in Step 1 only.
Patients receive vaccinia subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and GM-CSF SC on days 1-4 during cycle 1. Beginning with cycle 2, patients receive fowlpox SC on day 1 and GM-CSF SC on days 1-4. Treatment with fowlpox and GM-CSF repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. Beginning in week 13, patients receive fowlpox and GM-CSF as above every 12 weeks in the absence of clinical or biochemical disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Patients with biochemical or clinical disease progression may start Step II androgen ablation therapy comprising oral bicalutamide once daily for 1 month and goserelin SC once every 4 weeks in addition to fowlpox vaccine and GM-CSF until further progression or a max of 12 months.</description>

        <title>The Difference Between PSA Slopes Before and After Treatment</title>
        <description>PSA slopes were assessed by multiple PSA values obtained prior to registration and during treatment. Only patients who completed at least 3 months of treatment were included in this analysis. The PSA slopes were calculated by a piecewise linear model using the three or four PSA values obtained prior to registration and PSA measurements obtained every 4 weeks for the first six months of treatment. Natural log transformed PSA levels were used in this analysis, and the difference between PSA slopes before and after treatment was calculated.</description>
        <time_frame>Assessed monthly during the first 24 weeks and then every 3 months for a maximum total of 24 months</time_frame>

Beginning with cycle 2, patients receive fowlpox SC on day 1 and GM-CSF SC on days 1-4. Treatment with fowlpox and GM-CSF repeats every 4 weeks for 2 courses. Beginning in week 13, patients receive fowlpox and GM-CSF as above every 12 weeks in the absence of clinical or biochemical disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Patients with biochemical or clinical disease progression may start androgen ablation therapy comprising oral bicalutamide once daily for 1 month and goserelin SC once every 4 weeks in addition to fowlpox vaccine and GM-CSF until further progression or a max of 12 months.</description>
