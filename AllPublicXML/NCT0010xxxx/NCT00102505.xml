      The purpose of the study is to determine the dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated
      dose of motexafin gadolinium when administered with docetaxel and cisplatin in patients with
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.

      A cycle consists of 3 weeks. During week 1, patients receive MGd, docetaxel, and cisplatin
      treatment followed by 2 weeks without treatment.

      Eligible patients will receive 1 or 2 doses of MGd, depending on cohort, and a single dose of
      docetaxel and cisplatin at 75 mg/m² during the first week of each cycle. Additionally, tumor
      response will be evaluated at the end of even numbered cycles (2, 4, and 6). Patients may
      stay on the study a maximum of 6 cycles.
