      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of two recombinant HIV vaccines in HIV
      infected young adults on stable anti-HIV therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By helping to control viral replication, HAART has dramatically improved the prognosis for
      HIV infected individuals. However, because of extensive side effects, some of which may be
      acute and life-threatening, many patients find it difficult to tolerate a HAART regimen.
      HAART-associated long-term morbidity or mortality contribute to this difficulty.
      Administering an HIV therapeutic vaccine might allow HIV infected individuals to delay or
      interrupt treatment, avoiding the side effects associated with antiretroviral exposure. This
      study will evaluate the safety of two injections of two recombinant therapeutic vaccines in
      HIV infected young adults who are currently on stable HAART.

      This study will last 72 weeks. All participants will receive two rMVA vaccines (env/gag and
      tat/rev/nef-RT) at study entry and at Week 4 and two rFPV vaccines (env/gag and
      tat/rev/nef-RT) at Weeks 8 and 24. Safety will be assessed immediately after each
      immunization and at 1 hour and 48 hours postimmunization. There will be 16 study visits over
      72 weeks. A physical exam, blood collection, and administration of an adherence module will
      occur at most visits. An electrocardiogram (ECG) will occur at study entry and Weeks 2 and
      10. Urine collection will occur at study entry and Weeks 4, 8, and 24.
