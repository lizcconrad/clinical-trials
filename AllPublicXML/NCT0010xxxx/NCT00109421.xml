  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Project ÒRÉ intervention is a half-day community-based HIV/STI intervention program for
      friendship groups of adolescents that is tailored to African American culture. The four
      participating community sites will be assigned to either the Project ÒRÉ intervention or a
      standard health promotion program. Sexually experienced African American adolescent females
      will recruit members of their friendship group for the five-hour program. All participants
      will complete questionnaires before and immediately following the programs and another one 3
      months later. Immediately following the program some of the Project ÒRÉ groups will also
      participate in a focus group to provide feedback about the program.

      A group-randomized controlled design to test the efficacy of the Project ÒRÉ intervention, a
      community-based adolescent social network HIV/STI intervention tailored to African American
      culture. Four community based organization sites (CBOs) will be randomly assigned to an
      experimental or attention control condition. In both conditions, sexually experienced African
      American adolescent females will recruit members of their friendship group for the five-hour
      program. In the experimental condition, the intervention group will receive the half-day
      Project ÒRÉ intervention. The attention control group will receive a standard health
      promotion control program which has been used previously with similar populations. All
      participants will complete pre-, post- and 3-month follow-up self-administered
      questionnaires. In the experimental condition, a subset of groups will participate in a
      process evaluation focus group immediately following the program.
