      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Matrix Fentanyl Patch
      ZR-02-01 in providing pain relief.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the analgesic efficacy of the matrix fentanyl patch. The study will
      be conducted in non-opioid tolerant patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis (OA)
      pain. This patient population was chosen in anticipation that the patients are otherwise
      healthy adults being treated with NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs) or
      acetaminophen or who have received intermittent opioid analgesic treatment.

    <description>Study patches were replaced every 72 hours and were to be applied on the upper chest or lateral aspect of the upper arms. The patch application sites were to be rotated so the patch was not applied to the same skin site for successive applications. Patients were supplied with Tegaderm if needed to keep the patches adhered during the 72 hour wear period.</description>
