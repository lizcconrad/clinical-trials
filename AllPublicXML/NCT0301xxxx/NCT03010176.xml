  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum
      administered dose (MAD) of MK-1454 alone and of MK-1454 in combination with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in participants with advanced/metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. MK-1454 will be
      administered intratumorally (IT); pembrolizumab (pembro) will be administered intravenously
      (IV). Participants will be allocated to one of three treatment arms: MK-1454 monotherapy
      (cutaneous/subcutaneous [cut/subcut] lesions), MK-1454+pembrolizumab (pembro)
      (cutaneous/subcutaneous lesions), or MK-1454+pembro (liver metastasis/lesions). The
      MK-1454+pembro (liver metastasis/lesions) arm will initiate subsequent to establishment of
      the MTD/MAD dose level of the MK-1454+pembro (cutaneous/subcutaneous lesions) arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive either MK-1454 monotherapy or MK-1454 in combination with
      pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years). Participants will undergo at least
      a 24-hour observation period following the first dose administration of MK-1454 on Cycle 1,
      Day 1.

             detectable infection. Surgeries that required general anesthesia must be completed &gt;2
             weeks before first study drug administration. Surgery requiring regional/epidural
             anesthesia must be completed &gt;72 hours before first study drug administration and
             participants should be recovered.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Has a history of re-irradiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the head &amp; neck (SCCHN)
