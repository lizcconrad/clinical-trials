      This proposal will test the hypothesis that chronic treatment with sildenafil with and
      without the use of nitric oxide substrate, L-arginine, protects against fatty acid induced
      impairment of endothelial function, improves insulin-stimulated microvascular recruitment,
      insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in CD36 rs3211938 G-allele carriers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects carrying the G-allele of CD36 coding SNP rs3211938 that results in 50% reduction of
      CD36 levels in ~25% of African Americans have endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial
      dysfunction results in impairment of insulin's vascular actions and eventually reduced
      insulin sensitivity. Insulin induces microvascular recruitment via stimulation of nitric
      oxide(NO)-cGMP pathway, which facilitates nutrient flux, e.g., glucose to skeletal muscle.
      Elevated fatty acids impair insulin-stimulated microvascular recruitment and reduce insulin
      sensitivity. Chronic treatment with sildenafil increases vascularity and muscle glucose
      uptake in high fat fed mice. In humans, Drs. Shibao (PI) recently reported that a 3-month
      treatment with sildenafil improves insulin sensitivity in patients with impaired glucose
      tolerance. More relevant to this project, endothelial dysfunction improved after 4-week
      treatment with sildenafil in G-allele carriers. This proposal will test the hypothesis that
      chronic treatment with sildenafil with and without the use of NO substrate, L-arginine,
      protects against fatty acids induced impairment of endothelial function, improves
      insulin-stimulated microvascular.

      The protocol design was changed to single arm design.
