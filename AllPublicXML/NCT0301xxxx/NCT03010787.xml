          -  Part 3

               1. A history of Crohn's disease.

                  leading to ileostomy) or clinically significant abnormal physical examination,
                  including history of febrile illness within 1 week prior to the first dose.

               3. A history of severe allergies, non-allergic drug reactions, or multiple drug

                  trial or interpretation of the results.

          -  Part 4

               1. Subjects with severe Crohn's disease such as: those requiring surgery; those with
