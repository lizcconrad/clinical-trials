        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of WHO Group 3 PH associated with COPD

          2. Subjects are required to have a right heart catheterization (RHC) within one year
             prior to the first dose of study drug with the following parameters:

               1. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥ 4 Wood Units (WU) and

               2. A left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or pulmonary capillary wedge
                  pressure (PCWP) of ≤ 12 mmHg if PVR ≥ 4 WU to &lt; 6.25 WU or ≤ 15 mmHg if PVR ≥
                  6.25 WU and

               3. A mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 30 mmHg

          3. Clinical Diagnosis of COPD will be made using accepted Global Initiative for Chronic
             Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) diagnostic criteria, including Baseline spirometry
             with the following documented parameters:

               1. FEV1 &lt; 65% predicted, and

               2. FEV1/ FVC &lt; 70

          4. Baseline 6MWD ≥ 100 meters

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. The subject has a diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or PH for reasons
             other than COPD as outlined in inclusion criterion 3. This would include, but is not
             limited to, the concomitant presence of thromboembolic disease (acute or chronic),
             untreated or inadequately treated obstructive sleep apnea, connective tissue disease
             (including but not limited to systemic sclerosis/scleroderma, or systemic lupus
             erythematosus), sarcoidosis, interstitial lung disease,human immunodeficiency virus-1
             infection, and other conditions under WHO Group 1, 2, 4, and 5 classifications.

          2. The subject has received any Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medication
             for the treatment of PAH (ie, prostacyclin, prostacyclin receptor agonist, endothelin
             receptor antagonist [ERA], phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor [PDE5-I],or soluble
             guanylate cyclase [sGC] stimulator) within 60 days of the first dose of study drug,
             except for acute vasoreactivity testing.

          3. The subject has evidence of clinically significant left-sided heart disease as defined
             by the following criteria per the most recent assessment:

               1. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) or pulmonary capillary wedge
                  pressure (PCWP) &gt;15 mmHg (or &gt;12 mmHg if pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] ≥4
                  to &lt;6.25 WU)

               2. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% as assessed by either angiography or
                  echocardiography.
