  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine the efficacy and safety of low dose ketamine in association with
      IV morphine in the management of acute moderate to severe pain in emergency department.

      The investigators hypothesize that low dose ketamine will result in more effective pain
      control than morphine alone and will not be associated with an increase in adverse events.

    <textblock>
      Management of pain in the Emergency Department is challenging. Treatment of pain is most
      often accomplished by parenteral opioids analgesics. However, the use of opioids alone for
      pain control is often associated with inadequate analgesia and increased adverse events.

      Low-dose ketamine has been shown to improve pain perception and produce an opioid-sparing
      effect when given perioperatively.

      Its use in the ED may probably play a role in maximizing analgesia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of analgesia: To assess the primary outcome of pain relief, we used patient-reported pain scores. We consider the pain decreasing of at least 50% of pain score and the summed pain-intensity difference (SPID) over 2 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Two hours after starting protocol</time_frame>
    <description>At baseline, to assess our primary aim, efficacy of pain control, we will use patient reported pain scores and amount of rescue analgesia (parenteral morphine) received. Trained residents will ask participants to report their pains scores using a numerical pain rating scale (NPRS). The NPRS used will be a 0 to 10 rating scale. Baseline NPRS will be measured after randomization, but just before administration of morphine. Change in reported pain score during the protocol will be analysed.
The SPID was calculated using the pain-intensity difference (PID) at each of these study time points. The PID for a given time point is equal to the baseline NPRS minus the subsequent NPRS at each study time point. SPID is the summation of the PID at each of the study time points, weighted using the amount of time since the prior assessment</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total patient-perceived pain relief</measure>
    <time_frame>Two hours after starting protocol</time_frame>
    <description>The total patient-perceived pain relief will be calculated using weighted sum of the pain relief scale performed at each study time point. This pain relief scale is a five-point scale that asks participants to rate pain relief as complete = 4, a lot = 3, some = 2, a little = 1, and none = 0</description>

    <measure>Amount of rescue analgesia received</measure>
    <time_frame>Two hours after starting protocol</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of rescue analgesia received (in milligrams of morphine equivalents) will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to rescue analgesia</measure>
    <time_frame>Two hours after starting protocol</time_frame>
    <description>Time to rescue analgesia will be calculated as the time from administration of the last study medication (placebo or ketamine) to administration of an opioid analgesic.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The occurrence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Two hours after starting protocol</time_frame>
    <description>We will record participant-reported dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, dysphoria, visual disturbances, or other complaints at baseline and each study time point. All patients will be monitored for the duration of the study period and vital signs will be recorded at each time point.
The presence of tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 100 beats/min.), hypotension (systolic blood pressure [sBP] &lt; 100 mm Hg), hypertension (sBP &gt; 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure [dBP] &gt; 100 mm Hg), and respiratory depression (respiratory rate &lt; 12 breaths/min, oxygen saturation &lt; 92%, or need for supplemental oxygen) will be noted.</description>
