      the investigator intended to study the effect of laser versus ultrasonic in activation of
      irrigation in post operative pain of patients have a symptomatic necrotic teeth
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      the investigator will choose from patients entering clinic of endodontics in faculty of oral
      and dental medicine Cairo university who are eligible to the criteria.

      After the patients is found eligible,the patients will be randomly assigned to either the
      control (ultrasonic activated irrigation )or to the intervention ( diode laser activated
      irrigation) treatment done in both in single visit.

      At the end of treatment, patients will be asked to record post operative pain by NRS .

    <description>Laser-activated irrigation (LAI) has been introduced as a powerful method enhancing irrigant action; The laser radiation produces transient cavitation in the liquid through optical breakdown by strong absorption of the laser energy. The high-power diode laser has been tested in several areas of dentistry such as bleaching, depigmentation and gingivectomy, with promising results in dentinal disinfection. The diode laser has proved to be a resource worth testing, because of the it's properties and its low cost and availability in comparison to most lasers used in endodontics.</description>

    <description>ultrasonics have been developed to improve the penetration and effectiveness of irrigation in peripheral areas of the root canal space. The efficiency of sonic and ultrasonic devices is based on the creation of hydrodynamic phenomenon in well-shaped canals filled with an irrigant.
Such active root canal irrigation has been shown to facilitate the disruption of biofilms and make the cell membrane of bacteria more permeable to NaOCl.</description>
