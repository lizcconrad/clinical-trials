      It was previously proved an association of TGF-β1 and PDGF-BB with the pathogenesis of
      osteoarthritis (OA) by experiments of OA animal models. In this study, we aimed to determine
      whether serum concentrations of TGF-β1, PDGF-BB and CTX-1 were related to the knee OA. knee
      OA cases were collected from the first affiliated hospital of Shihezi university and healthy
      controls were recruited from the community. The severity of knee OA was defined as
      kellgren-lawrence (K-L) classification criteria.Serum levels of chemical biomarkers were
      compared between knee OA cases and controls or among K-L grade 2 to grade 4 groups. The serum
      concentrations of the TGF-β1, PDGF-BB and CTX-1 were determined by ELISA .
