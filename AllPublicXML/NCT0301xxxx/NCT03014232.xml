    <textblock>
      Hypercytokinemia contributes a major role in the pathogenesis and is associated with the high
      mortality in sepsis-related acute kidney injury(AKI). This pilot randomized controlled trial
      was conducted in sepsis-related AKI patients to compare the efficacy of cytokine removal
      including interleukin(IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrotic factor(TNF)-α by six-hour SLED-f
      between using HCO dialyzer(HCO-SLED-f) and HF dialyzer(HF-SLED-f).

      Hypercytokinemia contributes a major role in the pathogenesis and is associated with the high
      mortality in sepsis-related acute kidney injury(AKI). Reductions of these cytokines have been
      reported to improve clinical outcomes. Online sustained low-efficiency diafiltration(SLED-f)
      using traditional high-flux(HF) dialyzer could remove some cytokines. Interestingly, the
      potential of enhancing cytokine removal by using newly designed high cut-off(HCO) dialyzer
      that could theoretically remove larger molecular weight solutes has never been studied in
      SLED-f before.This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted in sepsis-related AKI
      patients to compare the efficacy of cytokine removal including interleukin(IL)-6, IL-8,
      IL-10, and tumor necrotic factor(TNF)-α by six-hour SLED-f between using HCO
      dialyzer(HCO-SLED-f,n=8) and HF dialyzer(HF-SLED-f,n=8).

    <description>Online SLED-f with high cut-off dialyzers were performed using the Fresenius 5008S hemodiafiltration machines (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany). Super-flux, Sureflux 150FH (Nipro Corporation, Osaka, Japan; cellulose triacetate material, pore size 78 A◦, Kuf 66.9 mL/hr/mmHg, surface area 1.5 m2) were used. Dialysis time and blood flow rate were 6 hours and 200 mL/min, respectively. The predilution reinfusion fluid rate and dialysate flow rate were 80 and 220 mL/min, respectively (the total dialysis fluid flow rate was 300 mL/min).</description>
