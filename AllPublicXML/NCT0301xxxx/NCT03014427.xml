  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The storage and use of biomaterial samples is an important requirement for accompanying
      research and the acquisition of new knowledge to improve prognosis and therapy. Biobanking is
      explicitly recommended in official guidelines. In order to preserve the biomaterial, the
      patient must consent to the removal, transfer and storage of the biomaterial separately from
      the consent to the register. The biomaterial is taken at times at which a blood or urine
      sampling takes place anyway in the clinical routine. Therefore no additional interventions
      are necessary.

      The storage and use of biomaterial samples is an important requirement for accompanying
      research and the acquisition of new knowledge to improve prognosis and therapy. Biobanking is
      explicitly recommended in official guidelines. In order to preserve the biomaterial, the

      sampling takes place anyway in the clinical routine. Therefore no additional interventions
      are necessary.

      Sample volumes are defined as follows:

        -  Peripheral blood: up to a total of 150 ml distributed to a maximum of 10 morning blood
           samples (approximately 15 ml blood per blood sample) during the inpatient stay in the
           intensive care unit (fixed times are admission and discharge of the intensive care unit)

        -  Urine: a total of up to 200 ml of catheter urine distributed to a maximum of 10 morning
           withdrawals during inpatient stays in the intensive care unit (defined times are
           admission and discharge from the intensive care unit)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients after admission to the intensive care unit

          -  18 years or older

          -  signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No exclusion criteria are formulated with regard to the objective of the register to
             record intensive care patients in general. Patients with multiple comorbidities, organ
             dysfunctions, and non-compliance for a curatively-intended therapy should also be
             recorded in the register. A palliative treatment or decision for best supportive care
             is not an exclusion criterion for registering.
