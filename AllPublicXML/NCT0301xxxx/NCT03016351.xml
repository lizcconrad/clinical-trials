    <textblock>
      After the participant meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be randomized
      equally to either the Resistance Training group (RT) or Aerobic Training group (AT). Both
      groups will participate in an 8 week initial control period, followed by 8 weeks of
      supervised exercise training, followed by 8 weeks of deconditioning. All participants will
      undergo the same assessments and procedures one time prior to the initial 8 week control
      period, and at each of the three periods. Assessments include: blood draws; arterial
      stiffness testing; ultrasounds of the brachial artery to measure flow-mediated dilation
      (FMD); gluteal adipose tissue biopsies; exercise testing to determine VO2 max; body
      composition analysis via DEXA scans; ambulatory blood pressure measurement; diet analysis via
      food journals; medical history questionnaires; urine analysis for pregnancy; and activity
      monitoring via accelerometer. Total participation will be 24-26 weeks.

      Study Design and Procedures This study is divided into three separate 8-week periods, the
      Control period, the Exercise Training period and the De-training period.

      A) Control Period (weeks 0-8): Participants will have a control period of 8 weeks. Subjects
      will be given a brochure regarding the benefits of regular exercise and nutrition on overall
      health.

      Baseline visit and eligibility assessment: After an initial phone interview to screen
      potential participants for eligibility, participants will be scheduled for their two visits
      of baseline assessments.

      Visit 1: Clinical Research Center, 2.5 hour visit

      Participants will report in the morning after a 12 hour fast. Female participants will be in
      the follicular stage of their menstrual cycle. Everyone will be instructed to drink water but
      not exercise the day of the visit. After informed consent and a medical history obtained, the
      following procedures will be performed:

        -  Urine pregnancy test for women

        -  Anthropometrics: weight, height, waist circumference and BMI

        -  Vitals: Blood pressure and heart rate

        -  Blood draw of approximately 2 tablespoons or 30 mLs

        -  Arterial stiffness test via pulse wave velocity: Sphygmocor (SphygmoCor, AtCor Medical,
           Sydney, Australia) is a device that used to detect the stiffness of blood vessels.

           24 hour blood pressure monitoring. Participants will be asked to wear a blood pressure
           cuff on your arm, and the small monitoring and recording pack attached to your waist (or
           next to you in bed as they sleep). The machine will take a blood pressure measurement
           every 30 minutes while they are awake and every 30-60 minutes while they are sleep. They
           will wear it everywhere, except for in the shower, for a full 24 hours.

        -  Ultrasound for brachial flow-mediated dilation with administration of nitroglycerin
           During procedures above, an EKG will be monitored (limb leads only). EKG recordings will
           be made to assess heart rate, and to gate subsequent measures of diameter with the
           cardiac cycle. Arterial pressure will be monitored throughout the protocol in the
           opposite arm using an automated sphygmomanometry device.

      Visit 2: Integrative Physiology Lab, 2 hour visit

      Participants will report for the following procedures:

        -  Exercise testing: Maximal oxygen consumption will be evaluated using cycle ergometry or
           treadmill to exhaustion. We will use a graded exercise protocol, starting at an easy
           level and increasing in difficulty each stage Participants will be connected to a breath
           by breath metabolic system for measurement of VO2max.

        -  Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA): DEXA provides precise non-invasive measures of
           fat mass, lean tissue mass (total body, as well as regional), bone mineral content and
           bone mineral density. DEXA measurements of participant's total and regional fat and lean
           mass, bone mineral content and bone mineral density will be done four times during the
           intervention.

        -  Review of food journal

        -  Return the 24-hour blood pressure cuff Begin 7 days of activity monitoring with
           accleerometer Participants will report to the IPL after 7 days to return the
           accelerometer.

      Participants will then be asked to maintain their normal lifestyle during the study period,
      with the exception of participating in exercise training from weeks 8-16. Since only
      sedentary subjects will be recruited, we do not anticipate differences between groups in
      physical activity. To verify this physical activity by accelerometry (GT3X; ActiGraph) will
      be used for 7 consecutive days during each of the three periods.

      B) Pre-training Testing, Week 8 (Pre-Exercise training period, weeks 9-16): After the 8 week
      control period, before training begins, participants will report for two visits of testing,
      and will undergo the following procedures:

      Visit 1: Clinical Research Center, 2.5 hour visit: Same as Visit 1 procedures as outlined in
      the Baseline visit, including the 12 hour fast. In addition participants will also undergo:

        -  Subcutaneous gluteal fat biopsy: All subjects will undergo subcutaneous fat biopsy with
           sterile techniques performed by a trained physician or nurse practitioner before and
           after the intervention. A small fat biopsy will be obtained just underneath the skin.
           The skin will be locally anesthetized with a small amount of lidocaine (2%). The
           incision is closed with Steristrips and covered with a waterproof clear bandage.

      Since this tissue is relatively avascular and will be obtained under direct inspection, there
      is minimal risk of bleeding or other complications. The entire procedure should take no more
      than 10 minutes and should be associated with minimal discomfort. Individuals will be
      instructed to keep the area dry for 24-48 hours after which the bandage can be removed. The
      Steristrips will remain in place until they spontaneously come off in about 4-5 days.

      Visit 2: Integrative Physiology Lab, 2 hour visit: Same as Visit 2 procedures as outlined in
      the Baseline visit

      Randomization After the participant meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be
      randomized equally to either the Resistance Training group (RT) or Aerobic Training group
      (AT) with a table of random numbers by a staff member having no knowledge of the
      participant's baseline profile.

      C) Post training Testing, Week 16 (pre-Detraining period, weeks 17-24). The two visit
      post-training testing will start 24-48 hours after last exercise session to avoid potential
      effects of the acute exercise bout. This testing is identical to the testing that occurred at
      the beginning of the Exercise training period at Week 8.

      De-Training Follow-up All participants will be asked to resume normal activities after the
      8-week exercise training program. They will be specifically instructed to resume the same
      activity pattern as before they entered the study (sedentary lifestyle), and to discontinue
      their exercise training.

      D) Post-detraining Testing: All of the procedures described above will be performed over the
      two visit days. Participants will return the accelerometer and any remaining food journals.

During each session, participants will complete a 5 min warm-up followed by 30-45 min of endurance exercise using cycle ergometry. Intensity will be monitored using heart rate monitors during each exercise session, and each participant will receive an exercise prescription with a heart range equivalent to 65-85% of their heart rate max.

    <description>Participants will undergo a supervised resistance training program in accordance with established guidelines. Each session will be monitored by a physical therapist or exercise physiologist. Sessions will be carried out 3 times per week, 45 min per session. Muscle strength will be determined once before and once after resistance training by measuring ten repetition maximum (10 RM) for each exercise. Eight exercises (three sets; 8-12 repetitions) will be used on each of the large muscle groups (leg press, leg extension, leg curl, chest press, shoulder extension, biceps curl, abdominal crunch and back extension). In addition, workloads will be progressively increased if the patients can lift the weight more than 12 repetitions.</description>
