  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the development of the control of DM and the great interest for the complications of
      the disease, even today the diabetic foot represents a challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon.
      Being frequently correlated to alteration of the plantar pressures, the surgery treatment is
      recommended and the Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) candidates itself to solve this
      pathologic case.

      The purpose of this longitudinal cross-sectional study was to evaluate radiographic and
      surgical outcomes and the subjective grade of satisfaction of the patients with a diagnosis
      of chronic plantar diabetic foot ulcers that have been treated at Padua's Orthopaedic Clinic
      through MIS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-two patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers (CDFUs) were treated by MIS between
      January 2010 and September 2016. Clinical evaluation was assessed pre-operatively, as well as
      at 3 months after surgery and at final follow-up, using the American Orthopaedic Foot and
      Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hallux Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Scale. The recurrence of the
      ulcers and complications were recorded. All the ulcers were evaluated with the University of
      Texas Diabetic Wound Classification. We used the radiological Maestro's criteria to evaluated
      the radiographs before and after the operation. Also, the bridging bone/callus formation was
      evaluated at the different radiographic follow-ups, while the articular surface congruency.
      The global disability was evaluated with the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the
      satisfaction's level with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Statistical analysis was carried
      out using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.

    <description>Percutaneous dorsal incision at the level of the the distal part of the metatarsal bone, a Shannon burr is introduced at the level of metatarsal neck, with orientation of at approximately 45°, keeping the articular cartilage surface of the metatarsal head as reference point on the superior cortex.
In this position, under fluoroscopic control, the osteotomy is started following a distal-dorsal and proximal-plantar direction. In this way the metatarsal head moves proximally and dorsally reducing the metatarsal pressure on the plantar ulcer.</description>
