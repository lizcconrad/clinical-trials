  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to test the effects of a targeted, computerized
      cognitive training program on verbal memory in older women who have undergone chemotherapy
      treatment for early-stage breast cancer. As measured by neuropsychological assessment, this
      treatment will result in improved verbal memory. Secondarily, processing speed and naming
      abilities are expected to improve. Enhanced self-perception of cognitive ability is also
      expected.

    <time_frame>Change in Processing Speed scores from Pretreatment/Baseline to Posttreatment/6 weeks, from Posttreatment/6 weeks to 1 month followup/10 weeks, and from Pretreatment/Baseline to 1 month followup/10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Lexical Decision Task is a computerized task that measures processing speed by calculating reaction times to verb and non-verb stimuli. Outcome is measured by reaction time in milliseconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Processing Speed measured via Stroop Color-Word Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Processing Speed scores from Pretreatment/Baseline to Posttreatment/6 weeks, from Posttreatment/6 weeks to 1 month followup/10 weeks, and from Pretreatment/Baseline to 1 month followup/10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color-Word task is a paper and pencil task that measures processing speed by assessing correct number of words read, correct number of color names read, and correct number of color-word interference pairs (i.e., names of colors printed in non-matching ink colors) read in 45 seconds. Outcomes are measured in raw scores and associated T-scores referenced against sex+age normative groups. The Stroop Color-Word Test scores will not be aggregated with the Lexical Decision Task scores.</description>

    <description>Chosen exercises from the rehabilitation package of a commercially available, computerized, cognitive training program called Happy Neuron Pro will be used. This program was designed by a team of neurologists, neuropsychologists and cognitive psychologists, and has been successfully adapted for varying conditions of cognitive dysfunction.</description>

    <description>Participants assigned to the wait list control arm will receive no treatment while the experimental arm is participating in the computerized treatment. However, the computerized treatment program will be made available for these participants to utilize at the end of the study period.</description>

    <description>Participants will engage in auditory and verbal memory exercises intended to improve verbal memory functioning. The exercises are: Elephant Memory, Words where are you?, Split words, Bird Songs, Sound check, and You've got voicemail. Participants will complete the exercises 1 hour per day, 6 days per week, for 6 weeks. The program automatically adjusts difficulty level according to individual performance. The program captures and reports all relevant data to the primary investigator, including accuracy and reaction time (speed), which will be used to measure progress.</description>
