  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons for consultation in Emergency Departments
      (ED) worldwide. The challenge for physicians is to not misdiagnose a surgical emergency. The
      actual gold standard for diagnosis is computed tomography (CT). However with this procedure
      there is high radiation exposure and a risk factor of radiation-induced cancers, therefore
      alternative diagnostic techniques should be considered. The aim of this study is to evaluate
      the performance of measuring venous lactate in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain
      in ED.

      In this single-center, prospective, non-interventional study, the diagnostic accuracy of
      venous lactate in order to detect surgical emergencies is evaluated. The hypothesis made here
      is that venous lactatemia is a positive predictive factor of surgical emergencies in patients
      with acute abdominal pain.

      Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons for consultation worldwide in Emergency
      Departments (ED). The challenge for physicians is to not misdiagnose a surgical emergency.
      The actual gold standard for diagnosis is computed tomography (CT). However with this
      procedure there is high radiation exposure and a risk factor of radiation-induced cancers,
      therefore alternative diagnostic techniques should be considered. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the diagnostic performance of measuring venous lactate in patients with acute
      abdominal pain in ED.

      A single-center, prospective, non-interventional study, will be conducted between June 2016
      and January 2017 in the university emergency department of Nice, France. Inclusion criteria
      are patients aged 18 and over, suffering from abdominal pain for seven days or less and
      requiring a blood test to help with diagnosis.

      The primary outcome is to determine if the value of venous lactate is a predictive factor of
      emergency surgery in patients with acute abdominal pain.

      The secondary outcome is to determine if the &quot;strong ion gap&quot;, first defined in &quot;The Stewart
      Approach&quot;, is a predictive factor of emergency surgery in patients with acute abdominal pain.

      A blood test will be performed when patients are admitted to the ED. Seven days after being
      admitted to the ED, patients' outcome will be assessed by consulting patients' medical
      records or by phone call.

    <description>Strong ion gap (SIG) is a calculated value based on the following equation :
SIG = (Na+ + K+ + 2xCa2+ + 2xMg2+) - (Cl- - lactate) - HCO3- + albumine x (0.123 x PH - 0.631) + phosphates mesur√©s x (0.309 x PH - 0.469) All the values are measured on venous samples.</description>
