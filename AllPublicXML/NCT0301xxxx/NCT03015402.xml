  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of oral inorganic
      nitrite verses placebo and the therapeutic response with regards to exercise tolerance in
      patients with pulmonary hypertension and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
      (PH-HFpEF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, 22-week double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled cross-over trial
      of oral nitrite on exercise capacity and hemodynamic measurements in subjects with PH-HFpEF.
