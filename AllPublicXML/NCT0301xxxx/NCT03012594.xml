  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a human research study looking at the effectiveness of Lanreotide (study medication)
      in treating small bowel motility disorders. It is similar to a natural hormone somatostatin
      that is produced in the body in the stomach, duodenum, pancreas and brain. Somatostatin is a
      growth hormone-inhibiting hormone. Lanreotide is a man made hormone and is a long acting
      medication that is given once a month. It is marketed with a trade name &quot;Somatuline Depot&quot;.
      It is given deep subcutaneously (deep within the layers of the skin) in the superior external
      quadrant of the buttock. Injection site will be alternated on subsequent injections.

      The investigators hypothesize that in patients with small bowel motility disorders,
      Lanreotide helps in alleviating the symptoms. Lanreotide is an FDA approved medication for
      management of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors, but has never been used for treating
      small bowel motility disorders. However, Octreotide which is similar to Lanreotide but is a
      short acting synthetic somatostatin has been used in few research studies.

      If a patient is interested and qualifies for the study then he/she will be explained about
      the study and signature will be collected on the consent form. Health and social history will
      be collected. Blood work, urine analysis, pregnancy test (in women of reproductive age group
      and have the capability of getting pregnant)) will be performed to make sure that patient
      qualifies for the study and for follow-up during the treatment. Physical examination, ECG,
      wireless motility capsule testing and hydrogen breath testing will be performed. Patients
      will be required to complete a questionnaire regarding their health.

      The total study duration from the first administration of study drug is 12 weeks. The study
      medication will be given once a month for 3 months and there is a 1 month follow-up after the
      last study medication. There will be a screening visit approximately 1 month before the first
      study drug administration.

    <measure>Improvement in symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in symptoms assessed by improvement in upper gastrointestinal disorders-symptom severity index (PAGI-SYM) scores. (PAGI-SYM is a brief (20-items with 6 sub scales) symptom severity questionnaire that captures information on common upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including heartburn, regurgitation, fullness, early satiety, bloating, nausea and vomiting, and upper abdominal pain). If the PAGI-Sym scores were decreased by at least 0.7 points compared to pre treatment, then it will be considered that lanreotide has significantly improved the symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Resolution of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</measure>

    <description>Resolution of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as assessed by hydrogen breath testing. If the hydrogen breath test is positive (&gt;20 ppm from the baseline) before treatment and it decreases (changes to &lt;20 from the baseline) after treatment, it will be considered that lanreotide is efficacious in decreasing the small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:
