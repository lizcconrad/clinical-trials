  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the longitudinal attainment of subject centred and
      functional related goals (cumulated Goal Attainment Scale Total (GAS T) score) after
      abobotulinumtoxinA injection (including following repeated injection cycles where they occur)
      alongside spasticity management used in real life settings over a period of 18 months (and a
      maximum of six injection cycles).

          -  Female or male subjects aged 2 to 17 years inclusive

          -  Decision to prescribe abobotulinumtoxinA, to be made prior to and independently from
             the decision to enrol in the study

          -  Primary diagnosis of paediatric lower limb (PLL) spasticity and either: Previously
             untreated with BoNT (naïve to BoNT), or previously treated with a BoNT (i.e. non naïve
             to BoNT), and for those who were previously treated with BoNT-A, they should have
             responded to BoNT-A treatment according to the investigator's criteria

          -  For non naïve BoNT subjects, a minimum interval of 12 weeks since the last BoNT
             injection and in the presence of spasticity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known resistance to any BoNT or experienced serious safety issues with previous use of
             BoNT

          -  Concomitant treatment with other BoNT

          -  Known hypersensitivity to abobotulinumtoxinA or related compounds, or any component in
             the study drug formulation

          -  Subjects with any clinical (or subclinical) evidence of marked defective neuromuscular
             transmission (e.g. Lambert Eaton syndrome or myasthenia gravis) or persistent
             clinically significant neuromuscular disorders
