  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monogenic hypertension, which follows the rules of Mendel's genetic law, is one of the most
      important causes of hypertension. Generally, patients occur hypertension in early age, have
      family history, and often manifest severe hypertension or refractory hypertension. At
      present, only a few hypertension centers of hospitals in China will help clinically difficult
      diagnosis hypertensive patients to test some selective genes, while most of other hospitals
      still perform diagnosis based on biochemical examination and clinical symptoms. Therefore, in
      order to provide better guidance for the diagnosis and treatment for hypertensive patients,
      this project aims to develop a single gene detection panel for genetic hypertension, so as to
      provide new diagnostic technology for early intervention, prevention and treatment of
      hypertension in clinics.
