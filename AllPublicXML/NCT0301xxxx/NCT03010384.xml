  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a two-year time period (2011 to 2012) 443 patients of suspected of disc herniation and
      risk of low work ability - based on questionnaires participated in a randomized control
      trial. The patients were randomized to either the intervention group (n=220) or control group
      (n=223). The intervention group were invited to the Department of Social Medicine two to four
      weeks after their first contact to Department of Rheumatology for a consultation with a
      physician specialized in social medicine. Together with the patient a return-to-work (RTW)
      schedule was made to ascertain the need for contact to the workplace (to adjust work
      functions), municipality, general practitioner or short-term supportive consultations with a
      psychologist. Throughout the intervention, the patients received their usual treatment from
      the Department of Rheumatology like patients from the control group. Outcome was return to
      the work force at one year follow up using information from a national registry.
