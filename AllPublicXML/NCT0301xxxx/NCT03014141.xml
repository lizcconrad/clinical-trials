  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consumption of oat bran fiber also has a significant bulking effect in humans. However,
      besides fecal bulk, dietary fiber can promote gut health in other ways. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of oat bran (rich in oat beta-glucan)
      supplementation on bowel function and appetite.

    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study it involves a
      total of 8 visits with a 14 day run-in period for total study duration of 84 days. A washout
      period of 2 weeks will occur in between the 2, 28 day treatment periods. The effects of an
      oat bran beverage for breakfast on bowel function will be tested after 2 week and 4 weeks of
      intake.
