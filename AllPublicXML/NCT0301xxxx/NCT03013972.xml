  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, nearly 1.25 million patients are diagnosed with and more than 600,000 patients die
      from colorectal cancer each year. The third leading cause of death is colorectal cancer in
      Taiwan 2012. The current treatments for colorectal cancer including surgery, chemotherapy
      and/or radiotherapy are prescribed to improve survival and lower the risk of recurrence.
      However, disease and treatment-related toxicities in cancer patients may result in fatigue
      and interfered quality of life (QoL). Previous studies have reported that cancer-related
      fatigue (CRF) is the most common symptom experienced by patients at all stage of diseases, it
      can occur during treatment, in advanced disease and in disease-free survivors; the prevalence
      of fatigue is reported to be between 59-96% in patients undergoing chemotherapy, 65-100% in
      patients receiving radiation therapy, and 30% in long term survivors. Also, CRF has been
      reported as the most frequent and distressing toxicity of colon and rectal chemotherapy. The
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has published guidelines for the definition of
      CRF as ''a persistent subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or
      exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity
      and that significantly interferes with usual functioning.&quot; Besides, CRF could dynamically
      change with the interactions among disease progression, treatment regimen, tumor site,
      nutrition, infection or other factors. Therefore, to minimize the impact of CRF on cancer
      patients, more in-depth researches on CRF are needed.

      The aim of this longitudinal study is to examine the dynamic changes, correlated factors and
      QoL of CRF among colorectal cancer patients during adjuvant chemotherapy. Furthermore, the
      results will supply physicians with more understanding about CRF, and help them to enhance
      the quality on cancer care to being perfected in the future.

      This study will enroll colorectal cancer patients with adjuvant chemotherapy about 1 year
      (estimated 60 patients). Brief fatigue inventory-Taiwanese form (BFI-T) and functional
      assessment of cancer therapy-general 7 (FACT-G7) will be used to evaluate patients' fatigue
      and quality of life. Patients will be thoroughly informed about all aspects of the study
      activity schedule and all regulatory requirements that must be satisfied for informed
      consent. Only patients who give consent to participate in this study and meet all other
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible to enroll into this study. The
      questionnaire survey will be carried out before first chemotherapy treatment (baseline), and
      every four chemotherapy cycles (i.e. at cycle 4, 8 and 12) after chemotherapy treatment at
      outpatient department (OPD) or ward during adjuvant chemotherapy treatment period. All
      patients will receive standard chemotherapy which continued for 24 weeks (12 cycles) or until
      disease progression, whichever came first. Subject demographic and disease-related
      information will also be collected for analysis.
