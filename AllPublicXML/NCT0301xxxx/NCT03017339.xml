    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a functional exercise program
      associated with Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) on pain, functional capacity and quality of
      life of individuals with fibromyalgia. Half of participants will receive functional exercise
      and LLLT, while the other half will receive functional exercise and placebo LLLT.
