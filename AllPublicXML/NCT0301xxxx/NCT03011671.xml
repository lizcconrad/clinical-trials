  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study that examines the rate of dose limiting side effects in patients with
      malignant astrocytoma treated with combination acetazolamide (ACZ) and temazolomide (TMZ).
      Eligible patients must have histologically proven newly diagnosed, O6-methylguanine-DNA
      methyltransferase (MGMT) methylated WHO grade III or IV astrocytoma and be planning to
      undergo treatment with standard adjuvant TMZ (after completing treatment with TMZ and
      ionizing radiation (IR)).

      During this study, patients will receive daily oral ACZ with TMZ. During each cycle, ACZ will
      be started on the day of TMZ initiation and continued for a total of 21 days.

    <description>ORR will be determined at 6 months and is based on the change in tumor size (as determined by Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology Criteria (RANO) criteria) at the indicated time relative to the pre-treatment scan. RANO criteria will also be used to define disease status (CR, PR, etc.).</description>
