  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic functional constipation is a common digestive system disease, the incidence is
      increasing in recent years.It is reported that the occurrence and development of chronic
      functional constipation is closely related to imbalance of intestinal flora .Moreover,types
      and quantity of intestinal flora may be related to intestinal motility. Fecal microbiota
      transplantation as a new technology to rebuild intestinal flora has been used for several
      diseaseï¼Œbut the clinical efficacy of chronic functional constipation by fecal microbiota
      transplantation needs to be further explored.

      Patients who meet the inclusion crit chronic functional constipation will be separated into
      two parts depending on acceptation or refuse of Fecal microbiota transplantation.Blood
      specimen from patients will be collected to analysis intestinal motility.
