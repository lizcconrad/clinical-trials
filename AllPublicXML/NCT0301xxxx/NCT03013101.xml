      This is a multiple-center, open-label, phase 2 study evaluating the humanized anti-PD-1
      antibody JS001, as a monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who
      have failed in previous routine systemic treatment. Patients are injected with JS001 with
      3mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progresses or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Response
      assessment is conducted by every 8 weeks.

    <description>humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (JS001) is a programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor antibody, which selectively interferes with the combination of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in the activation of lymphocytes and elimination of malignancy theoretically.</description>

             hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

          -  Severe, uncontrolled medical condition that would affect patients' compliance or
             obscure the interpretation of toxicity determination or adverse events, including
             active severe infection, uncontrolled diabetes, angiocardiopathy (heart failure &gt;
             class II NYHA, heart block &gt;II grade, myocardial infarction, unstable arrhythmia or
             unstable angina within past 6 months, cerebral infarction within past 3 months) or

             risks of study drug administration or obscure the interpretation of toxicity
             determination or adverse events.
