    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial with pilot expansion of HLA-haploidentical or HLA-mismatched related
      donor nicotinamide expanded-natural killer (NAM-NK) cell based therapy for patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) or relapsed/refractory CD20-positive non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL). The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of NAM-NK cells while maintaining safety.
