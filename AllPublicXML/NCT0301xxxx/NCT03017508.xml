  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the current proposal is to examine if sublingual riluzole can reduce anxiety in
      people with social anxiety disorder during a public speaking task.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose conducting a double-blind, placebo controlled crossover study
      examining the effects of BHV-0223 on public speaking anxiety. Twenty participants with DSM-5
      defined social anxiety disorder and clinically significant public speaking anxiety on the
      Impromptu Speech Task will be enrolled in a challenge study. Participants will be given
      BHV-0223 (or placebo) under double-blind crossover conditions 1 hour prior to performing each
      of 2 impromptu speech tasks. The two study days involving BHV-0223 (or placebo)
      administration and impromptu speech task will be separated by 2 to 10 days to allow for
      medication washout. There will be a final follow-up visit 2 to 10 days later to perform a
      complete Physical exam and do follow-up liver function testing and a Complete Blood Count.
      Our primary outcome will examine BHV-0223's effects (compared to placebo) on self-rated
      anxiety during the impromptu speech task. The investigators will also collect physiological
      measures of anxiety, clinician-rated measures of anxiety, and measures of speech performance
      as secondary outcomes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female (post-menopausal, surgically sterile, or negative pregnancy test at
             screening and agreement to utilize an established birth control, including complete
             abstinence, during the testing period) between the age of 18 and 65 yrs.

          2. Meet DSM-5 criteria for social anxiety disorder by structured clinical interview
             (SCID) and have a LSAS public speaking subscale score &gt;6.

          3. Stable psychiatric medications. Participants must have had stable doses of all
             psychiatric medications for the month prior to treatment and have been on stable doses
             of SSRI and antidepressants for at least 1 month prior to study enrollment. As needed
             benzodiazepine use will be permitted as long as subjects refrain from using
             benzodiazepines for the 48 hours prior to the study.

             investigational study involving no drug administration.

         14. Participant with clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities (QTcF
