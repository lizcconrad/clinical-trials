  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, Phase Ib/II study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      azacitidine, durvalumab (MEDI4736), and tremelimumab combination therapy in the treatment of
      patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      (SCCHN) who have progressed during or after treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or
      anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease. The clinical trial is
      studying drugs that can boost the participant's immune system against the cancer cells as a
      possible treatment for head and neck cancer.

      The study interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Azacitidine (Vidaza)

        -  Durvalumab (MEDI4736)

        -  Tremelimumab

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are still being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab (MEDI4736) or
      tremelimumab as a treatment for any disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved azacitidine for the
      participant's specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      This is a first in human study evaluating the safety of combining these three different
      drugs. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab are part of a family of proteins that make up
      the immune system. The body generates these proteins, or antibodies, in response to foreign
      substances (particles not typically found in the body such as bacteria and viruses) and these
      antibodies can protect against infection. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab are
      antibodies that are being studied in several other clinical trials to see if it has an effect
      in helping the immune system to recognize and eliminate abnormal cells in the body.

      Investigators hope that azacitidine may increase the chance of the immune system to recognize
      the cancer cells. Azacitidine has been tested in other research studies for similar reasons.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking for the highest effective dose of
      azacitidine in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736) and tremelimumab to improve the natural
      ability of the immune system to recognize and target head and neck cancer cells.
