  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is little study focusing on kinematic parameters in the assessment of the symptomatic
      and functional severity of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the correlations between kinematic parameters and the severity of symptoms and
      functions in patients with KOA.
