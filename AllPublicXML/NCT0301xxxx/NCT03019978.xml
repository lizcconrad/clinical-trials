  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will include an analysis of data for residents of Pennsylvania who are age
      21 and older, have a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and are enrolled in the
      Commonwealth's Adult Community Autism Program (ACAP). The individuals enrolled in the program
      will be administered a standardized assessment battery quarterly for two years. The proposed
      study will analyze the data gathered during each of the assessment periods in order to aid in
      service/treatment planning, assess for individual improvements, and ultimately measure
      treatment outcomes.

  <detailed_description>

      The proposed study seeks to more closely monitor the changing needs and challenges of adults
      with ASD, which will be facilitated through a battery of assessments given over quarterly
      time points in a two year time period. Investigators seek to address whether increased
      frequency of behaviorally driven assessments will inform treatment. More specifically,
      investigators are interested in knowing if the assessment data influences treatment planning
      with providers or if it is guiding any decisions about treatment once data is returned to
      participants in a meaningful way which is easily understood. If data prompts treatment
      changes, the study will examine whether improvements are being shown months or even years
      later.

      An &quot;elected reporter&quot;, a family member, is asked to take part in the research study with the
      participant. An elected reporter is asked to complete several questionnaires quarterly, both
      reporting on themself and the participant.
