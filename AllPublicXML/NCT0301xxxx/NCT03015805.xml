  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of Juvenile Probation Officers
      (JPOs) delivering Contingency Management (CM) to teens on their caseload who have problems
      with drug use. CM has already been shown to be effective at helping teens with drug problems
      but CM has never been delivered by JPOs. This study will test how well it works to have JPOs
      deliver CM during their regular meetings with teens.

      The overarching purpose of this study is to increase justice-involved youths' access to an
      evidence-based practice for substance abuse, specifically Contingency Management (CM). This
      randomized controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of using juvenile probation
      officers (JPOs) to deliver CM to youth (aged 12-17 years) on their caseloads. CM is an
      evidence-based practice for substance abuse. The Investigators posit that JPOs are in an
      ideal position to deliver an evidence-based practice such as CM to youth because of their
      intensive involvement and frequent contact with the youth offenders under their supervision.
      The study randomizes 36 JPOs to 2 conditions: CM versus control (usual JPO services), and
      then randomizes 504 drug-abusing adolescent probationers across those 2 conditions. The
      research team will work with JPOs employed by the Department of Youth Services (DYS) in
      various counties in Oregon. JPOs will participate in focus groups and research interviews and
      will submit monthly audio-tapes of sessions with participating youth. JPOs randomized to the
      CM condition will receive training in how to deliver CM. As stated, participating youth will
      also be randomized to CM or control and assigned to a JPO in the same condition. For those in
      the CM group, the delivery of CM will be added to their regular meetings with their JPO.
      Research data will be collected from families via audio-taped interviews and questionnaires
      from youth and one caretaker. Urine samples for drug testing will also be collected from
      youth. Lastly, arrest records will be collected on youth for the 18 months pre- and
      post-entry into the study. The study involves 2 types of participants: youth (n=504) and
      juvenile probation officers (n=36), for a total of 540 anticipated participants.

    <description>Contingency Management (CM) utilizes behavior modification &amp; cognitive behavioral strategies to target adolescent alcohol or other drug (AOD) use. Protocol components are as follows: (a) The provider introduces CM to the family and engages them in the intervention; (b) The provider conducts Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (ABC) assessments of the youth's AOD use with the youth and caregiver; (c) Based on the results of the ABC assessments, self-management planning and drug refusal skills training are implemented by the provider in collaboration with the caregiver; (d) Concurrently, a point and level system contract is filled in by the family, which provides rewards/privileges for negative drug and alcohol tests and disincentives (e.g., extra chores) for positive tests. Until continued abstinence is achieved, components &quot;b&quot; through &quot;d&quot; are repeated; (e) The provider collaborates with the family to develop plans for sustaining long-term abstinence. Typical duration of CM is 12-16 weeks.</description>
