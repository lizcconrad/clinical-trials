  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are 1) to determine the influence of daily consumption of
      well-cooked broccoli on plasma and urinary glucosinolate metabolites, and 2) to determine
      inflammatory marker changes consistent with decreased cancer risk.

      Consumption of Brassica vegetables is inversely associated with incidence of several cancers,
      including cancer of the lung, stomach, liver, colon, rectum, breast, endometrium, and
      ovaries. Brassica vegetables are a good source of many nutrients, but the unique
      characteristic of Brassicas (Broccoli in particular) is their rich content of glucosinolates.
      Glucosinolates are sulfur-containing compounds that are converted to isothiocyanates (ITC) by
      an enzyme in the plant called myrosinase, which is released when the vesicles containing
      myrosinase are ruptured by chewing or cutting. The isothiocyanates are considered to be the
      active agent for cancer prevention. Some of the mechanisms by which isothiocyanates likely
      inhibit cancer include modulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes, induction of phase II enzymes,
      and apoptosis.

      The aim of this study is to investigate how daily consumption of broccoli with myrosinase
      inactivated by cooking influences glucosinolate metabolism and absorption, and consequent
      regulation of inflammatory markers.
