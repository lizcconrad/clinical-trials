  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonist on inducing
      diabetes remission in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most of type 2 diabetes are characterized by being overweight or obese mainly caused by
      insulin resistance. GLP-1 receptor agonist has been proved to help to lose weight and improve
      insulin resistance. In this study, we suppose that GLP-1 receptor agonist has the effect of
      inducing diabetes remission in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese
      and has its advantages
