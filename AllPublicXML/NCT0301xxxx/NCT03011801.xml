      This study evaluates Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) in the treatment of depression among
      pregnant women with elevated depressive symptoms. Half of the women will be randomized to
      receive IPT, and the other half will get Treat As Usual, provided via behavioral health in
      the hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is one of the most well established risk factors for
      the development of later child psychopathology. Accumulating evidence from naturalistic
      observational studies documents that fetal exposure to maternal depressive symptoms is
      associated with risk for later child mental health problems. Maternal depression is one of
      the most common prenatal complications with approximately 40% of women experiencing elevated
      levels of depressive symptoms. The majority of past research has been correlational, so
      potential causal conclusions have been limited. This project will break new ground by testing
      the hypothesis that manipulating maternal depressive symptoms will benefit infant outcomes.
      In this project, maternal depressive symptoms will be reduced using brief interpersonal
      therapy (IPT), a well-established and efficacious treatment, and testing whether this
      reduction leads to an improvement in the development of infant mechanisms associated with
      risk for later psychopathology. The investigators propose to assess 300 pregnant women who
      report elevated levels of depressive symptoms and their infants. Prior to the intervention,
      maternal measures of depressive symptoms will be collected. Then half of the women will be
      randomized to receive IPT and the other half will receive enhanced usual care (TAU). After
      completion of the intervention, maternal measures will be collected longitudinally through 14
      months postpartum. Infants will be evaluated at birth and two other times. Infants will be
      assessed across four units of analysis (brain structure and function, physiology, behavior,
      and maternal-report).

    <description>Maternity support services (MSS) is the usual standard of care for pregnant women. A multi-disciplinary team of obstetric care providers routinely screen women for possible depression diagnosis. If a woman screens positive, she is seen by a behavioral health specialist (BHS) for further assessment and to initiate treatment, if necessary. The goals of MSS include offering services to promote healthy pregnancies and positive birth and parenting outcomes, including integrating mental health and prenatal care. Women with elevated depressive symptoms are seen by BHS throughout the pregnancy and postpartum period and then bridged to mental health treatment. BHS provides eclectic-based care but does not provide IPT.</description>
