  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the increasing public health concern the obesity in Morocco, the aim of the
      present study was to use isotope techniques to assess body fat, total energy expenditure and
      physical activity to inform design and improve interventions for the prevention and control
      of obesity and related health risks such as diabetes and elevated blood pressure among
      children and adolescents. Specific objectives of the trial: 1. Determine the extent of
      obesity and physical activity levels in children and adolescents to design effective
      interventions in the school setting. 2.Propose alternative field based techniques for
      assessing body composition and physical activity that could be used in largescale situation
      assessments and in assessing interventions to address obesity and risk related health care. *
      For body composition: BMI z-score, waist circumference, waist measurement at height. * For
      physical activity: Questionnaire, Accelerometers 3. To identify factors contributing to the
      development of obesity and related health risks in schoolchildren and adolescents. 4.
      Collaborate with stakeholders (government, schools and / or colleges, communities and
      development partners) in designing interventions to address obesity and health risks. 5. To
      recommend to stakeholders the most effective interventions in schools to prevent and combat
      obesity and health risks in children and adolescents.

    <description>The collection of the samples and the analyses were undertaken according to the guidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In brief, after having emptied the bladder, each participant provided a predose saliva sample using a cotton ball.A 99.8 % deuterium dose of 0.5 g per kg body weight was given orally to the participant. The postdose sample was collected from 3h to 4h after the administration of the dose. The saliva samples were stored at 20°C until analysis by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).</description>

    <description>Each participant provided a predose urine sample. A dose of doubly labelled water 2.625 ml per kg body weight was given orally to the participant.
The post dose sample was collected at 3h to 4h , and on days 3, 7 and 14 after dosing. An aliquot of those samples were stored at 20°C in tightly sealed containers until analysis by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS).</description>

    <description>The participants were instructed to wear the accelerometer triaxial (GT3X+) attached to an elasticized belt around the waist, once they woke up until bed time at night for 7 consecutive days and to remove the accelerometer any time they were to perform activities that involve the use of water and when going to bed.</description>
