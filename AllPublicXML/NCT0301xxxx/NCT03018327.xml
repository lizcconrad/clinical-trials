  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant-related malignancies have emerged as one of the important complications after
      organ transplantation. Some studies have shown that transplant recipients have an increased
      risk of developing cancer, especially non-melanoma skin cancer. Because of iatrogenic
      immunosuppression in these patients, there is an increasing focus on human papillomavirus
      (HPV) related cancers.

      The occurrence of HPV infection and ano-genital precancerous lesions and genital warts among
      Danish renal transplant recipients (RTRs) is not known. Relatively few controlled studies
      exist on the prevalence of ano-genital HPV infection, anal precancerous lesions and cervical
      precancerous lesions among RTRs.

      Knowledge about HPV infection and HPV-related ano-genital precancerous lesions in renal
      transplant recipients, together with identification of factors that play a role for
      development of anal and cervical precancerous lesions, is important for the possibility of
      early detection and treatment to prevent progression to ano-genital cancers. Cervical
      cytology has been used for decades to detect cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN),
      whereas high-resolution anoscopy is a newer modality for the detection of anal
      intra-epithelial neoplasia (AIN). International guidelines recommend annually screening
      against cervical cancer for female renal transplant recipients, but currently no
      recommendation exists on screening against anal cancer.

      Aim: In a clinical study it is the aim to examine the prevalence of anal, penile, oral and
      cervical HPV infection as well as ano-genital dysplasia and ano-genital warts among 250 renal
      transplant recipients and an immunocompetent control group. Furthermore to identify factors
      associated with the development of AIN or CIN such as HPV type, viral load, duration of
      immunosuppression, and lifestyle factors such as sexual habits, reproductive history, smoking
      and alcohol habits, history of genital warts and other infections, and socio-economic
      variables.

        We will include 250 male and female renal transplant recipients in the case group. The
        patients will be recruited from &quot;The Transplantation Clinic&quot; at the Department of
        Dermato-venereology, Bispebjerg Hospital (BBH), where they are being followed for
        development of cutaneous (pre-)malignancies and from the Department of Nephrology at
        Rigshospital and Herlev Hospital, Denmark. In the control group we will include 250
        immunocompetent individuals consisting of male and female patients coming for control of
        birthmarks at the Nevus Clinic or Non-melanoma skin cancer and precancer at BBH and
        patients having laser treatment for benign cutaneous lesions at BBH. The participants will
        be enrolled in the study after informed consent has been obtained.
