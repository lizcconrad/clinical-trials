  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single arm, open-label, interventional trial of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      in patients with osteosarcoma who have experienced disease relapse or progression after at
      least one line of systemic treatment, and who are not eligible for curative surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with osteosarcoma, who are not eligible for surgery of curative intent and have
      completed at least one line of systemic therapy, will be considered for treatment with
      pembrolizumab. Patients who are considered medically unfit for chemotherapy and where no
      other treatment options are believed to be of major benefit may also be considered. Patients
      will receive pembrolizumab for up to 35 cycles.

      Patients, who have received 35 cycles of pembrolizumab or discontinued study treatment of
      another reason than progression, will in the follow-up period be assessed for safety and
      treatment-related toxicity (for up to 90 days), progression and survival.

      Patients who have achieved a clinically meaningful response after 35 cycles of pembrolizumab,
      defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) assessed by
      the Investigator by using RECIST, v1.1, and have not experienced any clinically significant
      toxicity of study treatment, may be considered for reintroduction of pembrolizumab, if
      progression is detected &gt; 8 weeks after cycle 35.

      Due to the low incidence of osteosarcoma, the inclusion rate is expected to be low, thus a
      Simon's two-stage design is suggested. Evaluation of efficacy and safety in stage one will be
      performed after the first 12 patients have been treated for 18 weeks:

        -  In case of ≤2 responders; the trial ends.

        -  If ≥3 responders, the trial will continue into stage II to a total number of 25
           patients.

               2. The patient can be eligible if he/she is considered medically unfit for
                  chemotherapy, as assessed by the sarcoma centre in charge of the patient's
                  treatment.

          3. Surgical resection with curative intent not possible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          4. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.

          5. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          6. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          7. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

          8. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the

             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             sarcomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

         10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         11. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

         12. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         13. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         16. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         18. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
