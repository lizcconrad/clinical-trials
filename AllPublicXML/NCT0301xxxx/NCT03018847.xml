  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of undertaking this study is to examine the use of COPD Co-PilotTM, a COPD
      disease management program manufactured and operated by HGE Health Care Solutions, LLC, in
      COPD patients outside of the geographic base of HGE's existing patient population
      (Philadelphia, PA). The purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of expanding the program to
      additional geographic sites and to examine whether similar outcome measures are achieved in
      patients under the supervision of health care providers that are new to the program.

    <description>The COPD Co-Pilot is a system that guides a patient through a software application (web or mobile app) to collect, track, and trend daily symptoms related to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The system is intended to be used by patients as a support tool to track COPD symptoms as part of their personal disease management plan. The COPD Co-Pilot allows health care providers to view and triage subject symptoms via the provider web-based application. Health care providers also have the ability to send responses to subjects, like medication recommendations, through preset forms in the system.</description>
