    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study that will assess the acquisition of immunity to Pf malaria over the
      course of 2-4 sequential Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) over 2-3 years, in 10
      healthy adult participants. The study is expected to last for 48 months and will include 28
      healthy male and female volunteers (10 active study volunteers and 18 naïve controls to
      confirm Pf infectivity during the 2nd -4th CHMI challenges) ages 18 to 45 years, inclusive,
      from the greater Baltimore community.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether protective immunity against
      parasite infection develops following repeat CHMI.

      This is a phase I study that will assess the acquisition of immunity to Pf malaria over the
      course of 2-4 sequential Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) over 2-3 years, in 10
      healthy adult participants. 10 subjects will initially be challenged with 5 uninfected
      mosquitoes (mock), followed by 4 challenges with 5 mosquitoes infected with drug sensitive,
      P. falciparum parasites (strain NF54) 2, 8, 14-20, and 20-32 months later. For the final
      three infective CMHIs six additional immunologic malaria-naïve subjects will be enrolled and
      challenged as infectivity controls. If dropouts occur within the original 10 person cohort,
      and two or more CHMI remain, back-up replacement volunteers will be recruited to undergo
      successive CHMI with the core group. All volunteers (repeat CHMI subjects and infectivity
      controls) will be evaluated as part of an inpatient stay to diagnose Pf malaria infection and
      treat with Coartem® (artemether/lumefantrine) or Malarone® (Atovaquone/proguanil). Inpatient
      observation will occur from Study Days 9-19 or until three-day directly observed therapy for
      P. falciparum infection is complete and two negative smears separated by a time interval &gt;12
      hours have been documented. A third negative smear &gt;12 hours after the previous two inpatient
      smears will be documented to affirm malaria cure. The repeat CHMI subjects will have
      additional outpatient visits days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the challenge to obtain blood samples
      to monitor the development of immunity. The study is expected to last for 48 months and will
      include approximately 28 healthy male and female volunteers (10 active study volunteers and
      18 naïve controls to confirm Pf infectivity during the 2nd -4th CHMI challenges) ages 18 to
      45 years, inclusive, from the greater Baltimore community. The primary objective of this
      study is to determine whether protective immunity against parasite infection develops
      following repeat CHMI. The secondary objectives are to: 1) determine whether clinical signs
      and symptoms of malaria decrease in intensity and duration following repeat CHMI, 2) identify
      which PBMCs are activated and proliferate on Study Days 6 and 8, treatment day and 7 days
      post treatment initiation or, if aparasitemic, Study Days 13 and 21 to compare responses over
      time and to sequential CHMI, 3) track the production of antibodies that react with P.
      falciparum sporozoites and blood stage parasites.
