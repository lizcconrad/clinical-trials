        All patients in the THIN database who have a Read code for AI and have been prescribed
        either IR hydrocortisone or prednisolone or MR hydrocortisone (plenadren) between 2010 and
        the date of data extraction will be included

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cohort 1 (IR hydrocortisone): All patients with a Read code for AI and a prescription
             of IR hydrocortisone between 2010 and data extraction but no prescription for MR
             hydrocortisone at any time during this period, and no earlier prescription for IR
             prednisolone during this period

          2. Cohort 2 (IR prednisolone): All patients with a Read code for AI and a prescription of
             IR prednisolone between 2010 and data extraction but no prescription for MR
             prednisolone at any time during this period, and no earlier prescription for IR
             prednisolone during this period

          3. Cohort 3a (MR Hydrocortisone): All patients with a Read code for AI and a prescription
             of MR hydrocortisone between 2010 and data extraction

          4. Cohort 3b (IR to MR hydrocortisone): A sub-set of patients from cohort 3a, who have
             switched from IR to MR hydrocortisone.

          5. A list of pre-defined READ codes will be used to identify all patients with primary or
             secondary AI or CAH in the THIN database.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1)Patients who have not received a prescription of hydrocortisone or prednisolone in the
        past five years will be excluded as the aim of the study is to describe recent experience.
