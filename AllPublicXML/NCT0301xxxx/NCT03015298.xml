  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective comparison of PET/MRI and PET/CT for gastric cancer will be performed,to
      evaluate the value of PET/MRI in predicting the preoperative staging and resectability of
      gastric cancer and investigate the role of PET/MRI in gastric cancer diagnosis.The evaluation
      parameters are the diagnostic accuracy of gastric cancer staging( including the overall
      accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity) and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC).
