  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is one of a common neurological disorder. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are usually the
      primary treatment of epilepsy. However, almost 30% of patients do not respond to AEDs and
      other treatments including ketogenic diet (KD) are used. The Ketogenic Diet (KD) is a
      low-carbohydrate, high fat, adequate-protein diet. In this study, investigators are going to
      compare two kinds of the ketogenic diet namely classical ketogenic diet and modified Atkins
      diet. Fifty children and adolescents with intractable epilepsy will be included, 25 patients
      in each group, and will receive the diet for three months on non-randomised basis. In the
      classical ketogenic diet, the diet with a ratio of 4 to 1 (4:1), each 4 grams of fat to each
      gram of carbohydrate plus protein, will be introduced. Classical ketogenic diet will be
      established on outpatient setting, without fasting and gradually. The modified Atkins diet
      will be applied by the ratio of 1:1 or 2:1, each 1 or 2 grams of fat to each gram of
      carbohydrate plus protein.
