  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single center, prospective study to assess the efficacy of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC)
      in improving obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) parameters in patients with reduced tolerance to
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single center, prospective study. The study would include 30 patients diagnosed within the
      past 2 years with moderate to severe OSA (AHI&gt;=15) at the Rabin Medical Center (RMC) sleep
      lab, and who are intolerant to CPAP treatment. Following signing an informed consent form,
      these patients would undergo polysomnography (PSG) while treated with HFNC. The HFNC PSG
      outcome measures will be compared to the baseline PSG done within the past 2 years and to an
      additional PSG while connected to a CPAP device.
