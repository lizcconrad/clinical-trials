  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted video interventions
      designed to increase organ donation knowledge, intentions, and designations among adolescents
      enrolled in driver's education classes, as well as to increase the commitment of
      parents/legal guardians to authorize organ donation in the event of their adolescent's death.
      The central hypothesis is that integrating donation education into the driver's education
      curriculum will increase knowledge and attitudes that facilitate the behavioral action of
      donor designation at the time of getting a new driver's license.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Organ Donation Registration</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the adolescent's donor designation (yes-no) at the time of obtaining their first driver's license at the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) office. For most study participants, this decision will occur within 3-6 months of the intervention. We have an established relationship with the Information Technology group in the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. They are able to provide us with de-identified individual-level data on donor designation, age, sex, and census tract identification. Additionally, adolescents will be asked to self-report age, sex, race/ethnicity, and school achievement level (&quot;Mostlyâ€¦As, Bs, Cs, Ds/Fs&quot;).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Organ Donation Knowledge and Attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Twenty one item questionnaires will be completed by adolescents in the driver's education classroom at pre-intervention, post-intervention and at 1 week follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Parental Commitment</measure>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>There are no explicit statistics or facts about transplantation or donation in this video intervention. It is designed to appeal to those with lower motivation to process factual arguments, focusing instead on emotional appeal and peers modeling the targeted behavior, thus allowing for peripheral processing of the donation message.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Informational Messaging</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>This video intervention will mirror common educational campaigns and focus exclusively on factual arguments for organ donation, including the current supply-demand problem in transplantation, common reasons for/against donor designation, myths about donation, religious views of donation, the importance of communicating the donation decision to parents, and information about donor registries and how to register as a donor. This video will appeal to those with greater motivation to process factual arguments for donor designation. The video will be narrated by male and female adolescent peers. No personal testimonials will be displayed in this video.</description>
