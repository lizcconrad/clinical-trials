  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to implement the internet-based aftercare program 'GSA-Online
      plus' in several rehabilitation clinics with patients of different indications
      (psychosomatic, orthopedic and cardiovascular diseases). 'GSA-Online plus' is an
      internet-based aftercare program for patients with work-related problems or anxieties facing
      return to work after longterm sickness absence and inpatient rehabilitation. The patients
      have access to various exploratory and motivational videos on the study website until their
      inpatient rehabilitation ends. Afterwards, they start a 12-week writing intervention based on
      a psychotherapeutic concept, the psychodynamic 'Core Conflictual Relationship Theme Method
      (CCRT)'. Patients write weekly online diary entries which are answered by anonymous online
      therapists usually within 24 hours. In a previous randomised controlled trial the efficacy of
      the intervention was determined, whereas the current study focuses on the implementation and
      realization in a naturalistic setting (effectiveness).
