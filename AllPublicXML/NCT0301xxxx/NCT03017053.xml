  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical nodal metastasis is the most certain prognostic factor in oral cancer. Appropriate
      management of the neck is therefore of paramount importance in the treatment of oral cancer.
      However, there is still some controversy on the treatment of early maxillofacial
      malignancies. Currently, investigators have no accurate uniform treatment standards,
      including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended between surgery and
      radiotherapy options. Clinical evaluation indicated that lymph node-negative patients
      eventually 25%-35% had cervical node metastasis. Therefore, for the majority of patients with
      true node-negative, preventive cervical lymph node dissection is obviously over-treatment,
      and lower quality of life. Radiotherapy can avoid such surgery.

      Objective: To evaluate the effect of radiotherapy on the neck of early oral cancer with poor
      pathologic factors.

      This is a randomized, prospective, open, multicenter study. Intervention: Patients receive
      primary tumor resection followed by radiotherapy.

      Control: Patients receive primary tumor resection with selective neck dissection.

      Primary:

      2 years neck control rates

      Secondary:

      Disease-free survival (1, 2, 3, 5 years) Overall survival (3, 5 years) Quality of life

      Endpoint definition:

      1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years disease-free survival is defined as: patients proportion
      from the date of surgery completion to 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years did not find clear
      evidence of recurrence or metastasis.

      3 years, 5 years overall survival is defined as: the proportion of patients who survived from
      the beginning of the study to the third and fifth year in the total enrollment.
