      The aim of this trials investigates the therapeutic effects of application autologous oral
      mucosal epithelial cell sheets in the treatment of limbal stem cell deficiency disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A number of external factors can result in limbal stem cell deficiency(LSCD), causing pain,
      pathological corneal epithelium regeneration, inflammation reaction and seriously visual
      loss. For patients with unilaterally damaged eye, transplantation of limbal tissue from the
      healthy eye can be used in the past years in the risk of inducing limbal stem cell damaged in
      the healthy eye. While graft of human leukocyte antigen matched allogenic limbal stem cells
      require immune suppressive medications, it can cause side effects in the body. Over the past
      10 years, the clinical trials of application of cultured autologous oral mucosal epithelial
      cell sheet to treat LSCD have been emerged as a promising strategy in many countries.
      However, little study has been reported in China. This study investigates the therapeutic
      effects of application autologous oral mucosal epithelial cell sheets in the treatment of
      limbal stem cell deficiency disease in China.

    <description>The preoperative status of the eye will be recorded on the basis of clinical drawings and pre-and post-operative photographs. These pictures will be sent to two corneal experts in order to evaluate the results.
Judgement criterion: the results will be tested with a slit lamp:
Normal: no epithelial loss; Mild: the area of epithelial loss &lt;1/3; Moderate: the area of epithelial loss &gt;1/3 &lt;2/3; Severe: the area of epithelial loss&gt; 2/3</description>
