    <textblock>
      This is a biomarker preselected, randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase II study in men
      with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients with tumors that have
      ATM, BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations/deletions/loss of heterozygosity will be randomized in a
      1:1:1 fashion to each arm. Patients with mutations in noncanonical DNA repair genes including
      FANCA, PALB2, RAD51, ERCC3, MRE11, NBN, MLH3, CDK12, CHEK2, HDAC2, ATR, PMS2, GEN1, MSH2,
      MSH6, BRIP1, or FAM175A defects will be assigned to Arm IV with single agent olaparib.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             that is approved by the local institutional review board and HIPAA authorization for
             the release of personal health information.

          -  Histological or cytological proof of prostate adenocarcinoma (Note: small-cell
             carcinoma of the prostate is not permitted)

          -  Documented progressive mCRPC based on at least one of the following criteria:

               1. PSA progression defined as 25% increase over baseline value with an increase in
                  the absolute value of at least 2.0 ng/mL that is confirmed by another PSA level
                  with a minimum of a 1 week interval and a minimum PSA of 2.0 ng/mL.

               2. Progression of bidimensionally measurable soft tissue or nodal metastasis
                  assessed within one month prior to registration by a CT scan or MRI.

               3. Progression of bone disease (evaluable disease) (new bone lesion(s)) by bone
                  scan.

          -  Agree to undergo a biopsy of at least one metastatic site to determine DNA repair
             defects. However:

               1. Adequate metastatic tissue from prior metastatic disease biopsy/resection can be
                  used if available in lieu of a biopsy. These patients will only be eligible for
                  protocol therapy if the biopsy has tumor that is positive for DNA repair defects.

               2. Patients with known DNA damage repair defects based on prior appropriately
                  validated metastatic disease analysis may be used in lieu of new biopsy/analysis
                  based on central site evaluation of quality of the biopsy and analysis.

               3. Patients with known germline DNA repair defects are eligible without a biopsy.
                  However it will be highly desirable that they undergo a metastatic disease biopsy
                  to better define the scope of the DNA repair defects in the current disease
                  context.

          -  ECOG status of 0-2 (Appendix A: Performance Status Criteria).

        the upper limit of normal (ULN) in those with Gilbert's disease) AST (SGOT) / ALT (SGPT) ≤
        1.5x institutional ULN unless liver metastases are present in which case it must be ≤ 5x
        ULN

          -  The effects of abiraterone, olaparib or the combination of both on the developing
             human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. Men must agree to use

             and for at least 3 months thereafter.

          -  Patients must discontinue antiandrogen therapy (i.e., flutamide, bicalutamide,
             nilutamide) for at least 4 weeks prior to registration with no evidence of a falling
             PSA after washout.

          -  Serum testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL. Patients must continue primary ADT with an LHRH
             analogue (agonist or antagonist) if they have not undergone orchiectomy.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy ≥ 6 months.

             days must have elapsed since completion of radiation therapy or surgery and patient
             must have recovered from all side effects at the time of registration (e.g. back to

        Note: Patients can receive a stable dose of bisphosphonates for bone metastases, including
        zoledronic acid, or denosumab before and during the study as deemed appropriate by the
        treating physician.

          -  Prior exposure to enzalutamide, ARN-509 or other investigational AR-directed therapy
             in the setting of mCRPC.

             cancer or superficial transitional cell carcinoma.

        Note: Patients are not considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have
        completed all therapy and are now considered without evidence of disease for 1 year.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents. Any prior investigational agents
             must be stopped at least 14 days (2 week washout) prior to registration.

          -  Patients who have received itraconazole, ketoconazole, or fluconazole within 3 weeks
             prior to registration or those who have not recovered (i.e., back to baseline or Grade

             composition to olaparib or abiraterone.

          -  Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection. Examples
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3
             months) myocardial infarction, unstable spinal cord compression (untreated or unstable
             within at least 28 days prior to registration), superior vena cava syndrome, and
             extensive bilateral lung disease on HRCT scan or any psychiatric disorder that
             prohibits obtaining informed consent.

             indicators of bone marrow failure or abnormality.

          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome / acute myeloid leukemia.

             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with olaparib. In addition these patients
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow suppressive
             therapy.

          -  Patients with known active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.

          -  Patients with baseline moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B and

          -  Patients with any condition likely to interfere with absorption of the study
             medication.
