      Sleep disorders are commonly under-recognized in the primary care setting and available
      screening tools are often are limited. The study inestigators hypothesize that the use of a
      novel subjective sleep vital sign (VS) will improve recognition of patients with sleep
      disorders and can be utilized to track outcomes to sleep therapy.

      Background

      The ability to identify patients with sleep disorders is recognized as increasingly important
      given its association with cardiovascular disease and impact on daytime functioning and
      quality of life. The Center for Disease Control recently characterized insufficient sleep as
      a public health issue, while also estimating that 1 in 25 adults admit to falling asleep
      while driving in a given month. 50 to 70 million Americans are affected by chronic sleep
      disorders and intermittent sleep problems, yet sleep problems are under-recognized; for
      example, 80 to 90% of adults with sleep disordered breathing remain undiagnosed. Sleep
      disorder screening tools are available, but are often limited by the following factors:

        1. Surveys may be extensive and thereby limit utilization

        2. Screening tools are often targeted for specific sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep
           apnea (OSA)) rather than to more comprehensively screen for a wide range of sleep
           disorders

        3. Screening tools may not be useful in assessing outcomes during follow-up care

      The study investigators propose the development of a sleep vital sign (VS) constructed as a
      simple-to-use survey tool that can assist primary care in identifying patients with sleep
      disorders and be potentially useful to assess response to treatment.

      A simple to use Sleep VS can potentially benefit patients, make an impact on public health,
      and assist primary care providers on recognizing and caring for patients with potential sleep
      disorders.

      Study Proposal

      This study will investigate the use of a sleep VS (subjective patient reported metric) as a
      potential tool to identify patients with sleep disorders and to measure outcomes during
      follow-up care.

      This pilot study is structured as a 3-arm randomized clinical trial with the following
      specific aims:

        1. To determine whether a subjective sleep vital sign can improve the rate of identifying
           patients with sleep disorders in a primary care setting.

        2. To determine if a subjective sleep vital sign can track patient therapy response for
           various sleep disorders.

        3. To correlate a subjective sleep vital sign results with validated sleep measurements
           (e.g. sleep surveys, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) usage).

      Methods

      Study Design: This study is a 3-arm randomized clinical trial. Patients checking into the
      primary care clinic will be assigned to the Active Sleep VS Pathway, Non-Active Sleep VS
      Pathway, or to Usual Care.

      Randomization will occur through group randomization in which each clinic will be assigned to
      follow one of the three pathways for the day (1:1:1 ratio). Block randomization will also be
      utilized in order to ensure balanced enrollment into the three pathways.

      Active Sleep VS Pathway: Patients will be provided a Sleep VS survey packet at check in
      (packet includes: Sleep VS, sleep-wake assessment, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Functional
      Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire 10 (FOSQ-10), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI))--all are
      standard surveys used clinically.

      The proposed Sleep VS is based on the following 2 questions:

        1. How many days a week is the participant satisfied with his/her sleep?

        2. How many days a week is sleepiness a problem?

      For the purposes of this study, the Sleep VS will be considered a positive screen if the
      patient is satisfied with their sleep less than half the week (≤4 days) or if sleepiness is a
      problem at least half the week (≥4 days).

      Medical assistants will review the Sleep VS, and patients that screen positive will be:

        1. Asked an extended set of sleep questions (see below)

        2. Brought to the attention of the primary care physician.

      Expanded questionnaire

        1. Does the participant snore or wake up from sleep gasping?

        2. Does the participant have frequent problems falling asleep or staying asleep?

        3. Does the participant regularly get less than 6 hours of sleep per night?

        4. Is the participant a shift worker?

        5. Do leg restlessness or creepy-crawly sensations give the participant problems sleeping?

        6. Does the participant take three or more medications for depression and/or sleep?

        7. Does dozing off while awake regularly impact the participant's ability to function?

      A triaging algorithm will be available based on answers to the extended sleep questions to
      assist the primary care physician with assessment and triaging care. Patients will primarily
      be triaged to sleep medicine (for OSA assessment, complex insomnia patients, and other
      patients with more complex sleep disorders), to health education 4-week cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) program for less complex insomnia, or remain under the care of the primary care
      physician. At each of the sleep medicine and health education appointments, the patient will
      be asked to complete the sleep vital sign survey packet.

      Patients that screen &quot;negative&quot; will not be asked the extended sleep questions nor will they
      be brought to the attention of the primary care physician and proceed with &quot;usual care.&quot; If
      during the course of &quot;usual care&quot;, a potential sleep disorder is discussed, the extended
      sleep questions with triaging algorithm can still be utilized to assist in determining
      management.

      Non- Active Sleep VS Pathway: At time of check-in, the patients will also be provided the
      Sleep vital sign survey packet. However, the packet will be collected by the receptionist and
      unavailable to the primary care medical assistants nor physicians, and the patients will
      proceed with &quot;usual care&quot;. If during the course of &quot;usual care&quot;, a potential sleep disorder
      is discussed, the extended sleep questions with triaging algorithm can still be utilized to
      assist in determining management.

      Usual Care Pathway: Patients will not be provided the sleep VS packet during check-in. If
      during the course of usual care, a potential sleep disorder is discussed, the extended sleep
      questions with triaging algorithm can still be utilized to assist in determining management.

      Statistical Analysis

      This is a pilot study without pre-existing data to determine power calculation. The study
      investigators intend to enroll 2000 patients into the study. Given the high prevalence of
      sleep disorders (estimate that 20% of the population has chronic insomnia and 16% of the
      population has OSA), it is anticipated that 666 patients in each pathway should allow us to
      detect a difference in rate of sleep diagnoses. Comparisons between groups will be analyzed
      utilizing Student's T-test which should be appropriate given the anticipated sample size even
      if distribution is skewed. Correlations between sleep VS data and other established sleep
      metrics (e.g. survey, CPAP usage) will be analyzed with scatter plot and regression.
      Pearson's correlation may be applied if relationship is determined to be linear.
