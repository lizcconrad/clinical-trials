    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of a single oral dose of moxidectin on the QT interval
      associated with moxidectin plasma concentrations.

      The effect of moxidectin on other ECG intervals, and on safety, will also be assessed, as
      will preliminary pharmacokinetics and metabolism

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Moxidectin is being developed as a treatment for Onchocerciasis (river blindness), a serious,
      debilitating, disease caused by a parasitic worm, Onchocerca volvulus.

      Five dose levels of moxidectin will be administered to healthy volunteers and ECG assessments
      undertaken at pre-specified pharmacokinetic time points to correlate QT interval with
      moxidectin concentration in plasma.
