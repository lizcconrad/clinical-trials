  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-arm, phase III non-inferiority trial to evaluate the safety of a
      liberalized hospital diet inclusive of fresh fruits and vegetables to a neutropenic diet in
      patients with prolonged neutropenia. Both cohorts and diets will adhere to the hygiene and
      common sense advice listed in the FDA-endorsed food safety guidelines.
