    <textblock>
      RCT to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 16666 &amp; Lactobacillus
      reuteri DSM 17938 to significantly modify the frequency of clinical or bacteriological cure
      in women with non complicated acute cystitis who receive probiotics for 12 days compared with
      the frequency in women who receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, pilot trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of L. reuteri in non menopausal women with non complicated cystitis in terms of the frequency
      of clinical or bacteriological cure. Secondary outcomes will be a) time to
      clinical/laboratory relapse in at least 70% of women with non complicated acute cystitis who
      receive probiotics for 12 days compared with the time in women who receive placebo; b)
      frequency of clinical/laboratory and bacteriologic relapse in women with non complicated
      acute cystitis who receive probiotics for 12 days compared with the frequency in women who
      receive placebo, at day 30 after treatment start and c) frequency of adverse related events
      in women with non complicated acute cystitis who receive probiotics for 12 days compared with
      the frequency in women who receive placebo. In the active product we will use 5*10^8 CFU of
      Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 16666 &amp; Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 + cranberry extract. The
      control group will recibe Cranberry extract. The products will be taken twice per day,
      morning and evening.
