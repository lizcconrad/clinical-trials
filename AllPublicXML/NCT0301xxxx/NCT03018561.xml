  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with cardiovascular risk (CV) factors (obesity, diabetes, etc...) or established heart
      disease (such as coronary heart disease or chronic heart failure) often have cognitive
      dysfunction as compared to people without CV risk factors or heart disease. Among the
      mechanisms, a reduced cardiac output and cerebral blood flow in those people have been
      suggested. The aim of this study was to compare resting cognitive function, maximal
      cardiopulmonary function, cardiac output and cerebral hemodynamics during exercise in
      patients with metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, or heart failure vs. healthy
      subjects.

      All subjects will underwent a baseline evaluation including a medical history, physical
      examination with measurement of height and weight, body composition and fasting blood sample.
      All subjects will performed a cognitive testing at rest and a maximal cardiopulmonary
      exercise test (CEPT) with gas exchange analysis. During CEPT, cerebral oxygenation (measured
      by near-infra red spectroscopy) and cardiac hemodynamics responses (impedance cardiography)
      will be measured continuously.
