  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare, over 24 months, the time spent with
      clinically significant mood symptoms (ie, mania, depression), as measured by the Longitudinal
      Interval Follow-Up Evaluation (LIFE) and the Psychiatric Status Rating Scale (PSR), in
      offspring of bipolar parents with and without at least mild impairment in psychosocial
      functioning.

    <measure>Proportion of Weeks Spent With Clinically Significant Mood Symptoms in a 24-Month Longitudinal Study Period, Which will be Derived From the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation (LIFE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The LIFE is a semi-structured interview developed for prospectively following the course of psychiatric disorders; the LIFE collects detailed psychosocial, psychopathologic and treatment information for a 6-month follow-up interval.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Weeks Spent With Clinically Significant Mood Symptoms in a 24-Month Longitudinal Study Period, Which will be Derived From the Psychiatric Status Rating (PSR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Weekly symptomatic status, including symptom severity, will be assessed through the Psychiatric Status Ratings (PSRs). Ratings of 1 or 2 on the PSR represent remission or minimal symptoms; ratings of 3 or 4 represent clinically significant subthreshold symptoms; a rating of 5 represents a current episode of hypomania or moderate major depression; and a rating of 6 represents a current episode of mania or severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>GAF is a numeric scale (1 through 100) used by mental health clinicians and physicians to rate the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults.</description>

    <measure>Bipolar Prodrome Symptom Interview and Scale-Prospective (BPSS-P)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BPSS-P assesses the onset and severity of prodromal symptoms and is divided into 3 sections: Mania, Depression, and General Symptom Index. The BPSS-P yields a total score, and separate scores each of the 3 sections.</description>

    <measure>Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychological Testing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychological testing will be performed using a computerized test battery, as well as &quot;paper-based&quot; neuropsychological tasks to have a better understanding of the contribution of cognitive function and potential deficits in domains relevant for Bipolar Disorder (BD) to the clinical symptoms and longitudinal trajectory over 24 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>General Behavioral Inventory (GBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>GBI is a 73-item, self-assessment questionnaire designed to assess symptoms of depression and mania/hypomania (18 or higher for depression or 13 or lower for mania/hypomania).</description>

        Offspring of parents with Bipolar Disprder (BD) will be recruited primarily at selected
        sites which are already conducting research in prodromal BD and have the necessary setup
        and resources already in place to conduct such a study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have at least one parent who meets the criteria for diagnosis of
             Bipolar I disorder (BD-I) or Bipolar II disorder (BD-II), as confirmed by the Mini
             International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) administered to the parent. MINI will
             be administered to parent if the history of BD is endorsed by Family Index of Risk for
             Mood (FIRM) or other medical information (psychiatrist, medical records). The MINI can
             be administered to the parent remotely through the telephone or video call if an
             in-person interview is not feasible due to logistical reasons. A diagnosis Bipolar
             Disorder Not Otherwise Specified in the parent would not qualify for eligibility

          -  Participants must be either drug-naive, or on stable treatment for at least 4 weeks.

          -  Participants (and/or their parents as applicable) must sign an Informed Consent Form
             (ICF) allowing data collection and source data verification in accordance with local
             requirements and/or sponsor policy. Adolescents (minors) who in the judgment of the
             investigator are capable of understanding the nature of the study can be enrolled only
             after obtaining consent of a legally acceptable representative. Assent must be
             obtained from any participating adolescents (minors), if applicable

          -  Participants must be willing and able to complete self-reported assessments via mobile
             electronic device, and to wear a wrist actigraphy device for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) -IV Diagnosis of bipolar I
             or bipolar II disorder

          -  DSM-IV Diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder

          -  DSM-IV Diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders

          -  An intelligence quotient (IQ) score less than (&lt;) 80 as determined by Kaufman Brief
             Intelligence Test (K-BIT)

          -  Uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism
