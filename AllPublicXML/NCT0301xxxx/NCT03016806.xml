      This study is a single-center treatment protocol with four possible preparative regimens,
      designed to validate the process of umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation at our
      institution. Enrolled patients will receive chemotherapy +/-total body radiation as a
      pre-transplant conditioning regimen. Patients will then receive cord blood stem cells
      followed by GvHD prophylaxis that will include Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil, or
      Cyclosporin A and Methylprednisolone. Multiple data points will be collected prior to,
      during, and following transplantation to ensure safety of the process and to evaluate the
      stated objectives.

    <measure>Engraftment of ANC and Platelets</measure>
    <time_frame>42 days following the infusion of stem cells for ANC [If engraftment of ANC does not occur within 42 days, a subsequent transplant will be performed if a donor is available.]</time_frame>
    <description>The date of engraftment of ANC is the first of 3 consecutive days of ANC of 500 or higher based on daily CBC and Differential Counts. The date of engraftment of platelets is the first of three consecutive days of platelet counts of 20,000 or higher in the absence of platelet transfusions for a t least 7 days prior.</description>

    <time_frame>At 30 days, 100 days, 6 months and yearly from the date of transplant until the date of documented graft failure or the subject's death up to 120 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients who fail to initially engraft ANC will be tabulated as well as the percentage of patients who have primary engraftment of ANC but whose graft fails as evidenced by pancytopenia, failure of bone marrow function and loss of donor chimerism following initial engraftment of ANC.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days and 100 days after transplant from the date of transplant until the date of documented acute GvHD.</time_frame>
    <description>Routine physical exams, liver function tests, and clinical history of diarrhea and upper GI symptoms will be used to assess the presence of, the maximum severity of and the date of onset of Acute GvHD based on the criteria published by Przepioka et al., Bone Marrow Transplant 1995; 15(6):825-8 as used by the Center for International Blood &amp; Marrow Transplant Research. The percentage of patients developing symptoms of acute graft-versus-host disease will be tabulated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease</measure>

    <measure>Disease-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>At 30 days, 100 days, 6 months and yearly after transplant from the date of transplant until the date of documented graft failure or the subject's death up to 120 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Document and update the length of time a subject survives without recurrence of the disease for which they were transplanted at 30 days, 100 days, 6 months and yearly following the infusion of cord blood stem cells for as long as the subjects survive and remain disease-free.</description>
