  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to evaluate the nicotine induced acute cardiovascular changes in
      E-Cigarette users and also study the mechanism involved particularly with vascular
      impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit 30 experienced E-cigarette users (those using E-Cigarette for at least 1
      month and ≤ 1 tobacco cigarette / day), between ages 21-40 years; in 4 day study visit and 10
      non-smokers (those who used less than 100 tobacco cigarettes in their lifetime and not active
      nicotine/tobacco or related product user) for a one study visit.The participants will be
      asked to abstain from all tobacco/nicotine and related product use for 12 hours before each
      visit.

      Measurements will be taken at each study visit before and after E-cigarette use, each day
      with different nicotine dose, to look at both the individuals' exposure to nicotine and also
      the effects on the cardiovascular system. These measurements will include blood and urine
      samples as well as non-invasive cardiovascular measurements.
