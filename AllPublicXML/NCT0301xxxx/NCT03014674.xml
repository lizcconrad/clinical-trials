  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mepolizumab (SB-240563) is a humanized monoclonal antibody (Immunoglobulin G1, kappa, mAb)
      that blocks human interleukin-5 (hIL-5) from binding to the interleukin (IL)-5 receptor
      complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits signaling. This study will
      compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of mepolizumab administered as a liquid drug product
      in two different devices with the reconstituted lyophilized drug product in healthy subjects.
      Subjects will receive a single administration of 100 milligram (mg) mepolizumab as a single
      injection. The randomization will be stratified by body weight (&lt;70 kilogram (kg), 70 &lt;80 kg
      and &gt;=80 kg) and the site of injection will be randomized 1:1:1 to the upper arm, abdomen or
      thigh. Approximately 243 healthy subjects will be randomized so that at least 9 subjects are
      randomized to each mepolizumab treatment within each weight strata and 3 subjects within each
      mepolizumab treatment, weight strata and injection site. Each subject will participate in the
      study for up to approximately 16 weeks (up to 85 days after drug administration), and will
      have a screening visit, a single dose treatment period, and a follow-up visit.

          -  A vulnerable subject. Defined as individuals whose willingness to volunteer in a
             clinical trial may be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not,
