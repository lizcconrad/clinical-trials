    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current explorative study is to examine the effects of health-related
      internet use in individuals with pathological health anxiety using ambulatory assessment. In
      a naturalistic setting participants answer over a seven-day period questionnaires about their
      health-related internet use and its effects on affect, health anxiety and symptom severity in
      their usual daily lives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The internet is a popular method for obtaining information. Increasingly, it is also used to
      answer medical and health questions, because compared to other methods (e.g. going to the
      library or visiting a doctor) it has a number of advantages to offer like low costs,
      availability, easy accessibility, anonymity, and great diversity of information types and
      sources. 60 to 80 percent of internet users search online for medical information. In this
      context the term &quot;cyberchondria&quot; was coined in the media to describe the potentially
      detrimental effects of this behavior. The first studies in this field using self-report
      retrospective data showed that individuals with elevated levels of health anxiety seem to
      make increased use of the internet for this purpose and it seems to maintain health anxiety
      in the long-term. However, up until today little is known about the consequences of this
      behavior and the maintaining mechanism.

      This observational study aims to investigate the effects of health-related internet use in
      individuals with pathological health anxiety in a naturalistic setting using ambulatory
      assessment. The variables of interest are monitored using time- and event-based sampling
      methods. Therefore, over a seven-day period participants answer seven times a day
      questionnaires on a mobile phone in their usual daily lives and additionally track the
      variables of interest in the moment the target behavior (health-related internet use) occurs.
      To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate these relations using ambulatory
      assessment and therefore additionally aims to investigate the feasibility of this study
      design in this specific field of research.
