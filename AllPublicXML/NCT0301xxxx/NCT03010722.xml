  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre prospective biological translational research study involving the
      collection of tumour tissue, blood samples and clinical data from patients being treated with
      regorafenib for metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC) at the Royal Marsden Hospital. Patients
      will be eligible for the study if they have a histological diagnosis of CRC, are refractory
      to standard available therapies with palliative intent for mCRC, have received prior
      treatment with at least one anti-VEGF antibody and chemotherapy drugs including fluorouracil
      (5FU) or capecitabine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan, and patients have RAS mutant tumours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory translational research study to obtain research biopsies of RAS mutant
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) tumour tissue prior to commencement of regorafenib
      multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (MKI) treatment targeting vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor (VEGFR), tumour microenvironment and oncogenic driver alterations, and again at
      development of resistance. Candidate markers of resistance will be identified in tissue
      biopsies through genetic and other molecular analysis and parallel collection of serial blood
      specimens will facilitate the identification of resistance markers and the tracking of
      resistance evolution in circulating nucleic acids. Early dynamic contrast enhanced MRI
      (DCE-MRI) along with diffusion weighted (DW)-MRI imaging at the beginning, and on day 15+/-7
      post treatment will be performed. Additionally, dual contrast enhanced CT (DECT) will be
      performed according to routine clinical evaluation time points before drug administration and
      at 8 weeks after drug administration. Disease will be monitored with serial CT scans of the
      chest abdomen and pelvis (CT-CAP) every eight weeks, until progression. The aim of the study
      is to identify novel predictive biomarkers of resistance and response to this targeted
      therapy in mCRC previously treated with oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidines and irinotecan, using
      genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomics, proteomic and live tissue culture methods. These
      molecular analyses will be performed on metastatic tumour tissue samples taken firstly before
      commencement of regorafenib, and secondly on progression of disease, and thirdly from
      archival primary or metastatic tumour tissue. There is an additional biopsy at 8 weeks in
      patients with response or stable disease, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

    <description>DCR will be defined as complete response (CR)/partial response (PR)/ stable disease (SD) using RECIST v1.1. Chi2 or Fisher's exact tests will be employed to explore whether there is an association between low or high mutations and DCR. Logistic regression will be employed to produce odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).</description>

    <description>PFS will be measured from start of treatment to date of progression or death from any cause.Logistic regression will be employed to produce odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves will be generated for each group. The log-rank test will be used to compare the survival curves and a Cox proportional hazards model will be fitted to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. The proportional hazards assumption will be tested with the use of Schoenfeld residuals</description>

    <description>Dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) will be performed pre-treatment and at day 15. KEF changes of more than 70% between the two time points will be considered significant and patients will be thus stratified in two groups, i.e. A) drop in KEF of &gt;70% and B) less than 70% drop in KEF.</description>
