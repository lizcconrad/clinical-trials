  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new law about the advance directives (AD) has been recently voted in France on February 2,
      2016. This &quot; Claeys-Leonetti &quot; law has made the AD more binding, as in other countries. This
      should lead to a greater respect of the human autonomy principle. However, the interpretation
      of these guidelines is often difficult and may differ between doctors. Indeed, the
      subjectivity of these interpretations could lead to different medical decisions by
      physicians.

      The investigators intend to assess the effect of advance directives (AD) on decision making
      in care by intensivists, using a simulated (hypothetical) situation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational simulation (hypothetical) study of intensivist decisions for selected real
      patients.

      Each patient writes advance directives (AD) after receiving clear information (videos and
      interview with an independent intensivist).

      Intensivists answer to 5 questions for two simulations (hypothetical) models (scenario) on
      pneumonia and occlusive syndrome, in 3 times: without the AD, with AD, and with AD by knowing
      the drafting conditions (information from intensivist).
