  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with Glargine U300 when compared to
      Glargine U100 will result in similar sugar control in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D),
      who are admitted to the hospital and then transition at home, after discharge from the
      hospital.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several randomized clinical trials done previously in medicine and surgical patients with T2D
      have shown that basal bolus regimen with glargine results in a lower mean daily blood glucose
      (BG) concentrations compared to the sole use of sliding scale regular insulin (SSI) and in
      lower rate of hospital complications. Glargine U300 results in similar improvement but in
      lower rate of hypoglycemia than treatment with glargine U100. No previous studies; however,
      have compared the efficacy and safety of glargine U300 in the management of hyperglycemia and
      diabetes in the hospital setting. This study will determine if treatment with glargine U300
      has a similar glucose control in patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital and if
      glargine U300 will result in lower number of low blood sugars compared to glargine U100 .
