    <textblock>
      Gut dysbiosis is an intestinal disorder that is characterized by accumulation of microbiota
      imbalance, host-microbiota crosstalk dysfunction and inflammation.

      As part of its clinical development, MaaT (Microbiota as a Therapy) Pharma is particularly
      interested in patients with Bone and Joint Infections (BJI). These patients are treated with
      antibiotics having significant consequences on their intestinal flora, causing intestinal
      discomfort, which can be manifested by diarrhea.

      MaaT Pharma wishes to carry out a clinical study, OSIRIS, in collaboration with Prof. Tristan
      Ferry, member and coordinator of CRIOAc (Centre de Référence des Infections
      Ostéo-Articulaires Complexes) Lyon, Center of Reference of Bone and Joint Infections (BJI).
      The objective of this study is to follow patients with treated BJI in order to characterize
      intestinal dysbiosis and the future relevance of an autologous Fecal Microbiota
      Transplantation (aFMT) intervention.

      To do this, patients will be monitored according to the current CRIOAc recommendations, with
      the aim of taking biological samples from patients at the same time as scheduled visits,
      routine monitoring patients. Only one additional consultation will be carried out 15 days
      after stopping the antibiotics in order to better evaluate the dysbiosis evolution.

      Thus biological samples (blood, stool, nasal, rectal) will be taken during the follow-up
      consultations over a period of 6 months.
