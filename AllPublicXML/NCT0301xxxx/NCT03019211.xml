  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized control trial with single blinding of the assessor that will be
      conducted in two nursing homes residence to evaluate the applicability of a physical exercise
      program performed in an aquatic environment compared with the same realization but land-based
      to reduce falls in the institutionalized old people. The secondary objectives are to study
      the applicability of the intervention in improving balance, function, gait mobility, muscle
      strength of the lower limbs and the perception of the intervention.

      The participants will be randomized and divided into the hydrotherapy group or the control
      group. Each participant will attend a total of 24 physical exercise sessions of 50 minutes of
      duration. The study outcomes will be measured before the intervention and in 3 posterior
      phases to evaluate its effects in the short, medium and long terms.
