  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral feeding in the neonatal period requires an accurate coordination between suction,
      swallowing and breathing. In premature new-borns and, depending on their gestational age, the
      coordinated work of those processes becomes jeopardised, being necessary to begin with an
      artificial enteral feeding. This situation results in lengthen their stay at the hospital
      until they are able to respond in a reliable way to their nutritional requirements orally,
      maintaining an adequate daily weight gain and without endangering their cardiorespiratory
      system.

      This project is an experimental, prospective, blinded, randomized study, aimed to determine
      whether the application of a manual oral stimulation protocol in premature infants,
      hospitalized in a neonatal unit, reduces the transition time from enteral feeding to oral
      full feeding, while improves quality of feeding and shortens hospitalization time.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>T1: Time elapsed, in days, from the end of the oral stimulation protocol (OSP) until the baby is able to ingest, through nutritive suction,100% of the total of the corresponding intake for his/her weight.</measure>
    <time_frame>An average of 20 days after the baby is 32 weeks (32+0 to 32+6)</time_frame>
    <description>A neonatology nurse, blinded to the study, routinely records, after each intake and on the habitual nursing evolution sheet, the amounts of milk that prematures take and the way of feeding (enteral, oral), among other factors (height, weight, percentile, incidences...). When the premature reaches 30 weeks of gestational age (30 + 0 to 30 + 6), the physiotherapist perform the ten-day manual oral stimulation protocol. The researchers will look at the nursing evolution sheet, the time (days) elapsed from the end of the protocol (equivalent day in control group) to the day in which babies are able to take 100% of the corresponding intake for their weight. Is estimated that experimental group will reach this goal approximately 3 days before than control group.</description>

    <description>30% suction without complications means that the baby already has the reflexes integrated and is able to coordinate suction, swallowing and breathing.

    <measure>T3: Time elapsed, in days, from the end of the OSP protocol until the baby is able to perform a full oral feeding, defined as the intake, by nutritive suction, of a quantity of milk ≥ 150 ml / kg / day , for three consecutive days.</measure>
