  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate long-term effectiveness of adalimumab in
      pediatric participants starting a treatment for Crohn's disease in real life conditions,
      namely to describe the time to loss of clinical benefit in a time to event approach. Main
      secondary objectives are to describe growth and pubertal development and to describe
      long-term safety. The participants will be followed-up up to 10 years.

    <description>Loss of clinical benefit will be defined as one of the following:
Loss of efficacy leading to adalimumab discontinuation or
Introduction / reinforcement of other immunosuppressants (ratio dose/weight) or
Introduction / reinforcement of corticosteroids (ratio dose/weight; reinforcement of corticosteroids are allowed within the 4 first months after start of adalimumab)
Introduction of enteral nutrition
CD-related surgery, discontinuation of adalimumab due to adverse event, death.</description>

    <description>The Pediatric Activity Index (PCDAI) has become the standard outcome measure in pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) clinical research. The Weighted Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (wPCDAI) was developed to add weight to the items in the PCDAI and make it more feasible. In the wPCDAI, growth velocity, abdominal examination, and hematocrit are removed. The wPCDAI score can range from 0-125, with higher signifying severe disease activity.</description>
