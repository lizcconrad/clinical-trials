  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal understanding of ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients is lacking
      resulting in large variation of achieved exposure and possible inadequate therapy. The
      investigators hypothesize that drug dosing based on CKD-EPIcr-cys provides a useful method to
      individualize and optimize therapy for ciprofloxacin and eventually improve outcome.

      In a multi-centre, observational, open-label study the investigators aim to define : the
      model for estimation of renal function that most accurately predicts ciprofloxacin clearance
      in critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Correct estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is necessary in critically ill
      patients in order to asses renal function. GFR is subsequently used to derive and appropriate
      drug dosing of renally excreted drugs and warrant adequate dose adaptations.

      It is known that estimation of GFR based on creatinine clearance is not precise, especially
      in populations with altered muscle mass or instable renal function, such as the Intensive
      Care Unit (ICU) population.

      The use of combined filtration markers together, cystatin C and creatinine, can improve
      precision in estimating GFR (eGFR). Studies confirmed that eGFR based on both creatinine and
      cystatin C is more precise than eGFR creatinine or eGFR cystatin C. The equation based on
      both creatinine and cystatin C, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
      creatinine-cystatin C (CKD-EPIcr-cys), may therefore improve eGFR and thus drug dosing in ICU
      patients, a population that does not reach PK/PD targets frequently.

      So far little is known about drug dosing based on CKD-EPIcr-cys. Currently optimal
      understanding of ciprofloxacin pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients is lacking,
      resulting in large variation of achieved exposure and possible inadequate therapy. The
      investigators hypothesize that drug dosing based on CKD-EPIcr-cys provides a useful method to
      individualize and optimize therapy for ciprofloxacin and eventually improve outcome.

      In a multi-centre, observational, open-label study the investigators aim to define the model
      for estimation of renal function that most accurately predicts ciprofloxacin clearance in
      critically ill patients.
