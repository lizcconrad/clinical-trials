      The trial is a single arm, single-center, non-randomized phase I clinical trial which is
      designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of C-CAR011 in treatment of adult subjects with
      relapsed/refractory CD19+ B cells acute lymphoblastic leukemia(r/r CD19+B-ALL)

      This is a single-center, Open Label phase I clinical trial, 20 subjects planned to be
      enrolled. The trial have two stages (Phase I dose-escalation clinical trial and phase I dose
      expansion trial).Subjects will be divided into low-dose group, medium-dose group and
      high-dose group.Additional patients will be enrolled to confirm the optimal dose

      Dose CAR+ cells/kg Low 0.5×106 Medium 1.5×106 High 3.0×106
