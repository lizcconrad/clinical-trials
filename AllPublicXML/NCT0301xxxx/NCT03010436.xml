    <textblock>
      Benralizumab is a type of medicine called a monoclonal antibody that is made in the research
      clinic; it works by blocking a specific protein in the body called interleukin-5. The study
      medicine, benralizumab, is not yet approved for doctors to treat patients with EGPA. It is
      considered an experimental drug in this study.

    <textblock>
      This study is open-label which means that all subjects will receive the study medication. The
      medicine-benralizumab-will be given to subjects in addition to the medicines they are already
      taking to treat their EGPA such as oral steroids (e.g. prednisone) and medicines that reduce
      the activity of their immune system. Drugs that are sometimes used (i.e., standard of care)
      to reduce the activity of the immune system in EGPA (in addition to oral steroids) include
      azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide. Information about how
      the stud drug that you get affects the subjects body and their health will be collected
      through a number of tests, procedures and questions.

      The study medicine, benralizumab, will be given to subjects as one injection 30 mg under skin
      every four weeks for 12 weeks and then every 8 weeks for 16 weeks for a total of 5
      treatments. During the treatment phase of this study, a study staff member will call the
      subjects to see how they are doing, what medications they are taking and if they are able to
      decrease their steroid use. The study is a total of 9 study visits in a 44 week time period.
      Everyone who takes part in the study will continue to receive his/her existing treatments for
      EGPA (although their dose of oral steroids may be reduced during the study.
