    <textblock>
      This research study combines 2 different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells.
      Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers, and both have
      shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most patients. This study
      combines both T cells and antibodies to create a more effective treatment. The treatment
      being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted
      against the CD19 antigen (ATLCAR.CD19) administration.

      Prior studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells and will increase their
      ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this
      study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD19. This antibody sticks to leukemia cells
      because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD19. For this study, the
      anti-CD19 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood part of it
      is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called
      a chimeric receptor. These CD19 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to
      kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of
      fighting the cancer are unknown.

      Preliminary results have shown that many subjects receiving this treatment have experienced
      unwanted side effects including cytokine release syndrome. In this study, to help reduce
      cytokine release syndrome symptoms, the ATLCAR.CD19 cells have a safety switch that when
      active, can cause the cells to become dormant. These modified ATLCAR.CD19 cells with the
      safety switch are referred to as iC9-CAR19 cells. If the subject experiences moderate to
      severe cytokine release syndrome as a result of being given iC9-CAR19 cells, the subject can
      be given a dose of a second study drug, AP1903, if standard interventions fail to alleviate
      the symptoms of cytokine release syndrome. AP1903 activates the iC9-CAR19 safety switch,
      reducing the number of the iC9-CAR19 cells in the blood. The ultimate goal is to determine
      what dose of AP1903 can be given that reduces the severity of the cytokine release syndrome
      to mild, but still allows the remaining iC9-CAR19 cells to effectively fight the leukemia.

      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving iC9-CAR19 cells is safe
      and tolerable and and later to determine an optimal dose of AP1903 to be given to subjects to
      alleviate severe cytokine release syndrome.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of autologous iC9-CAR19 T cells administered to
           adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ Acute Lymphoblastic
           Leukemia (ALL).

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To identity a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of iC9-CAR19 T cells in adult and
           pediatric subjects with relapsed or refractory CD19+ ALL.

        -  To measure the survival of iC9-CAR19 T cells in vivo.

        -  To determine the anti-leukemia overall response rate (ORR) mediated by autologous
           iC9-CAR19 T cells administered to adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or
           refractory CD19+ ALL.

        -  To determine overall survival (OS) in adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or
           refractory CD19+ ALL following infusion of iC9-CAR19 T cells.

        -  To determine event-free survival (EFS) in adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed or
           refractory CD19+ ALL following infusion of iC9-CAR19 T cells.

        -  To determine relapse-free survival (RFS) in adult and pediatric subjects with relapsed
           or refractory CD19+ ALL following infusion of iC9-CAR19 T cells.

        -  To measure patient-reported symptom, physical function, and health-related quality of
           life at baseline and over time in adult subjects treated with iC9-CAR19 T cells.

      ENDPOINTS

      Primary Endpoint

      Toxicity will be classified and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5), CAR-T-cell-related encephalopathy
      (CRES) symptoms will be graded according to CRES Grading and CRS symptoms will be graded
      according to CRS Grading.

      (Note: The safety evaluation period for dose limiting toxicity assessment will encompass
      toxicities related to the cell therapy that are experienced starting on the day of iC9-CAR19
      T cell infusion up through 4 weeks post infusion. General safety monitoring will begin at the
      time of procurement).

      Secondary Endpoints

        -  The recommended phase 2 dose of iC9-CAR19 cells will be determined based on 3+3 dose
           finding rules and the tolerability of iC9-CAR19 cells assessed by NCI-CTCAE criteria,
           CRES grading criteria and CRS grading criteria

        -  Persistence of iC9-CAR19 T cells in vivo will be determined by quantitative polymerase
           chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry in samples of peripheral blood.

        -  Overall response rate (Complete Response (CR)/Complete Response with incomplete recovery
           of counts (CRi)) to iC9-CAR19 T cell therapy will be determined using National
           Comprehensive Cancer Network Response Criteria (NCCN) for ALL. Assessment of minimal
           residual disease (MRD) will be included as criterion of response (ie, the percentage of
           subjects who achieve CRm defined as MRD negative CR by either flow cytometry or PCR
           analysis will be determined).

        -  Overall survival will be measured from the date of administration of iC9-CAR19 T cells
           to the date of death.

        -  EFS applies to all subjects and will be measured from the date of administration of
           iC9-CAR19 T cells to the date of signs and symptoms of treatment failure or relapse from
           CR or CRi, or death from any cause; subjects not known to have any of these events are
           censored on the date they were last examined.

        -  RFS will apply only to subjects achieving CR or CRi and measured from the date of
           achievement of a remission until the date of relapse or death from any cause; subjects
           not known to have relapsed or died at last follow-up are censored on the date they were
           last examined.

        -  Patient reported symptoms will be measured using selected symptoms from the NCI
           PRO-CTCAE. Patient-reported physical function will be measured using the PROMIS Physical
           Function Score derived from the PROMIS Physical Function Short Form 20a v1.0.
           Patient-reported health-related quality of life will be measured using the PROMIS Global
           Health Score derived from the PROMIS Global Health Short Form v1.0-1.1.

      OUTLINE

      Cell Procurement

      Peripheral blood, up to 300 mL total (in up to 3 collections) will be obtained from subjects
      for cell procurement. In subjects with low (CD3 count as assayed by flow cytometry less than
      200/μl) T-cell count in the peripheral blood, a leukopheresis may be performed to isolate
      sufficient T cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes.

      iC9-CAR19 Cells Administration

      Post lymphodepletion, subjects who meet eligibility criteria for cellular therapy will
      receive iC9-CAR19 T cells within 2-14 days after completing the pre-conditioning chemotherapy
      regimen. The starting dose of 5 x 10^5 transduced cells/kg (dose level 1) will enroll at
      least 3 adult subjects in the initial cohort. If there are no dose limiting toxicities within
      4 weeks of the cell infusion in these 3 subjects, then the next cohort will evaluate 1 x 10^6
      transduced cells/kg in adults. If there is toxicity in 1/3 subjects in the initial cohort,
      the cohort will be expanded to enroll 3 more subjects. If dose level 1 is determined to be
      above a tolerable dose, de-escalation would occur to dose level -1 where subjects would
      receive 1 x 10^5 transduced cells/kg. The first subject enrolled on each dose level will be
      evaluated for a 4 week safety follow-up period prior to enrolling additional subjects on that
      dose level.

      Duration of Therapy

      Therapy in this study involves 1 infusion of iC9-CAR19 cells.

      Duration of Follow-up

      Subjects will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent retrovirus evaluation
      or until death, whichever occurs first. Subjects removed from study for unacceptable adverse
      events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
