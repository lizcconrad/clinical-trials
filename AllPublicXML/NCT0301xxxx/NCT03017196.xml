      This study is designed to answer the following questions: &quot;Is the My Life, My Healthcare
      Discussion Aid feasible for use in primary care? Does it positively impact patient and
      healthcare teams' care experience and communication, while reducing patient treatment
      burden?&quot;

      Through implementation of the My Life, My Healthcare Discussion Aid for patients with chronic
      conditions, the study team hypothesizes that it will be feasible to implement in routine
      primary care practice and positively impact patient and healthcare teams experience of
      chronic care, while reducing patient treatment burden.
