    <textblock>
      Hypoglycaemia in subjects suffering from type 2 diabetes may have substantial consequences
      including a significant negative impact on quality of life. Further, repeated minor
      hypoglycaemias may result in significant productivity losses.

      Here, the investigators propose to provide quantitative results on cognition during an acute
      mild hypoglycaemic episode (target plasma glucose 3 mmol/L) in 28 subjects with type 2
      diabetes. Data will be provided on executive function, attention and memory.

      Hypoglycaemia in subjects suffering from type 2 diabetes may have substantial consequences
      including a significant negative impact on quality of life. Further, repeated minor
      hypoglycaemias may result in significant productivity losses. In healthy subjects a number of
      studies show that during a hypoglycaemic episode with plasma levels of 2.2 - 2.5 mmol/L
      (40-45 mg/dl) brain areas responsible for cognition have an altered neuronal function when
      measuring cerebral blood flow. This is accompanied by severely impaired cognitive function
      with a reduced ability to solve simple cognitive tasks. At higher levels of glucose (above 3
      mmol/L (54 mg/dl)), it remains to be settled whether cognitive functions are also affected
      negatively and whether this may be accompanied by changes in brain metabolism. Apart from
      raising the blood glucose directly or indirectly via glucagon, no treatment for hypoglycaemia
      exists, but since Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) based therapies used in type 2 diabetes may
      affect brain glucose consumption, therapeutic interventions to prevent negative results of
      hypoglycaemia may eventually become clinically possible.

      Here, the investigators propose to provide quantitative results on cognition during an acute
      mild hypoglycaemic episode (target plasma glucose 3 mmol/L). Data will be provided on
      executive function, attention and memory.

    <description>Multiple neurocognitive tests are performed for a comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. The test battery includes the following: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (verbal memory), Trail Making Test part A and B (psychomotor speed and executive function), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (psychomotor speed and executive function), WAIS-III Letter-Number Sequencing test (executive function), verbal fluency test (letters S and D) (executive function) and Rapid Visual Processing test from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (sustained attention). Verbal IQ is estimated with the Danish Adult Reading Test (DART).
The individual cognition measures will be z-transformed and aggregated into one overall cognitive composite score in line with previously described procedures (Miskowiak et al, J Clin Psychiatry, 2014). For exploratory purposes the cognition measures will also be reported individually to determine cognitive domains most susceptible to hypoglycemia.</description>
