  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if rifampin, an antibiotic (a medicine
      that treats infections), is effective in treating osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) of
      the foot in diabetic patients. Despite use of powerful antibiotics prescribed over a long
      period of time, many diabetic patients remain at a high risk for needing an amputation of
      part of the foot or lower leg because the osteomyelitis is not cured. Some small research
      studies have shown that addition of rifampin to other antibiotics is effective in treating
      osteomyelitis in both diabetics and non-diabetics. However, because few diabetics with
      osteomyelitis have been studied, there is no definite proof that it is better than the usual
      treatments for diabetic patients. If this study finds that adding rifampin to the usual
      antibiotics prescribed for osteomyelitis reduces the risk for amputations, doctors will be
      able to more effectively treat many Veteran patients with this serious infection. Improving
      treatment outcomes is an important healthcare goal of the VA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, investigation of a six
      week course of adjunctive rifampin vs. adjunctive matched placebo (riboflavin) added to
      backbone antibacterial therapy for the treatment of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. Backbone
      antibacterial therapy will be with single or multiple agents selected by the clinical
      treatment team based either on culture results or standard empiric therapy, and which can be
      administered either intravenously or orally. Rifampin will be dosed at 600 mg daily. The
      primary outcome measure is amputation-free survival. Amputation events include both below-
      and above-ankle amputations. Primary outcomes will be determined by systematic medical record
      review and through confirmatory research visits, phone calls and, as needed, information from
      non-VA providers. The results for amputation-free survival will be analyzed by means of a
      two-sided log-rank test. The secondary outcomes of complete wound epithelialization and
      remission of osteomyelitis will be determined by direct examination by the site
      investigators.

      The study will initially enroll and randomize a total of 880 study participants to receive
      either rifampin or placebo (riboflavin) in addition to backbone antibiotic therapy prescribed
      by their clinician. Investigators expect to enroll, on average, close to one subject per
      month per site (10-12 per year/site) at 28 VA medical centers to achieve total randomization
      of 880 subjects over three years. In meeting this average site enrollment projection,
      Investigators anticipate variation in enrollment between larger and smaller sites, and
      between high-performing and low-performing sites. Subjects will be followed through the end
      of the second year after randomization or until a study primary endpoint event (amputation or
      death) occurs. On average, study participants will be followed for 1.8 years through
      systematic review of medical records, and by study visits and phone calls.

    <time_frame>Assessed 2 years post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is amputation-free survival, ending with amputation or death from any cause. Amputation is defined as surgical treatment of osteomyelitis by removal or debridement of necrotic bone (all or part of a bone) from a lower extremity limb or digit on the ipsilateral side of the protocol-treated osteomyelitis. Debridement prior to randomization may include removal of bone. Because this debridement occurs early, prior to exposure to study drug or placebo, removal of bone at that time is not a study endpoint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Amputation</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 2 years post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Time from randomization to the occurrence of the components of the primary outcome:
the first occurrence of ipsilateral amputation alone
the first occurrence of ipsilateral above-ankle amputation
the first occurrence of ipsilateral through the ankle (e.g. Symes amputation) or below-ankle amputation proximal to the metatarsal-phalangeal joint
the first occurrence of ipsilateral below-ankle amputation at or distal to the metatarsal-phalangeal joint
all cause death
Endpoint will be determined by chart review by the Study Coordinator, with confirmation by the Site Investigator, and as needed, by the Study Chair.</description>

    <description>New courses of antibacterial therapy for ipsilateral foot infection during the first year after randomization (yes/no per patient).
Endpoint will be determined by chart review by the Study Coordinator, with consultation with the Site Investigator as needed to confirm that the new course of treatment is directed toward continued or recurrent osteomyelitis of the initially affected lower extremity. The new course will require there be at least a 14 day interval between the end of the initial back-bone antibiotic therapy course.</description>
