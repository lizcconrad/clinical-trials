  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational
      product, SBI-101, in subjects with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). SBI-101 is a biologic/device
      combination product designed to regulate inflammation and promote repair of injured tissue
      using allogeneic human mesenchymal stromal cells. Patients will be randomized to receive one
      of three treatments, low dose SBI-101, high dose SBI-101, or sham control. SBI-101 will be
      integrated into the renal replacement circuit and patients will be treated for up to 24
      hours.

    <description>SBI-101 is a biologic/device combination product that combines two components: allogeneic human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and an FDA-approved plasmapheresis device. SBI-101 is administered via integration into a Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy circuit and is designed to regulate inflammation and promote repair of injured tissue.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AKI, as determined by the Investigator based on his/her clinical judgment

          -  Able to tolerate indwelling intravascular access

          -  Has tolerated Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy for at least 12 hours prior to IP
             treatment

          -  Likely to require Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy for at least an additional 48
             hours

          -  Ability to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or lactating

          -  Known end-stage liver disease

          -  Hepatorenal syndrome

          -  Acute glomerulonephritis (e.g. rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis;
             membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis);
             acute interstitial nephritis (e.g. toxin- or drug- induced interstitial nephritis) or
             hereditary renal disease (e.g. Alport's Syndrome; polycystic kidney disease)

          -  AKI due to post-renal outflow obstruction

          -  Acute or chronic vasculitis of any etiology

          -  At the time of randomization, clinical evidence (e.g. febrile) suggestive of an
             uncontrolled or inadequately treated systemic infection

          -  History of a chronic systemic infection of any etiology regardless of therapy

          -  Active malignancy(-ies) and/or receiving active treatment for a malignancy(-ies), with
             the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the Investigator, are likely to require escalating
             doses of vasopressors to attain and/or maintain hemodynamic stability

          -  History of renal replacement therapy in the preceding 2 months that is not directly
             related to the current AKI diagnosis

          -  Systemic immunosuppressive therapy including chronic corticosteroid therapy within the
             past 30 days

          -  Organ failure affecting more than 2 non-renal organs

          -  Platelet count &lt;25,000/uL or other serious hematological abnormalities that would
             place subject in imminent danger of death

          -  Any prior medical condition that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would prevent
             the subject from safely participating in and/or completing all study requirements
