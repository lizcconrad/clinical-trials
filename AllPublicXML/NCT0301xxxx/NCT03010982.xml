      of approximately 12 µg tazemetostat that contains approximately 500 nCi of [14C] tazemetostat
      and the ADME of an oral dose of 800 mg tazemetostat that contains approximately 400 µCi of
      [14C]-labeled tazemetostat in three subjects with B-cell lymphomas or advanced solid tumors.

             conditions that may interfere with normal urinary bladder emptying. In the past 3
             months, no obstructive uropathy, surgery affecting urinary system (e.g., radical
