  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the reasons head and neck cancer
      patients may or may not follow the swallowing exercises that they are asked to perform after
      receiving radiation treatments. Researchers also want to learn if certain levels of cytokines
      affect if participant has side effects and if it puts participant at risk for future disease.
      Cytokines are proteins that are related to the immune system.

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will complete the below study
      tests at participant's first study visit and about 6 months after participant's radiation
      treatment.

      Questionnaire:

      Participant will complete a questionnaire (either in the clinic or at home) about how well
      participant is following the swallowing exercises and how participant has been coping with
      stress. The questionnaire will also collect information about the disease and personal
      information about participant, such as participant's age, sex, race, education level, and
      marital status. This questionnaire should take about 30 minutes to complete. On the Day 1
      visit, participant will not complete the part of the questionnaire that asks about
      participant's swallowing exercises.

      If participant prefers to complete the questionnaire online, a separate email will be sent to
      participant's email address. The email will contain a link to a secure online questionnaire
      protected by MD Anderson.

      Cytokine Blood Tests:

      Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn to measure the level of cytokines in
      participant's blood 2 times. These blood samples will be drawn at the same time as other
      routine blood draws so participant will not have extra needle sticks.

      Researchers want to learn 1) if cytokine levels are related to changes in the types of side
      effects participant may have, such as fatigue and nausea, 2) which patients are at risk for
      developing permanent swallowing dysfunction after radiation treatment, and 3) which patients
      are at risk for developing recurrence after treatment.

      Researchers will also study participant's genetic code to try to predict cytokine levels or
      what side effects participant may have. This means researchers may need to store parts of
      participant's blood for a long time, maybe with no time limit, to complete the genetic
      testing. However, these samples will only be used for research testing as described in this
      consent form.

      Length of Study:

      Participant's active participation in this study will be over after participant completes the
      6 month questionnaire and blood draw.

      Information from participant's medical record (such as information about participant's
      disease history, if the disease has gotten worse, any treatment participant receives, and any
      side effects participant has) will continue to be collected for up to 2 years after
      participant completes radiation therapy.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 230 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
