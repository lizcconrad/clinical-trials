  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procedures for systematic user involvement in primary mental health services are lacking, and
      several adolescents are dissatisfied with their opportunities to influence the service
      provided. The research on the effects of user involvement is scarce, especially regarding
      user involvement for children and adolescents. Hence, we suggest introducing an idiographic
      assessment tool in a selection of Norwegian primary mental health services. Idiographic
      assessment is a way of measuring psychological constructs, by using tools specifically
      adapted for each individual respondent.

      This protocol describes the implementation and evaluation of a user involvement tool called
      'Assert', in Norwegian primary mental health services. Assert is a simple tool where the
      adolescents themselves decide the goals or themes that they would like to address in
      collaboration with their service provider. Assert is scored each time the adolescent and the
      service provider meet, to monitor progress toward the goal. A randomised controlled trial
      design is proposed for this study. Assert will be implemented in 5-10 Norwegian
      municipalities, and will include 250 participants between 12 and 23 years. The objective of
      the study is to examine the relationship between Assert and perceived user involvement. Are
      idiographic measures an adequate way to operationalise user involvement on an individual
      level? And if so, can user involvement (i.e. Assert) have an effect on quality of life and
      mental health in adolescents? And lastly qualitative analyses of the adolescents' themes and
      goals will be conducted to explore what matters to the adolescents that visit primary mental
      health services in Norwegian municipalities.
