  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linus Pauling and Dr Ewan Cameron have published two retrospective studies about using high
      dose vitamin C to treat cancer patients forty years ago. Their studies have shown that high
      dose vitamin C usage could significantly prolong overall survival of patients with advanced
      cancer. Recently, preclinical study has shown that human colorectal cancer cells harboring
      KRAS or BRAF mutations are selectively killed by high levels of ascorbic acid (AA). High dose
      of AA impairs tumor growth in Apc/KRASG12D mutant mice. Previous phaseⅠclinical trials have
      found that high dose (1.5g/kg or 90g/m2) iv AA is well tolerated in cancer patients. This
      protocol is a phase Ⅲ, study of ascorbic acid (AA) infusions combined with treatment with
      mFOLOX6 versus mFOLOX6 alone as first-line therapy in patients with recurrent or advanced
      gastric cancer.
