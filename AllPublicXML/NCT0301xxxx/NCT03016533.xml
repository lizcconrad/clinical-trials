  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG) is a potent inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
      integrase that has been developed for the treatment of HIV. This is a phase 3b (PH3b),
      non-randomized, open-label, multi-center, treatment rollover study. The primary objective of
      this pediatric interventional study is to provide continued access to DTG for eligible
      participants who previously participated in the international maternal pediatric adolescent
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] clinical trials (IMPAACT) P1093 study (parent
      study) and who cannot locally access DTG in the public sector. The P1093 study was designed
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of DTG in
      HIV-1 experienced adolescents and children as well as treatment-naive infants and toddlers.
      Participants who have no evidence of virological failure (VF) and who have tolerated DTG in
      the parent study without any significant toxicity leading to the permanent discontinuation of
      this drug and withdrawal from the parent study will be considered for this open-label
      continued access study. Participants will be receiving their age/weight appropriate dose of
      DTG as defined in the parent study. The objective of this study will be supported through
      evaluation of serious adverse events. The duration of participant accrual into the study will
      extend until DTG receives local (by country) regulatory approval . Therefore, participants
      enrolled into this study will be those who will benefit from treatment and will continue to
      receive DTG until local (by country) regulatory approval and commercial or other availability
      occurs from another source (e.g. government programs, aid programs, assistance programs,
      etc.). Participants will be enrolled after all screening procedures have been completed. In
      most cases, the Screening visit will overlap with the participant's penultimate visit on the
      parent study (at Week 180 of P1093). Participants who meet all entry criteria may enroll and
      will be seen in the clinic every 12 weeks for a safety evaluation and to receive DTG. It is
      estimated that no more than 120 participants will be enrolled in this study.

    <description>All participants will receive dolutegravir film-coated tablets or film-coated dispersible tablets at appropriate doses selected as per their age and weight bands. For those participants who were previously receiving dolutegravir in study P1093 (parent study), dolutegravir will be supplied as film-coated tablets containing 10 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg of dolutegravir and 5 mg film-coated dispersible tablets of dolutegravir. Participants will receive dolutegravir until age-appropriate formulations are available to them from some other source, or until participant is no longer deriving benefit from treatment, or participant are discontinued, or until development of dolutegravir is terminated. The dose adjustment will be made if a participant's weight change requires a dose adjustment. Aging participants (those who crosses age-boundaries) who are taking the dispersible tablet formulation will be allowed to switch to the tablet formulation once daily if they are able to swallow the tablet.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Between &gt;=4 weeks and &lt;18 years of age inclusive, at the Day 1 visit for the P1093
             study.

          -  Subjects must have previously participated in the P1093 study (parent study) through
             at least Week 180 with no evidence of VF.

          -  Subjects must have virological control defined as HIV-1 ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt;400
             copies per milliliter (c/mL) during the parent study at their penultimate P1093 visit
             (on or after the Week 180 visit). If the penultimate P1093 visit on or after the Week
             180 visit indicates the possibility of VF, a retest can be used to confirm
             eligibility. Adherence issues should be addressed and viral suppression must be
             confirmed prior to Day 1.

          -  Demonstrated ability or willingness to swallow assigned dolutegravir (DTG) tablets
             (for subjects requiring tablets). DTG 10, 25, and 50 milligram (mg) tablets may not be
             crushed or dissolved. The 5 mg dispersible tablets may not be cut and must be used in
             five milligram intervals.

          -  Female subjects who are of child bearing potential and male subjects engaging in
             sexual activity should be counseled on safer sexual practices including the use and
             benefit/risk of effective barrier methods (e.g. male condom) and on the risk of HIV
             transmission to an uninfected partner. Male subjects engaging in sexual activity that
             could lead to HIV-1 transmission must use a condom. Female subjects who are of child
             bearing potential and who are engaging in sexual activity that could lead to
             pregnancy, must use 2 adequate birth control methods while on study and for 2 weeks
             after stopping study drug. Condoms are recommended in addition, because their
             appropriate use is the only contraception method effective for preventing HIV-1
             transmission.

          -  Parent, legal guardian or subject &gt;=18 years of age is able and willing to provide
             signed informed consent which includes compliance with the requirements and
             restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of any active AIDS defining opportunistic infection.

          -  Known &gt;=grade 3 laboratory toxicities prior to study entry (e.g. neutrophil count,
             hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], aspartate aminotransferase
             [ALT], lipase, serum creatinine and total bilirubin). Repeat testing will be allowed
             for eligibility determination. &gt;=grade 3 total bilirubin is allowable, if the subject
             is on atazanavir (ATV). Subjects with laboratory abnormalities considered unrelated to
             DTG may be allowed to enter the study. Thus, if the laboratory abnormality persists
             upon repeat testing, the subject may be considered for study entry after consultation
             and approval of the study team.

          -  Subjects who were permanently discontinued from DTG in the parent study due to
             intolerance or pregnancy must not be included in this current program.

          -  The following liver toxicities within 30 days prior to study entry: ALT &gt;3 times upper
             limit of normal (ULN) and direct bilirubin is &gt;2 times ULN.

          -  Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed during the study.

          -  Subject is currently participating in or has participated in a study with a compound
             or device that is not commercially available within 30 days of signing informed
             consent, unless permission from the sponsor's medical monitor is granted.

          -  Presence of any history of allergy/sensitivity to any of the study drugs.

          -  Use of any disallowed medications at time of screening.

          -  Subject is unlikely to adhere to the study procedures, keep appointments, or is
             planning to relocate during the study.

          -  Clinical or symptomatic evidence of pancreatitis, as determined by the clinician.

          -  Any condition (including but not limited to alcohol and drug use) that would, in the
             opinion of the site investigator, place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury
             or render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.
