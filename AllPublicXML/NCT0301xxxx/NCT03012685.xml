  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most people will experience a psychologically traumatic event, such as a life-threatening
      accident, at some point in their life. In the initial days after such an event, it is common
      to be haunted by intrusive memories: image-based memories of the event that spring to mind
      unbidden. Intrusive memories can be distressing in their own right, but are also a hallmark
      symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

      Sleep is important for many functions involved in how people perceive, respond to and
      remember events, including stressful/traumatic events. Studies with patients who have
      experienced traumatic events indicate that sleep disturbances in the first weeks post-trauma
      are associated with later PTSD symptoms. However, in a previous study with healthy volunteers
      exposed to experimental trauma (film footage), those who were sleep-deprived in the first
      night, compared to those who slept, had fewer intrusive memories in the following week. This
      raises the question of how sleep in the first night, but also the first week, after real-life
      trauma is related to subsequent intrusive memories and PTSD symptoms.

      The current study is an observational study of patients recruited from a hospital emergency
      department after a traumatic event. After completing brief baseline questionnaires in the
      emergency department, participants will be asked to fill in a daily diary of their sleep and
      intrusive memories over the following week. Post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety and
      depression will be assessed by post/online at one week and two months. Participants will be
      telephoned after two months to complete an interview to assess PTSD symptoms and an optional
      feedback interview.

      This clinical study will be the first to assess the relationship between sleep in the first
      night and week, and intrusive memories and mental wellbeing after real-life trauma. Findings
      may have implications for developing simple sleep-based preventive treatments after trauma in
      the future.
