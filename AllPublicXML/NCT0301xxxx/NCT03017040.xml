  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that there is no relationship between in vivo kinematic
      abnormalities and patient-rated outcomes for scapholunate interosseous ligament injuries
      (SLIL)

      The secondary null hypotheses are that: There are no kinematic differences between subjects
      with unilateral, symptomatic, full thickness scapholunate ligament tears in comparison to the
      contralateral wrist without scapholunate ligament injury.

      The investigators aim to answer to the below questions:

        -  What are baseline validated outcomes for subjects with SLIL injury?

        -  What are baseline physical measures (range of motion, Jamar Dynamometry)?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vivo kinematics of the normal wrist has been studied previously, but few studies have
      characterized the wrist with a SLIL injury. There are few studies evaluating validated
      patient-rated outcomes for patients with SLIL injury. The goal of this study would be to
      evaluate to what degree kinematic abnormalities affect patient-rated outcomes.
