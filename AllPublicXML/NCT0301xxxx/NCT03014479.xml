      The purpose of this study is to assess the reduction in treatment burden during 12 weeks of
      trelagliptin administration in patients with type 2 diabetes on diet and exercise therapy
      only. Eligible subjects will be randomized to either the study drug (trelagliptin) group or
      the comparative drug (daily DPP-4 inhibitor) group. Treatment burden will be assessed using
      DTR-QOL questionnaire and DTSQ.

    <measure>Change from baseline (Week 0) in total score for all question items in the Diabetes Therapy Related -QOL (DTR-QOL) Questionnaire at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>DTR-QOL Questionnaire is a self-reported instrument assessing impact of diabetes treatment on health-related QOL. It includes 29 items across four subscales; Factor 1: Burden on social activities and daily activities (13 questions), Factor 2: Anxiety and dissatisfaction with treatment (8 questions), Factor 3: Hypoglycemia (4 questions) and Factor 4: Treatment satisfaction (4 questions). Each item is scored ranging from 1 to 7. Every score of the questions in Factor 1-3 and the score in Factor 4 converted into reverse (1-7 will be converted to 7-1) will be simply added up, and scores of each factor and the total figure will be subsequently converted from 0 to 100 ( the best and worst scores will be equivalent to 100 and 0). Higher scores reflect better QOL and positive changes relative to baseline indicate improvement of QOL.</description>

    <description>The DTSQ is a self-reported instrument consists of 6 questions about treatment satisfaction and 2 questions regarding blood sugar level. Each question answered on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 to 6, based on concern with the diabetes treatment and experiences in the past few weeks. Higher total score for questions about treatment satisfaction indicate greater satisfaction with treatment and experiences.</description>
