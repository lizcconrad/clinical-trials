  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multilevel decompression and bone graft fusion is a most effective measure for treating
      degenerative lumbar spinal diseases. Yet, the surgery is commonly associated with large
      amount of perioperative blood loss and high demand for homologous blood transfusion.
      Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been proved as efficient in reducing the gross blood loss in
      various kinds of surgeries. However, high quality evidence of its efficacy and safety is
      still lacking in lumbar spinal surgeries. Besides, systemic use of TXA carries the risks of
      thromboembolic complications such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, thus the
      optimal drug delivery route of TXA remains undetermined. The aim of this study is to test the
      non-inferiority of topical TXA application to its intravenous use in multilevel decompression
      and bone graft fusion surgeries. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, head-to-head
      comparison study design will be adopted.
