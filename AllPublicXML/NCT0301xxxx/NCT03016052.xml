    <textblock>
      this study examines the emergence of the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN) ERP component in
      response to deviations from the embedded contingency in attention bias modification treatment
      (ABMT) for social and generalized anxiety, and the interaction between vMMN emergence and
      clinical improvement.

      ***As of September 2017, recruitment of SAD participants has concluded.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      all participants, suffering from either social anxiety disorder or generalized anxiety
      disorder, will receive 6 sessions of ABMT, adapted for an oddball paradigm. two of the
      sessions will also include simultaneous EEG measurement. the goal of the study is to
      determine the emergence of vMMN in response to trials deviating the embedded contingency and
      to examine the correlation between vMMN emergence and clinical improvement of anxiety
      symptoms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline - the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale - Diagnostic Interview scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after treatment completion and 2 months after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>The LSAS is a 24-item scale, each item corresponding to a situation selected on the basis of clinical experience. Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 to 3 with regard to the passing week, measuring separately two components of social anxiety, specifically, fear/anxiety and avoidance of social interaction and performance situations. Although the assessor may request and ask for further detail and adjust the rating based on clinical experience, this option is not often exercised, and inter-rater agreement is not considered to be a relevant concern.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline - The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after treatment completion and 2 months after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Severity Scale (GADSS) is a 6-item interview assessment that evaluates the severity of each of the DSM-IV symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. It begins with a target worry list to identify situations that are the focus of worry, and continues with six 5-point-scale items to evaluate levels of generalized anxiety severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline - the Social Phobia Inventory scores</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after treatment completion and 2 months after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 17-item self-report measure of social anxiety evaluating fear, avoidance and physiological discomfort. Each item is rated on scale ranging from 0 to 4 with a possible total score of 68.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline - the Penn State Worry Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after treatment completion and 2 months after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 16-item self-report measure of the worry dimension of generalized anxiety disorder. the questionnaire is composed of statements, and subjects are request to rate how typical each item is of them, ona 5-point scale ranging from &quot;not typical at all&quot; to &quot;very typical&quot;. the PSWQ includes 5 reverse questions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline - the GAD-7</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week after treatment completion and 2 months after treatment completion</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 7-item self-report measure of generalized anxiety. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale with a possible score of 0-21. Increasing scores indicating increased functional impairment.</description>

    <description>structured diagnostic interview for DSM - IV and ICD-10 psychiatric disorders, which takes approximately 20 min to administer and is a valid and time-efficient alternative to the SCID-P and CIDI.</description>
