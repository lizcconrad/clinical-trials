  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is increasing day by day but the treatment
      options are limited in children and adolescents. Albiglutide, approved for the treatment of
      T2DM in adult population, is a novel analogue of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) with a
      sufficiently long half-life to permit once a week injection. The study will be conducted in 2
      parts: Part A is a single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study to confirm the dose and safety of
      albiglutide in pediatric subjects aged 10 to less than 18 years and Part B is a randomized
      double-blind placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy (glycemic control)
      of albiglutide in the pediatric population. Treatment duration in Part B is 52 weeks (24
      weeks double-blind placebo-controlled and 28 weeks open-label during which all subjects will
      receive albiglutide). Approximately 210 eligible male and female subjects will be included in
      the study.
