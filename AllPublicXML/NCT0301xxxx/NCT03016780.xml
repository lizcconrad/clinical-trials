    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis is a common digestive system disease, the incidence is increasing in
      recent years.It is reported that the occurrence and development of ulcerative colitis is
      closely related to imbalance of intestinal flora .Moreover,intestinal mucosal immunity may be
      related to intestinal flora. Fecal microbiota transplantation as a new technology to rebuild
      intestinal flora has been used for several diseaseï¼Œbut the efficacy of ulcerative colitis by
      fecal microbiota transplantation needs to be further explored.

      Patients who meet the inclusion crit ulcerative colitisby will be separated into two parts
      depending on accepation or refuse of Fecal microbiota transplantation.Blood specimen from
      patients will be collected to analysis intestinal mucosal immunity.

    <description>According to the inclusion criteria, the patients were randomly divided into experimental group and control group. Before and after the fecal microbiota transplantation, patients were asked about the history of abdominal pain, abdominal distension, diarrhea and so on,at the same time, monitoring heart rate, respiration, pulse, blood pressure is necessary and determinating liver function, renal function, electrolytes, blood coagulation, blood lipids, endotoxins and other biochemical tests to evaluate clinical efficacy.</description>

    <description>Inflammatory factors such as interleukin-10 in the blood of patients with ulcerative colitis and indicators of disease activity such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein are often elevated, we want to study the change above indicators before and after treatment, reflecting the improvement of Inflammation of ulcerative colitis and study the effect of its activity.</description>
