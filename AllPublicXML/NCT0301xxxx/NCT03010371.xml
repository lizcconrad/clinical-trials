  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study aims to prove the efficacy of a pilot psychosocial evidence-based
      treatment (Positive Psychotherapy) in two formats (online vs face-to-face) with an online
      support control group. It develops as a randomized-controlled trial in a group of primary
      breast cancer survivors assigned to one of the three experimental treatments. The principal
      dependent variables assessed will be emotional distress, post-traumatic growth and QoL. Some
      treatment predictors of psychosocial response will be explored. Lastly, an economic analysis,
      comparing the three psychosocial treatments and focused on the &quot;quality adjusted life years&quot;
      (QALY) will be made. It is expected to find higher efficacy in psychosocial indicators and
      QALY for Positive Psychotherapy in the two experimental intervention formats than in the
      online support group. It is hypothesized that the face-to-face format will be more effective
      for severely distressed patients with previous history of trauma, while the online format
      will be more effective for younger patients with mild emotional distress.

      Psychosocial treatments in cancer survivors have demonstrated its efficacy in diminishing
      emotional distress and improving Quality of Life (QoL). Providing access to a psychosocial
      intervention at the end of a curative cancer treatment become worthwhile, not only because it
      reduces the use of other medical resources and promotes return-to-work, but also because it
      facilitates oncology treatment adherence and the adoption of healthy life styles. Online
      psychosocial treatments are a good option because of its easy access, anonymity and low cost.
      The study will consist of a multicenter, controlled and randomized clinical trial with the
      objective of evaluating the viability and the efficacy of a new online psychosocial
      treatment, called positive psychotherapy, which has been adapted from a face-to-face version.
      Those breast cancer survivors who show moderate or severe adaptation problems after the
      completion of the oncological treatment will be randomly assigned to one of the three
      treatment groups: 1) Positive Psychotherapy (PP), 2) Positive Online Psychotherapy (POP) and
      3) Online Support Group (OSG). All participants will be evaluated using a battery of measures
      at the beginning of the study: at recruitment (T0), post-treatment (T1), three months from T1
      (T2) and twelve months from T2 (T3). Therefore,this study will use a factorial design of 3
      (treatment conditions) x 4 (evaluation points).The main measured outcomes include: quality of
      life, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress and post-traumatic growth. Secondary outcome
      measures will be: healthy lifestyles, adherence to the oncological treatment, perceived
      social support, and the number of return-to-work days run after the cancer treatment
      completion.

      Data from the three conditions will be analyzed using SPSS 2.1 version. It is expected to
      find higher efficacy in psychosocial indicators and QALY for Positive Psychotherapy in the
      two experimental intervention formats than in the online support group. It is hypothesized
      that the face-to-face format will be more effective for severely distressed patients with
      previous history of trauma, while the online format will be more effective for younger
      patients with mild emotional distress.

    <description>Positive Psychotherapy (PP) is designed to treat cancer survivors with moderate/severe adaptation difficulties after completing cancer treatments (Ochoa et al., 2010). The objectives are the facilitation and promotion of post-traumatic growth and quality of life, and the reduction of emotional distress (anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms). Secondary consequences of this psychological improvement is a better transition to daily life and the restoration of a good psychosocial functioning (labor reincorporation, adherence to treatments and follow-up, and the adoption of healthy lifestyles). The program consists of twelve sessions of 90 minutes per week in a closed group (5 to 7 participants). Each session focuses on the different topics and tasks defined in the Positive Psychotherapy for cancer survivors (Ochoa et al., 2010).</description>

    <description>The Positive Online Psychotherapy (POP) is based on the PP program, but being adapted to an online version. Patients in this experimental condition will have access to a secure virtual platform (supervised and dependent from the Catalan Health Department). The POP consists of twelve weekly sessions of 90 minutes, in a closed-group format (5-7 participants). Patients have a simultaneous group-connection to the online platform, together with a clinical psychologist who lead the tasks according to the focuses of each session.</description>

    <description>The Online Support Group (OSG) consists of a virtual patient community. Individuals assigned to this condition have web access to a private online forum in which they interact asynchronously (supervised and dependent by the Catalan Health Department). The forums have eight pre-defined topics that coincide with those of the previous experimental conditions. The forum is moderated and energized by the webmaster with the aim of increasing participation, solving basic technical problems and ensuring minimum rules of operation and respect. Participants can interact at any time of the day and their participations are registered and analyzed at the end of the group.</description>
