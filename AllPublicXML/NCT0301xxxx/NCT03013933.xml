    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of brentuximab vedotin and
      cyclosporine when given together with verapamil in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma
      that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      brentuximab vedotin, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.
      Immunosuppressive therapies, such as cyclosporine, may improve bone marrow function and
      increase blood cell counts. Verapamil may increase the effectiveness of brentuximab vedotin
      by overcoming drug resistance of the cancer cells. Giving brentuximab vedotin, cyclosporine,
      and verapamil may work better in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of brentuximab vedotin (BV) plus
      MDR1 inhibitors cyclosporine (CsA)/verapamil (VRP).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain estimates of overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, and response
      duration in patients treated with the combination of BV plus CsA/VRP.

      II. Estimate overall and progression-free survival in patients treated with the combination
      of BV plus CsA/VRP.

      III. Characterize pharmacokinetics of plasma MMAE in cycle 1 (for expansion cohort only).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin and cyclosporine.

      Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5, verapamil PO four
      times daily (QID) on days 1-5, and brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
