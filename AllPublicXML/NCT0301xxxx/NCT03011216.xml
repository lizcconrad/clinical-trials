  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study examines whether a computerized cognitive control training as compared to a
      placebo (fake) training will reduce the frequency of depressive rumination in depressed
      individuals. Rumination has been identified as a major risk factor for the onset and
      recurrence of depressive episodes and it has been suggested that it is linked to deficits in
      cognitive control functions. It is thus expected that training cognitive control will reduce
      the frequency of rumination as well as ameliorate its detrimental effect on negative mood
      states.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rumination has been shown to intensify dysphoric mood and is one of the best researched risk
      factors for the onset and recurrence of depressive episodes. Accumulating evidence suggests
      that the tendency to ruminate is linked to impairments in cognitive control functions,
      especially to problems discarding no longer relevant negative material from working memory
      (=working memory updating).

      The aim of the present study is to examine whether training to update emotional material in
      working memory will have an effect on the frequency of using rumination as well as on the
      impact of rumination on mood in the daily lives of clinically depressed participants.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 10 sessions of either online cognitive control
      training or an online placebo condition. The ability to update emotional material in working
      memory will be assessed pre and post training by two computer tasks (close and far transfer
      tasks). The effects of the training on daily rumination and the dynamics between daily mood
      and rumination will be assessed pre- and post-training, as well as at 3-months follow-up
      using ambulatory assessment (via smartphone app). It is expected that individuals in the
      training as compared to the placebo group will show a greater reduction in rumination
      frequency as well as a reduction in the negative impact of rumination on mood.

    <description>Rumination frequency is measured by 2 items in the ambulatory assessment. The ambulatory assessment is employed for 7 days pre-training, 7 days post-training (within a week after the end of the training phase), and 7 days at 3-months follow-up with 8 prompts per day during each assessment period</description>

    <description>The impact of rumination on mood is assessed as the effect of rumination at time t on depressed and positive mood at time t+1 in a multi level model; Time t refers to consecutive assessment points in the ambulatory assessment. The ambulatory assessment is employed for 7 days pre-training, 7 days post-training (within a week after the end of the training phase), and 7 days at 3-months follow-up with 8 prompts per day during each assessment period. Rumination frequency is assessed by two items; depressed and positive mood are each assessed by the average score of two items.</description>

    <description>Manipulation Check: Measured by two computer tasks (non-adaptive n-back task; modified Sternberg task) in the lab sessions pre- and post-training (=within a week after the end of the training phase). Dependent variables are the differences in accuracy rates and reaction times between the experimental and the control condition in these tasks.</description>

    <description>Adaptive emotional n-back task: On each trial of this task, participants are presented with an emotional facial expression. Participants have to indicate whether the emotion presented in the current trial is the same as n trials back. In order to train participants at their individual ability level, the n-level varies by trial block based on participants' performance on the previous block.
The adaptive emotional n-back task is assumed to train the ability to continuously update emotional material in working memory.</description>

    <description>Adaptive non-emotional feature match task: On each trial of this task, participants are presented with two panels containing 8-12 shapes each. Participants are asked to compare the two panels and decide whether or not they are identical. The panels contain a minimum of 8 shapes and a maximum of 12 shapes, depending on participants' performance on the previous block.
The adaptive non-emotional feature match task is assumed to train the speed of responding (involving processes like visual search and concentration). It does not trait working memory updating.</description>
