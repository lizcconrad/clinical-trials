  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing Open Cardiac Surgery will be randomized into two groups. Group I will be
      ventilated with 40% Fio2 during induction, surgery and in Postoperative care unit. Group II
      will be ventilated with 100% Fio2 during induction and with 60-70% ( determined according to
      the arterial blood gas sample results) during surgery and in Postoperative care unit.

      Hemodynamic parameters ( systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate
      ), Arterial blood gas samples ( PaO2, PaCO2, pH, Oxygen saturation, Lactate), and pre and
      post cardiopulmonary bypass Superoxide dismutase and malonyl aldehyde levels.
