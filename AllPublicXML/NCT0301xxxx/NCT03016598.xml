  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of intranasal administration of oxytocin, a social
      neuropeptide, on reducing cocaine use, enhancing therapeutic engagement, and susceptibility
      to stress-induced relapse in Veterans with cocaine use disorder and enrolled in opioid
      replacement therapy (ORT) program for co-occurring opioid use disorder (OUD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High rates of substance use disorders (SUDs) in Veterans compared to the general population
      are heavily influenced by psychosocial factors - such as difficulty reintegrating into
      civilian life due to avoidance of vital support systems - leading to disproportionately
      elevated unmet addiction treatment needs. Although the gold standard for treatment for most
      SUDs involves pharmacological interventions, there are currently no effective pharmacological
      interventions approved by the Federal Drug Administration for stimulant users, who have the
      most difficulty adhering to treatment programs and the most susceptibility to stress-induced
      relapse of any SUD. Administering oxytocin, a mammalian neuropeptide, intranasally to healthy
      controls facilitates the stress-buffering properties of social support. Oxytocin may also
      have an independent role in mitigating the symptoms of SUDs. For example, in animal models of
      addiction, oxytocin administration directly reduces tolerance, withdrawal effects,
      self-administration, and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking for a range of
      addictive substances. A more integrated understanding of oxytocin's distinct effects on the
      behavior and psychology of 1) addiction, 2) sociality, and 3) stress reactivity could be the
      key to defining oxytocin's role in SUD treatment. This study proposes to translate promising
      preclinical and early proof-of-concept clinical results related to the anti-addiction,
      pro-social, and stress-tempering properties of oxytocin administration in Veterans with
      moderate-severe cocaine use disorder (CUD) enrolled in a opioid replacement therapy (ORT)
      program for cooccurring opioid use disorder (OUD) at the San Francisco VA Medical Center
      (SFVAMC). The investigators' primary outcome is Aim 1) reduction in cocaine use, as measured
      by quantitative urine levels of cocaine metabolite. Secondarily, the investigators will focus
      on Aim 2) improving psychosocial treatment engagement (social support) and Aim 3) mitigating
      social stress-related relapse, targeting two important barriers to CUD recovery likely to
      respond to oxytocin administration
