  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rivers et al. laid the foundation for modern hemodynamic and fluid management by establishing
      goal directed therapy (GDT) for the treatment of sepsis using fluid and inotropic and
      vasoactive agents. There have been many subsequent protocols to improve outcome in the
      operating room or in the ICU. These are mainly passive decision support systems. Active
      clinical decision support systems using fluid and pharmacologic agents to improve
      intraoperative hemodynamics are not really found.

      The investigators developed an active clinical decision support system based on an
      institutional GDT-protocol using fluid, vasopressors and inotropes using the LiDCOrapid
      device.

      The goal of the study was to check the feasibility of an active clinical decision support
      system to optimize hemodynamics during high risk vascular surgery based on the principles of
      GDT implementing fluid, vasopressors and inotropes.

    <description>The active decision support system in this study is a goal directed therapy (GDT) protocol where threshold hemodynamic values are defined when to give fluid, vasopressors and inotropes. Hemodynamic values are measured with the LiDCOrapid device, which uses pulse contour analysis to continuously monitor cardiac output and respiratory variations in stroke volume (SVV).</description>
