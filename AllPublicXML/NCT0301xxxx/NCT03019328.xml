  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recent finding that early introduction of peanut can prevent ~70-90% of peanut allergy is
      a major step towards prevention of food allergy. However, because that finding was from a
      clinical trial in a very select population, there are several major questions that must be
      answered in order to implement these findings into clinical practice without causing more
      harm than good. These questions include who, if anyone, should be screened prior to early
      introduction for peanut allergy, how this screening should be done, and what quantity of
      peanut ingestion is needed to prevent peanut allergy. The goal of this project is to answer
      these critical questions so that the potential of these recent findings can be realized. To
      that end, 400 infants at high-risk of peanut allergy will be enrolled. These infants will be
      given a peanut skin prick test, peanut food challenge and have blood drawn for measurement of
      peanut IgE, and then will be followed for assessment of peanut consumption and development of
      peanut allergy until 3 years of age.

      400 infants aged 4-11 months from three high risk groups will be enrolled in a prospective
      observational study. All subjects will have a baseline research clinic visit, where they will
      be given a peanut skin prick test, peanut food challenge and have blood drawn for measurement
      of peanut immunoglobulin E (IgE). Based on the baseline oral food challenge, the participants
      will be advised to begin introducing peanut following the current practice guidelines.
      Participants will then be followed until 30 months of age with two clinic visits and regular
      monitoring of peanut consumption.

          -  Have at least one of the following criteria:

               1. physician diagnosis of milk, egg or other non-peanut food allergy,

               2. at least moderate eczema as defined by a SCORAD score of at least 25 on present
                  or previous evaluation, OR a rash that required the application of topical creams
