    <textblock>
      This is a clinical investigational plan (CIP) for the &quot;Clinical Study to Confirm MRI Safety
      and Effectiveness Using SJM Cardiac Rhythm Management Systems (ASSURE MRI)&quot;. This study
      intends to enroll patients who meet standard bradycardia or tachycardia indications and have
      already been implanted with one of the SJM device/lead combinations listed in this protocol.
      The objective of this study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of each of the four
      SJM device/lead combinations in an MRI environment. This clinical investigation is sponsored
      by St. Jude Medical.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center clinical study designed to confirm the safety and
      effectiveness of St. Jude Medical low voltage pacemakers, high voltage dual chamber
      Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD), and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy
      Defibrillators (CRT-D) with various leads in an MRI environment.

      The study will enroll subjects across multiple geographies and sites. Sites in geographies
      where MRI labelling is not yet approved may also be included after appropriate IRB/EC and
      local regulatory approvals, as applicable, are obtained. A prospective, multi-center study
      design is chosen for generalizability of study results.

      The clinical study will be conducted in approximately 40 centers worldwide. Approximately 88
      subjects total (with a minimum 22 subjects for each of the four device/lead combinations)
      will be enrolled in this study.

      Enrollment in the study is expected to take approximately 6-8 months. Subjects will be
      followed for 1 month following the MRI scan. The total study duration of the study is
      expected to be 10 months, depending on the rate of enrollment.

        Subjects who meet standard bradycardia or tachycardia indications comprise the target
        population for this study. The subject will be considered enrolled in the study after the
        consent is signed and the MRI Settings have been programmed at the MRI visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are implanted with one of the following SJM device/lead combinations evaluated in this
             study for at least 60 days (can include patients with an eligible SJM lead for ≥ 60
             days OR patients with a new eligible SJM pacemaker, Implantable
             Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICD), or Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators
             (CRT-D) device and eligible SJM lead implanted for at least 60 days:

               1. Accent MRI™, Assurity MRI™, Endurity MRI™, or Endurity pacemaker with Tendril™
                  STS Model 2088 lead

               2. Accent MRI™, Assurity MRI™, Endurity MRI™, or Endurity pacemaker with IsoFlex™
                  Optim (Model 1944 or 1948) lead

               3. Ellipse™ VR/DR or Fortify Assura VR/DR ICD with Tendril™ STS (Model 2088) or
                  Tendril MRI™ and Durata™ or Optisure™ leads
