      The investigators seek to extend the findings of a recent research which demonstrated that
      treating insomnia has several beneficial effects on employee work outcomes (Barnes, Miller, &amp;
      Bostock, in press). In the present study, the investigators propose that the treatment of
      leader insomnia would beneficially influence leadership, specifically abusive supervision,
      charismatic leadership, and laissez-faire leadership.
