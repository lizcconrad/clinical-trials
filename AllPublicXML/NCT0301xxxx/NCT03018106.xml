    <textblock>
      Vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) is a condition that impacts up to 60% of the growing
      postmenopausal female population, and the most common symptom is dyspareunia. Vaginal
      estrogen is the most common treatment for VVA, but it only marginally improves overall sexual
      function, and many women and clinicians avoid using it because of the risks of exogenous
      estrogen use during menopause. Ospemifene is a non-estrogen selective estrogen receptor
      modulator (SERM) that is FDA-approved for treating dyspareunia related to VVA, and has shown
      superb improvements in overall sexual health. 104 women will be randomized to receive 12
      weeks of 60mg oral ospemifene, taken daily, or 12 weeks of 0.5mg vaginal conjugated
      estrogens, which is placed vaginally twice per week. The improvements in sexual health and
      VVA symptom severity will be compared in each group. This study will help determine if
      ospemifene is a better treatment medication than conjugated estrogens.

      Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) affects 57% of postmenopausal women. Vulvovaginal atrophy
      (VVA) is a condition that impacts up to 60% of the growing postmenopausal female population,
      and the most common symptom is dyspareunia. Women with FSD are 3.84 times as likely to also
      have VVA. Vaginal estrogen is the most common treatment for VVA, but it only marginally
      improves overall sexual function, and many women and clinicians avoid using it because of the
      risks of exogenous estrogen use during menopause. Ospemifene is a non-estrogen selective
      estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is FDA-approved for treating dyspareunia related to
      VVA, and has shown superb improvements in overall sexual health. This oral medication, taken
      daily, improves vaginal health, and has demonstrated protective activity in the breast and
      bone tissues. It also has not demonstrated any carcinogenic activity in the endometrium or
      liver. This study hopes to determine if ospemifene is superior to conjugated estrogens in
      improving sexual function and vaginal atrophy symptoms.

      104 women will be randomized to receive 12 weeks of 60mg oral ospemifene, taken daily, or 12
      weeks of 0.5mg vaginal conjugated estrogens, which is placed vaginally twice per week. Each
      participant will be informed of her assigned medication, and will receive a medication coupon
      to help offset the cost of the medication. Each medication is FDA-approved for long-term use
      of at least 52 weeks. For this study, a 12-week prescription for the medication will be sent
      electronically to the pharmacy of the participant's choice. The improvements in sexual health
      and VVA symptom severity will be compared in each group.

    <description>The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a 19 item questionnaire that asks about sexual function in the prior four weeks. The FSFI was developed for the specific purpose of assessing sexual arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, pain related to sexual functioning in clinical trial participants. Participants answer by selecting between 5-6 question-specific options to rate the degree to which the question fits their experience. Each response option is assigned a point and each question has 0-5 or 1-5 possible points. The points are summed to determine a total score. The total score can range from 2 to 36 and scores equal to or less than 26.55 indicate female sexual dysfunction (FSD).</description>

    <description>Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), and it is the only SERM approved in the United States to treat moderate to severe dyspareunia associated with VVA. It is an oral medication that is taken as a 60mg tablet once daily. Food intake increases its absorption by 2 to 3-fold, and this is not impacted by the fat or calorie content of the food. It is metabolized primarily in the liver, and is excreted in feces.</description>

    <description>Conjugated estrogens are a mixture of several different estrogen salts derived from natural sources and blended to approximate the composition of estrogens in the urine of pregnant horses. The main components are sodium estrone sulphate and sodium equilin sulfate. Vaginal estrogen is considered the medication of choice for treating vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA).</description>

        <title>Female Sexual Function Index Score</title>
        <description>The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a 19 item questionnaire that asks about sexual function in the prior four weeks. The FSFI was developed for the specific purpose of assessing sexual arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, pain related to sexual functioning in clinical trial participants. Participants answer by selecting between 5-6 question-specific options to rate the degree to which the question fits their experience. Each response option is assigned a point and each question has 0-5 or 1-5 possible points. The points are summed to determine a total score. The total score can range from 2 to 36 and scores equal to or less than 26.55 indicate female sexual dysfunction (FSD).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The patient population did not provide as many interested and qualified subjects as anticipated, thus the study was terminated early due to obstacles with recruitment and time limitations for data analyses.</limitations_and_caveats>
