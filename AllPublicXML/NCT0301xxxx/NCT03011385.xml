      OBJECTIVE: The project aims at investigating of the effects of three types of planning
      (individual planning, collaborative planning, and dyadic planning) on physical activity among
      dyads.The influence of three planning interventions are compared with an active control
      condition, including physical activity education.

      PARTICIPANTS: The effects of the interventions are evaluated among dyads of two adults
      (partner-partner dyads). Adults forming dyads (e.g. two romantic partners, two relatives, two
      co-workers, two friends) who are in regular contact for at least one year will be enrolled. A
      minimum of 50 dyads enrolled into the each arm of the trial (a total of 200 dyads). The
      interventions consist of six planning sessions.

      DESIGN: The dyads are randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. The
      assessment of the main and secondary outcomes is conducted at the baseline, at 1 week after
      the first intervention session, at post-intervention (after six intervention sessions are
      completed), and at 6-, and 12-month follow-ups.

      OUTCOMES: Physical activity constitutes the main outcome, whereas health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL), body mass index, as well as the self-regulatory strategy called the use of
      planning (individual, dyadic and collaborative) are secondary outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individual planning (also known as implementation intentions or action and coping planning)
      is a regulatory strategy, which refers to making plans on when, where, and how to perform an
      intended behavior. In dyadic planning, a target person is setting plans together with a
      partner on when, where, and how the target person will individually engage in behavior
      change. The concept of dyadic planning differs from the conceptualization of collaborative
      plans, where two individuals make plans on how to enact a behavior together.

      The study will evaluate the effects of a short-term planning intervention. The intervention
      includes a total of six sessions: two face-to-face sessions with the experimenter (delivered
      over two weeks) and three sessions delivered over phone (over the following three weeks), one
      face-two-face session (delivered at one month after the third session delivered over the
      phone). The delivery has an individual format (the experimenter + the dyad). The total time
      from first to sixth session is 2 months. The setting for the interventions will include
      physician's offices and participant's home. The same format, schedule, delivery, and setting
      will be used for conducting active control group procedures.

Action plans (referring to when, when, and how the individual will act) as well as coping plans (referring to how to overcome potential difficulties, risky situations or temptations to not engage in physical activity) will be formed. Each participant will form their plans individually, without consulting the dyadic partner, but discussing the plans with the experimenter.</description>

Action plans as well as coping plans will be formed. Both partners in the dyad jointly form one plan. This jointly developed plan is discussed with the experimenter.
The plan focuses on physical activity of only one person in the dyad. This target person will be selected jointly by the participants if both participants are healthy. If one participant has a chronic disease, e.g. diabetes or a cardiovascular disease, the plans are formed for the person with a disease.</description>

    <description>The education materials address physical activity and healthy nutrition guidelines for age groups and chronic disease. Participants receive a set of educational materials about types of physical activity (PA), PA intensity, exercise calorie expenditure, strength and endurance training, stretching, and general nutrition guidelines in terms of meal composition, and nutrients, meal frequency. The materials exclude any planning statements. The education is delivered by the experimenter to a partner-partner dyad and discusses individual guidelines for both dyadic partners.</description>
