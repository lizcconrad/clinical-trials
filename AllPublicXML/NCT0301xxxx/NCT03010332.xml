  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access protocol designed to provide access of ATA230 to subjects with
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia or disease, who are intolerant to, or failed, standard
      antiviral therapy and have no comparable treatment options.

      ATA230 (third-party donor-derived CMV-CTLs) are cytotoxic T lymphocytes that specifically
      kill cells presenting CMV protein antigens.

      This is an expanded access protocol designed to provide access of ATA230 to subjects with CMV
      viremia or disease, who are intolerant to, or failed, standard antiviral therapy and have no
      comparable treatment options. This study will enroll subjects regardless of the underlying
      susceptibility to CMV, including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT), solid
      organ transplant (SOT), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), other immunocompromised states,
      and immune competent subjects who require therapy. Subjects must have active CMV viremia or
      disease for ≥ 2 weeks despite treatment with antiviral therapy or must be intolerant to
      antiviral therapy due to treatment-related toxicity or comorbidities such as renal
      insufficiency or myelosuppression.

      ATA230 will be administered in cycles lasting 5 weeks (35 days). During each cycle, subjects
      will receive intravenous (IV) ATA230 at a dose of 1×10^6 cells/kg (with an acceptable range
      of 0.8-1.0×10^6 cells/kg) on Days 1, 8, and 15, followed by observation through Day 35.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be considered eligible to participate in the study if the following
        inclusion criteria are satisfied:

          1. Has a clinically documented condition associated with CMV disease (eg, interstitial
             pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, retinitis, colitis) or microbiological evidence of
             CMV viremia or tissue invasion with CMV infection (as determined by viral culture or
             levels of CMV DNA in blood or body fluids)

          2. The CMV disease or CMV viremia is characterized by at least one of the following:

               1. CMV disease is persistent or clinically progressing despite ≥ 2 weeks of
                  antiviral therapy

               2. CMV viremia/disease is persistent or increasing (determined by quantitation of
                  blood CMV DNA) despite ≥ 2 weeks of antiviral therapy

               3. A genetic mutation associated with antiviral drug resistance is present

               4. Unable to continue antiviral drugs due to drug-associated toxicity.

          3. No other comparable or satisfactory therapies are available for treatment of CMV

          4. Not eligible for any other trials supporting development of ATA230

          5. For subjects who received an alloHCT, the underlying disease for which the alloHCT was
             performed is in morphologic remission

          6. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 3× the upper
             limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin &lt; 2.5×ULN unless caused by CMV

          7. Availability of appropriate ATA230 cell lot (ie, HLA partially-matched and restricted
             CMV-CTLs)

          8. Subject or subject's representative is willing and able to provide written informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible to participate in the study if any of the following criteria
        are met:

          1. Receiving concomitant investigational therapy (co-enrollment in a non-interventional
             study or a study for follow-up or sample collection only is permitted)

          2. Need for antimetabolite agents (eg, methotrexate), or extracorporeal photopheresis

          3. Antithymocyte globulin or similar anti-T cell antibody therapy ≤ 4 weeks prior to the
             first dose of ATA230 (on Day 1 of Cycle 1)

          4. Need for vasopressor or ventilator support

          5. Pregnancy, except when ATA230 is clearly needed

          6. Female of childbearing potential or male with a female partner of childbearing
             potential unwilling to use a highly effective method of contraception

          7. Inability to comply with study procedures
