    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is handled by cardiopulmonary resuscitation which is a time critical emergency
      situation. The actions during resuscitation are lead by international guidelines.
      Traditionally, the main focus of the training has been on medical knowledge and technical
      skills (TS). Nowadays non-technical skills (NTS), such as communication, teamwork behaviour,
      and leadership, are considered at least equally important.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate both TS and NTS of the resuscitation team during
      real-life resuscitation situations using a validated assessment tool. The correlation of TS
      and NTS will be analyzed. Findings from this study may help to recognize the possible
      weaknesses and issues which could be improved by training. Hypothesis is that that TS are
      probably in a high level, but some improvement points of NTS are ought to be known better.
      Investigators also hypothesis that the good NTS performance in resuscitation is accompanied
      by good TS performance.

      Background

      Cardiac arrest is a time-critical emergency situation, which is treated by cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR). The actions during resuscitation are lead by international guidelines
      (Nolan et al 2010). Because of the relatively rare nature of cardiac arrests in many wards
      and clinics, regular resuscitation training is necessary.

      During cardiopulmonary resuscitation and other sudden medical crisis situations, in addition
      to medical knowledge and technical skills (TS), also non-technical skills (NTS) are needed
      (Castelao et al 2011, Fletcher et al 2002, Helmreich et al 1999, Gaba et al 1998). NTS are
      behavioural elements which are ought to improve team performance. However, the importance of
      NTS has been demonstrated only in a simulated settings, not in a real life.

      Objective, purpose, and hypothesis

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the technical and especially non-technical skills of the
      resuscitation team during real-life resuscitation situations. Findings from this study may
      help to recognize the possible weaknesses and issues which could be improved by training. The
      hypothesis is that technical skills are probably on a high level, but some improvement points
      of non-technical skills are ought to be known better. Investigators also hypothesis that good
      non-technical performance is related on good technical performance.

      Design and Methods

      Turku University Central Hospital lies in a Southwestern part of Finland, and provides
      medical services for 865 000 inhabitants. The target group of this study is the resuscitation
      team of the adult ICU of Turku University Central Hospital. This team consists of an ICU
      doctor (most commonly an anaesthesiologist specialized for intensive care), two ICU nurses,
      and one medical technician. These people are treating approximately 90 cardiac arrests per
      year, but this group also gets other alarms (like shortness of breath, unconscious patients
      and other acute situations). This ICU resuscitation team takes care of all resuscitation
      calls in the newer part of the Turku University Hospital, when the older parts of the
      hospital are taken care either by a resuscitation team from pediatric ICU or by prehospital
      emergency medical service system.

      The data from 30 video-recorded real-life resuscitation situations treated by resuscitation
      team in Turku University Hospital will be collected and the overall NTS and TS score will be
      measured using a validated assessment tool. The correlation of the TS and NTS will be
      analyzed by statistical methods. The resuscitation team uses routinely a defibrillator
      (Leardal HeartStart MRx) with Q-CPR technology, so the data that gathers to the Q-CPR device
      will be analyzed. In addition, after each recorded resuscitation situation, every member of
      the resuscitation team will be called by a phone. During the calls team members are asked to
      tell examples, what went well during the resuscitation, and what could have been done better.
      Based on these answers, inductive analysis will be made.

      Ethics

      The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Turku University. All patients
      suffering from sudden cardiac arrest in Turku University newer hospital building area are
      considered eligible to the study regardless of the initial rhythm or presumed aetiology.
      Written information consent of patients is not needed, because the study is directed at
      resuscitation team performance. The patients are not identified at any phase of the study.

    <description>The investigators are analyzing as many real-life CPR situations as possible. From each CPR-situations the investigators measure the technical skill performance and non-technical skills using an 71 item assessment tool. No-flow time/hands-off time is measured by the defibrillator (MRx) data and visually from each video. Statically analyses will be made to study if the TS, NTS and hands-off-time/no-flow-time are are related on one another.</description>
