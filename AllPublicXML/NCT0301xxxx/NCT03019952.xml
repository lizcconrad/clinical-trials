    <textblock>
      An analysis of data for adolescents and young adults diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders
      (ASDs) who are evaluated as part of the Care Coordination, Assessment, and Responsive
      Engagement for transition-aged adolescents (t-CARE) program which replaced the former Autism
      Life Care Model (ALCM), which was a clinical program implemented between Fall 2014 and April
      2016. The individuals enrolled in the program will be administered a standardized assessment
      battery during each visit with the care coordinator or study coordinator. The proposed study
      will analyze data gathered during each of the assessment periods in order to check the
      efficacy and viability of the protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current collaboration between individuals, families, and providers through in-person meetings
      are extremely infrequent, costly, and occur most often when providers are intimately involved
      as part of a multidisciplinary team in a single setting such as at a school. Often, little
      information is transmitted between providers and/or school personnel in determining treatment
      goals and interventions. Furthermore, the transmission of information is often provider to
      provider or school personnel to provider, which excludes direct patient-input and lessens
      transparency in decision making. In an effort to improve current care and therefore improve
      successful adult transitions for adolescents with ASD, t-CARE is designed to mimic
      multidisciplinary team meetings. These meetings are incredibly impactful as they include
      direct individual and family involvement through facilitated information-sharing, while also
      maintaining patient-centered care across multiple providers and complex systems of care.

    <description>This is a longitudinal study. Adolescents or young adults with autism will participate in this study. Participants will be required to complete a baseline of assessment measures at enrollment and then monthly assessments (described in the study procedures below) during the first (approximately) 10-15 minutes of each visit with the t-CARE coordinator. The remainder of the visit will focus on care coordination and clinical treatment goals.</description>
