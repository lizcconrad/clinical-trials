      Robust I study is a feasibility study about safety and efficacy of DCB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the safety and effectiveness for drug coated balloon
      (DCB).

      Up to 30 subjects will be enrolled and treated with the device at up to 3 clinical sites. Due
      to the significantly higher prevalence of strictures in men vs. women and the etiology of
      those strictures being different, the study will focus on male subjects with single anterior
      urethral stricture. Subjects will be followed up post-treatment up to 5 years.
