  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the corneal morphometry instrumentation Oculus Pentacam, which is commonly used
      before and after clinical refractive surgery, we will collect the corneal morphological and
      biologic parameters of the population under refractive surgery screening in refractive
      surgery centers around the country, and construct corneal morphology database in different
      living areas of Chinese people. Based on this, compared with the suspected keratoconus and
      keratoconus population, the screening criteria and reference standards accord with the
      characteristics of keratoconus of Chinese ethnic will be achieved.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety of refractive surgery has always been the focus of attention, keratoconus
      screening is the most important part for the preoperative examination of refractive surgery.
      Favorable tools and appropriate indicators are the premise of fast and accurate screening,
      and the corneal morphology from various regions of China have various characteristics, the
      use of uniform standards developed by foreign screening will always induce a lot of problems,
      for example, the differences of cornea morphological features between European and American
      ethnic and Chinese race, as well as the corneal morphometric indicators between various
      regions of China, will cause varying degrees of false-positive or false-negative screening
      results. Based on this, in order to further improve the safety of refractive surgery
      effectively and to obtain the effective and accurate screening of suspected keratoconus
      population, this study will be conducted to collect the corneal morphological characteristics
      database of Chinese people from all over the country, and to develop a database of Chinese
      ethnographic characteristics for screening keratoconus indicators and reference valuable to
      guide clinical screening and surgical design.

    <intervention_name>Scheimpflug tomography system (Pentacam) measurement</intervention_name>
    <description>The Scheimpflug tomography system (Pentacam,Oculus GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) is a rotating Scheimpflug camera that measures 138,000 true elevation points to compute corneal topography. Patients were asked to blink twice and then look at the fixation device. Image acquisition was a 2-second scan of 50 rotational Scheimpflug images through the corneal sighting point, the point where the ray of light from the fovea to the fixation device crossed the cornea. All measurements were performed just after a blink to minimize the effect of tear film alteration on the data. Acceptable maps had at least 10.0 mm of corneal coverage with no extrapolated data in the central 9.0 mm zone.</description>
