  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to investigate the effects of daily almond intake based on the timing
      of almond consumption (i.e., almond consumption as a preload or between-meal snack) on body
      composition, lipid profile, and oxidative and inflammation indicators among young Korean
      adults.

      The current study was conducted to investigate the effects of daily almond intake on body
      composition, lipid profile, and oxidative and inflammation indicators among young Korean
      adults based on the timing of almond consumption. Participants were randomly assigned to one
      of three groups: (1) a pre-meal group (PM; n = 58) in which participants were instructed to
      consume 56 g of almonds per day as a preload when having regular meals; (2) a snack group
      (SN; n =55) in which participants were instructed to consume 56 g of almonds between meals as
      snacks; and (3) a control group (CL; n = 56) in which participants were provided
      high-carbohydrate iso-caloric control food. The three-day diet records, including two
      consecutive weekdays and one weekend day, were done once before the trial and twice during
      the trial. Body composition was assessed through multi-frequency whole-body bioimpedance
      measurement using InBody 620 (Biospace Co., Ltd, Seoul, Korea).After a 12-hour fast, blood
      samples were taken at the baseline time point (week 0) and at weeks 8 and 16 by standard
      venipuncture. The serum total cholesterol and triglycerides levels were measured by the
      enzymatic-colorimetric method using a Cobas 8000 c702 chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics;
      Mannheim, Germany). HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were determined via
      homogeneous enzymatic colorimetry.

    <description>In this group, participants were provided with 56 g of almonds per day either as preload before meals or snack between meals. A snack was defined as an eating event that occurred between participants' regular meals, specifically two hours before and after meals. All the participants in almond group were provided daily portions of packaged almonds.</description>
