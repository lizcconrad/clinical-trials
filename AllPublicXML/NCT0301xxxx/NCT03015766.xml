  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Auricular acupressure therapy (AAT) has been applied in MHD patients with insomnia in recent
      years and yielded favorable results. However, the effect and safety of AAT for insomnia in
      MHD population still lacks high quality evidence. A randomized controlled clinical trial is
      planned to evaluate the effect and safety of AAT in MHD patients with insomnia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia, a worldwide health problem, is much more frequently complained in maintenance
      hemodialysis (MHD) patients and impairs their quality of life and long term outcome. Hypnotic
      sedative agents are often reluctantly prescribed with doses mounting up. Patients are
      concerned about drug dependence and drug-related adverse effects. As a non-drug therapy,
      auricular acupressure therapy (AAT) is attractive to both patients and practitioners and is
      widely used to treat many conditions in China. The investigators had been applying AAT for
      MHD patients with insomnia in recent years and yielded favorable results. However, the effect
      and safety of AAT for insomnia in MHD population still lacks high quality evidence.
      Therefore, the investigators aimed to perform a randomized controlled clinical trial in MHD
      patients with insomnia to evaluate the effect and safety of AAT.

    <description>Auricular acupressure, is a therapeutic method in which specific acupoints on the ear are stimulated to treat various disorders of the body. This practice is based on the theory that there are specific points on the auricle which correspond to major organs or systems of the body; and therapeutic effect on the corresponding target organ or system can be exerted by manipulating auricular acupoints. Auricular acupressure applies stimulation through pressure on specific acupoints by the imbedded beads, usually Semen Vaccaria (Wang Bu Liu Xing) or stainless steel beads. This therapeutic method is non-invasive and can be self-manipulated by the recipients at times required.</description>
