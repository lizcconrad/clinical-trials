  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to evaluate how intraocular pressure (IOP) is changed depending on
      surgical position (Trendelenburg versus reverse Trendelenburg) in the same patient and to
      compare the effects of different anesthetics on IOP (desflurane versus propofol) in patients
      undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The study design is a double-blind randomized
      controlled trial. The patients were randomly assigned to desflurane or propofol administrated
      groups and all patient are administered intravenous remifentanil continuously as adjuvant
      analgesics during anesthesia. For this study 50 to 80-year-old patients undergoing
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery without eye disease were enrolled. Mean arterial blood
      pressure, peak airway pressure, end tidal carbon dioxide, and IOP (using a Tono-pen® Avia
      tonometer) on both eyes were measured at defined intervals during the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative visual loss is a rare but devastating complication associated with certain type
      of operative procedures. Laparoscopic or robotic surgeries for colorectal cancer, prostate
      cancer and diseases of the female genital organs in the pelvic cavity are performed in a
      steep Trendelenburg position and pneumoperitoneum, which increases the intraocular pressure
      (IOP) by 13-26 mmHg compared with the preoperative IOP value. High intraocular pressure is
      believed to correlate with decreased perfusion to the optic nerve, and thus could lead to
      ischemic optic neuropathy. The objective of the study is to test which anesthetic agent
      (desflurane or propofol) can attenuate the changes in IOP during laparoscopic colorectal
      surgery and identify correlated parameters. Fifty patients (30-80 years; American Society of
      Anesthesiologists' physical status 1-2) scheduled for laparoscopic colorectal surgery will be
      enrolled and allocated randomly into two groups (group D and group P). After measurement of
      initial IOP with topical opthalmic anesthetics, general anesthesia will be induced with
      pentothal sodium 5-6mg/kg (group D) or propofol (group P) 2-2.5mg/kg. After administration of
      muscle relaxant and intubation, intraocular pressure will be measured and anesthesia will be
      maintained with desflurane (group D) or propofol (group P) and all patients will be
      administered intravenous remifentanil concurrently during anesthesia. During anesthesia, IOP
      will be measured at different patient positions. At the time of each IOP measurements, the
      following data set will be collected: mean arterial pressure (MAP), End tidal carbon dioxide
      (EtCO2), peak inspiratory pressure (PIP).
