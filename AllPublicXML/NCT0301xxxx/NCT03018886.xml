    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to validate the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) plus
      arginine (GHRH+arg) stimulation test and itÂ´s cut-off limits for diagnosis of adult growth
      hormone deficiency using the growth hormone (GH) Immulite 2000 Xpi assay calibrated against
      the IS 98/574 from the World Health Organization. A specific aim was to study the effect of
      gender and age on the peak GH response in the GHRH+arg test

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) is a clinical entity including increased abdominal fat
      mass, decreased muscle mass, low bone density and adverse effects on quality of life and
      cardiovascular morbidity. These signs are nonspecific, and accurate diagnosis with laboratory
      tests in needed.

      The GHRH+arg test is used to diagnose AGHD, but the cut-off values vary based on controls
      used. At moment consensus cut-off criteria are BMI specific, but gender and age may also
      affect the GH response in the GHRH+arg.
