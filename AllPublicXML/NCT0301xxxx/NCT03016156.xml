  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine whether a smartphone application called CRADLE (ComputeR
      Assisted Detection of LEukocoria) has the potential to improve the detection of leukocoria.
      There will be no impact on participants' health outcome.

      This study will be performed in two parts, each with a distinct cohort of patients.

      Part 1 will assess the feasibility of various techniques/conditions for using CRADLE within
      patients known to have leukocoria.

      Part 2 will estimate the sensitivity and specificity of CRADLE to detect leukocoria (using
      the techniques selected from information gathered in Part 1) as compared to an
      ophthalmoscope, within patients referred to the clinic for suspected leukocoria.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the most effective usage of a camera phone application (CRADLE) to maximize
           detection of leukocoria in patients with retinoblastoma, congenital cataracts, and
           glaucoma.

        -  To estimate the sensitivity and specificity of a camera phone application (CRADLE) in
           detecting leukocoria.

      This study will utilize three strata called Stratum I, Stratum II and Stratum III.

      STRATUM I - Infants and children known to have leukocoria who have been diagnosed with
      retinoblastoma, cataracts or glaucoma or other eye conditions.

      Participants enrolled on Stratum I of the study will have the CRADLE application used by the
      doctor during their appointment.

      The participant will look straight forward while the doctor stands about 1-3 feet away
      holding the device that has the CRADLE application. He or she will slowly move the device up,
      down, middle, right, and left - both in a lit and dimmed room.

      The participant will be videotaped and photographed during this appointment. The doctor will
      record the results as determined by CRADLE (&quot;normal&quot; or no leukocoria versus &quot;abnormal&quot; or
      positive for leukocoria).

      STRATUM II - Infants and children who are referred to an eye doctor to evaluate for
      leukocoria.

      Participants enrolled on Stratum II of the study will be asked to look straight forward while
      he or she uses the CRADLE application (using the best method determined from Stratum I). The
      doctor will also examine the participant's eyes with the ophthalmoscope method. The results
      from both CRADLE and the ophthalmoscope method will be recorded and compared (white eye
      present versus absent, and normal versus abnormal as described above).

      STRATUM III - Infants and children receiving treatment for retinoblastoma. For participants
      enrolled on Stratum III, he or she will have the same procedures as described in Stratum II.

      After receiving informed consent, participants will undergo evaluation by ophthalmoscope and
      CRADLE on Day 1. Stratum III participants only will also undergo CRADLE evaluation on Days 2,
      3, and 4.

    <description>This outcome will assess the feasibility of various techniques and conditions for using CRADLE in participants with retinoblastoma, congenital cataracts, and glaucoma. The most effective usage of CRADLE to maximize detection of leukocoria will be determined by review of all images, and the most effective and efficient technique will be selected based on the findings and the clarity of the images. This technique will be used for completion of the subsequent objectives using a new cohort of participants.</description>
