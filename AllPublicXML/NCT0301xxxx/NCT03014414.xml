  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with elevated blood pressure are at higher risk of having a heart attack or stroke
      than people with lower blood pressure. Losing a modest amount of weight—such as 15 or 20
      pounds—can reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke. However, it can often be a
      struggle to maintain weight loss over time.

      This study examines whether two behavioral weight-management programs can help people
      maintain weight loss over time. In this study, 346 adults will be randomly assigned (like
      flipping a coin) to one of the 12-month programs and followed for 36 months (i.e., 3 years)
      to see how their body weight may change.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial will test the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of novel modules
      administered prior to weight loss that are explicitly designed to enhance enjoyment of
      healthy lifestyle behaviors independent of any longer-term health effects, and thus escalate
      the proportion of individuals sustaining ≥7% weight loss over the long-term.

      Overweight/obese individuals with elevated blood pressure will be randomized to one of two
      12-month weight-management interventions (Fun First or Weight Watchers) and followed for 36
      months. For Aim 1 (Primary outcome), we will test whether Fun First is more efficacious than
      Weight Watchers using a mediator-intervention interaction model with sufficient a priori
      statistical power for the interaction effect as well as the intervention and mediator main
      effects. The posited mediator assesses participants' change in enjoyment for four key healthy
      lifestyle behaviors (healthy eating, physical activity, weighing and self-nurturing) via
      online survey from 0-2 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants who lose
      a clinically significant amount of initial body weight and maintain it during the trial
      (i.e., lose &gt;=7% of their initial body weight from 0-12 months and gain &lt;=5 lbs from 12-36
      months), assessed on clinic scales during in-person visits at the research clinic. Secondary
      outcomes include the proportion of individuals sustaining ≥7% weight loss over the trial
      assessed by digital cellular scales in participants' homes and participants' change in
      systolic blood pressure over the trial assessed at the research clinic.

      For Aim 2 (Other pre-specified outcomes), we will test whether Fun First is more cost
      effective than Weight Watchers using both individual-level trial data and systems science
      modeling for long-term, population-level hypertension and cardiovascular disease incidence,
      health care and disability costs, and quality-adjusted life-years over the life course.
