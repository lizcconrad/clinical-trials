  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a congregation,
      clinic and integrated case management-based intervention for sustainable testing and
      retention on linkage to care, engagement, retention and viral load suppression of women and
      children infected with HIV.

      Using a two-arm cluster randomized design, our proposed study will evaluate the comparative
      effectiveness of iSTAR, a community-based social network intervention that combines trained
      church-based Health Advisors and clinic-based staff and uses motivational interview skills
      and clinic- quality improvement approaches (Intervention Group; IG) versus a clinic-based
      approach (Control group; CG) on linkage, engagement, retention and viral suppression among
      HIV-infected women and children. Eighteen health facilities in identified local government
      areas in Benue state, north-central Nigeria will be randomly assigned to either the IG (N=9
      health facilities) or the CG (N=9 health facilities). A total of 10,000 pregnant women will
      be screened and 400 HIV-infected participants will be enrolled over a 24-month period. The
      primary outcome will be the difference in the rate of linkage and engagement between the
      groups. The secondary outcome will be the difference in rate of retention and viral
      suppression among participants. Additionally, we will conduct network, mediation/moderation
      analysis to examine the roles of intermediate variables such as health team cohesion,
      turnovers, attitudes, leadership and dynamic adaptation on iSTAR implementation and
      sustainment.

    <description>HIV-infected participants identified from the churches randomized to CG will be referred to PEPFAR-supported HIV clinics that provide comprehensive care including counseling, laboratory testing, ART and ongoing support during treatment as the standard of care.

    <description>Each component of the iSTAR intervention targets a specific point along the HIV continuum: confidential, onsite integrated laboratory tests during baby showers targets HIV diagnosis (b) church-based Health Advisors (CHAs) trained in motivational interviewing and quality improvement skills as promotoras target linkage, engagement and adherence by providing counseling and other support to HIV-infected women and children (c) integrated network of community and clinic case management targets reduction in loss to follow-up.
CHAs will support participants during the study period by being available to accompany them to clinic visits, review laboratory results and medications after clinic visits. They will be available to speak with them at intervals to see how they are doing either by phone or through home visits as they prefer. At each follow-up study visit, the trained CHA will review and collect data on participants' clinic visits, treatment, and laboratory results.</description>
