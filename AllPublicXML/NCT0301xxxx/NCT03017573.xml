    <textblock>
      SCANDARE is a prospective biobanking study on tumor (+/- nodes), plasma and blood samples at
      different time points in ovarian, triple negative breast and head and neck cancer patients.
      This study will allowed to identify new molecular and/or immunological biomarkers associated
      with clinical and biological features of the tumors. All patients will receive standard
      treatment according to the stage of the diseases and usual procédures.

      Patients will have blood and +/- tumor samples at the following times :

        1. if eligible for surgery :

             -  at surgery (blood + tumor and nodes)

             -  after surgery (blood)

             -  before cycle 1 of adjuvant chemotherapy (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes if
                possible)

             -  before cycle 2 of adjuvant chemotherapy (blood)

             -  at progression (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes if possible)

        2. if eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy :

             -  before neoadjuvant therapy (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes)

             -  during neoadjuvant therapy (post cycle 1) (blood)

             -  at the time of surgery (blood + tumor and nodes)

             -  before cycle 1 of adjuvant chemotherapy (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes)

             -  before cycle 2 of adjuvant chemotherapy (blood)

             -  at progression (blood + tumor biopsie and nodes)
