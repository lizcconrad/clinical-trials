      The purpose of this study are to compare angles of hip joint between before and after
      releasing quadratus lumborum muscle.

      The 1st physical therapist performed the modified Thomas test position. The participant was
      asked to lie supine over the edge of the couch. The participant hold one knee to the chest
      tightly while the other knee was bent over the end of the couch. The 2nd physical therapist
      measured angles of hip and knee using a standard goniometer at baseline. The quadratus
      lumborum muscle was released. Then the same measurement was repeated.
