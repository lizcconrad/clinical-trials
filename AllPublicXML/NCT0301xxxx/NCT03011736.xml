    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies the omission of intact parathyroid hormone testing during surgery
      in treating patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Omission of intact parathyroid hormone
      testing during parathyroid gland removal may help patients with primary hyperparathyroidism
      to decrease their time under anesthesia, and decrease the overall time and cost of surgery.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the non-inferiority of omission of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients who
      meet the biochemical and radiological criteria compared to current standard of care (i.e. use
      of intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Cost-analysis to determine savings of omission of intraoperative PTH testing.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard minimally invasive parathyroidectomy without PTH testing during
      surgery.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive 4 dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) for single gland (adenoma) primary
             hyperparathyroidism

          -  Preoperative serum calcium levels &gt;= 10.9 mg/dL

          -  Preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) elevated beyond normal range or inappropriately
             high for associated calcium level

          -  Patient has no history of prior neck surgery or external radiation to neck for
             malignant conditions

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2

          -  Subject or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved
             written informed consent form prior to receiving any study related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has recurrent hyperparathyroidism

          -  4D CT positive for multiple gland disease

          -  Patient has inability to tolerate 4D CT scan (for example; contrast intravenous (IV)
             allergy, claustrophobia, renal disease)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant or nursing female subjects; may be determined in the preoperative evaluation

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements

          -  Any condition which in the investigator's opinion deems the subject an unsuitable
             candidate to undergo observational study (may also include preoperative testing
             results including electrocardiography [EKG], chest x-ray, or pulmonary function tests
             that preclude a wide excision in the operating room)
