      This is a pilot study to test a hypothesis that a greater increase in serum chromogranin A
      (CgA) after a definitive radiotherapy (RT) with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
      is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer recurrence after RT. Serum CgA level is
      measured before the start of RT and/or the start of neoadjuvant ADT for patients undergoing a
      definitive RT with or without ADT. CgA is also measured at various pre-defined post-RT time
      points. The study will analyze the followings: 1. Change in CgA level at various pre-defined
      post-RT time points from the baseline, 2. Correlation between the extent of post-therapy CgA
      change and Gleason score of malignancy, 3. Correlation between the extent of post-therapy CgA
      change and treatment outcome.

      Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostate cancer is a well-recognized phenotypic
      change by which prostate cancer cells transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine-like (NE-like)
      cells. Accumulated evidences have suggested that the prevalence of NE-like cells is
      associated with disease progression and poor prognosis.

      NED can be induced by a therapeutic agent. Such therapeutic agents include RT and ADT.
      RT-induced NED represents a novel pathway by which prostate cancer cells survive radiotherapy
      and contribute to treatment failure and tumor recurrence. Chromogranin A is the serum
      biomarker for NED and correlates well with CgA-positive staining in biopsy specimens. It has
      been reported that elevated serum CgA is associated with poor therapeutic response,
      androgen-independent growth, and biochemical recurrence.

      The study tests whether the extent of serum CgA increase by RT +/- ADT, which reflects
      radiation-induced NED, is correlated with the risk of prostate cancer recurrence following RT
      and a Gleason score of prostate carcinoma.
