      To determine the accuracy of two techniques (transverse scan and sagittal scan) using
      ultrasonography to identify C7 spinous process compare to the fluoroscope (standard

      To identify the accurate level of upper thoracic spine is essential maneuver during breast
      surgery and axillary node dissection. Palpation C7 spinous process is most common technique
      using to identify the level. However, the accuracy was lower than 50%. Ultrasonography has
      been investigated to identify the cervical nerve roots by differentiating the transvers
      process of C6 and C7. However, there was no study on the accuracy of using ultrasound to
      identify cervical spine level before.

    <description>Convex transducer will be placed at patient's neck using paramedian sagittal scan and pointing toward the chest apex aiming to identify the first rib. Then move the transducer medially to identify the transverse process along with identify C7 transverse process will appear on the image as a hyperechoic shadow without continue to the rib laterally. Place the C7 spinous process on the midpoint of the probe and the spinous process correspondence to the midline will be marked as C7.</description>

    <description>Linear transducer will be placed at patient's lateral neck using transverse scan. The unique characteristic of sonography of transvers process of C6 and C7 will be used to identify the transverse process of C6 and C7. C6 transverse process has a very prominence anterior tubercle (known as Chassaignac tubercle). While anterior tubercle of C7 is absent. After identifying the C7 transverse process, simultaneously the color Doppler mode will be activated to identify the vertebral artery for double confirmation.</description>
