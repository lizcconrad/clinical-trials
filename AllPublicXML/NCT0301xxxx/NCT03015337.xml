    <textblock>
      This study examined how well elementary students demonstrated motor skill competency as a
      result of participating in the evidence-based quality physical education program and
      investigated relationships between levels of health-related physical fitness and physical
      activity in school-aged children.

    <description>changes in manipulative skill between the intervention year 1 and the intervention year 2. The K-1 students' motor skill competency in running, weight transferring, hand dribbling, and underhand catching skills was assessed using four PE Metrics skill assessment rubrics in the intervention year 1 and year 2, respectively.</description>
