  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microcirculation should be assessed before and after tibial bypass surgery by intraoperative
      fluorescence angiography. According to this, the direct and the indirect angiosomes should be
      compared according to the individual microcirculatory improvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only patients at CLI stage Rutherford IV to VI with the necessity of tibial Bypass surgery
      will be included. Macrocirculation is measured by the ankle-brachial index (ABI). In order to
      assess the skin microcirculation intraoperative fluorescence angiography is used (SPY Eliteâ„¢,
      NOVADAQ, Canada). The alteration of microcirculation is compared in direct and indirect
      revascularized angiosomes by calculation of the fluorescence parameters Ingress (IN) and
      Ingress rate (InR). Clinical Follow-up investigations will be performed and the wound healing
      rate is compared between the different revascularization methods.
