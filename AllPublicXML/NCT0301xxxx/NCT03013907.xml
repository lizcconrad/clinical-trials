  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to adapt and then evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
      efficacy of a telephone-based intervention (UPLIFT: Using Practice and Learning to Increase
      Favorable Thoughts) for individuals with elevated depressive symptoms and hypertension.
      UPLIFT is a group-based intervention that is delivered over 8 weekly sessions for 1 hour/week
      by phone.

      Aim 1 of this study is to adapt UPLIFT using qualitative focus groups and individual
      interviews and to test the adapted UPLIFT program in a single-arm design. Aim 2 of this study
      is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will compare the effects of the adapted UPLIFT
      program to usual care (UC) and to test mediators and moderators of the effects of UPLIFT.

    <textblock>
      Once 16 participants are enrolled (to form 2 groups of 8 patients each), an independent study
      staff member will determine participants' group assignments. The randomization sequence will
      be created a priori by Dr. Keith Goldfeld (biostatistician) by using a computer-generated
      list of random numbers with stratification by antidepressant medication use and baseline
      levels of depressive symptoms (PHQ scores &lt;10 and ≥10).

      UPLIFT: Eligible participants will complete 8 weekly group sessions by phone. The
      intervention builds cognitive-behavioral and mindfulness skills to help reduce depressive
      symptoms. Each hour-long weekly session consists of: check-in, instruction, skill building,
      discussion, and a home-based practice assignment.

      Usual care: Subjects randomized to UC will be advised to seek help from their primary care
      physician (PCP) or other sources as they normally would if they encountered symptomatic
      deterioration or other difficulties over the course of the study. All treatments received
      over the course of the study for the UC group and outside of the study (for the intervention
      group) will be assessed at each time point.

    <description>validated measure of depressive symptoms. Items rate symptom severity during the prior 2 weeks based on DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for major depression. Scores range from 0-27; scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. The PHQ-9 will be completed at screening and at all study visits (continuous scores).</description>

    <description>Standardized depression instrument that has treatment sensitivity advantages over the PHQ-9 and will be administered at pre- and post-treatment. Total scores on the QIDS-SR16 range from 0 to 27 and reflect depression severity across 9 domains of the DSM-IV MDD criteria: depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, concentration/decision making, self-outlook, suicidal ideation, energy/fatigability, sleep, weight/appetite change, and psychomotor changes.</description>
