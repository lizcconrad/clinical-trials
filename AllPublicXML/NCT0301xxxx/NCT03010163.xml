    <description>Participants will get free weight, height, waist, and blood pressure testing at health fairs stationed at NYC taxi garage bases and airport taxi holding lots. Health fair staff will follow up with participants who need to see a doctor due to a high blood pressure reading or other unusual result that needs a physician follow-up. All participants will be given a pedometer with instructions on how to use it to track their daily step counts.</description>

    <description>In addition to the health fair services with general follow-up, and giving each driver a pedometer with instructions on how to use the devise to track daily step counts, all participants in this group will receive daily healthy living advice and encouraging messages about walking through text messages sent by study staff to participants' cellular phone.</description>

    <description>Each participant in this group will receive the health fair services with general follow-up along with a pedometer with instructions on how to use the device to track daily step counts. Additionally, participants in this group will be asked to provide the names of family or friends who will form a social support network team. This team will provide encouragement and remind participants to maintain a healthy lifestyle and increase daily walking activities. Participants will be given a social network guide to train their family and/or friends on how to best motivate the participants .</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will receive the health fair service with general follow-up, along with a pedometer with instructions on how to use the device to track daily step counts. Participants will also receive daily healthy living advice through encouraging text messages about walking through text messages sent by our staff to participants' cellular phones. Participants will also be asked to provide the names of family or friends who will form a social support network team. This team will provide encouragement and remind participants to maintain a healthy lifestyle and increase daily walking activities. Participants will be given tools to train their family and/or friends on how to best motivate the drivers.</description>

    <description>The Fitbit One/Alta wireless tracking pedometers measures steps taken, calories burned, and distance traveled. The Fitbit Alta also sends reminders to move, which are notifications that remind the wearer to walk at least 250 steps each hour. If the wearer has not walked 250 steps within the hour, the device will vibrate and send an on-screen reminder 10 minutes before the hour. The reminders to move will be turned off during baseline and will be turned on at randomization for all participants.</description>
