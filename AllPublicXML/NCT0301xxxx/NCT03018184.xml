    <textblock>
      Patients with inherited muscle diseases can have several problems in their muscles, which can
      be both structural and metabolic. All the different diseases can affect the contractility of
      the muscles. The aim of the study is to investigate the relation between muscle strength and
      contractile cross sectional area (CCSA) in the thigh and calf in patients affected by
      inherited muscle diseases.

    <textblock>
      Patients with inherited muscle diseases can have several miscellaneous problems in their
      muscles, which can be both structural and metabolic. Depending on the specific disease
      multiple symptoms may be present. All the different diseases can affect the contractility of
      the muscles. Examples of inherited muscle diseases are congenital myopathies and
      RYR1-myopathy, afflicting the muscle fiber structure. They are the first subgroups of
      inherited muscle diseases to be investigated in this study. Congenital myopathies are
      hereditary and relatively non-progressive diseases. Hypotonia is the clinical characteristic
      of congenital myopathies and is often presented already in the neonatal period. Almost all
      patients have generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia. The various subtypes of congenital
      myopathy are a broad group of disorders defined by the predominance of particular and
      specific structural abnormalities shown in muscle biopsies. Based on genetic and
      morphological features, they can be divided into four main groups; one with central cores,
      one with central nuclei, one with minicores and one with nemaline bodies. RYR1-myopathy is
      caused by a mutation in the RYR-gene. The RYR1-protein is important in the making of
      RYR1-receptors and channels responsible for the transport of calcium atoms within muscle
      cells, particularly in muscle contractions. Patients typically present with limb weakness,
      decreased fetal movement and skeletal abnormalities. About 70% of patients with malignant
      hyperthermia have a mutation in the RYR1-gene. MRI findings often include involvement of
      different muscles in the thigh and the calf.

    <time_frame>MRI scan per subject lasts approximately 60 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The MRI protocol include a whole body scan. The calf and thigh are chosen for qualitative analysis. Cross sectional area is calculated, the amount of adipose tissue is calculated, and the amount of adipose tissue is subtracted from the CSA, resulting in the CCSA.</description>
