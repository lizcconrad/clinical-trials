    <textblock>
      This registry is designed to observe the safety and effectiveness of WATCHMAN left atrial
      appendage closure technology in a Chinese population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, multi-center, single arm observational study, 413 patients with
      non-valvular atrial fibrillation intended to be implanted with a WATCHMAN device based on
      real clinical practice will be enrolled. Enrolled subjects will be followed up for 5
      years.Primary endpoints include stroke, systematic embolism, cardiovascular death, and
      procedure or device related complications, etc.
