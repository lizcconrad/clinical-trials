    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is now considered to be one of promising approaches for treating cancer.
      Radiation therapy has been to be a cornerstone treatment for unresectable advanced esophageal
      cancer. Radiation-induced mutation genes were identified as new sources of tumor associated
      antigens using exon sequencing and peptide microarray technologies. Epitope peptides for
      these targets are able to induce peptide specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). In this
      clinical trial, investigators evaluate the efficacy and safety of peptide specific CTL
      therapy in combination with radiation therapy in treating patients with unresectable,
      advanced or recurrent esophageal cancer.
