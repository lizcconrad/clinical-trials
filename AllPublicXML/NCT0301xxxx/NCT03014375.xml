      The purpose of this study is to:

      To determine the rate and routes of excretion of BIA 5-453 and the mass balance in urine and
      faeces

      Monocentre, open, non-placebo-controlled, single-group, single-dose study Safety measurements
      (12-lead ECG, vital signs, blood chemistry and haematology) will be conducted before and
      after the study, adverse events will be monitored throughout the study.

      Subjects should be hospitalized the day before the administration until 264 hours thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy Caucasian male subjects, 40-55 years of age.

          -  Sitting blood pressure and pulse rate within a clinically acceptable range for the
             purposes of the study, i.e.: BP: 100 160 mmHg systolic, 50 95 mmHg diastolic and pulse
             rate: 50 100 bpm. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after 3 minutes resting in
             a sitting position.

          -  Subject body mass index must be between 18 and 28 kg/m2

          -  Normal 12-lead ECG

          -  Ability to communicate well with the investigator and comply with the requirements of
             the entire study.

          -  The subject has given his written informed consent to participate in the study.

             drug and/or nonprescription medication within 7 days prior to the administration of
             the drug.

          -  Participation in other clinical trials during the previous month in which an
             investigational drug or a commercially available drug was tested.

             donor.

          -  Existence of any surgical or medical condition which might interfere with the
             absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug, i.e., impaired renal or
             hepatic function, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular abnormalities, chronic symptoms of
             pronounced constipation or diarrhoea or conditions associated with total or partial

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (as determined by the Principal
             Investigator) at the screening evaluation, however, liver parameters (SGPT, SGOT)
             values must be within the normal range.

          -  Positive results of the drug screening.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to BIA 5-453.

          -  Heavy smokers, i.e., more than 10 cigarettes per day

          -  Exposure to artificial ionizing radiation in the last 12 months (e.g., x-ray
             investigation)

          -  Subject who had more than 4 flights (with more than 2 hours flight time) within the
             last year prior to the administration of the drug
