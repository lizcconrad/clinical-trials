  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine whether comprehensive remote follow-up in HF patients
      with CRT will reduce the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality or worsening heart failure
      hospitalizations, whichever comes first, when compared to basic remote monitoring, over a
      27-month follow-up.
