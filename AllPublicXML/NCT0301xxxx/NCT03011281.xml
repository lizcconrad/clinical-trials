      The objectives of this single center, prospective, non-interventional inception cohort is to
      understand patient characteristics, general treatment patterns, effectiveness, and safety of
      Tofacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis patients in the real-world setting.

        1. To evaluate the baseline characteristics of Korean RA patients treated with Tofacitinib

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Tofacitinib in clinical practice in Korean
           RA patients.

        3. To further evaluate safety, effectiveness and demographic characteristics of the
           patients treated with Tofacitinib matched with and compared to biologic DMARDs from the
           BIOPSY registry database.
