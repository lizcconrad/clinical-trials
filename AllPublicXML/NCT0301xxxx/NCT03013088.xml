      This is a clinical study aimed at demonstrating the safety and product performance of the
      SoundBite Crossing System. The study shall demonstrate that the SoundBite Crossing System can
      facilitate passage of a standard guidewire through a Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) located in
      the lower extremity arteries without major adverse events related to SoundBite device
      utilization.

      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm, two-phase clinical study. This study will be conducted
      in two phases.

      The first phase will consist of ten (10) subjects enrolled and treated using the SoundBite
      Crossing System with 30 day follow-up. An analysis shall be performed after 10 subjects
      undergo treatment with the SoundBite Crossing System and complete 30 day follow-up. This
      analysis shall be utilized to provide insight into product performance and safety.

      The second phase will consist of up to forty (40) subjects enrolled and treated using the
      SoundBite Crossing System with 30 day follow-up. An analysis will be generated on this
      subject cohort after 30 day follow-up is complete.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Technical Success</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of the index procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Technical Success: the ability of the SoundBite Crossing System to facilitate crossing of a target CTO lesion, defined as: The ShockWireTM being advanced by 1cm or more into proximal aspect of target CTO lesion based on angiography; AND Either the ShockWireTM or other commercially available device (e.g. guidewire) is able to cross target CTO lesion.
Technical Success shall be assessed at the time of the index procedure after all ShockWireTM devices have been used on the target CTO lesion (if more than one ShockWireTM device was utilized to address the target CTO lesion).</description>

          5. Able and willing to provide written informed consent prior to study procedure.

          6. Evidence that the target CTO lesion is a de novo or restenotic chronic total occlusion
             in the SFA (starting at least 1cm distal to the origin of the SFA) and/or popliteal
             artery (ending at least 1cm proximal to the popliteal trifurcation), confirmed by
             angiography; AND/OR Evidence that the target CTO lesion is a de novo or restenotic
             chronic total occlusion and is located below the popliteal trifurcation in the
             anterior tibial, posterior tibial or peroneal arteries (at least 1 cm distal to the
             vessel origin, and ending at least 1cm proximal to the dorsalis pedis or plantar
