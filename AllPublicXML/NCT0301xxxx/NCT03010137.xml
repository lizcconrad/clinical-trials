  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incisional negative pressure therapy (INPWT) has previously been shown in certain patient
      populations to decrease wound healing complications, decrease the rate of hematomas and
      seromas, as well as have better scar quality. We have found a group of patients, those who
      have panniculectomies in preparation for renal transplant, with significantly higher rates of
      wound healing complications. We believe the best way to demonstrate benefits of incisional
      negative pressure wound therapy will be in this group of patients known to have significantly
      higher rates of wound complications.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients undergoing panniculectomy in preparation for renal transplantation at the
             University of California Davis Medical Center. Patients who are entered into the trial
             and have 30 days of follow up, and those in the INPWT study arm who successfully
             complete 7 days of treatment, will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients who previously demonstrated a hypersensitivity reaction to adhesives and
             qualify for panniculectomy in preparation for renal transplantation, or all patients
             who are undergoing panniculectomy for reasons other than in preparation for renal
             transplantation (i.e. after massive weight loss or for cosmetic reasons). Patients who
             do not complete the duration of treatment of negative pressure wound therapy (7 days),
             or patients who do not follow up for a minimum of 30 days from the date of surgery
             will be excluded. Adults unable to consent, infants, children, teenagers, pregnant
             patients and prisoners will be excluded. It is also extremely unlikely, based on our
             study population, that we will encounter any of these patients.
