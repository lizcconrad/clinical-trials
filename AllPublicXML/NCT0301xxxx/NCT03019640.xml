  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving immune cells
      called natural killer (NK) cells with chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant to patients
      with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Participants will receive an autologous stem cell transplant (a
      transplant of your own bone marrow or blood cells).

      Immune system cells (such as NK cells) are made by the body to attack foreign or cancerous
      cells. Researchers believe that the NK cells you receive from the donor may react against the
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells in your body, which may help to control the disease.

      The NK cells will be separated from a donor's umbilical cord blood. These separated NK cells
      will then be grown in the lab to increase the number of NK cells that can be given to you by
      vein. If certain types of unwanted T cells are growing too much, an investigational device
      called a CliniMACS system will be used to filter out the unwanted T cells using a magnet.

      This is an investigational study. The way researchers process the NK cells is
      investigational. It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      The study drugs (carmustine, cytarabine, etoposide, lenalidomide, melphalan, and rituximab)
      are FDA approved and commercial available. Their use to prepare your body before an NK cell
      infusion is investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how the study therapy is designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Chemotherapy, NK, and Stem Cell Infusions:

      In a stem cell transplant, the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus days.
      The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after you receive the stem cells
      are called plus days.

      If you agree to take part in this study, on Day -13, you will receive rituximab by vein over
      about 3 hours, if you are receiving it. This will depend on the disease that you have. You
      will then be admitted to the hospital and will receive hydration fluids by vein.

      On Day -12, you will receive carmustine by vein over about 2 hours.

      On Days -11 through -8, you will receive etoposide by vein over about 3 hours and cytarabine
      by vein over 1 hour.

      On Day -7, you will receive melphalan by vein over about 30 minutes. You will receive
      rituximab by vein over about 3 hours, if you are receiving it.

      On Days -7 through -2 you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time a day. You should swallow
      lenalidomide capsules whole with water at the same time each day. Do not break, chew, or open
      the capsules.

      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you
      miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day. Do
      not take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose. If you take more than the
      prescribed dose of lenalidomide, you should seek emergency medical care if needed and contact
      study staff right away.

      On Day -5, you will receive the NK cells by vein over about 1 hour.

      On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein over about 30-60 minutes.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive filgrastim (G-CSF) through a needle under the skin 1
      time a day every day until your white blood cell count begins to recover. Filgrastim is
      designed to help cells in the bone marrow to multiply, which helps to raise white blood cell
      counts more quickly, lower fever, and decrease the risk of infection.

      You will receive standard antibiotics to help lower the risk of infection. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Visits:

      Before you start treatment, the following tests/procedures will be performed if they were not
      done within the last 30 days:

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the status of the disease and to
           check for infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis. Within 10-14 days before
           lenalidomide is prescribed, and again within 24 hours before lenalidomide is prescribed,
           you will have a blood pregnancy test if you can become pregnant. These blood tests will
           be part of a routine blood draw. You must fill the lenalidomide prescription within 7
           days after it is prescribed. To take part in this study, you cannot be pregnant.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an EKG and either an echocardiogram (ECHO) or a MUGA scan to check your
           heart function.

        -  You will have chest x-rays and a PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. If your
           doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have MRIs of your brain.

        -  You will have lung function tests.

        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to
           check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspiration, an area of the hip
           or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone and bone marrow is
           withdrawn through a large needle.

      Up to twice a week from Day -4 to Day +7, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check
      for donor NK cells, if you are one of the first 12 participants enrolled in this study. If
      donor NK cells are found, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn 1 time each week until
      around Day +30 (+/-3 days). From 30 to about 100 days after the stem cell transplant, this
      blood will be drawn only if you had NK cells in your blood at the last blood draw and you are
      having a routine follow-up visit.

      At each visit after the NK cell infusion on Day -5, or as often as your study doctor thinks
      it is needed, you will be checked for possible reactions to the transplant and study drugs,
      including graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a condition in which transplanted tissue
      attacks the transplant recipient's body. Graft failure occurs when transplanted stem cells
      may not be able to grow and multiply in your body. If this happens, there will be a high risk
      of infections and/or bleeding. If the number of white blood cells does not get back to high
      enough levels within 3 weeks after the transplant, more stem cells may need to be given. The
      study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      About 28 days after your last lenalidomide dose, if you can become pregnant, you will have a
      pregnancy test. This blood test will be part of a blood draw as part of your standard care.

      At about 30, 100, and 180 days after the stem cell transplant:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have PET/CT and/or CT scans to check the status of the disease.

        -  If your study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspiration and
           biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      As often as the doctor thinks is needed through Day 100, blood (about 4 teaspoons) and/or
      urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Length of Study:

      You will remain in this study for 180 days after the stem cell transplant. Your participation
      on this study will be over when you have completed the long-term follow-up visits.

      You may not be treated on study if the disease gets worse, if you have any infections, if
      intolerable side effects occur, if you are not able to receive the stem cell transplant, if
      you need medical treatment not allowed in this study, if the study doctor decides it is in
      your best interest, or if you are unable to follow study directions.
