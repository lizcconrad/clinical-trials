  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial with a main goal to assess the effects of a
      locally-prepared food for prevention of malnutrition and stunting, in comparison with
      standard village practices and also a widely available aid food supplement in 8-12 villages
      in Guinea-Bissau. The supplement intervention will be for 24-30 weeks. The primary outcome
      will be cognitive tests of executive function. Secondary outcomes will be changes in standard
      anthropometric benchmarks of growth, hemoglobin and skin carotenoids in young children living
      in villages in rural Guinea-Bissau. This is a within-village randomization at the level of
      the family, and all children will receive a dietary intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 1050 children aged 15 months to 6.99 years, and older children if they are in 1st grade
      elementary school, in 8-12 villages in the Oio and Cachau regions of Guinea-Bissau will be
      recruited for this study along with their maternal caregiver and father. Child ages will be
      based on the official birth records which families possess. The mothers/primary caregivers
      and fathers of the children will also be recruited for simple outcome assessments. Villages
      will be a convenience sample chosen from villages within the network of our local research
      partner International Partnership for Human Development. Each village in this region has one
      school and one community health center per village, which will be involved in supplement
      distribution and some outcome assessments.

      Families with enrolling children will be randomized within 8-12 villages to receive 1 of 3
      supplements and if any family (defined based on the father of the children since this is a
      polygamous community) has more than one enrolling child all those children will be randomized
      to the same supplement arm.

        -  One supplement will be the locally-prepared bar

        -  One will be an isocaloric amount of porridge prepared with USAIDs Corn Soy Blend Plus,
           prepared as recommended in a 10:3 ratio with fortified vegetable oil.

        -  One supplement will be an isocaloric amount of cooked rice with vegetable oil, which is
           the typical local breakfast.

      Villagers will be informed of the randomization after baseline testing is complete.

      Following baseline measurements in children of anthropometry and body composition, grip
      strength, cognition, hemoglobin, and skin carotenoids, children will receive their
      intervention for 24-30 weeks and the same measurements taken at baseline will be repeated
      during the last study week. The flexible end data is given to accommodate the local rainy
      season and its impact on transportation. Please note that cell phone access to villages is
      not influenced by local weather, thus communication regarding safety issues with community
      health workers will remain possible throughout the entire trial.

    <description>The bar is similar to one tested recently in a pilot study and is a locally prepared bar designed to facilitate growth and cognitive development. It will provide 300 kcal/day and will have ≈20-30% of energy from protein (of which 25-50% is from an animal protein source), 20-35% from total carbohydrate and ≈40-60% from fat. The bar will be fortified with vitamins and minerals to meet USAID recommendations for moderate malnutrition and Dietary Reference Intake recommendations for at-risk and healthy children of the ages studied, and at the same time will not exceed Upper Level nutrient recommendations for any micronutrient. Ingredients in the bar will be a combination of local products and imported shelf-stable ingredients.</description>

    <description>The placebo condition will be 300 kcal/day of locally-purchased rice cooked with a small amount of oil (10:2 ratio), which mimics the usual breakfast of children in this region. The community health workers or other designated villagers will prepare the rice freshly each intervention day using locally accepted standards for hygiene, and a quality control process for ratios of ingredients assigned by the research team to ensure consistent composition.</description>
