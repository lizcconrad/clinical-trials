  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) experience distressing activity-related
      respiratory discomfort which is challenging to manage therapeutically. Interventions such as
      pulmonary rehabilitation, collaborative self-management, supplemental oxygen therapy and oral
      opiate medications, are variably effective and therapeutic responses to each in individual
      patients are difficult to predict. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the acute effects
      of inhaled opiate therapy (fentanyl citrate) on breathing discomfort (dyspnea) in individuals
      with mild-to-moderate IPF, as well as examine the potential mechanisms of dyspnea relief.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with opioids can improve activity related dyspnea by reducing central respiratory
      neural drive. Inhaled fentanyl citrate is an opioid that is generally well tolerated and has
      been shown to effectively relieve respiratory discomfort without causing systemic
      side-effects, although its mechanism of action are poorly understood. Based on the current
      evidence, non-sedating, rapidly active inhaled fentanyl represents a possible alternative and
      effective treatment of severe dyspnea in patients with IPF who require urgent treatment. As
      such, the primary objective of this study is to examine the acute effects of nebulized
      fentanyl on dyspnea intensity and quality in patients with mild-to-moderate IPF, as well as
      examine the neurophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea relief during fentanyl inhalation. It is
      believed that fentanyl when compared with placebo, will reduce inspiratory neural drive to
      the diaphragm and breathing frequency, resulting in improvements in dyspnea intensity during
      physical exertion. Alternatively, dyspnea relief after inhaled fentanyl may be independent of
      changes in neural drive, and instead linked to the presence of opioid receptors in the lungs
      that modulate afferent inputs to the brain, thereby favourably influencing perceived dyspnea.

    <description>The 10-point Borg scale ranges from 0 &quot;nothing at all&quot; to 10 &quot;maximal/extremely strong&quot; and will be used to rate the intensity of dyspnea during exercise: a decrease in this rating signifies an improvement.
