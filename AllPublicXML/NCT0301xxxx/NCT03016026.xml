  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of enhanced recovery after surgery(ERAS) on
      laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer.All of participants received an ERAS
      program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative education about ERAS program is administered in the ward after admission by a
      specific team. Breathing training and atomizing during the time of preoperative preparation
      is performed during hospitalization (5-7 days). Patients are allowed to eat a normal diet and
      intake of 1000 ml 10% carbohydrate drink 10 hours before surgery and oral 500ml 10%
      carbohydrate drink 2 hours before the induction of anesthesia. Mechanical bowel preparation
      is not recommended as routine procedure.

      The intravenous fluid therapy is restricted. Urinary catheters are routinely placed after
      anesthesia. In principle, drainage and nasogastric tube are not placed (except the concerns
      of surgical safety). Surgical site infiltration is implemented.All patients undergo
      laparoscopic distal gastrectomy.

      Urinary catheters are routinely removed within 24 hours after operation. An optimal
      management of acute postoperative pain is multimodal analgesia consists of surgical site
      infiltration, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for postoperative three days (POD) and
      epidural analgesia. Adjunctive analgesia with acetaminophen is used after the resumption of
      oral intake until adequate pain relief. Patients were encouraged to move from POD 1. The
      patients are encouraged to a full fluid diet on POD 2. Adhere to the premise of eating little
      and often daily increase, then to semi-fluids to soft diet. A normal diet is often started on
      POD 4. Abdominal drains are routinely removed within 72 hours after operation.
