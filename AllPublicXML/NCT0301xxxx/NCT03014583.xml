  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Back and/or Leg Pain (CBLP) after spinal surgical procedures, a condition commonly
      labelled Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS), affects between 15% and 40% of patients after a
      spine surgery. Treatment of this chronic condition by further operation or medical management
      has a heavy financial impact on health care systems.

      Many studies have demonstrated the efficacy and economic value of Spinal Cord Stimulation
      (SCS) for chronic neuropathic pain, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown SCS to
      be a clinically effective adjunct to medical management. SCS has the advantages of being
      reversible and less invasive than surgery and may cause fewer issues over time than long-term
      pharmacological treatments.

      Despite variable levels of success in the literature, approximately 30-55% of the patients
      treated with traditional SCS for neuropathic pain disorders will not receive adequate long
      term pain relief. Therefore, technical SCS system refinements, as well as new techniques have
      emerged.

      Two new stimulation waveforms based on traditional SCS technology have appeared to further
      optimize the outcome for specific painful conditions;

        -  Burst stimulation mode: which generates constant-current stimuli with 5 spikes at 500 Hz
           per burst and pulse width and interspike intervals of 1 ms.

        -  High-frequency stimulation (from 1 to 10 kHz) mode.

      Several studies have demonstrated the potential interest of these 2 new waveforms to treat
      FBSS patients compared to traditional SCS.

      The Precision Spectra™ system allows MultiWave Technology by offering a broad spectrum of
      waveform options (from Tonic Conventional Stimulation (TCS), BURST stimulation to High
      Frequency stimulation (HF)).

      To date, literature data comparing these 3 stimulation patterns is lacking but it is
      suggested the pain relief in some of non-responsive patients can be &quot;recaptured&quot; by
      increasing the SCS frequency to 500 Hz by BURST stimulation or beyond by HF stimulation. It
      seems important to conduct RCT in crossover, thanks to the new Precision SCS Stimulator, to
      compare the effects of these 3 different SCS modalities in FBSS patients and to determine
      which concept is the most effective in terms of pain reduction and energy consumption.
