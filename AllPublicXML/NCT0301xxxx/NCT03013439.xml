      IDA is highly prevalent in subjects with cancer and gastrointestinal diseases such as
      inflammatory bowel diseases, menstruating or pregnant women, and subjects who have undergone
      bariatric procedure. IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on
      the subjects, and treatment of these subjects includes controlling the bleeding and
      replenishing lost iron.
