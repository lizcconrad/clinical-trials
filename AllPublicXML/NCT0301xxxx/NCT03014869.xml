  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For moderate AECOPD(pH&lt;7.35), several guidelines have strongly recommended NPPV as standard
      therapy, which can reduce the rate of intubation and mortality. A few previous studies have
      shown that HFNC can efficiently improve alveoli ventilation and breathing pattern in some
      severe AECOPD patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that HFNC is not inferior to NPPV for
      preventing endotracheal intubation in moderate AECOPD patients. To assess this hypothesis, we
      performed a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial of HFNV vs NPPV in moderate AECOPD
      patients.

    <textblock>
      Recently, many clinical studies have showed that HFNC can be successfully used in patients
      with hypoxemic respiratory failure to improve the comfort, to attenuate respiratory failure
      and to decrease the rate of tracheal intubation and mortality. Although theoretically HFNC is
      a potential and ideal treatment for AECOPD patients, the related clinical researches are very
      few. It still needs to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of HFNC in patients with
      AECOPD. For moderate AECOPD(pH&lt;7.35), several guidelines have strongly recommended NPPV as
      standard therapy, which can reduce the rate of intubation and mortality. A few previous
      studies have shown that HFNC can efficiently improve alveoli ventilation and breathing
      pattern in some severe AECOPD patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that HFNC is not inferior
      to NPPV for preventing endotracheal intubation in moderate AECOPD patients. To assess this
      hypothesis, we performed a multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial of HFNV vs NPPV in
      moderate AECOPD patients.

    <description>High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a new emerging noninvasive respiratory support technology, which mainly includes high flow (15-60 L/min) device, heating humidification device and nasal cannula for high flow. A large number of physiological studies confirmed that HFNC has the following critical physiological effects: promoting airway humidification, improving tolerance of treatment, reducing the physiological dead space on the upper respiratory tract, producing a certain level of positive end expiratory pressure (2-7 cmH2O), decreasing the work of breathing and so on.</description>
