      This study includes screening (Days -16 to -3), check-in (Day -2), enrollment (Day -1),
      dosing (Day 1), observational period (Days 2 to 3), discharge day (Day 4), and safety
      follow-up visit (Day 8). Forty eligible subjects will be enrolled into 4 dose cohorts (10 for
      each cohort), and every 10 subjects will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive a single
      dose of either SHR4640 (n=8) or placebo (n=2).

        week of Day 1. 3) Use of any over the-counter, nutraceuticals, or prescription medications
        that might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of SHR4640
        (proton-pump inhibitor, fluconazole, indomethacin, ranitidine, flurbiprofen, probenecid,
        aprepitant, etc.) within 1 month of Day 1.

        18. Received the last dose of a study drug (or treatment with a medical device) within 30
        days or 5 T1/2 (whichever is longer) of the study drug of Day 1 or are currently
        participating in another study of a study drug (or medical device).

        19. Any other medical or psychological condition, which in the opinion of the Investigator,
