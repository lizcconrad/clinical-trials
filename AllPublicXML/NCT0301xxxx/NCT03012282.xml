  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well computed tomography (CT) perfusion images work in
      assessing treatment response in patients with pancreatic cancer. Analyzing specific
      measurements on the CT perfusion images may help doctors better determine how a tumor
      responds to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and may help guide treatment for patients
      with pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop, test, and refine a CT perfusion protocol for its feasibility, reproducibility,
      and quality with a limited number of patients with a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).

      II. To analyze preliminary date regarding perfusion parameters that improve accuracy in
      predicting response and resectability for a subset of patients with locally advanced (LA) and
      borderline resectable (BR) PDA treated with neoadjuvant therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo CT perfusion sequence over 30 seconds during the baseline standard of care
      CT scan and during follow-up CT scans at 2 and possibly 4 months after chemotherapy, at 4-6
      weeks after radiation therapy, or prior to definitive surgery.

      After completion of the study, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
