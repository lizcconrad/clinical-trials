  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if cannabidiol is safe and effective at different
      doses as an additional treatment for pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy. Pure cannabidiol has
      potentially therapeutic properties, such as anti-convulsant effects, that may reduce seizure
      frequency. There are only a few open label studies that have demonstrated the safety and
      tolerance of cannabiodiol in both adult and pediatric epileptic populations--these studies
      were performed either retrospectively or with varying cannabidiol preparations. There are no
      well-documented studies and completely analyzed data for pediatric epileptic patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             (at time informed consent form is signed)

          2. Documentation of a diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy as proven by and documented
             with medical records and/or the following clinical features (must have all 3 of the
             following):

               1. Failure to control seizures despite appropriate trial of 3 or more AEDs at
                  therapeutic doses

               2. An intractable childhood epilepsy including, Dravet Syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut
                  Syndrome

               3. Must report at least 3 countable (non-countable seizures includes absence and
                  myoclonic) seizures per month

          3. Between 1-3 baseline AEDs . Vagus nerve stimulator (VNS), ketogenic diet, and modified
             Atkins diet do not count towards this limit.

          4. VNS must be on stable settings for a minimum of 3 months.

          5. If on the ketogenic diet, must be on stable ratio for a minimum of 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Epilepsies associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including neuronal
             ceroidolipofuscinosis, progressive myoclonus epilepsies, Rasmussen encephalitis, and
             tumors

          2. Epilepsies associated with an inborn error of metabolism, including mitochondrial
             disorders

          3. Felbatol initiated within the past 12 months

          4. Use of any Cannabis-related product (including hemp oil) in the past 12 months as
             assessed by parental questioning.

          5. Laboratory values on comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and complete blood count
             (CBC) testing that are Class 3 or higher according to the CTCAE v4.0.

          6. Positive pregnancy test.
