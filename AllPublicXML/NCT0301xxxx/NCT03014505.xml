  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imbalance of gut bacteria is suspected to play a key role driving the progression of
      cirrhosis and there is hope manipulation of these bacteria may be beneficial. This study will
      determine if fecal microbiota transplantation is an effective and safe treatment for
      decompensated cirrhosis.

    <textblock>
      Two groups of inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis will be randomized using random
      sequence generator into experimental and control groups. Two groups will given traditional
      treatments and experimental group will added treatment with fecal microbiota transplantation
      via endoscope and/or cenema.The liver function parameters, adverse events complication,
      systemic inflammatory markers, Intestinal mucosa structure, permeability changes in the
      intestinal mucosal barrier, Microbiota composition will be assessed and thereafter at 1 month
      and 3 months &amp; subjects will be clinically assessed for improvement or worsening.
