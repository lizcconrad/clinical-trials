  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The toxicity of traditional prostate cancer therapies including radical surgery and external
      beam radiation is well known. This has prompted a move towards focal therapy where only the
      cancerous part of the prostate is treated.

      To date, studies have demonstrated very promising outcomes following focal therapy with the
      majority of men maintaining their urinary and sexual function after therapy.

      In a small proportion of men, disease recurs after focal therapy. The optimal treatment for
      men with recurrent disease after focal therapy is yet to be defined. Patients may undergo
      further focal therapy to the recurrent disease, undergo radiation therapy, whole-gland
      therapy using a minimally invasive approach such as High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)
      or cryotherapy. Alternatively patients may undergo radical surgery where the whole prostate
      is removed.

      To date, the side-effects or toxicity of any treatment for recurrent prostate cancer after
      focal therapy has not been formally studied.

      Traditionally, the side effects of surgery and radiation therapy performed in patients that
      have already undergone previous prostate cancer treatment have been considerable with high
      rates of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. However, as focal therapy leaves a
      significant area of the prostate untreated, the investigators believe surgery after focal
      prostate therapy will be associated with a much lower incidence of urinary and sexual
      dysfunction.

      The aim of the RAFT study is to characterise the side effects of prostate cancer surgery in
      men that have undergone prior focal ablation therapy. In addition, the investigators wish to
      perform a number of basic science studies to attempt to better understand why the patient has
      experienced recurrent prostate cancer after focal therapy.
