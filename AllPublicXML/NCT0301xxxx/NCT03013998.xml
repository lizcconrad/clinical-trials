  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This screening and multi-sub-study Phase 1b/2 trial will establish a method for genomic
      screening followed by assigning and accruing simultaneously to a multi-study &quot;Master Protocol
      (BAML-16-001-M1).&quot; The specific subtype of acute myeloid leukemia will determine which
      sub-study, within this protocol, a participant will be assigned to evaluate investigational
      therapies or combinations with the ultimate goal of advancing new targeted therapies for
      approval. The study also includes a marker negative sub-study which will include all screened
      patients not eligible for any of the biomarker-driven sub-studies.

    <description>This is a phase 2 clinical trial to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a stepwise approach to the treatment of IDH2-mutant AML. On day 1 of the trial, all enrolled participants will be initiated on therapy with the IDH2 inhibitor AG-221 for IDH2 R140 and R172-mutant patients. The dosing will be based on phase 1 experience of AG-221, which has established 100 mg daily as a safe and tolerated dose, with preliminary suggestion of efficacy. These will be administered continuously in 28 day cycles. Hydroxyurea will be allowed for the purposes of cytoreduction.</description>

    <description>The study is an open-label phase 2 study of entospletinib in older AML patients with NPM1+/FLT3ITD- AML. It includes 2 Cohorts: patients 1) age &lt;75 years; 2) have ECOG performance status of 0-1, and 3) are willing to receive 7 + 3 intensive chemotherapy (Cohort A); and patients who do not meet criteria for Cohort A (Cohort B). In Cohort A, entospletinib lead-in is administered on days 1-5 as a single agent (Cycle 0) and is then given daily with IV daunorubicin (days 1-3 for Cycle 1) and cytarabine (days 1-7 for Cycle 1). If a second induction is required, it is given with IV daunorubicin (days 1-2 for Cycle 2) and cytarabine (days 1-5 for Cycle 2). In Cohort B, for subjects receiving monotherapy, entospletinib is given daily for every 28 day cycle until the subject meets criteria for treatment discontinuation; for subjects receiving combination therapy, entospletinib is administered daily on days 1-28 as a single agent (Cycle 1) with azacitidine on days 1-7 of subsequent 28 day cycles</description>

    <description>This is an open-label phase 2 clinical trial of a stepwise approach to the treatment of patients with TP53 mutation AML. On day 1, all enrolled participants will be initiated on therapy with pevonedistat (20 mg/m2) day 1, 3 and 5 together with azacitidine (75 mg/m2 days 1-7 or day 1-5 then day 8, 9) every 28 days. During cycle 1, patients with rapidly progressive disease or severe organ dysfunction, not correctable by hydroxyurea cytoreduction will not be eligible to continue. Those patients who achieved a response, defined as complete response or complete response with incomplete blood count recovery, by the end of cycle 4 will continue on pevonedistat and azacitidine until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 12 cycles of therapy. After 12 months of combined therapy, pevonedistat will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 2 years of total therapy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults, age 60 years or older at the time of diagnosis

          -  Subjects or their legal representative must be able to understand and provide written
             informed consent

          -  Cohort Inclusion Criteria - Group A: Subjects must have previously untreated acute
             myeloid leukemia (AML) according to the WHO classification with no prior treatment
             other than hydroxyurea. Prior therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
             myeloproliferative syndromes (MPD), or aplastic anemia is permitted but not with
             hypomethylating agents.

          -  Cohort Inclusion Criteria - Group B: Subjects must have relapsed or refractory AML
             according to the WHO classification. For study purposes, refractory AML is defined as
             failure to ever achieve CR or recurrence of AML within 6 months of achieving CR;
             relapsed AML is defined as all others with disease after prior remission. (Group B is
             not currently recruiting. Expected to begin recruiting in 3rd quarter 2017.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Isolated myeloid sarcoma (meaning, patients must have blood or marrow involvement with
             AML to enter the study)

          -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia

          -  Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement by AML

          -  Signs of leukostasis requiring urgent therapy

          -  Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with active bleeding or signs of thrombosis

          -  Patients with psychological, familial, social, or geographic factors that otherwise
             preclude them from giving informed consent, following the protocol, or potentially
             hamper compliance with study treatment and follow-up

          -  Any other significant medical condition, including psychiatric illness or laboratory
             abnormality, that would preclude the patient participating in the trial or would
             confound the interpretation of the results of the trial
