  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the incidence of Hepatitis B has been decreased a lot recently years, there are
      still quite a few chronic hepatitis B patients in China. The anti-virus drugs of western
      medicine such as Entecavir and Tenofovir have been proved effective on decreasing the serum
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) level, on the other hand, Chinese materia medica showed effective on
      TCM syndromes of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) such as hypochondriac pain, jaundice and abdominal
      mass. Besides, the hepatic fibrosis could be delayed after the appropriate treatment of TCM.
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, open label, parallel group clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of two different traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbal treatment on
      chronic hepatitis B.
