    <textblock>
      Curing HCV in Incarcerated Patients (CHIP) is a 1-year demonstration project that will assess
      the feasibility of a HCV treatment program in the San Francisco City &amp; County Jail. The Jail
      Health Services will treat 100 patients using the FDA approved combination treatment,
      sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, Epclusa® and will continue their treatment during incarceration and
      after their release (if applicable).

      Curing HCV in Incarcerated Patients (CHIP) is a 1-year demonstration project that will be
      conducted in the San Francisco County Jails. Jail settings can provide an optimal opportunity
      to screen for HCV, initiate curative treatment, and link patients to community HCV providers
      to complete their treatment. This demonstration project will be funded by the Gilead's
      Investigator Sponsored Research. The purpose is to assess the feasibility of treating inmates
      with the FDA approved combination oral treatment, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, Epclusa®. The San
      Francisco Department of Public Health's Jail Health Services will treat 100 patients.
      Intensive patient navigators will be an essential component for treatment to ensure
      medication adherence and achieve SVR for those who are discharged from jail prior to HCV
      treatment completion. Navigators will provide short-term case management services by linking
      patients to medical and social support services. This demonstration project will be
      facilitated by the Jail Health Services' HIV &amp; Integrated Services (formerly Forensic AIDS
      Project).
