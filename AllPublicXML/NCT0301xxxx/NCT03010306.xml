    <textblock>
      Building on an intervention for early child development from the SPARK Center in Boston,
      Socios En Salud (SES) pilot tested &quot;CASITA&quot; a community-based package to screen and treat
      young children (ages 1-3 years of age) diagnosed with neurodevelopment risk and delay in
      Carabayllo, Lima, Peru. Ministry of Health CHWs identified children with developmental delays
      within the clinics and community and delivered a structured early intervention that included
      parent coaching and social support. In order to test the hypothesis that CASITA improves
      early child development, caregiver, and home environment, dyads received either nutrition
      supplements alone, nutrition + &quot;CASITA&quot; early child development sessions individually, or
      CASITA in a group of 10 dyads.

    <description>The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) is an internationally-validated instrument that can be used to assess change in developmental risk over time. Fernald et al incorporated additional observation-based assessments and the following modifications: 1) addition of child observation exercises to allow for validity check of parent responses (original ASQ questions), and 2) the incorporation of ASQ questions from the next highest age range. The Extended Ages and Stages Questionnaire (EASQ) was utilized as an assessment tool to allow us to better quantify degree of risk at baseline (based on quintiles of scores). By incorporating ASQ questions from the next two highest age ranges, scores will be continuous across the study period of three. The EASQ has been applied to children in four countries, including 2,845 children in Peru.</description>

    <measure>Change in HOME subscore of parent responsivity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This HOME subscore is defined in the manual as &quot;the extent to which the parent responds to the child's behavior including reinforcement for desired behavior and communication through words and actions&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in HOME subscore of parent involvement</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This HOME subscore is defined as &quot;parental acceptance of the child's behavior that is less than optimal and examines avoidance of undue restriction and punishment&quot;.</description>

    <description>Monthly food baskets were provided to the nutrition only group. Food baskets included basic foods to sustain a family of three over one month's time, such as rice and evaporated milk. Food baskets were valued at approximately $28 US Dollars per basket.</description>

    <description>The CASITA intervention was given by a community health worker (CHW) and involves individual and group modalities. HOME-CASITA took place at the dyad's place of residence, and the GROUP-CASITA at a local community center. All CASITA participants received 12 weekly sessions over 3 months. Interventions retain core elements of the SPARK approach: coaching parents on child development stimulation and providing social support and encouragement. Each session is as follows: 1) Child observation &amp; knowledge sharing about child development; 2) Practice of reciprocal attention focusing and social interaction activities; 3) Parent encouragement on behavior and developmental interactions; and 4) Parent social support through referral assistance, reassurance, and validation of parent's concerns.</description>
