    <textblock>
      This I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when given together
      with nivolumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin
      lymphoma that has come back and does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving nivolumab and lenalidomide may work better in treating patients with
      non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab
      in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). (Phase I) II. To determine
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of
      lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL. (Phase I) III. To
      evaluate the feasibility and toxicities of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in
      patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin's disease (HD). (Phase IB) IV. To evaluate the
      efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in terms of overall response rate
      in patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma (DLBCL). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with
      relapsed/refractory NHL in terms of overall response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR),
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase I) II. To evaluate the
      efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with
      relapsed/refractory HD in terms of complete response rate (CR). (Phase IB) III. To evaluate
      the efficacy of the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with
      relapsed/refractory HD in terms of duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase IB) IV. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination
      of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL and DLBCL in terms of
      duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase
      II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the relationship between prognostic parameters including ki-67 staining, PD-1
      staining and cell of origin (activated B-cell or ABC versus germinal center B-cell or GCB)
      with ORR to the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with
      relapsed/refractory NHL. (Phase I) II. To evaluate and monitor effects on B-, T-, and natural
      killer (NK)-cell function with the combination of lenalidomide and nivolumab in patients with
      relapsed/refractory NHL. (Phase I) III. To explore the relationship between prognostic
      parameters including ki-67 staining, PD-1 staining and cell of origin (activated B-cell or
      ABC versus germinal center B-cell or GCB) with ORR to the combination of lenalidomide and
      nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL and DLBCL. (Phase II) IV. To evaluate and
      monitor effects on B-, T-, and NK-cell function with the combination of lenalidomide and
      nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory FL and DLBCL. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over
      60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of courses 1-4 and on day 1 of courses 5-12. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      then every 6 months for up to 3 years.
