  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the growing public awareness and recent progress in multimodality therapy to the
      colorectal cancer (CRC), CRC still ranks high on the list of the most common and deadly
      cancers in Taiwan. The cause of CRC mortality is due mainly to the occurrence of distant
      metastasis. Several reports suggested that circulating tumor cells (CTCs) highly associated
      with metastasis suggesting that targeting CTCs may offer an unprecedented opportunity to
      prevent the development of metastasis. Early detection and characterization of CTCs is
      therefore important as a potential strategy to monitor the progression of CRC. The current
      proposal is focused on detecting CTCs from peripheral blood of CRC patients using Miselect R
      system. We will monitor the amount of CTCs and correlate with CRC progression and prognosis.
