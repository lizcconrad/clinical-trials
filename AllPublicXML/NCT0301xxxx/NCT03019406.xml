      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the safety profile of neoGAA in patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease
      (IOPD) previously treated with alglucosidase alfa.

      Secondary Objective:

      To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of neoGAA and to evaluate the preliminary
      efficacy of neoGAA in comparison to alglucosidase alfa.

    <textblock>
      The duration of the study per patient will be up to 3 years that will consist of a 14-day
      screening period, a 25-week treatment period, a 120-week extension period, and a 4-week
      post-treatment observation period.

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  The patient has confirmed GAA enzyme deficiency from any tissue source.

          -  The patient who has reached legal age of majority as defined by local regulation, or
             the patient's legal guardian(s) must provide signed informed consent prior to
             performing any study-related procedures. If the patient is legally minor per local
             regulations, assent shall be obtained from patients, if applicable.

          -  The patient (and patient's legal guardian if patient is legally minor as defined by
             local regulation) must have the ability to comply with the clinical protocol.

          -  The patient is &lt;18 years old.

          -  The patient, if female and of childbearing potential, must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) and must not be breastfeeding at
             screening/baseline.

          -  The patient has cardiomyopathy at the time of diagnosis: ie, left ventricular mass
             index (LVMI) equivalent to mean age specific LVMI plus 2 standard deviations.

          -  The patient has been receiving a stable dose of alglucosidase alfa regularly for a
             minimum of 6 months immediately prior to study entry.

          -  For participants in Stage 1: The patient has documented evidence of clinical decline
             in at least 1 of the following parameters related to Pompe Disease and NOT related to
             intercurrent illness as assessed by the Investigator: respiratory function, motor
             skills, and/or cardiac parameters.

          -  For participants in Stage 2: The patient has documented evidence of suboptimal
             clinical response in at least 1 of the following parameters related to Pompe Disease
             and NOT related to intercurrent illness as assessed by the Investigator: respiratory
             function, motor skills, and/or new onset of ptosis.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  The patient has high antibody titer to alglucosidase alfa.

          -  The patient has a high risk for a severe allergic reaction to neoGAA.

          -  The patient requires any prohibited concomitant medications (e.g., immune modulatory
             treatment or beta-blockers) for the duration of the study.

          -  The patient has previously participated in any ACT14132 study cohort.

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential not protected by highly effective
             contraceptive method of birth control and/or who is unwilling or unable to be tested
             for pregnancy

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
