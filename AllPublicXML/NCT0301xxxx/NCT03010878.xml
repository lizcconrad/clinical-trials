  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized control trial of a yoga and self-management intervention for
      individuals with chronic pain. Participants were assigned to either a wait-list control group
      (self-management only), or a yoga intervention (self-management and yoga). Self-management
      education session occurred monthly within the community. Group yoga intervention was
      delivered two times a week with a specifically designed program that was progressively more
      difficult. Assessments were then administered pre and post intervention, and a
      semi-structured interview was completed following the intervention. Quantitative and
      qualitative data were then compared between groups.

      This was a randomized control trial completed with two specific aims.

      Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of completing a group yoga intervention in conjunction with
      an ongoing self-management education for people with chronic pain.

      Aim 2: To explore the preliminary efficacy of a group yoga intervention in people with
      chronic pain. The key variables of interest were pain interference, functional performance,
      balance, strength, mobility, and quality of life (QoL)
