    <textblock>
      This study utilizes multimodal brain imaging to obtain quantitative biomarkers of brain
      injury and to improve understanding of the biological basis of brain pathology in adolescents
      with concussion. Adolescents with a concussion will undergo neuroimaging and neuropsychology
      assessments acutely and four months after injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concussion is a highly prevalent condition in adolescence, but it remains a clinical
      diagnosis that largely relies on subjective patient report with no reliable objective
      biomarkers for diagnosis. Traditional clinical brain imaging has not been found useful for
      concussion as the pathology is generally not visible on conventional acute MRI or CT. The
      proposed study addresses this gap in concussion diagnosis and management by examining the
      sensitivity of magnetoencephalography (MEG) for identifying areas of brain injury through
      detection of abnormal neural activity (slowing) in adolescents with concussion compared to
      healthy controls. Adolescents with a concussion will complete neuroimaging (MEG and MRI) and
      neuropsychology assessments at two time points within ten days and then again 4 months
      post-injury. Healthy controls will complete neuroimaging and neuropsychology assessments at a
      single time point.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Whole-brain, resting-state slow-wave maps of whole brain activity will be obtained from the MEG imaging in both adolescents with a concussion and healthy controls. Control images will be analyzed to determine a whole brain z-score value that includes typically developing controls below the 95th percentile, the z-score threshold for this group). Z-score images for the adolescents with concussion will be obtained and the number of adolescents with concussion above this z-score threshold will be determined, and compared to the healthy controls. The sensitivity and specificity of this method determined.</description>

    <description>MRI diffusion data will be collected to examine associations between abnormal brain slowing and white matter damage in the adolescents with a concussion versus controls.
