  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction affects up to 50% of medical and surgical critically ill
      children. GI dysfunction, specifically gastric dysmotility and loss of epithelial barrier
      integrity, is associated with significant morbidity in critical illness. The mechanisms
      underlying GI dysfunction in critical illness are not well understood. GI dysfunction in
      surgery and critical illness has been associated with inflammation. There is evidence to
      suggest the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) is a link between inflammation and GI
      dysfunction. PAR2 is a G-coupled receptor present throughout the GI tract. PAR2 mediates GI
      motility and epithelial barrier integrity. PAR2 is activated by PAR2 agonists, specifically
      GI serine proteases and zonulin, released under conditions of inflammation. In this study the
      investigators will examine the relationship between inflammation and PAR2 activation by PAR2
      agonists and subsequent GI dysfunction in pediatric critically ill surgical patients. The
      overall hypothesis of this study is that PAR2 activation by PAR2 agonists, GI serine
      proteases and zonulin, released due to inflammation results in gastric dysmotility and loss
      of epithelial barrier integrity. In this study, the investigators will examine whether PAR2
      agonist expression is increased and correlates with GI dysfunction in critically ill surgical
      pediatric patients. This proposal fills a knowledge gap in the understanding of mechanisms
      for GI dysfunction in critical illness, and will be applicable to all surgical and medical
      critically ill children.

      The investigators in this study aim to examine a plausible mechanism by which
      gastrointestinal dysfunction, gastric dysmotility and loss of epithelial barrier integrity,
      occur in critical illness. Specifically, the investigators will examine whether an increase
      in PAR2 agonist levels, zonulin and serine proteases, are associated with gastric dysmotility
      and loss of epithelial barrier integrity in critical surgical illness in children. The
      investigators will examine GI function, gastric motility and epithelial barrier integrity,
      and PAR2 agonist levels, zonulin and serine protease, in participants before surgery and
      after surgery. Specifically, children undergoing posterior spinal fusion, a known significant
      inflammatory trigger, and with planned admissions to the intensive care unit will be
      enrolled. Gastrointestinal function and PAR2 agonist levels will be tested non-invasively in
      blood and stool.
