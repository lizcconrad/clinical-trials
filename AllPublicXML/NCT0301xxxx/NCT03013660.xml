  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is the leading contributor to mortality among children younger than 5 years.
      One effective and inexpensive intervention is providing skin-to-skin care (STSC) whereby the
      mother of a preterm baby provides skin-to-skin contact to the newborn for at least a few
      hours, ideally every day. This intervention can make breastfeeding easier and can improve the
      health and development of the baby.

      Unfortunately, despite the large health benefits, mothers in low-resource communities are
      often unable to practice STSC due to a range of institutional and economic barriers. STSC
      requires substantial time and financial commitments from mothers; they must travel from home
      each day to the hospital to engage in STSC and provide expressed breast milk. Low-income
      women with access only to limited federally provided unpaid family leave may have to choose
      between returning to work while their baby is in the NICU and being able to stay at home with
      their newborn after discharge from the NICU. Families of preterm infants also face direct
      financial costs of practicing STSC and breastfeeding (such as fees for parking and childcare
      for older children).

      This trial aims to examine the impact of providing additional support to low-income mothers
      of babies born preterm in 2 hospitals in Massachusetts to help them provide STSC. Half of the
      participants will be randomized to receive an additional financial support intervention while
      their infant is in the NICU. The study will examine how this intervention impacts mothers'
      health behavior while their child is in the NICU and up to three months after.

      Most of the current and past policy efforts to increase STSC have focused on the delivery of
      STSC at hospitals, focusing on supply-side related challenges such as the lack of trained and
      informed staff. However, interventions that focus exclusively on hospitals are unlikely to be
      sufficient for low-income women if there are significant opportunity costs or transportation
      costs to simply being present at the hospital. This study aims to provide more evidence to
      determine whether removing these financial barriers has the potential to mitigate the poor
      outcomes of preterm babies born to lower socioeconomic status households.

    <description>Participants will be provided with standard information about the benefits of STSC and breastfeeding and will be encouraged to come into the NICU every day for at least 1 hour of STSC. To facilitate increased let down of breast milk, all participants will be provided a hospital grade breast pump free of charge during the stay of their babies in the NICU and assistance will be provided to the mothers in procuring a Medicaid covered breast pump to keep when the baby leaves the NICU. The hospital grade breast pump will be provided to her as soon as she enrolls into the study and will remain with her until her baby is discharged or transferred.</description>

The participants selected for the intervention arm will be asked not to discuss the payment with any other study participants (such as the members of any other families they may see at the NICU) or other health care staff at the NICU. Participants will also receive everything that the Comparison group receives.</description>
