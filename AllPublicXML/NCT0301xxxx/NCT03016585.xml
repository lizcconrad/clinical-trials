  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is an idiopathic disease affecting approximately 3% of the world
      population, primarily diagnosed in middle-aged women. Although FM is mainly characterized by
      chronic pain and fatigue, reduced muscular strength and flexibility are common symptoms
      associated with the presentation of the disorder. Interestingly, the etiology and underlying
      mechanism of FM are not completely understood, but previous findings suggest that autonomic
      dysfunction may explain some of the FM symptoms.

      Compared to age-matched healthy individuals, patients with FM have an attenuated autonomic
      function which is associated with a reduction in vagal tone and increase in sympathetic
      activity. Therefore, autonomic function is a worthwhile target intervention in individuals
      with FM. Although traditional exercise ( both aerobic and resistance) has been shown to
      effectively improve HRV parameters and FM symptoms, most FM patients display a decline in
      adherence to traditional exercise and continue to experience considerable pain and fatigue
      years after the original diagnosis ultimately requiring medication to control their
      symptoms.Thus, new approaches are needed to improve autonomic function and clinical symptoms
      in patients with FM, which will ultimately improve their physical and emotional functioning
      leading to a better quality of life.

      Tai Chi (TC) is a form of ancient Chinese martial art which integrates slow movements,
      controlled breathing and mental concentration. TC training is safe for special populations
      and has previously shown to decrease pain, fatigue as well as other FM related
      symptoms.However, the potential role of TC training on autonomic function is largely
      unexplored.

      The investigators hypothesis is that 12 weeks of TC training would improve our primary
      outcome of autonomic function through improvements in sympathovagal balance, and the
      secondary outcomes measures of FM symptoms (pain, fatigue and sleep quality), strength and
      flexibility.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of 12 weeks of TC training on on cardiac
      autonomic function, FM symptoms (pain, fatigue and sleep quality), strength and flexibility.
      The specific aim of the study is:

      - To evaluate the effects of 12 weeks of TC training on autonomic function arterial function
      by assessing heart rate variability
