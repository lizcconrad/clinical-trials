  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic device (CIED) is a evolution therapy and number of
      patients with it are growing rapidly. Electromagnetic interference causing device malfunction
      is not uncommon, Radiofrequency Identification system is among its plausible source. Patients
      with CIEDs are at risk of exposure to this novel product in their daily living especially
      automobile keyless access system. Only informal studies have been conducted and not be
      published. Formal and systemic evaluation and tests are crucial.
