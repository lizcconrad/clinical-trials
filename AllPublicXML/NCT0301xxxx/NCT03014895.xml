    <textblock>
      The study (E3112/CP1) is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      single intravenous ascending dose study conducted in Japanese healthy adult males to evaluate
      the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and immunogenicity of E3112 following a single intravenous
      dose of E3112.
