    <textblock>
      This was an open label, randomized, single dose, three period crossover pharmacokinetic study
      of Chronocort® in 30 healthy male volunteers. The study was conducted in smaller sub groups
      (Group 1, n=18 and Group 2, n=12).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age, inclusive (at screening).

          -  Subjects with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 21-28. Body Mass Index = Body weight (kg) /
             (Height (m))2.

          -  Subjects with no clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry, haematology and
             urine examination values within 14 days of the start of the study. The parameters
             measured included those shown in Appendix 3 of the Study Protocol.

          -  Subjects with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen (including alcohol), determined
             within 14 days of the start of the study.

          -  Subjects with negative HIV and Hepatitis B and C results.

          -  Subjects with no clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram
             (ECG) determined within 14 days of the start of the study.

          -  Subjects with no clinically-significant deviation outside the normal ranges for blood
             pressure and pulse measurements.

          -  Subjects and sexual partners must have used effective contraception methods during the
             trial and for 3 months after the last dose, for example:

               -  Oral contraceptive + condom

               -  Intra-uterine device (IUD) + condom

               -  Diaphragm with spermacide + condom

          -  Subjects must have been available to complete the study.

          -  Subjects must have satisfied a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in
             the study.

          -  Subjects must have provided written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A clinically significant history of gastrointestinal disorder likely to influence drug
             absorption.

          -  Receipt of regular medication within 14 days of the first study day (including high
             dose vitamins, dietary supplements or herbal remedies).

          -  Evidence of renal, hepatic, central nervous system, respiratory, cardiovascular or
             metabolic dysfunction.

          -  A clinically significant history of previous allergy / sensitivity to Hydrocortisone.

          -  A clinically significant history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Inability to communicate well with the Investigator (i.e., language problem, poor
             mental development or impaired cerebral function).

          -  Participation in a New Chemical Entity clinical study within the previous 16 weeks or
             a marketed drug clinical study within the previous 12 weeks.

          -  Subjects who had consumed more than 2 units of alcohol per day within seven (7) days
             prior to the first dose or had consumed any alcohol within the 48 hour period prior to
             the first dose.

          -  Donation of 450ml or more blood within the previous 12 weeks.

          -  Subjects who worked shifts (i.e. regularly alternated between days, afternoons and
             nights).
