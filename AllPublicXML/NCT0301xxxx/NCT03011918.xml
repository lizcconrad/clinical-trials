    <textblock>
      Falls and falls related injuries are considered one of the most adverse events that a patient
      can experience. Several assessment instruments to assess and mitigate risks for falls have
      been developed. However, these instruments have not addressed nutritional risk factors.

      Weight loss and low hemoglobin levels are key components of Malnutrition. Malnutrition in the
      hospital setting is a significant concern and may play a role as a fall risk factor.

      The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a global anemia database. WHO has identified
      iron deficiency anemia, based on hemoglobin value alone as the most common, wide-spread
      nutritional deficiency worldwide. Anemia is present in 30% of the worlds population including
      industrialized nations.

      The consensus statement of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics / American Society of
      Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition simply defines adult under-nutrition as a continuum of
      inadequate intake along with a multitude of other factors. Weight loss occurs at multiple
      points along this continuum.

      this multiphase retrospective descriptive analysis hypothesizes that degree of weight loss
      and degree of Hgb decline may be fall risk factors.

      Eat Well, Fall Less is a multiphase retrospective descriptive analysis of single event
      fallers and repeat fallers. Data source: Documented falls occurring between October 1, 2010
      and October 31, 2012.

      Chart Review data on weight loss and decline in Hemoglobin levels were collected 12 months, 6
      months and 3months and 1 month prior to the first fall along as the most recent value prior
      to the event. Additional data on vitamin D levels and C-reactive Protein values will be
      collected at the 12 month, 6month, and 1 month prior to the first fall

      Statistical Analysis using SAS version 9.1. a two tailed t-test was performed to evaluate
      differences in HGB characteristics between single and frequent fallers. One way ANOVA
      evaluated changes in Hgb, c-Reactive Protein, vitamin D values and weight over time are being
      collected.

      Two constellations of fallers emerged. Those with and those without dementia. The two groups
      appeared to have different nutrition risk factors. All statistical analysis was done using
      JMP Pro (version 10.0.0, SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Statistical significance was set at p
      &lt; 0.05
