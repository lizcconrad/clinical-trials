    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect on older's cognition of the application of closed target-controlled
      infusion(TCI) of propofol and remifentanil guided by Narcotrend index .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundreds of patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were randomly divided
      into two groups:closed-loop (group A,n=100) and open-loop group(group B,n=100).The procedure
      during induction of anesthesia was same in two groups.In group A,if Narcotrend index(NI) fall
      down to 46 and keep more than 30 seconds,propofol and remifentanil were intravenously infused
      as feedback automatically to achieve the target NI of 26-46.However,the NI in group B was
      controlled manually.Taking an exam of MMSE before and after the surgery which measures if the
      older's cognition changed. Furthermore.we will measure the levels of protein S100beta and
      NSE.

    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment.It is commonly used in medicine and allied health to screen for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment. The MMSE's purpose has been not, on its own, to provide a diagnosis for any particular nosological entity.We measure the patient before the operation and the first/third/seventh day after the operation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>protein s100beta</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The calcium-binding protein S100b is enriched in astroglial cells and can cross the blood-brain barrier after hypoxic damage of the central nervous system. Its routine measurement is simple and relatively inexpensive. S100b is filtrated by the kidney and has an estimated half-life of 2 h . Its serum level increases after CA, and its prognostic value has been studied . Because of mitigated results, its routine use has been, up to now, not recommended. S100bata is normally 0.2μg/L in serum or more smaller.We decide to take the blood sample before the operation and after the operation when the patient is awake.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>NSE</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>NSE has a role in glucose metabolism. As for S100b, NSE is released from the hypoxic brain into the bloodstream, and its serum level correlates with the extent of brain injury. Also, NSE correlates with other markers of brain injury . NSE has a high specificity to predict adverse outcomes when measured in the few days post CA. A cutoff point of 33 mg/l is recommended.in our study, we take the blood sample before the operation and after the operation when the patient awake.</description>
