    <textblock>
      Muscle wasting is a significant problem in critically ill patients, with reported losses of a
      half to three percent per day over the first ten days (for an average 70kg person this
      equates to 3 to 20kg of muscle loss). Low skeletal muscle mass at admission to the intensive
      care unit (ICU) and the loss of lean tissue have been associated with negative clinical
      outcomes, including increased incidence of infections, length of stay, mortality and muscle
      weakness. It is therefore crucial that technology is utilised to: 1) identify ICU patients
      with low muscularity on admission, 2) to help understand the factors impacting muscle loss
      and to 3) assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at maintaining skeletal muscle mass
      in this population.

      The measurement of lean body mass in patients admitted to the ICU is challenging however, due
      to the large fluid shifts that occur in this population and logistical issues in moving
      patients to specialised machinery for body composition analysis. Currently, there is no
      validated method for accurately assessing a patient's muscle mass at the bedside in the
      intensive care setting. It is therefore important to investigate the accuracy, feasibility
      and reliability of bedside methods such as subjective physical assessment of muscle mass, mid
      arm muscle circumference, ultrasound and bioimpedance analysis to assess muscularity in this
      population who are primarily bedbound. In order to do this, a critical comparison is required
      between these methods and muscularity assessed by a &quot;reference&quot; body composition method, such
      computed tomography (CT) image analysis. Briefly, quantification of skeletal muscle at the
      abdomen area utilising abdominal CT images has been shown to be highly representative of
      whole body skeletal muscle volume.

      We wish to conduct a pilot, feasibility study (n= 50), which will recruit patients who have a
      CT scan (containing abdomen area), performed for clinical purposes. Our primary aim will be
      to investigate whether muscularity assessed with non-invasive bedside methods (ultrasound,
      bioimpedance analysis, SGA physical assessment, mid arm muscle circumference) are correlated
      with skeletal muscle mass quantified by a &quot;reference method&quot; (CT image analysis).

      Aim Our primary aim is to investigate whether muscularity assessed via bedside ultrasound is
      correlated with a reference method for estimating whole body skeletal muscle mass (CT image
      analysis) in the first few days of critical illness.

      Our secondary aims are

        -  To investigate whether muscularity assessed via other bedside methods (bioimpedance
           spectroscopy, subjective physical assessment and mid arm muscle circumference) are
           correlated with a reference method for estimating whole body skeletal muscle mass (CT
           image analysis) in critically ill patients.

        -  To better understand the association between measured resting energy expenditure and
           muscularity in the critically ill.

        -  To observe changes in skeletal muscle mass (in a sub set of patients who have two CT
           scans) and the impact various factors, including energy and protein delivery has on
           these changes.
