      Primary aim of this study is to evaluate the association between postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction and increased serum levels of S100B protein after robot-assisted laparoscopic
      radical prostatectomy.

      The neurocognitive assessment protocol will design to evaluate general cognitive function and
      identify patients with cognitive dysfunction. Neuropsychological tests of all patients will
      conduct on the one day prior to surgery, the seventh day after surgery, and the 3rd month
      after surgery, respectively. According to a consensus statement, cognitive function will
      assess using a battery of seven neuropsychological tests: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test
      (delayed recall), Trail Making Test (Parts A and B), Digit Span Test (forward and backward),
      and Grooved Pegboard Test (dominant and non-dominant hands). To determine a normal reference
      value of cognitive functions, a group of 20 healthy individuals appropriately selected with
      respect to sex, age and education level without any significant mental or somatic disorders
      and without operation were recruited as a control group. To determine the cognitive
      dysfunction, baseline score or time measurement were subtracted from test score and the
      difference was divided by the standard deviation of the score in the control group. The
      result was called the Z score. Z score was calculated for each test and, POCD was defined as
      a Z score greater than 1.96 in at least two of the seven tests, and/or a combined Z score
      greater than 1.96.

      Serum levels of S100B protein will obtain from venous blood samples collected before surgery,
      after anesthesia induction, at 30 min and 24 h after surgery.
