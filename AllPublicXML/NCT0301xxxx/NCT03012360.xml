  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial treatment could be beneficial in patients with ventilator-associated
      tracheobronchitis (VAT). The hypothesis of this study is that antibiotic treatment for VAT (3
      or 7 days), compared with no antibiotic treatment, would reduce the incidence of transition
      from VAT to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this randomized controlled multicenter double-blind trial is to assess
      the efficiency of two durations (3 or 7 days) of antibiotic treatment for VAT, compared with
      no antibiotic treatment, in reducing the incidence of transition from VAT to
      ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

      Secondary objectives are to determine the impact of two durations (3 or 7 days) of antibiotic
      treatment for VAT, compared with no antibiotic treatment, on:

        -  duration of mechanical-ventilation free days

        -  duration of antibiotic free days

        -  length of ICU stay

        -  mortality at day 28 and day 90

        -  incidence of ICU-acquired colonization related to multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria

        -  incidence of ICU-acquired infection related to MDR bacteria

        -  incidence of ventilator-associated events After informed consent, patients will be
           randomized (1:1:1) to receive 0 (control group), 3 or 7 days (experimental groups) of
           antibiotic treatment for VAT

      Antibiotic treatment is standardized, based on the time of onset of VAT, and presence of risk
      factors for MDR bacteria:

        -  patients with early-onset VAT with no risk factor for MDR bacteria will receive
           ceftriaxone (2 g iv every 24h).

        -  patients with late-onset VAT (after day 4 of mechanical ventilation), or with at least
           one risk factor for MDR bacteria will receive imipenem (1 g iv every 8h), and
           ciprofloxacin (400 mg iv every 8h) as empirical treatment. When methicillin-resistant
           Staphylococcus aureus is suspected, linezolid (600 mg iv every 12h) will be added to
           empirical treatment.

      Patients randomized in control group will receive 7 days of placebo, and those randomized in
      the first experimental arm (3 days of antibiotics) will receive 4 days of placebo.
