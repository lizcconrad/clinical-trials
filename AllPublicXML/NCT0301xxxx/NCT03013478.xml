  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct an 8-week randomized trial evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of adding
      CBT4CBT to treatment as usual in a community based primary care program in a population of 60
      individuals who meet current DSM criteria for substance use disorder other than nicotine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct an initial evaluation of the computer program as an
      enhancement of treatment as usual in a community-based primary care clinic. Sixty individuals
      with a current DSM-IV alcohol or substance use disorder will be randomly assigned to either
      (1) treatment as usual, or (2) treatment as usual plus exposure to the 'CBT for CBT' program
      over a period of 8 weeks. Primary outcomes will be retention in treatment and reduction in
      drug use over 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include treatment utilization
