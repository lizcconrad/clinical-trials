      Twenty Salvation Army clients will be recruited to pilot test a motivational smoking
      cessation counseling intervention that is delivered via a tablet computer. Study participants
      will be given brief instructions on how to use the tablet. They will then complete a brief
      survey on the tablet. This will be followed by the researcher using the tablet to provide the
      motivational intervention. Finally, study participants will be interviewed to establish this
      perceptions of the intervention.
