  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and are about to begin treatment for the same.

      Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and their treatment may weaken
      your immune system and may make you more likely to develop invasive fungal infections (IFIs).

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if isavuconazole can help prevent
      invasive aspergillosis (IA) and other IFIs in patients with AML/MDS. The safety of this drug
      will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Isavuconazole is FDA and commercially available for the
      treatment of IA and mucormycosis. It is considered investigational to use isavuconazole for
      the prevention of IFIs. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will take
      isavuconazole by mouth every 8 hours for the first 6 doses (48 hours) and then 1 time each
      day after that.

      The capsules should be swallowed whole. Do not chew, crush, dissolve, or open the capsules.

      If at the start of the study participant is unable to take participant's dose by mouth,
      participant will receive the study drug by vein over about 1 hour every 8 hours for the first
      6 doses and then 1 time each day after that for up to 4 days.

      If there is a brief period where participant is unable to take the dose by mouth, participant
      will receive isavuconazole by vein over about 1 hour. Participant will switch back to taking
      the dose by mouth again as soon as participant is able to do so.

      Participant will be given a study drug diary to keep track of each dose of study drug that
      participant has taken, the time the dose was taken, and any missed or vomited doses.
      Participant should bring the study drug diary with participant to every visit.

      Length of Study:

      Participant may continue to take the study drug for up to 12 weeks. Participant will no
      longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if participant has a
      complete remission of the disease (if the disease goes away), if a breakthrough fungal
      infection occurs, if intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow
      study directions.

      Participation in the study will be over after the End-of-Study Visit.

      Study Visits:

      Every week:

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests 1-2 times each week.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn twice a week to check for a fungal
           infection.

      During Weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, participant will have a physical exam.

      On Days 8 and 15, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points.

      On Day 10, participant will have an EKG.

      During Week 2 and then every other week after that (Weeks 4, 6, 8, and so on), blood (about 1
      teaspoon) will be drawn to measure the iron stores in participant's body.

      If at any time the doctors think it is needed:

        -  Participant will have a chest x-ray or CT scan to check for fungal infections in
           participant's lungs.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn to check for fungal infections.

        -  If participant has a bone marrow test done to check the status of the leukemia as part
           of participant's standard of care, it will be checked for iron content.

      End of Study:

      About 30 days after the last dose of the study drug:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.
