  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how repeated dietary exposure to umami taste
      affects umami taste perception, hedonics, food preferences, and satiety. Healthy adult
      subjects will consume a low glutamate vegetable broth daily for one month, where the
      experimental group's broth is supplemented with the umami-rich stimuli of monosodium
      glutamate (MSG) and the control group's low glutamate broth is matched for sodium (NaCl).

      The investigators hypothesize that repeated dietary exposure to umami taste will:

        1. diminish umami suprathreshold intensity perception and hinder the ability to
           discriminate varying MSG concentrations

        2. decrease liking of umami-rich foods and shift preferences upwards towards more intense
           umami stimuli

        3. decrease satiation and decrease the satiating effect of a test meal

    <time_frame>1 month (at baseline and post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rate the umami intensity of aqueous solutions and foods on the general Labeled Magnitude Scale before and after a month-long dietary supplementation to determine how perception changes with repeated exposure to umami taste</description>

    <time_frame>1 month (at baseline and post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rate liking and preference in a variety of umami-rich foods before and after a month-long dietary supplementation to determine how liking and preference of umami-rich foods changes with repeated exposure to umami taste</description>

    <measure>Change in liking and wanting of high protein foods</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month (at baseline and post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects complete the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire before and after a month-long dietary supplementation to determine how explicit liking and implicit wanting of high-protein foods changes with repeated exposure to umami taste</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in satiation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month (at baseline and post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects consume a test meal and the amount of food eaten is measured before and after a month-long dietary supplementation to determine how satiation from a test meal differs after repeated exposure to umami taste</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month (at baseline and post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects consume a test meal and rate appetite sensations on a visual analog scale throughout the test meal before and after a month-long dietary supplementation. A satiety quotient will be derived from these values with the formula: Satiety Quotient = (rating pre-eating episodeâˆ’rating post-eating episode) / (intake of eating episode) to determine how satiety changes with repeated exposure to umami taste</description>

    <measure>Height</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month (at baseline and post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Body height (centimeters) will be measured with standard procedures and equipment. Using this information, BMI will be calculated with the formula: BMI=[kg/m]2 to ensure that BMI does not change with repeated exposure to umami taste</description>

    <measure>Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month (at baseline and post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight (kilograms) will be measured with standard procedures and equipment. Using this information, BMI will be calculated with the formula: BMI=[kg/m]2 to ensure that BMI does not change with repeated exposure to umami taste</description>

    <measure>Habitual glutamate consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month (at baseline and post intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects complete the National Cancer Institute's monthly diet history questionnaire to estimate habitual glutamate consumption. Baseline habitual glutamate consumption, in addition to gender, will be assessed as effect modifiers in the analysis.</description>
