  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of investigational drug niraparib in patients with advanced/recurrent
      endometrial cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether blocking a protein
      called poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with niraparib provides clinical benefit in
      patients with recurrent endometrial cancer, as well as to explore the possible impact of
      phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss (loss of function of the PTEN gene) on blocking
      PARP with niraparib.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will first enroll patients with recurrent endometrial cancer regardless of PTEN
      status. If this patient population does not meet the criteria for clinical efficacy,
      retrospective analysis of PTEN status will be done and the study will potentially continue
      with a focus on participants with PTEN loss.

      Participants will be screened for eligibility by standard safety tests and procedures within
      28 days of the start of the study drug. Tests and procedures done for research purposes only
      during this time include archival tumor tissue collection for biomarker/genetic research
      including PTEN analysis, and blood sample collection for analysis in the even the participant
      develops myelodysplastic syndrome) MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      Eligible participants will take niraparib capsules or tablets by mouth, at 300 mg, once a
      day, every day of every 28 day cycle.

      While receiving the study treatment, participants will be asked to visit the study site on
      Days 1, 8, 15, and 21 of Cycle 1, Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 2, and Day 1 of Cycle 3 and future
      cycles for safety tests and procedures. If, at any time, participants develop (or is
      suspected to have developed) MDS/AML, a mandatory bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be done
      for testing to confirm diagnosis.

      When participants are taken off the study treatment permanently, they will be asked to return
      to the study site for an End of Study Treatment visit to have tests and procedures done for
      safety purposes.

      Participants who are taken off the study treatment for any reason other than disease
      progression will continue to have radiological assessments every 12 weeks until disease
      progression. Participants will continue to be followed up for side effects weekly in the
      first 4 weeks, then monthly until resolution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed epithelial endometrial cancer. All histological subtypes are
             allowed except for endometrial sarcoma, carcinosarcoma, clear cell, mixed and
             adenosquamous tumors.

          -  Patients must have radiographic evidence of disease progression following the most
             recent line of treatment.

          -  Patients must have previously received at least one line of platinum-based
             chemotherapy. Prior hormonal and immunotherapy are allowed. There is no restriction on
             the total number prior lines of therapy.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for

             calipers by clinical exam, and ≥15mm for nodal lesions. Areas of previous radiation
             may not serve as measurable disease unless there is evidence of progression post
             radiation.
