  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, all patients in the hospital are woken up throughout the night to check for vital
      signs, no matter how sick they are. The investigators are doing this study to determine
      whether skipping routine vital sign checks at night improves participant sleep quality and
      satisfaction without increasing the risk of adverse events.

      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To determine the correlation between subjective and objective sleep quality measures.

        2. To compare the objective and subjective measures of sleep quality and satisfaction
           between the intervention group and the control group.

        3. To compare the adverse event rates in the intervention group and the control group,
           defined as ICU transfer or cardiac arrest occurring within 24 hours of risk
           stratification.

    <intervention_name>Risk Stratification</intervention_name>
    <description>Every night, subjects will be risk stratified into low-risk or medium- to high-risk using a physiologic risk score, eCART. Subjects who meet the low-risk criteria will not be woken up for routine nighttime vitals (typically at midnight and at 4 am). However, subjects will continue to be woken up for laboratory draws, procedures, or treatments as per usual. Subjects who are medium- to high-risk will continue to be woken up at night for routine nighttime vitals. Alarms for all subjects, including low-risk subjects, will continue to alert nurses in real-time. If the primary nurse of a low-risk subject is alerted of an alarm, the nurse will have to go into the subject's room to turn off the alarm and therefore check on the patient.</description>
