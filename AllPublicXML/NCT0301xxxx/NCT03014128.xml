  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Work-related upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders (WRUEMSDs) have shown to be related to
      many occupational situations and specific industries. However, there is conflicting
      information about monotonous and repetitive activities. In this context, the profession of
      surgical device mechanics has not been analyzed so far.

      The objective of this study is to examine surgical device mechanics at different workplaces
      with varying work contents and to compare them with a control group without the repetitive
      workload exposition as described above. The headquarters and main production site of Aesculap
      are located in Tuttlingen/Germany. Aesculap is the world leading manufacturer of surgical
      devices.

      After statistical power analysis, the investigators plan to randomize and include a total of
      90 voluntary test persons in 3 groups (30 persons each). The study will include standardized
      questionnaires and a physical examination as well as an industry test (Purdue Pegboard Test).

      Primary and secondary endpoints were defined to show if significant difference between
      surgical device mechanics and a control group is present.
