  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consequences of childhood obesity are devastating, affecting the physical and mental
      health of children. Disadvantaged school-age children are at risk for unhealthy gains in BMI
      during the summer months and there is a dearth of information regarding the causal health
      behaviors and environmental factors. The overall objective of this application is to provide
      an in depth examination of key dietary and physical activity behaviors as well as the food,
      physical activity, and social environments of low-income, racial/ethnic school-age children.
      To achieve this goal, an observational study utilizing a multi-state prospective cohort
      design will be conducted with the goal of examining the weight gain trajectory among a
      racially and ethnically diverse convenience sample of disadvantaged school-age children who
      routinely attend structured programming during the summer months and those who don't
      participate in structured programming. In addition, a subset of these children will be
      evaluated to learn their daily health behaviors, as well as their food, physical activity,
      and social environments during the summer. Identification of determinants of program
      participation and factors that may enhance the beneficial effects of program participation
      will also occur. A social ecological framework approach will guide the research. This study
      can be expected to have a significant positive impact by providing information on the factors
      that protect disadvantaged children from unhealthy weight gain during the summer which can be
      used by stakeholders at the local, state, and federal level to reform current policy that
      will increase child participation in health promoting programming during the summer window of
      risk.
