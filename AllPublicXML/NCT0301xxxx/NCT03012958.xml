      The purpose of this study is to learn more about new noninvasive ways of detecting lung
      disease in US Military personnel and people who worked as contractors during military
      operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. This study is looking at conducting a type of breathing
      test called the lung clearance index (LCI) test which is being investigated as a potential
      noninvasive way to detect the type of lung disease that may be seen in symptomatic deployers
      retuning from Iraq and Afghanistan.

      The healthy control group will comprise 20 volunteers who are at least 18 years of age, have
      no history of pre-existing lung disease, and report no respiratory illness in the four weeks
      preceding enrollment.

      The symptomatic deployers who have undergone lung biopsy and meet case definition for
      deployment-related lung disease. A case of deployment-related lung disease is defined as the
      presence of unexplained chest symptoms in a deployer who, on a surgical lung biopsy, is found
      to have bronchiolitis or granulomatous pneumonitis without other known cause.

    <description>LCI is determined by the number of lung volume turnovers necessary to clear the lungs of an inert tracer gas such as nitrogen that is inhaled at the beginning of the test. The LCI is calculated by determining the cumulative expired volume (CEV) and then dividing the CEV by the functional residual capacity. Values of less than7.0 indicate normal values while an LCI greater than 7.0 is associated with heterogeneity in ventilation and distal airway abnormalities. The ability to detect peripheral airway disease may make LCI a better modality for detecting distal airways abnormalities seen on lung histopathology but often missed on traditional pulmonary function testing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For the deployer group:

          -  presence of respiratory symptoms (cough, chest tightness, wheezing, shortness of
             breath or decreased exercise tolerance) following deployment

          -  history of deployment for Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom or
             Operation New Dawn for greater than or equal to 6 weeks as either military personnel
             or a civilian contractor

          -  prior VATS biopsy-proven histologic abnormalities of small airways disease.

        For the control group:

          -  no history of pre-existing lung disease

          -  no respiratory illness in the four weeks preceding enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For the deployer group:

          -  If on clinical evaluation they were found to have asthma, vocal cord dysfunction or
             other explanations for their respiratory symptoms and did not need to undergo surgical
             lung biopsy for diagnosis.

          -  unable to provide informed consent

          -  pregnant subjects
