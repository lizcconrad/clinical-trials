      The current study is a prospective, randomized, open, multi-center investigation. The aim of
      the study is to investigate whether the HBeAg seroconversion rate can be improved if applying
      combination therapy in HBeAg positive CHB patients who has achieved
      HBVDNA&lt;105copies/ml，HBsAg≤5000IU/ml, ALT≥ 2ULN or Liver histology G2S2.

      The HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis B(CHB) subjects who has achieved HBV
      DNA&lt;10*5copies/ml，HBsAg≤5000IU/ml, ALT≥ 2ULN or Liver histology G2S2 will be randomized to
      three groups. The subjects who go into group A will be treated by tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF) for 96 weeks; The subjects who go into group B will be treated by TDF in the
      first 48 weeks, then will be treated by the combination of TDF and Peginterferon alfa-2a for
      another 48 weeks; The subjects who go into group C will be treated by the combination of TDF
      and Peginterferon alfa-2a for the first 48 weeks, then will be treated by TDF for another 48
      weeks.
