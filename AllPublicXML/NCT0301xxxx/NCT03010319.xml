      The study will evaluate the efficacy of PriMatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold in the management of
      diabetic foot ulcers in subjects with diabetes mellitus versus the Standard of Care
      treatment. Half of patients will be treated using PriMatrix while the other half will receive
      Standard of Care treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a major health complication that affects up to 15% of
      individuals with diabetes mellitus over their lifetime. The treatment of DFUs is extremely
      challenging as these ulcers may not respond to standard of care (SC) treatment and frequently
      become infected.

      Advanced wound therapies like PriMatrix have become an important strategy in the treatment of
      hard-to-heal chronic DFUs by trapping and binding the patients' own cells to rebuild the
      dermis layer of the skin to aid in healing.

      The study will evaluate the efficacy of PriMatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold in the closure of
      DFUs in subjects with diabetes mellitus in comparison to Standard of Care treatment.

                  Informed Consent for trial participation.

               2. Ulcer has been diagnosed as either a partial or full thickness diabetic foot
                  ulcer without tunneling, undermining, sinus tracts, or capsule/tendon/bone
                  exposure,

               3. Ulcer is either located on the foot or ankle (with no portion above the top of
                  the malleolus),

               4. Ulcer size (area) is greater than or equal to 1 cm2 and less than or equal to 12
                  cm2 post-debridement,

                  ulcers on the specified foot, post-debridement. If the subject has more than one
                  ulcer that meets the entrance criteria, the ulcer designated as the study ulcer
                  will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Non study ulcers may be treated at
                  the Investigator's discretion however excluded treatments listed in Section
                  3.4.3.1 must not be used on non-study ulcers.

          1. Subject was previously randomized and treated under this clinical study protocol.

          2. Subject has suspected or confirmed signs/symptoms of gangrene or wound infection as
             evidenced by redness, pain, and purulent drainage on any part of the affected limb.

          3. Subject has suspected or confirmed osteomyelitis of the foot.

          4. Subject has a history of hypersensitivity to bovine collagen, as determined by prior
             medical history.

          5. Subject has participated in another clinical trial involving a device or a
             systemically administered investigational study drug/treatment within 30 days of
             randomization.

          6. Subject has received within 30 days of signing Informed Consent Form or scheduled to
             receive a medication or treatment which is known to interfere with or affect the rate
             or quality of wound healing (e.g. systemic steroids, immunosuppressive therapy,
             autoimmune disease therapy, dialysis, radiation therapy to the foot, vascular surgery,
             angioplasty, or thrombolysis).

          7. Subject has a history of bone cancer or metastatic disease on the affected limb,

          9. In the opinion of the Investigator the subject has a history of or is currently
             diagnosed with any illnesses or conditions, other than diabetes, that could interfere

             GraftJacket, OASIS, Omnigraft, or Integra BMWD).

         15. Subject has been treated with hyperbaric oxygen or topical oxygen therapy within 5
             days of the Screening Visit or is scheduled to receive hyperbaric oxygen treatment or
             topical oxygen therapy during the study.

         16. Subject has been treated with negative pressure wound therapy within 72 hours of the
             Screening Visit or is scheduled to receive negative pressure wound therapy during the
             study.

         17. At the end of the Screening Phase the area of the study ulcer (after sharp
             debridement) has decreased by more than 30% over the two week screening period.
