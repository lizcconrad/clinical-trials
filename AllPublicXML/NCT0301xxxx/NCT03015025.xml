  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of coumarins has been a challenge for doctors because of its narrow therapeutic range
      and they show great inter and intra-individual variability in the dose necessary to achieve
      an international normalized ratio (INR) within the therapeutic range. Among the factors
      influencing the interindividual variability in the dose required include age, weight, Vitamin
      K in the diet, comorbidity as well as drug interactions and in recent years has also seen the
      importance of pharmacogenetic factors.

      Demographic and clinical factors contribute approximately 20% to the total variability of
      dose requirements. In recent years it has highlighted the close relationship between the dose
      requirements of coumarin drugs and certain polymorphisms of genes involved in
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of these drugs. The use of dosing algorithms that
      include pharmacogenetic information may help in the dose selection, improving efficacy and
      reducing adverse events. Studies have shown the relationship between genotype variants of
      CYP2C9 and VKORC1, CYP4F2 and apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which together with the demographic
      and clinical variants can explain between 50-60% of the variability in the response to these
      drugs.
