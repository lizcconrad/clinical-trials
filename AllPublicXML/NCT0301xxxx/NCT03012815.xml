  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current &quot;gold-standard&quot; for the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is
      symptom-triggered administration of benzodiazepines. This method of treatment has several
      drawbacks that have been described in the literature. Thus benzodiazepine sparing agents have
      been evaluated for use in AWS. One of these agents that has not only shown benefit for AWS
      but also benefits on complete abstinence, reducing a return to heavy drinking, and cravings
      is gabapentin. In clinical practice at Mayo Clinic gabapentin is used for this purpose. Due
      to the limited reports of the safety and efficacy of a protocol involving gabapentin for AWS,
      a study to compare gabapentin to symptom-triggered lorazepam will be completed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current &quot;gold-standard&quot; for the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome is
      symptom-triggered administration of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines and use of a
      symptom-triggered approach has several drawbacks such as over administration of medication
      due to many subjective patient reported symptoms. Benzodiazepines may contribute to a
      drug-induced delirium or high dosage may necessitate transfer to an ICU setting. Abrupt
      withdrawal of benzodiazepines also contribute to cravings, rebound insomnia, and anxiety that
      have been shown to increase the risk of a return drinking.

      Clinical use of gabapentin for alcohol withdrawal has been presented by Maldonado at Stanford
      University Hospitals. (Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine Annual Meeting, 2013-2015) At Mayo
      Clinic, the Psychiatry Consultation-Liaison hospital service has been recommending the use of
      a modified gabapentin protocol since January 2015, which has been clinically accepted on
      medical, surgical, and psychiatric hospital services. The purpose of this research is to
      investigate the reactive benzodiazepine versus proactive gabapentin approaches to AWS in a
      prospective, randomized, open-label study.
