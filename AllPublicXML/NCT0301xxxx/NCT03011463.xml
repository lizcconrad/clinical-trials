      The purpose of the study is:

        -  to determine absolute bioavailability, input rates, distribution volume, renal and
           intestinal excretion of trospium in subjects with wild-type of SLC22A1 rs72552763 and
           rs12208357 and in subjects with homozygous variant alleles of SLC22A1 rs72552763 or
           rs12208357

        -  to determine absolute bioavailability, input rates, distribution volume and renal and
           intestinal excretion of trospium in subjects with wild-type alleles of SLC22A1
           rs72552763 and rs12208357 after co-medication of 300 mg of the OCT1- inhibitor
           ranitidine

        -  to determine absolute bioavailability, input rates, distribution volume and renal and
           intestinal excretion of trospium in subjects with wild-type alleles of SLC22A1
           rs72552763 and rs12208357 after co-medication of 500 mg of the P-glycoprotein- inhibitor
           clarithromycin

          -  good health as evidenced by the results of the clinical examination, ECG, and the
             laboratory check-up, which are judged by the clinical investigator not to differ in a
             clinical relevant way from the normal state (blood pressure between 110/70 and 140/90
             for males and between 100/60 and 140/90 for females, heart rate over 50 bpm up to 90
             bpm, laboratory values within the reference ranges as given actually by the laboratory

             inhibitors, anticholinergics)

          -  any other medication within two weeks prior to the first administration of the study
             medication, but at least 10-time the half-live of the respective drug (except oral
             contraceptives)

          -  intake of grapefruit or orange containing food or beverages within 14 days prior to
