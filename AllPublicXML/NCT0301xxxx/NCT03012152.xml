      and oncoplastic surgery as regard margin status and patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This planned study was conducted on 70 female patients presented to our tertiary referral
      breast unit at Ain Shams University hospitals with breast cancer amid the period from
      September 2012 to May 2013 .

      Every one of them signed an informed consent to partake in this study that was approved in a
      meeting held by the ethical committee on august 2012 at Ain Shams University. All patients
      sharing in the study received closed envelope before surgery in a randomized way in which the
      surgical technique is written either standard conservative surgery or oncoplastic
      surgery(Double Blind).

      Our patients were partitioned into 2 equal groups: group A (35patients) who underwent
      standard conservative surgery, group B (35patients) who underwent oncoplastic surgery.
