    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ruxolitinib phosphate when given
      together with pembrolizumab in treating patients with stage IV triple negative breast cancer
      that has spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab,
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Ruxolitinib phosphate may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      pembrolizumab and ruxolitinib phosphate together may work better in treating patients with
      stage IV triple negative breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib phosphate (ruxolitinib) (JAK2
      inhibition) in combination with fixed dosing of pembrolizumab (anti PD-1) in patients with
      advanced/metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with ruxolitinib.

      II. To estimate clinical tumor response in women with TNBC treated with pembrolizumab in
      combination with ruxolitinib as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess tumor response with immune related (ir)RECIST and associations with PDJ
      amplification, PD-L1, PD-L2, JAK2 and pSTAT3 expression.

      II. To determine the effect of combination targeted blockade on T- and B- cell immunity to
      breast cancer tumor antigens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ruxolitinib phosphate.

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and ruxolitinib
      phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 3 or 6 months for up to 2 years.
