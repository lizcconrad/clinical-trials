  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for
      triple-negative breast cancer that has spread to other areas of the body. The names of the
      study interventions involved in this study are:

        -  Cisplatin

        -  AZD1775
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved AZD1775 as a treatment for
      any type of cancer. Cisplatin is FDA approved for other cancers and has been shown to be an
      active treatment for breast cancer.

      AZD1775 is a drug that is designed to block a protein called Wee-1 which may control the
      ability of certain cancer cells to grow or divide. Cisplatin works by damaging the DNA inside
      the cancer cells which prevents them from dividing. By combining AZD1775 and Cisplatin,
      cancer cells may potentially be more effectively killed.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine whether the combination of
      AZD1775 and cisplatin is an effective treatment for triple negative breast cancer that has
      spread to other parts of the body.

          -  Prior chemotherapy: Patients may have received 0-1 prior chemotherapeutic regimen for
             metastatic breast cancer and must have been off treatment with chemotherapy for at
             least 21 days before enrollment in the study. The number of patients with 0 prior
             chemotherapeutic regimen will be limited to a maximum of n = 20.

          -  Prior biologic therapy: Patients must have discontinued all biologic therapy at least

             treatment.

          -  Availability of a tissue block from initial breast cancer diagnosis and/or metastatic
             recurrence. If a tissue block is not available, 10-20 unstained slides may be provided
             as an alternative. If unstained slides will be provided, they should not be sent until
             specifically requested by the DFCI study coordinator. If archival tumor tissue is not
             available, a fresh biopsy may be performed.

          -  In the first stage of the trial, at least 10 patients with biopsy-accessible disease
             must be willing to undergo paired research biopsies. These biopsies will occur 5-48
             hours after the C1D1 cisplatin dose (ie. C1D2or C1D3) and 5-8hrs (+/- 24hrs) after the
             last dose of AZD1775 on C2D3. The exact timing of the biopsy relative to receipt of
             study treatment should be accurately recorded.

               -  Biopsies may be done with local anesthesia or intravenous conscious sedation,
                  according to standard institutional guidelines.

               -  Research biopsies requiring general anesthesia are not allowed on this protocol
                  unless a biopsy is being obtained simultaneously for clinical reasons, in the
                  judgment of the patients' treating physician.

                  inadequate tissue is obtained are still eligible to continue protocol therapy.
                  They will not be required to undergo a repeat biopsy attempt.

               -  If dosing is delayed placing the biopsy outside of the allowable window, the
                  biopsy should be rescheduled to be within the window. If not feasible, the biopsy
                  should be obtained as close to within the window as possible.

               -  Fine needle aspirates (FNA) is not allowed

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening.

             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use enhanced methods of contraception.
             All women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless they fulfill one of
             the following criteria at screening:

               -  Post-menopausal defined as age ≥50 and amenorrheic for at least 12 months OR
                  Women age &lt;50 if they have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months and have a
                  serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) level in
                  the postmenopausal range (per institutional standards).

               -  If women have documentation of irreversible surgical sterilisation by
                  hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral
                  tubal ligation, they are considered post-menopausal.

          -  Appropriate contraception should be used from the time of screening, throughout the
             duration of study participation, and for four months after the last dose of AZD1775.
             Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, tubal ligation, intra-uterine
             devices, and vasectomised partner. All methods of contraception (with the exception of
             total abstinence) should be used in combination with the use of a condom by the male
             sexual partner for intercourse. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, the participants
             treating physician should be informed immediately. Additionally, male patients should
             refrain from donating sperm from the start of dosing until 6 months after
             discontinuing AZD1775. If male patients wish to father children they should be advised
             to arrange for freezing of sperm samples prior to the start of study treatment.

          -  Participant must be able to swallow pills.

          -  Participant may not have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or be

             symptoms. Patients with a history of treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases
             are eligible. Treated brain metastases are defined as those having no evidence of
             progression for ≥ 1 month after treatment, or hemorrhage for ≥ 2 weeks after treatment
             and no ongoing requirement for corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical examination
             and brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan) during the screening period.
             Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued without the
             subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the first study drug. Treatment
             for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or a
             combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS
             metastases treated by neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 1 month
