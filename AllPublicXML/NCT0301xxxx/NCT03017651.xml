      This protocol will determine the pK profile of two different omega-3 fatty acid supplements
      on plasma EPA and DHA levels.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is to assess the omega-3 blood levels of DHA and EPA following a single dose
      administration of study products by means of pharmacokinetics over a 24 hour period of time
      (post-dose).
