  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to conduct a contrast study on the characteristics of functional and
      structural connectivity of neural networks of working memory in patients with acquired brain
      injury versus normal controls, using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance
      imaging, task-specific functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging,
      combined with cognitive behavioral examinations. Another purpose is to reveal the
      characteristics of dynamic change of neural networks of working memory pre- and
      post-intervention in patients with working memory dysfunction.
