  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a simple tissue collection study with no therapeutic intent. Colon tissues will be
      taken from standard of care procedures. Tissues will be tested for their functions,
      expression of immune co-signaling molecules and reactions to transduction with recombinant
      Listeria vectors to assess effects on expression of B7-H1 and cytokines.

        Approximately 50% of patients are expected to be Caucasian, about 40% Hispanic and the
        remainder African American and other minorities. The investigators anticipate that subjects
        will range in age from 18 years old and older.
