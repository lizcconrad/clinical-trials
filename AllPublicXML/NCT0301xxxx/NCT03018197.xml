  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the use of a personal health record to improve
      medication adherence among patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation taking dabigatran
      for primary prevention of embolic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three brief newsletters will be sent by the research staff to the study patients in the form
      of secure messages through their MyChart account. The newsletters will describe dabigatran
      tolerability, adverse effects, patient monitoring, warnings/precautions, and administration.
      Newsletters will be developed through a review of the FDA-approved prescribing information,
      general tertiary references, and a search of PubMed and drafted with guidance from a Drug
      Information Specialist at Manchester University College of Pharmacy as well as reviewed by
      the research staff.

      Descriptive analysis will be used to analyze the survey to assess patient attitudes and
      beliefs about dabigatran and personal health records, as well as to assess the level of
      patient engagement. Difference-in-difference regression analysis will be used to evaluate the
      impact of the personal health record on dabigatran adherence by comparing the differences
      between times (pre-post) and interventions. Patient medication adherence will be correlated
      from the Pharmacy refill data to determine if the Intervention Group is more compliant than
      the Control Group. Multivariate analysis will be used to explore factors influencing personal
      health record use and dabigatran adherence.
