  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoid is widely used in clinical treatment. Recently, there was research about
      glucose fluctuations under low-dose and pulse steroid therapy in elderly patients with active
      autoimmune diseases. Through this prospective trial, the investigators wanted to know the
      blood glucose characteristics under high dosage glucocorticoid (1-2 mg/kg/day prednisone or
      equivalent) in young patients (30-40 years) with active autoimmune diseases with or without
      low-dose glucocorticoid maintenance. The investigators used continuous glucose monitoring for
      72 hours to get a better understanding of the glucose levels.

      As known to all, the dosage and duration of glucocorticoid influences the glucose levels in
      different diseases. Continuous glucose monitoring becomes a newly effective technology to
      better understand the glucose level. In this study,the investigators enrolled 25 patients
      with certain active autoimmune diseases during high-dosage glucocorticoid therapy at Peking
      Union Medical College Hospital. It was done by monitoring three-day continuous glucose levels
      by holding continuous glucose monitoring system underneath the skin, which helped to show a
      unique picture of fluctuations. The participants were divided into two groups according to
      the glucocorticoid therapy. Group 1 enrolled subjects who were newly commenced 1-2mg/kg/day
      prednisone-equivalent (intravenous/oral methylpredisolone or oral prednisone) for at least
      five days. Group 2 enrolled subjects who had underwent less than 15mg/day
      prednisone-equivalent glucocorticoid maintenance for at least 3 months but treated with
      high-dose glucocorticoid for the relapse during the study This finding is useful for the
      suitable treatment to control the hyperglycemia in young patients.

        The subjects were recruited from inpatients admitted to the Immunology Department, Peking
        Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), Beijing, China from April 1, 2016 to September 1,
        2016. Patients' primary disease was diagnosed according to the criteria by American College
        of Rheumatology. The spectrum of autoimmune disease included Systemic lupus Erythematosus
        (SLE), Connective tissue disorders, Sjogren Syndrome, Systemic sclerosis, IgG4-related
        disease, Bahcet's disease, ANCA-associated vasculitis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis.
