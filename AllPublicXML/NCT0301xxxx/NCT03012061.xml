  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the effects of UMEC 62.5 microgram (mcg) and UMEC 31.25
      mcg on lung function versus placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. This study will provide
      important information regarding the efficacy and safety of UMEC when administered in a
      separate inhaler to subjects on a background of fluticasone furoate (FF). This is a Phase
      IIb, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study that will compare the efficacy,
      safety and tolerability of UMEC (62.5 mcg and 31.25 mcg) administered once-daily in subjects
      with asthma that is not well controlled. Eligible subjects will be requested to participate
      in the study for a maximum of approximately 31 weeks with 4 phases (pre screening,
      screening/run-in, randomization/treatment and safety follow-up). The total number of
      randomized subjects required is approximately 384, with 128 subjects randomized 1:1:1 to each
      of the 3 double-blind treatment arms.

             uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or hematological abnormalities that are
             uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or
             which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition
             exacerbated during the study.

          -  Unstable liver disease as defined by the presence of ascites, encephalopathy,

             significance of each abnormal ECG finding in relation to the subject's medical history
             and exclude subjects who would be at undue risk by participating in the trial. An
             abnormal and clinically significant finding is defined as a 12-lead tracing that is
             interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following: Atrial fibrillation (AF)

          -  Subjects with a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention,
             prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction should only be included if in the
             opinion of the Investigator the benefit outweighs the risk and that the condition
             would not contraindicate study participation.

          -  Subjects with carcinoma that has not been in complete remission for at least 5 years.
             Subjects who have had carcinoma in situ of the cervix, squamous cell carcinoma and

          -  Subjects at risk of non-compliance, or unable to comply with the study procedures. Any
             infirmity, disability, or geographic location that would limit compliance for
             scheduled visits.

          -  Study investigators, sub-investigators, study coordinators, employees of a
             participating investigator or study site, or immediate family members of the
             aforementioned that is involved with this study.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, any subject who is unable to read and/or would not
             be able to complete study related materials.

          -  Occurrence of a culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the
             upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear during the run-in period that
             led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the Investigator, is
             expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's ability to participate
             in the study.

          -  Evidence of a moderate asthma exacerbation leading to a change in therapy or severe
             exacerbation during screening or the run-in period, defined as deterioration of asthma
             requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) or
             an in-patient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that
             required systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Changes in asthma medication (excluding changes after Visit 0 or run-in medication and
             albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol provided at Visit 1).

          -  Evidence of clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests during screening or
             run-in, which are still abnormal upon repeat analysis and are not believed to be due
             to disease(s) present. Each Investigator will use his/her own discretion in
             determining the clinical significance of the abnormality.
