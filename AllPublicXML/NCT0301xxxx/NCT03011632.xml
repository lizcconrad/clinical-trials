      The project is intended to be realised in two phases. In the first stage, a case control
      study will be performed. In the second phase, double-blind, placebo controlled study will be
      conducted. In the first phase 3 groups of children will be compare: i) a group of children
      suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) (fulfilling the European Position Paper on
      Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps (EPOS) criteria) and asthma (fulfilling the Asthma Predictive
      Index (API) criteria) (CRS+/asthma+, n=90), ii) a group of children suffering from CRS
      (fulfilling the EPOS criteria) but without asthma symptoms (negative API criteria)
      (CRS+/asthma-, n=30) and iii) a group of children without symptoms of CRS (negative EPOS
      criteria) and without asthma symptoms (negative API criteria) (CRS-/asthma-, n=30). In the
      second phase the effect of intranasal glucocorticosteroids will be assessed. The following
      research methods will be used: CRS-symptom score questionnaire (SN-5) and Childhood Asthma
      Control Test (cACT) questionnaires, skin prick test, spirometry, measurement of nitric oxide
      NO in exhaled breath (FeNO), taste perception test, eosinophil morphology assessment, ratio:
      glucose concentration in nasal secretion/serum glucose level, concentration of specific
      immunoglobulin (Ig) E, total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA), the
      proportion of innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and regulatory lymphocytes cells in the peripheral
      blood. Endoscopic examination of the upper airways will be performed and samples of the
      mucosa will be taken. The mucosal examination will be as follows: i) polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) examination for the detection of the presence of viral and bacterial genetic
      material, ii) measurement of the expression of the various messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA),
      iii) measurement of the expression of mRNA for the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)
      genes and iv) percentage of ILCs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistence of CRS and asthma require multiple interconnected feedback and feed-forward
      circuits between ILCs and epithelial cells. It seems that type 2 ILCs (ILC2) are the most
      important accelerators of type II immune response that prepare cytokine microenvironment for
      Th2 cells chronic activation. What decide on ILC2 accumulation - this is an urgent question.
      The aim of the proposed project is to examine the role of the innate immune response of
      airways in children suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis and asthma.

      The project is intended to be realised in two phases. In the first stage, a case control
      study will be performed. In the second phase, double-blind, placebo controlled study will be
      conducted. In the first phase 3 groups of children will be compare: i) a group of children
      suffering from CRS (fulfilling the EPOS criteria) and asthma (fulfilling the API criteria)
      (CRS+/asthma+, n=90), ii) a group of children suffering from CRS (fulfilling the EPOS
      criteria) but without asthma symptoms (negative API criteria) (CRS+/asthma-, n=30) and iii) a
      group of children without symptoms of CRS (negative EPOS criteria) and without asthma
      symptoms (negative API criteria) (CRS-/asthma-, n=30). In the second phase the effect of
      intranasal glucocorticosteroids will be assessed. The following research methods will be
      used: SN-5 and cACT questionnaires, skin prick test, spirometry, measurement of NO in exhaled
      breath, taste perception test, eosinophil morphology assessment, ratio: glucose concentration
      in nasal secretion/serum glucose level, concentration of specific immunoglobulin E, total IgG
      and IgA, the proportion of ILC2 cells and regulatory cells in the peripheral blood.
      Endoscopic examination of the upper airways will be performed and samples of the mucosa will
      be taken. The mucosal examination will be as follows: i) PCR examination for the detection of
      the presence of viral and bacterial genetic material, ii) measurement of the expression of
      the various mRNA types, iii) measurement of the expression of mRNA for the
      Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) genes and iv) percentage of ILC 1, 2 and 3 cells and
      regulatory cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a group of children (n=90) suffering from CRS (fulfilling the EPOS criteria, European
             Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps) and asthma (fulfilling the API
             criteria, Asthma Predictive Index), including a 30-person subgroup diagnosed with
             clinically significant IgE-dependent hypersensitivity (accordance between symptoms and
             current exposure to sensitizing allergen),

          -  a group of children (n=30) suffering from CRS (fulfilling the EPOS criteria) but
             without asthma symptoms (negative API criteria), including a 15-person subgroup
             diagnosed with clinically significant IgE-dependent hypersensitivity (accordance
             between symptoms and current exposure to sensitizing allergen),

          -  a group of children (n=30) without symptoms of CRS (negative EPOS criteria) and
             without asthma symptoms (negative API criteria).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  food allergy with symptoms affecting the respiratory tract

          -  contraindication to nasal endoscopy or contraindication to nasal mucosa biopsy

          -  hypertrophy of the third tonsil exceeding 60% of the nasopharynx (the criterion of
             obstruction being an indication for adenoidectomy). In these patients, the anatomical
             nasal obstruction may be the single cause of chronic inflammation in the airways, and
             hence verification of the hypotheses is impossible

          -  confirmed immunodeficiency

          -  exacerbation of asthma requiring systemic administration of glucocorticosteroids

          -  obesity, exposure to tobacco smoke

          -  other chronic illnesses and clinical conditions, which in the opinion of the
             researcher may influence the evaluation and the course of the study.
