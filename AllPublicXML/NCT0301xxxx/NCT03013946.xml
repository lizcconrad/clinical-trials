  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the effect of a 24-week concomitant
      coaching on patient reported outcomes of patients receiving standard treatment for mRCC with
      sunitinib.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of our study is to define the benefit of proactive coaching in mRCC, when compared
      to a reactive approach, which is considered the standard of care.

      Patients in the Coaching Arm A will be trained continuously at personal interactions of coach
      and patient (Face-to Face meetings as well as telephone contacts). The patient is educated on
      nature and severity of treatment emergent Adverse events (TEAE) of the Sunitinib-Therapy.

      Quality of Life (QoL) is assessed during sunitinib treatment in both arms (Arm A Coaching and
      Arm B non Coaching).

             safety or study results

          7. Participation in another clinical study with an investigational product during the
