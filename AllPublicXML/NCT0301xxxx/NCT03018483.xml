      The aim of this multicenter, randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the weaning time from
      mechanical ventilation comparing non-variable PSV, variable PSV, and Smart CareTM.

      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled open trial comparing variable, non-variable
      pressure support ventilation and Smart CareTM in patients receiving mechanical ventilation
      for more than 24 hours who are able to be weaned.

      The aim of the study is to determine the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation for
      each one of the above mentioned weaning methods

    <description>Pressure support is to a targeted mean tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml/kg; the maximal inspiratory pressure ≤40 cmH2O; the flow trigger is set at 2 l/min; inspiratory cycling-off at 25% of peak flow; PEEP and FiO2 for oxygen saturation SaO2 ≥92%, with PEEP ≥5 cmH2O.
In patients ventilated with variable PSV, the pressure support variability is as high as possible (up to 100%), while not exceeding the maximal inspiratory pressure determined by the treating physician.</description>

    <description>Pressure support is to a targeted mean tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml/kg; the maximal inspiratory pressure ≤40 cmH2O; the flow trigger is set at 2 l/min; inspiratory cycling-off at 25% of peak flow; PEEP and FiO2 for oxygen saturation SaO2 ≥92%, with PEEP ≥5 cmH2O. The adjustment of pressure support until extubation follows these rules for both non-variable and variable PSV groups: pressure support is gradually adjusted in decrements (or increments) of 0 to 5 cmH2O. PEEP is decreased in steps of 0 to 5 cmH2O; PEEP and FiO2 are adjusted to achieve a SaO2 ≥92%, with a PEEP ≥5 cmH2O.</description>
