    <textblock>
      The potential benefit of using the cap is that it helps in luminal orientation at bends by
      keeping the colonic mucosa away from the lens at the colonoscope tip. Colonoscopy in patients
      with a history of abdominal surgery is considered to be difficult due to adhesion-related
      bowel angulations. There were few study evaluating usefulness of cap-assisted colonoscopy in
      patients with prior abdominal surgery. The investigators designed a randomized, controlled
      trial to verify the usefulness of cap-assisted colonoscopy in patients with prior abdominal
      surgery.

      The potential benefit of using the cap is that it helps in luminal orientation at bends by
      keeping the colonic mucosa away from the lens at the colonoscope tip. This assists in
      negotiating sharp turns by better anticipation of the direction. Cap-assisted colonoscopy can
      be tried as a salvage procedure in cases of failed cecal intubation with regular colonoscopy.
