  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Structural valve dysfunction (SVD) is the most common and life threatening complication in
      patients treated by aortic valve replacement. A calcification process is frequently involved
      in SVD but its pathophysiology remains unclear. In the hypothesis of an active metabolic
      phenomenon of calcification, as previously shown in native aortic valve stenosis, rather than
      a passive deposit of calcium in valve tissue, positon emission tomography (PET) imaging with
      18F-Fluoride could emphasize increased osteoblastic activity in SVD tissue.

      This study will include patients with echocardiography-confirmed SVD. Echocardiographic
      parameters and other current parameters analyzed in SVD patients such as bioprosthesis
      calcium scoring derived from CT will be compared to 18F-Fluoride activity.

    <description>18F-Fluoride activity in valvular tissue will be determined by a tissue to bloodpool ratio of SUV (TBR). Patients will be divided in two groups : moderate SVD (EOA ≥ 0.8 and ≤ 1.2 cm²), and severe SVD (EOA ≤ 0.8 cm²), and TBR will be compared between the two groups, determined at time of inclusion.</description>
