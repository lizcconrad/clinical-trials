  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a community-based randomized controlled trial designed to test the
      effectiveness of two point-of-use water treatment technologies to improve clean drinking
      water access, reduce enteropathogen burden, and improve child growth among children in
      Limpopo, South Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lack of access to safe water in low-resource settings likely contributes to stunted growth
      early in life, which affects more than a quarter of children under 5 years worldwide.
      Point-of-use water treatment technologies have the potential to provide effective and
      low-cost solutions to improving quality of drinking water in these settings. One such
      technology, a silver-impregnated ceramic disk, continually disinfects water in household
      water storage containers by diffusing silver into the water for daily treatment of 10 to 15
      liters for at least six months. Silver-impregnated ceramic water filters are another
      commercially available technology that additionally remove pathogens mechanically. While both
      technologies have proven to be highly effective in treating water, it is unknown whether the
      use of these technologies will translate to improvements in child health outcomes. This
      community-based intervention trial will estimate the effect of the silver-impregnated ceramic
      disk and a silver-impregnated ceramic water filter on linear growth of children in Limpopo,
      South Africa.

      Households in the Dzimauli community will be randomized to receive the ceramic disk, a water
      filter, the safe-storage water container alone, or no intervention. Children will be followed
      every three months for 2 years to assess height, weight, and pathogen burden in stool
      samples. Cognitive assessments will be completed at 2, 5, and 7 years of follow-up. The
      investigators hypothesize that children in households given the ceramic disk or the water
      filter will show improved linear growth compared to those in households without these
      interventions. The investigators expect that the ceramic disk will perform similarly to the
      water filter and result in similar improvements in linear growth when compared to children
      from control households.

      Estimates of effectiveness demonstrated in this trial will provide the necessary evidence
      base to support the scale-up of manufacturing and distribution of the ceramic disks and
      filters, which could provide a robust point-of-use water treatment solution for rural areas.
      By helping to identify effective tools to reduce the risk of stunting in children, the trial
      will contribute to targets to improve child health in low-resource settings.

In July 2017, all households in the MadiDrop arm were crossed over to the ceramic water filter arm due to inconsistent silver release from the ceramic tablets.</description>

    <description>A silver-impregnated ceramic disk used for drinking water treatment that was developed by engineers at the University of Virginia. When the ceramic disk is placed in a household water storage container, silver diffuses through the porous ceramic into the water at a release rate that is effective for continual disinfection of waterborne pathogens while remaining below the silver drinking water standard. The disk is effective for daily treatment of 10 to 15 liters for at least six months.
This intervention was removed from the study in July 2017 (approximately at 1 year of follow-up).</description>

    <description>Silver-impregnated ceramic water filter are well-developed, tested, and widely-used devices. In addition to mechanically removing pathogens, the filter is treated with silver to reduce live pathogens that pass through the filter and to provide residual disinfectant to reduce risk of recontamination after treatment.
This intervention was replaced with ceramic filters without silver in Dec 2017 (approximately at 1.5 years of follow-up).</description>
