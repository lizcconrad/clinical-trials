  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective monocentric study of PICC Line complications use in 5 medical and one
      surgical units of Brest Medical University Hospital.

      To evaluate the incidence of the following complications: infections, thromboses, mechanical
      and hemorrhagic, at month 3 post-intervention.

      Also evaluating:

        -  the management of these PICC Line related complications,

        -  risk factors for such complications,

        -  and the mortality-related outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All eligible patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, after PICC Line placement, will
      receive oral and written patient information describing the study deployment and follow-up.
      Patients will be followed up until PICC Line removal if it occurs during the first 3 months
      after placement or until death if it occurs during the first 3 months, or during 3 months in
      the absence of complications.

        -  Infectious complications are described in accordance with IDSA 2009 guidelines and
           include bloodstream infection, endocarditis, local infection and septic
           thrombophlebitis.

        -  Thrombotic complications are defined as symptomatic, deep, or superficial venous
           thrombosis, confirmed by Ultrasound and Echo-Doppler or asymptomatic venous thrombosis
           diagnosed fortuitously.

        -  Mechanical complications are defined as impairments related to PICC Line device:
           occlusion, rupture, accidental removal.

        -  Hemorrhagic complications are defined as hematoma or bleedings of puncture site.

      In the event of PICC Line-related complications, patient will be followed up for an
      additional 3 months, from the date of complication diagnosis, i.e. maximum follow-up duration
      of 6 months.

      Each week during the first month, then once monthly during the follow-up (i.e. W1, W2, W3,
      W4, M2, M3, +/- M4, M5, M6), all patients data related to the PICC Line retention or removal,
      use and all its related complications will be collected.
