  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently it has been reported that a consistent percentage of the general population consider
      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though
      they do not have CD or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named Non-Celiac
      Gluten Sensitivity' (NCGS). In a previous paper the investigators suggested the term
      'Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity' (NCWS), since it is not known what component of wheat causes
      the symptoms in NCGS patients, and the investigators also showed that these patients had a
      high frequency of coexistent multiple food hypersensitivity. The clinical picture of NCWS is
      characterized by combined gastrointestinal (bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or
      constipation, nausea, epigastric pain, gastroesophageal reflux, aphthous stomatitis) and
      extra-intestinal and/or systemic manifestations (headache, depression, anxiety, 'foggy mind,'
      tiredness, dermatitis or skin rash, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,
      and anemia). Nowadays no data are available on the abdominal ultrasonographic features of
      NCWS patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the abdominal
      ultrasonographic features of NCWS patients in comparison with patients affected with celiac
      disease.

      tiredness, dermatitis or skin rash, fibromyalgia-like joint/muscle pain, leg or arm numbness,
      and anemia). The researchers have just demonstrated in patients affected with seronegative
      celiac disease that the presence of dilated bowel loops and a thickened small bowel wall had
      a sensitivity of 83% and a negative predictive value of 95% in CD diagnosis. Considering the
      presence of one of these two signs, abdominal US sensitivity increased to 92% and negative
      predictive value to 98%. Nowadays no data are available on the abdominal ultrasonographic
      features of NCWS patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate the
      abdominal ultrasonographic features of NCWS patients in comparison with patients affected
      with celiac disease.

        The study included consecutive adult patients with IBS-like clinical presentation,
        according to Rome III criteria, and a definitive diagnosis of NCWS, referred at the
        Department of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital of Palermo, Italy, and at the
        Department of Internal Medicine of the Hospital of Sciacca, Agrigento, Italy, between
        January 2015 and November 2016, and sex- and age-matched subjects with CD, enrolled at the
        same centers, as controls patients. All subjects undergone abdominal ultrasonography at the
        Outpatient of Ultrasonography of the Department of Internal Medicine at the University
        Hospital of Palermo, Italy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To diagnose NCWS the recently proposed criteria will be adopted. All the patients will meet
        the following criteria:

          -  negative serum anti-transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysium (EmA)
             immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG antibodies

          -  absence of intestinal villous atrophy

          -  negative IgE-mediated immune-allergy tests to wheat (skin prick tests and/or serum
             specific IgE detection)

          -  resolution of the IBS symptoms on standard elimination diet, excluding wheat, cow's
             milk, egg, tomato, chocolate, and other self-reported food(s) causing symptoms

          -  symptom reappearance on double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge. As the
             investigators previously described in other studies, DBPC cow's milk protein challenge
             and other &quot;open&quot; food challenges will be performed too.

        To diagnose CD the standard criteria will be adopted. All the patients will meet the
        following criteria:

          -  positive serum anti-transglutaminase (anti-tTG) and anti-endomysium (EmA)
             immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG antibodies

          -  presence of intestinal villous atrophy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        NCWS diagnosis excluded patients with:

          -  positive EmA in the culture medium of the duodenal biopsies, also in the case of
             normal villi/crypts ratio in the duodenal mucosa

          -  self-exclusion of wheat from the diet and refusal to reintroduce it before entering
             the study

          -  other previously diagnosed gastrointestinal disorders

          -  nervous system disease and/or major psychiatric disorder

          -  physical impairment limiting physical activity.
