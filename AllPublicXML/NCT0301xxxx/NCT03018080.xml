    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the following
      two regimens: Cohort A) phased regimen of pembrolizumab in which paclitaxel is followed by
      paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab and Cohort B) concurrent regimen of paclitaxel plus
      pembrolizumab. The primary safety objective is to evaluate the overall grade 3 or 4
      treatment-related adverse event rate for each cohort and compare them to relevant historical
      controls.

      This is an open-label randomized pilot research study to determine if the study drug,
      pembrolizumab, is safe to use in combination with a chemotherapy drug called paclitaxel. This
      study will have the following two regimens: Cohort A) phased regimen of pembrolizumab in
      which paclitaxel is followed by paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab and Cohort B) concurrent
      regimen of paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab. A total of 40 evaluable subjects will be enrolled
      over an enrollment period of 18-24 months. The study is planned to enroll approximately 20
      evaluable subjects in each treatment cohort.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytological confirmed diagnosis of HER2-negative metastatic breast
             cancer or locally advanced disease not amenable to resection.

             Available ER and PR status from tumor sample with either hormone receptor positive or
             negative tumor.

             For subjects with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer,
             they are eligible if they have already received or been intolerant to at least two
             lines of endocrine therapies, or are appropriate candidates for chemotherapy (such as
             large burden of visceral disease).

          2. Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1, or evaluable bone disease, i.e., bone lesions that
             are lytic or mixed (lytic and sclerotic) in the absence of measurable lesion.

          3. Male or female age 18 years of age or older.

          4. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2.

          5. Must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

             Hematologic

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL

               -  Platelets ≥ 75,000/mcL

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

             Renal

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5X ULN or

               -  Measured or calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min for subject with
                  creatinine levels &gt; 1.5X ULN (CrCl should be calculated per institutional
                  standard; GFR can also be used in place of creatinine or CrCl)

             Hepatic

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5X ULN or for subjects with total bilirubin levels &gt;1.5X ULN,
                  direct bilirubin ≤ULN

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5X ULN

             Coagulation

               -  PT and PTT ≤ 1.5X ULN; subjects receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if
                  PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants per
                  investigator discretion.

               -  INR ≤ 1.5; Patients receiving anticoagulant therapy are eligible if their INR is
                  stable and within the recommended range for the desired level of anticoagulation
                  per investigator discretion.

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to receiving C1D1.

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of
             birth control, be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the
             course of the study and 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year. Male subjects of reproductive potential should
             agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study
             therapy and 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Abstinence is acceptable if
             this is the established and preferred contraception for the subject.

          8. Available tumor tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a metastatic
             tumor lesion. For locally advanced disease, biopsy of the breast tumor or other
             regional areas is acceptable. Recently obtained tissue collected within 8 weeks prior
             to treatment on Cycle 1, Day 1 is acceptable.

             Note: Subjects for whom tumor biopsies cannot be newly obtained (i.e. inaccessible
             tumor or subject safety concern) may submit an archived tumor specimen from primary
             tumor or metastatic biopsy collected within 6 months from consent.

          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign the written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects must not meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy within 3 weeks, prior targeted small molecule therapy or radiation
             therapy within 2 weeks, or prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody for direct
             anti-neoplastic treatment within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          2. Not recovered (i.e. ≤ Grade 1) from adverse events due to agents previously
             administered.

             Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia of any grade are an exception and
             may qualify for the study.

          3. More than three prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease or for locally
             advanced disease that is not amenable to resection.

             Note: Non-Chemotherapy regimens do not count as prior lines (for example, hormonals,
             biologics)

          4. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2 agent or with an
             agent directed to another co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137) or
             has participated in Merck MK-3475 trial(s).

          5. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1

          6. Has had major surgery within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          7. Has received any other investigational agents within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1 of study
             therapy.

          8. Known active uncontrolled or symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases
             and/or carcinomatous meningitis as indicated by clinical symptoms, cerebral edema,
             and/or progressive growth.

             Note: Subjects with treated CNS metastases are eligible if they are asymptomatic, have
             no requirement for steroids, no requirement for anticonvulsants, and stable CNS
             radiographic study showing no significant vasogenic edema ≥ 4 weeks since completion
             of radiation and ≥ 2 weeks since discontinuation of steroids.

          9. History of known allergic reaction to paclitaxel

         10. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the
             trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of
             the treating investigator.

         11. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment. Pregnant women are excluded from this study
             because paclitaxel is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with paclitaxel, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with paclitaxel. These potential risks also
             apply to pembrolizumab being used in this study.

         12. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or known acquired
             immunodeficiency disorder (AIDS). HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             paclitaxel and pembrolizumab. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

         13. Has known active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

         14. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs).

             Replacement therapy (i.e., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         15. Has a known additional malignancy that progressed or required active treatment within
             the last 5 years.

             Note: Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy, or in situ cervical cancer.

         16. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.

         17. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         18. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 of study therapy.

        Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
        are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist) are live attenuated
        vaccines, and are not allowed.
