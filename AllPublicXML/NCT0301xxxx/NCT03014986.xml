      The availability of novel therapies with DAAs might prompt clinicians caring for HSCT
      recipients with HCV infection to prescribe the treatment more frequently and possibly earlier
      after HSCT. Since numerous possible therapeutic combinations exist, the choice of the most
      appropriate one is not straightforward. It depends not only on its efficacy, toxicity and
      rate of pharmacological interactions, but also on availability (both through healthcare
      system and in expanded access programs), and cost.

      This observational prospective study will focus on treatment strategies in HSCT recipients
      with HCV infection. The main focus will be the therapeutic approach, the combination of drugs
      chosen, the length of treatment and the outcome. The main reasons for treating or not
      treating HSCT recipients with HCV infection will be also explored. Compared to previous
      cohorts, this study might provide additional data in the area of non-invasive assessment of
      fibrosis, HCV-RNA levels and genotyping.

      In order to get as much data as possible on HCV treatment, patients with chronic HCV
      infection transplanted during the last 10 years will be included.

      Finally the prevalence of HCV-RNA positive patients among those transplanted in the year 2016
      will be reported.

      Introduction:

      According to previous EBMT studies, approximately 6% of HSCT recipients were HCV-positive
      (Locasciulli et al. Transplantation 1999). Despite the fact that HSCT recipients with chronic
      HCV infection are prone to HCV-morbidity (end stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma,
      the need for liver transplant), only about half (44% and 61%) of long term survivors of HSCT
      were offered specific treatment (Ljungman et al. BMT 2012; Peffault de Latour et al. BMT
      2005). The median time from HSCT to treatment was long and the efficacy was far from
      satisfactory (approximately 50%) (Ljungman et al. BMT 2012). Since 2011 novel oral directly
      acting antiviral agents (DAA) have been developed and marketed. DAAs offer the advantage of
      higher efficacy, shorter duration and reduced treatment toxicity; together with the
      possibility of exclusively oral, interferon- or interferon/ribavirin-free regimens.

      Short description of the study:

      The availability of novel therapies with DAAs might prompt clinicians caring for HSCT
      recipients with HCV infection to prescribe the treatment more frequently and possibly earlier
      after HSCT. Since numerous possible therapeutic combinations exist, the choice of the most
      appropriate one is not straightforward. It depends not only on its efficacy, toxicity and
      rate of pharmacological interactions, but also on availability (both through healthcare
      system and in expanded access programs), and cost.

      This observational prospective study will focus on treatment strategies in HSCT recipients
      with HCV infection. The main focus will be the therapeutic approach, the combination of drugs
      chosen, the length of treatment and the outcome. The main reasons for treating or not
      treating HSCT recipients with HCV infection will be also explored. Compared to previous
      cohorts, this study might provide additional data in the area of non-invasive assessment of
      fibrosis, HCV-RNA levels and genotyping.

      In order to get as much data as possible on HCV treatment, patients with chronic HCV
      infection transplanted during the last 10 years will be included.

      Finally the prevalence of HCV-RNA positive patients among those transplanted in the year 2016
      will be reported.

      Research design:

      Over the period of 24 months, all HCV-RNA positive patients who received autologous or
      allogeneic transplant from any time to May 2017 and are followed at transplant centres will
      be enrolled.

      Data regarding the patients who are receiving (or has recently received) HCV treatment (group
      1) will be collected in Form 1 (FORM 1 - HCV TREATMENT) and 6 months after the end of
      treatment in Form 4 (FORM 4 - POST HCV TREATMENT FOLLOW UP FORM)

      Data regarding the baseline characteristics of HCV-RNA positive patients who are not being
      treated (group 2) will be collected in Form 2 (FORM 2 - HCV-RNA positive patients - BASELINE)
      and then at the end of the recruitment period (December 2017 +/- 3 months) in Form 3 (FORM 3
      - HCV-RNA positive patients - FOLLOW UP FORM).

      If patients from group 2 start treatment, their data thereafter should be reported in Form 1
      and then Form 4.

      Including: Duration of the study Recruitment period (visits date for HCV-RNA+ patients)
      starts December 2015 till November 2017. All the patients will be followed for a minimum
      additional period of 6 months from the end of recruitment period.

      Patients, in whom HCV treatment started before December 2015, will be also included if
      followed during the study period with the aim of establishing the efficacy of the recent
      HCV-treatment (HCV-RNA testing to establish SVR at 12 and 24 weeks after EOT).

      Study Population:

      All HCV-RNA positive patients transplanted from anytime until May 2017, followed from
      December 2015 to November 2017.
