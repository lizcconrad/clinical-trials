  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research deals with behaviors that are part of opioid dependence. The purpose is to
      study how stress and medication dose can affect opioid drug use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will last for about 6-months. Participants will live on a residential unit for a
      minimum of 3 nights on 4 separate weeks (every other week). Participants will live on the
      residential unit for a total of 12 nights over this 7-week period. During that time,
      participants can't leave the unit unescorted or have visitors.

      For the entire 11-week time, participants will receive a medication called
      Buprenorphine/Naloxone. Buprenorphine/Naloxone is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat opioid addiction, and is a safe and effective alternative to
      methadone. Participants will receive this medication every day. When participants are not
      living on the inpatient unit they will come to the research clinic every day to receive the
      medication.

      On the 12 days while participants are an inpatient they will participate in experimental
      sessions that involve drug administration. On some days participants will receive morphine
      and on some days participants will receive oral medications called yohimbine and
      hydrocortisone that will be used to study stress responses.

      At the end of the study participants will be detoxified from the Buprenorphine/Naloxone
      medication over a 4-week outpatient period.

      Finally, after the detoxification phase is complete participants will be asked to come in for
      3 separate in-person follow-up visits in which participants will be asked to provide a urine
      sample and will be asked questions about their drug use.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Opioid dependent, as determined by structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and
             Addiction Severity Index (ASI)

          -  Positive urine test for opiates

          -  Willing to use an adequate form of contraception for the duration of the study.

             testing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No candidate who has a current DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than Drug Dependence or a

          -  Candidates meeting criteria for opioid or nicotine dependence will not be excluded,

             alcohol free breath specimen.

          -  No candidate with medical (neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary or systemic)
             disorders will be allowed to participate. This will be determined with history and
             physical exam, standard laboratory testing (blood and urine), EKG, and TB tests (to
             avoid transmitting this communicable disease on the residential unit or in the
             laboratory).

          -  Candidates with evidence of cognitive impairment (based on reading ability and
             comprehension, will be excluded.

          -  Female candidates who are pregnant (urine pregnancy test), lactating, or not using
             adequate birth control methods (self-report) will be excluded.

          -  Candidates with injection phobia, or seeking treatment for opioid dependence will be
             excluded.
