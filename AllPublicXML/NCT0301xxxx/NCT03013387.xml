    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 peptide receptor radionuclide therapy trial of 90Y-DOTATOC in patients with
      somatostatin receptor positive tumors. The somatostatin receptor targeting of the therapeutic
      will be checked with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT imaging prior to therapy. Treatment consists of 3
      cycles, 6-8 weeks apart. Cycle 1 dose is fixed with Cycles 2 and 3 doses to be determined by
      dosimetry-based calculation of renal doses from previous cycles not to exceed 23 Gy for the
      total renal dose.

      The goals of the project are to

        1. Demonstrate safety and efficacy of renal uptake dosimetry-guided peptide receptor
           radiotherapy (PRRT) using 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) in patients with
           neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.

        2. Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using
           90Y-DOTATOC.

        3. Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) PET/CT as an accurate technique for
           diagnosis, staging, treatment targeting, and monitoring response to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.

    <description>Tumor response defined according to RECIST1.1 criteria applied on up to five target lesions (primary tumor, up to two: liver lesions, nodal metastases, and a metastatic lesion in other organs) that will be quantified and compared between pre-therapy and 3-9 months post-therapy high-resolution, contrast-enhanced CTs. 90Y-DOTATOC will be deemed worthy of further study if its associated response rate is ≥ 0.60, and clinically uninteresting if its rate is ≤ 0.40. Enrollment will proceed according to an optimal Simon two-stage study design. Sixteen (16) enrolled in the first stage; if 7 or fewer patients respond, the arm will be closed and the treatment ruled clinically uninteresting. Otherwise, an additional 30 will be enrolled. If 24 or more responses are observed in the total of 46 subjects, then the treatment will be ruled worthy. The study design has a probability of early termination equal to 0.72. Power to detect efficacy is 0.80 with a type 1 error rate of 0.05.</description>

    <description>Adverse events will be recorded and reported in tabular form by type and grade. If four or more subjects experience renal toxicity ≥ Grade 4, the radiopharmaceutical will be declared too toxic and the trial will be stopped. If any other irreversible Grade 4 toxicity is observed in four or more subjects, the treatment will be declared too toxic and will be stopped. Adverse events will be graded according to the most recent CTE guidelines.</description>

    <measure>Determine response to therapy of lesions identified by 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT but not identified on Octreoscan as a confirmatory measure of true positivity of the Ga-68 DOTATOC avid lesion</measure>
    <time_frame>Lesions will be quantified and compared between pre-therapy and through follow-up visits: 1) occurring 3-4 months after treatment 3 and 2) occurring 6-9 months after treatment 3</time_frame>
    <description>For subjects who participated in the 68Ga-DOTATOC Comparator trial (IRB # 201212736), the number, size, and location of discordant lesions between 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT and Octreoscan will have been tabulated. This analysis will be updated using the results of post- therapy 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT for those patients who participated in the comparator study, but only received the initial 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT due to progression on the Octreoscan + high-resolution, contrast-enhanced CT. Lesions that were positive on PET, but negative on Octreoscan will be considered true positive if a response to PRRT is documented after either Cycle 1 or at 6-9 month followup following last 90Y-DOTATOC infusion.
For subjects who did not participate in the 68Ga-DOTATOC Comparator trial, all 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT scans will be acquired as part of this study; number, size, and location of lesions will be analyzed between first and subsequent 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CTs.</description>

    <measure>Determine if Standard Uptake Value (SUV) on initial 68Ga-DOTATOC PET imaging correlates with SSTR2 expression as measured by quantitative messenger RNA (qPCR) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) on the diagnostic biopsy specimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Lesions will be quantified and compared between pre-therapy and through follow-up visits: 1) occurring 3-4 months after treatment 3 and 2) occurring 6-9 months after treatment 3</time_frame>
    <description>Compare maximum SUVs of primary tumor, liver lesions, and extra-hepatic lesions with expression level of sst2 RNA and IHC on fresh frozen tissue, or paraffin embedded samples (block(s) or 10 unstained slides) to determine whether or not any correlation exists between SUVmax, sst2 expression, or sst2 protein and response to PRRT. The study is expected to delineate whether measurement of sst2 expression by either qRT-PCT or immunohistochemistry at diagnosis can predict response to 90Y-DOTATOC. We will construct a table tabulating SUVmax, level of RNA expression, and IHC level for all lesions biopsied. With 64 subjects the correlation between SUV max, RNA expression and IHC will be determined. Analysis of SUVmax compared with sst2 RNA and receptor protein expression on primary tumor and metastatic lesions will be considered worthy of further study if &gt; 50% of lesions demonstrate a positive correlation.</description>

         11. The effects of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, women and men of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study

         12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 90Y-DOTATOC is a Class C agent
             with potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

          2. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with 90Y-DOTATOC, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued until 6 weeks after the last administration of study drug.

          3. Surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.

          4. External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of &lt;500 cGy to a single kidney
             or radiation to &lt; 50% of a single kidney is acceptable).

             this malignancy.

          6. Another investigational drug within 4 weeks of study drug administration.

          7. Concurrent, malignant disease for which patient is on active therapy.

          8. Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently
             uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to
             complete this protocol.

          9. Any subject for whom, in the opinion of their physician, a 12-hour discontinuation of
             somatostatin analogue therapy represents a health risk. Also subjects who have
             received long-acting somatostatin analogue in the past 28 days or long-acting
             lanreotide within the past 8 weeks are excluded. Subjects may be maintained on short
             acting octreotide during the time from last injection of long-acting somatostatin
             analogue until 12 hrs prior to injection of study drug. Known antibodies to
             Octreotide, Lanreotide, or DOTATOC or history of allergic reactions attributed to
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 90Y-DOTATOC.

         10. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) of study drug administration or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

         11. Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

         12. Subject weighs more than 450 pounds. (Subjects who weigh more than 450 pounds will not
             be able to fit inside the imaging machines.)

         13. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (due to cough, severe arthritis,
             etc.)
