    <measure>Change in Muscle Activity as Assessed by Surface Electromyography (EMG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Surface EMG sensors will be placed on the skin of subjects' lower extremities and trunk to measure muscle activity. Only one participant data was analyzed. Emg was recorded from the soleus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, rectus femoris, vastus medialis, bicep femoris and semitendinosus muscles. The outcome measure is the %age change between the baseline and 4 week assessments. Negative values denotes decrease in muscle activity at 4 week compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Gait Characteristics as Assessed by the GAITRite Walkway (Step Time)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Gait quality will be measured with the GAITRite Walkway which can quantify step cadence, step length, step time, double support time, and symmetry. The outcome measure is the difference in step time between pre and post assessment. Negative value denotes decrease in step time (implying faster step time at post).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Lower Extremity Strength as Assessed by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Lower Extremity Motor Score (LEMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) assessment protocol consists of two sensory examinations, a motor examination and a classification framework (the impairment scale) to quantify the severity of the spinal cord injury. The scale informs about the functionality of the patient. The range of scores is 0 to 5, and high values represent better outcome. Following is the description of the range:
0 = total paralysis
= palpable or visible contraction
= active movement, full range of motion (ROM) with gravity eliminated
= active movement, full ROM against gravity
= active movement, full ROM against gravity and moderate resistance in a muscle specific position
= (normal) active movement, full ROM against gravity and full resistance in a functional muscle position expected from an otherwise unimpaired person
We report the difference between baseline and 4week assessments. Negative value denotes decrease at post assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exoskeleton User Feedback as Assessed by a Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>week 4</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire will be administered to allow participants to provide feedback regarding their experiences during training sessions with the exoskeleton. The units on a scale was used to measure the feedback. The range of the scale was 1-5. '1' refers to very satisfied and '5' refers to very dissatisfied. '1' refers to a better outcome.</description>

Subjects will participate in individualized treatment sessions which may include: sit to stand, static and dynamic standing balance, weight shifting, walking, turning, and stand to sit. Each training session will last up to 90 minutes (60 minutes of training with 30 minutes for setup, don/doff of device) and training will be held 5 days per week for 3 weeks with a total of 15 sessions. During the training period, subjects will be required to maintain the same amount and level of regular daily physical activity and exercise.</description>

        <title>Change in Lower Extremity Strength as Assessed by American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Lower Extremity Motor Score (LEMS)</title>
        <description>The ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) assessment protocol consists of two sensory examinations, a motor examination and a classification framework (the impairment scale) to quantify the severity of the spinal cord injury. The scale informs about the functionality of the patient. The range of scores is 0 to 5, and high values represent better outcome. Following is the description of the range:
0 = total paralysis
= palpable or visible contraction
= active movement, full range of motion (ROM) with gravity eliminated
= active movement, full ROM against gravity
= active movement, full ROM against gravity and moderate resistance in a muscle specific position
= (normal) active movement, full ROM against gravity and full resistance in a functional muscle position expected from an otherwise unimpaired person
We report the difference between baseline and 4week assessments. Negative value denotes decrease at post assessment.</description>
