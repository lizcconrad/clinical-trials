  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with immunosenescence and impaired host defense mechanisms, contributing
      to influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Preliminary data demonstrate that the platelet
      transcriptome is markedly different between healthy subjects and influenza patients.
      Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITM) family members are among the transcripts
      significantly increased in platelets during influenza and expression of IFITM-3 is impaired
      in elderly subjects, a pattern associated with increased mortality. This study will build on
      these data and investigate if aging influences the expression of platelet IFITM family
      members in patients with influenza and sepsis.

      This study will prospectively determine if aging alters the induction of (IFITMs) in
      platelets from hospitalized influenza and sepsis patients. The study will also determine if
      diminished expression of IFITM family members correlates with an increased risk of adverse
      outcomes in older influenza and sepsis patients.

    <description>For the increased risk of mortality outcome, 90-day mortality will be the primary outcome variable. This will be modeled using mixed effects logistic regression, using days 0, 3, and 7 as repeated measurements. In this fashion, IFITM-3 and mortality are time-varying. A separate model will be fitted for the younger and older groups, since age group is expected to be collinear with IFITM-3 protein.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>28 day mortality</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The same sample of influenza patients will be used for mortality analysis. Based on published and unpublished data, 28-day mortality in critically-ill influenza patients admitted to ICUs ranges from 10-40%, even during non-pandemic periods. Based on these estimates, our sample size (n=75 younger and n=75 older) provides 84% power (two-sided alpha 0.05 comparison) to detect a difference in incidence of 29% and 9%, which is a conservative estimate of the difference between the younger and older groups.</description>

    <description>Recent evidence also demonstrates that IFITM-3 acts as a membrane organizer by facilitating clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). This membrane-organizing process allows cells to internalize molecules and viruses. CME regulates platelet membrane organization. IFITM-3 is demonstrated as necessary for host defenses against influenza virus. Moreover, with absent or reduced levels of IFITM-3, cells do not effectively restrict viral replication, an impaired response that may influence adverse clinical outcomes.</description>

    <time_frame>24(±12) hours of diagnosis (day 0 or 1), day 3, 5, and 90.</time_frame>
    <description>Platelet IFITM-3 protein levels have been seen to be increased in influenza patients and correlated with IFITM-3 mRNA (r2=0.33, p&lt;0.005). However, in hospitalized influenza patients, platelet IFITM-3 mRNA and protein expression was decreased in older, compared to young patients.
It is hypothesized that influenza will induce expression of IFITM family members in platelets; IFITM's expression will be reduced in older compared to young influenza patients. This hypothesis will be tested to determine whether or not influenza induces IFITM-3 expression in human platelets and compare older and young subjects. Here, an outcome of IFITM-3 protein will be tracked in conjunction with mRNA.</description>
