    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of a dietary intervention in post-treatment head and neck
      cancer survivors on the ability to function physically, tiredness, and quality of life, as
      well as on changing markers in the blood that are associated with better recurrence and
      survival.

    <description>A questionnaire will collect a set of covariates used in the analyses (i.e., these do not represent individual outcomes; this is a group of covariates used in the data analyses). This group includes demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, income); lifestyle behaviors (tobacco use, alcohol consumption, exercise); medical history; cancer-specific clinical variables (tumor site, cancer stage, treatment modality); anthropometrics (height and weight)</description>
