    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a breastfeeding self-efficacy
      promotion intervention. More specifically our objectives were to: explore changes in
      self-efficacy following the intervention; explore changes in the initiation and maintenance
      of breastfeeding following the intervention.

      Breastfeeding is the optimal choice for feeding infants in order to ensure a healthy growth
      and development. Although breastfeeding has many benefits for the infant and the mother,
      breastfeeding rates drop drastically during the first three months after birth. There is a
      number of factors that influence the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding. One of the
      key factors is maternal self-efficacy in relation to breastfeeding. The aim of the study was
      the development and evaluation of an intervention to enhance maternal perceived self-efficacy
      in order to contribute positively to the initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding. This
      was done by using a complex intervention approach (MRC framework) to design and assess a
      multi-center controlled trial, involving midwives and nurses working at the Complejo
      Hospitalario de Navarra (CHN) of the Servicio Navarro de Salud and at the Clínica Universidad
      de Navarra (CUN). These health professionals were trained to deliver the intervention. The
      intervention was focused on self-efficacy related aspects and took place at three instances
      with every mother: in the final stage of pregnancy, during the maternal hospital stay after
      giving birth, and in the first days after discharge. The participants in the control group
      received the standard care as provided in each health institution.

    <description>The intervention consisted on breastfeeding support at three stages: a) week 28-39 pregnancy: women were provided with written information and watch a breastfeeding self-efficacy enhancing video; b) during hospitalization after birth: based on their responses to the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF) questionnaire and the observation of a whole breastfeed, nurses provided specific advice using active listening. All the relevant information was registered; c) within one week after birth: a nurse or midwife made a phone call to follow-up mothers breastfeeding behaviour, addressing issues that during the hospitalization needed reinforcement, solving any question or matter that they had and providing positive reinforcement.</description>

    <description>This group received standard antenatal and postnatal care by midwives and nurses caring for them during their regular antenatal visits and after delivery.
The professionals delivering the intervention were the same than those providing the standard care. That was the reason to first collect the data from the control group and after that organising the training of health professionals to deliver de intervention.</description>
