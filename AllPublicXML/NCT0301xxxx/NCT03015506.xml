  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the glycemic index of 4 pulse-based breads in at
      least 10 normal healthy human volunteers. Participants will be studied in the morning on 6
      separate days after overnight fasts. On the first and last days they will consume a test meal
      consisting of about 2 slices of white bread (50g carbohydrate) and on the other 4 days they
      will consume 2-3 slices (50g carbohydrate) from 4 different test breads containing starch
      obtained from pulses (beans and/or lentils). Blood glucose will be measured at intervals over
      2 hours. Glycemic index is calculated as 0.71 times F/WB where F is the incremental area
      under the curve of blood glucose (AUC) after each test bread and WB is the mean AUC after
      white bread.

    <description>Glycemic index is 0.71 times F/WB where F is the incremental area under the blood glucose response curve ignoring area below fasting (AUC) elicited by a pulse bread, and WB is the mean AUC elicited by White Bread. AUC is calculated using the trapezoid rule from 2 measures of fasting blood glucose taken 5 minutes apart (the average of these measures is taken to be fasting blood glucose) and measures of blood glucose at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after starting to eat. The mean of the values for each pulse bread in each subject is the glycemic index.</description>
