  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enteral administration of immune-modulating nutrients such as glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids,
      selenium, and antioxidants has been suggested to reduce infections and improve recovery from
      critical illness. However, the effects of colostrum on clinical outcomes in critical ill
      patients has not been investigated. In current trial, intensive care unit patients with
      enteral feeding will receive either enteral colostrum or maltodextrin as placebo.

      A randomized, double blind, controlled trial will be conducted in general intensive care unit
      (ICU) in Tehran, Iran. After a full review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria and
      explanation of the risks and benefits of the study, written consent form will be completed.
      Intervention patients will be received 20 g/day of colostrum along with enteral formula and
      control patients will be received maltodextrin along with enteral formula. Patients will be
      assessed for occurrence of new infection, organ failure, duration of stay in ICU, 28 days and
      6 months mortality and inflammatory and immune markers.
