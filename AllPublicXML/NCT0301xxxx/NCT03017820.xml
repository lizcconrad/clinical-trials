      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant vesicular stomatitis
      virus carrying the human NIS and IFN beta genes (VSV-hIFNbeta-sodium iodide symporter [NIS])
      in treating patients with multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma that
      has come back or does not respond to treatment. A virus, called VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS, which has
      been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill cancer cells without damaging normal
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in patients with
      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS. II. To estimate clinical response
      rate in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell
      lymphoma overall and by disease type.

      III. To estimate progression-free and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma overall and by disease type.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the
      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various times points after infection with
      VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS using planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed
      tomography (CT) imaging.

      II. To assess virus replication, viremia, viral shedding in urine and respiratory secretions,
      and virus persistence after systemic administration of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS.

      III. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS by way of measuring serum
      interferon-beta and also vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-real time (RT)-polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.

      IV. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-IFNbeta-NIS specific) and natural killer (NK)
      cell responses.

      V. Gene expression analysis pre- and post-virotherapy. VI. Assess presence of VSV in tumor
      and normal tissues subsequent to administration of intravenous (IV) VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients receive VSV-IFNbeta-NIS intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, and then
      undergo SPECT/CT 3-5 days later.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days, and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.
