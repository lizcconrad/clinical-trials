  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medically under-served (i.e., low-income, uninsured, underinsured) cancer patients generally
      encounter significant disparities in accessing care for their mental health needs while
      undergoing toxic treatments that provide considerable physical and emotional stress. Thus,
      the investigators propose to adapt evidence-based strategies to a stepped-care intervention
      model to address the mental health needs of under-served lung cancer (LC) and head and neck
      cancer (HNC) patients and their caregivers across several levels of symptom severity (e.g.,
      mild, moderate, or severe symptoms of depression and anxiety).

    <description>Intervention strategies are grounded in evidence-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), that includes stress management and relaxation treatment strategies and coping skills training. Treatment strategies have been adapted from the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping (TMSC), a theoretical model that predicts that individuals who are able to cope and adapt to the stress related to cancer treatment or caregiving will report less psychological distress than those unable to cope.</description>

    <description>Denver Health, St. Mary's and St. Joseph's hospitals provide supportive mental health care for patients such as printed materials, support groups, crisis counseling, and specialized care (e.g., psychiatric medication). Because the amount of usual mental health care that each patient receives varies at each site, the investigators will standardize and monitor the usual care arm across the three sites with an enhanced usual care condition.</description>
