  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hordaland Health Studies (HHS) were conducted in 1992-93 (The Homocysteine study) and in
      1997-99 (HUSK). Both surveys were conducted as a joint project between the University of
      Bergen, the Norwegian Health Screening Service (SHUS) (now part of the National Institute of
      Public Health) and the Municipal Health Service in Hordaland.

      The main focus of the studies is on chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease,
      cancer, osteoporosis, anxiety and depression. Some projects focus on psychosocial factors,
      occupational research, musculoskeletal diseases, urinary incontinence and mapping of drug
      use. The main purpose of the surveys is to gather information so that disease ultimately can
      be prevented.

      Approximately 36,000 residents of Hordaland county participated in the studies, ca. 18,000 in
      1992-93 and ca. 26,000 in 1997-99. About 7,000 of those who participated in the 1992-93
      survey also participated in 1997-99.

    <description>The unique 11-digit personal identification number assigned to all Norwegian residents facilitates linkage between HHS and the Norwegian Population Register, which contains information on vital status (alive, emigrated, or dead). The follow-up period varies from 16 - 23 years, depending on whether first or second measurement is used as baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mortality or morbidity from chronic diseases (for example cardiovascular disease, cancer). Also, award of disability pension are used as an outcome.</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants are followed from baseline (1992-93 or 1997-99) until time of diagnosis/death from disease or the last day of follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The Cause of Death Registry, Cancer Registry of Norway, CVDNOR and FD-trygd (a national database of Health and social benefits) will be used to get information on outcomes. The last day of follow-up for cardiovascular disease is December 31st, 2014. The last day of follow-up for cancer is December 31st, 2014.
The last day of follow-up for Cause of Death is December 31st, 2014. The follow-up period for cardiovascular disease varies from 15 - 22 years, depending on whether first or second measurement is used as baseline.
The follow-up period for cancer varies from 15 - 22 years, depending on whether first or second measurement is used as baseline.</description>
