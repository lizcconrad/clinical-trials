    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the rate and extent of absorption of JNJ-64041575 by
      measuring ALS-008112 plasma concentrations following administration of a single oral dose of
      JNJ-64041575 given as 2 new concept formulations (oral suspension and tablet) compared to
      their respective current formulations under fasted conditions and to assess the effect of
      food on the pharmacokinetics of the 2 new concept formulations under fed condition in healthy
      adult participants.
