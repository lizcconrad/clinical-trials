      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) T cells targeting EpCAM in treating patients with EpCAM positive cancer. In
      the research, the investigators design a novel CAR consists of a EpCAM targeting antibody
      scFv with two intracellular signaling domains derived from CD3 zeta and CD28. Autologous T
      cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a lentivirus vector. Prior to T cell
      infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. The infusion dose is
      (1-10)×106 EpCAM-CAR positive T cells/kg, and the specific cells numbers depends on the
      situation of individual CAR-T cells preparation. The way of infusion is vascular
      interventional mediated or endoscopy, and the cells perfusion process would lasts 15min to
      30min, and the specific time depends on patent's tumor-burdened state. After T cell infusion,
      the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T
      cells and efficacy.
