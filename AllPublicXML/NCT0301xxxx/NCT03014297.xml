      This is a single center, open label, phase I study involving grade I-III
      gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, consisting of a dose escalation Part A followed
      by an expansion cohort Part B. On Part A Patients will be treated with daily oral everolimus.
      Fosbretabulin will be administered IV either q3 weekly or q weekly based on PO CRM cohort.
      Part B: Once the investigators have established an MTD in Part A, the investigators will be
      treating 15 more patients at that dose combination. The primary and secondary objectives of
      the expansion cohort will be similar to Part A of the study, i.e., to establish a safety
      profile of the experimental drug combination and to collect and assess efficacy data.
      Patients will be treated with concurrent everolimus and fosbretabulin for 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      A variety of treatment options are available for NETs with carcinoid syndrome including
      surgical and medical therapies. Most subjects require somatostatin analogs to control the
      symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Subjects who no longer respond to somatostatin and other
      liver-directed therapies, who experience progression of disease and increasing symptoms have
      limited options, including participation in a clinical trial. Recently everolimus and
      sunitinib have been approved for the treatment of subjects with progressive locally advanced
      or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Based on the preclinical data in models of NETs and the
      clinical activity seen in NETS and other tumor types that have existing tumor vascculature,
      this study will examine the effectiveness of fosbretabulin given in combination with
      everolimus in subjects with GI-NETs and PNETs.The vasoconstrictive effect of fosbretabulin is
      potent, though short-lived (4-8 hours), with no cumulative adverse effect. Everolimus
      inhibits angiogenesis, slows tumor growth and has a prolonged half-life (30 hours). Combining
      these two agents with distinctly different mechanisms of action may improve tumor control
      without additional toxicities, and has the potential of reducing drug resistance.

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately.

          -  Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception
             prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after
             completion of fosbretabulin and everolimus administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had prior everolimus but were not able to tolerate a 10 mg daily
             dose.

          -  Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Child Pugh Class B or greater hepatic dysfunction.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases because of their poor prognosis and likelihood to
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to fosbretabulin

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (HTN); sustained blood pressure (BP) greater than 150/100
             mmHg

          -  Must not have had any unstable angina or myocardial infarction within 4 months prior
             to enrollment to treatment, NYHA Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina,
             history of severe coronary artery disease, severe uncontrolled ventricular
             arrhythmias, sick sinus syndrome, or electrocardiographic evidence of acute ischemia
             or Grade 3 conduction system abnormalities unless subject has a pacemaker.

          -  Must not have any evidence of other clinically active cancer and have no history of
             prior malignancy within the past 3 years with the exception of: a) adequately treated
             basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid cancer; b) carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix or breast; c) prostate cancer of Gleason Grade 6 or less and with
             stable prostatespecific antigen levels; or d) cancer considered cured by surgical
             resection or unlikely to impact survival for the duration of the study, such as
             localized transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder or benign tumors of the adrenal
             glands or pancreas.

          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or
             inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because everolimus and fosbretabulin have
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events to nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with these agents, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is
             treated with everolimus and fosbretabulin.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with everolimus and fosbretabulin. In
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrowsuppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be initiated for patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  History of prior cerebrovascular event, (including transient ischemic attack) within 6
             months of start of screening.

          -  Current thrombotic or hemorrhagic disorder/event or history of prior event within 6
             months of start of Screening

          -  Corrected QT interval ([QTc] Fridericia) &gt; 480 ms

          -  Significant vascular disease or recent peripheral arterial thrombosis
