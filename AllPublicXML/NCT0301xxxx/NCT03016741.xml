      This clinical trial studies cognitive function in men with prostate cancer treated with
      androgen receptor directed therapies such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide. The
      investigators use MRI imaging (non-invasive, non-contrast) to see whether there are changes
      in brain structure or activity related to treatment that may be related to changes in
      cognitive function. The investigators are also looking for genetic variations that might make
      patients more or less sensitive to cognitive changes during treatment for prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare cognitive function and associated mediators of cognitive function (quality of
      life, depression, pain, and fatigue) of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (mCRPC) during treatment with enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify characteristics of men with mCRPC associated with change in cognitive function
      during treatment with androgen receptor (AR) directed therapy.

      II. To compare quality of life and associated factors, including fatigue, pain, and
      depression, of men with mCRPC during treatment with enzalutamide and abiraterone acetate.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To analyze whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may be associated with change in
      cognitive function during treatment with AR directed therapy.

      II. To compare the functional and structural components of the brain over time and between
      the brains of men with mCRPC treated with enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate using diffusion
      tensor imaging (DTI), functional MRI (fMRI), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and other advanced
      neuroimaging techniques.

      OUTLINE: Treatment patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer are
      randomized to 1 of 2 arms. Control patients receiving long term androgen deprivation therapy
      will be assessed with the same measures as a control arm.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard of care treatment with gonadotrophin releasing hormone
      (GnRH) agonist/antagonist therapy. Patients also receive abiraterone acetate orally (PO) and
      prednisone PO twice daily (BID) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients then undergo cognitive assessment comprising of neuro-cognitive tests and
      assessments of overall quality of life, fatigue, pain, and symptoms at baseline, 3, 6, and 12
      months. Patients also undergo MRI program for 40 minutes comprising of DTI, fMRI, ASL MRI,
      Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) MRI, Fluid attenuated Inversion Recovery
      (FLAIR) MRI, and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI at baseline and 3 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard of care treatment with GnRH agonist/antagonist therapy.
      Patients also receive enzalutamide PO QD in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo cognitive assessment and MRI program as in Arm I.

      ARM III: Patients receive standard of care treatment with GnRH agonist/antagonist therapy and
      undergo cognitive assessment and MRI program as in Arm I.

    <description>Multivariable linear regression will be utilized to compare the difference in primary outcomes between two allele groups at each time point for each SNP among patients in each treatment group. Baseline scores and other covariates will also be included in the model. Multivariable analyses using data from both treatment groups and control patients at each time point will be performed to identify SNPs whose associations with cognitive function are different between each treatment group and the control patients.
