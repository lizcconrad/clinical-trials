  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole body vibration is an exercise modality that could modulate tissue blood perfusion and
      neural reflexes, and thus may have the potential to alter muscle stiffness through modulation
      of contractile properties or/and neurological adaptation. However, the potential effects of
      WBV on leg muscle stiffness in stroke rehabilitation remains unknown. The overall aim is to
      investigate the effects of whole body vibration (WBV) on leg muscle stiffness and Hoffman
      reflex (H-reflex) and to identify the optimal vibration parameters that may reduce leg muscle
      stiffness among people with stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle stiffness is common among stroke survivors. Leg muscle stiffness would hinder mobility
      and balance function of people with stroke. The whole body vibration is an exercise modality
      that may have beneficial effects in modulating neural reflex and tissue perfusion. Thus, it
      could alter muscle stiffness by modulating reflex activity or muscle contractile properties.
      However, the potential effects of WBV on leg muscle stiffness in stroke rehabilitation
      remains unknown. Scientific evidence is warranted to fill the knowledge gap.

      Purpose This study aims to 1) to investigate effects of whole body vibration (WBV) on leg
      muscle stiffness and reflex activity among people with chronic stroke; 2) to identify the
      optimal vibration parameters that may reduce leg muscle stiffness.

      Methods Individuals with chronic stroke will be recruited from community self-help groups and
      existing patient database. Relevant information (e.g. demographic information, medical
      history) will be obtained from medical records and subject interviews. Each subject will have
      to fulfill the following inclusion criteria: (1) diagnosis of chronic stroke, (2)
      community-dwelling, (3) able to follow simple verbal instructions. Exclusion criteria are:
      (1) other diagnoses of neurological conditions, (2) significant musculoskeletal conditions
      (e.g. amputations), (3) metal implants in the lower extremity or spine, (4) recent fracture
      in the lower extremity, (5) diagnosis of osteoporosis, (6) vestibular disorders, (7)
      peripheral vascular disease, and (11) other serious illnesses or contraindications to
      exercise.

      This study will be repeated measures design. Subject will stand with knees flexed at 60Â° in
      the WBV platform which will generate thre two different vibration conditions(0Hz, 40Hz/high
      amplitude. Note: Hz is short for Hertz). The duration of the vibration stimulation will be
      90-second per protocol. Muscle elasticity or neural modulation will be measured before and
      after the vibration stimulation. Muscle elasticity will be measured using supersonic
      ultrasound elastography. Neural modulation will be measured in soleus muscle H-reflex
      (H[max]/M[max]). Resting intervals will be provided in each session. All experiments should
      be completed in 2 separate days.
