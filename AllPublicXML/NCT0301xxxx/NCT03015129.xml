        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have recurrent or persistent endometrial carcinoma (including:
             Endometrioid adenocarcinoma, serous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma,
             dedifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma,
             adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.), mucinous adenocarcinoma, squamous
             cell carcinoma, and transitional cell carcinoma) or endometrial carcinosarcoma).
             Histologic documentation of diagnosis of carcinoma is required.

          -  All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined by RECIST
             (version 1.1). Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each
             lesion must be ≥ 10 mm when measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical
             exam; or ≥ 20 mm when measured by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be &gt; 15 mm in short
             axis when measured by CT or MRI.

          -  Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; to be used to assess response on this
             protocol as defined by RECIST version 1.1 (Section 8.1). Tumors within a previously
             irradiated field will be designated as &quot;non-target&quot; lesions unless progression is
             documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following
             completion of radiation therapy.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years and life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

             chemotherapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and/or consolidation/maintenance
             therapy. Chemotherapy administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a
             radio-sensitizer WILL be counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen.

          -  Patients are allowed to receive, but are not required to receive, three additional
