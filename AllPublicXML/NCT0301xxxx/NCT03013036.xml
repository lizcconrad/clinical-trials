  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of our study is to evaluate the predictive value of ultrasonographic (USG) measurement of
      thyrohyoid distance for difficult intubation and determination of optimal endotracheal tube
      size by using USG in pediatric patients undergoing elective surgery.

    <textblock>
      After ethics committee approval and parental consent were obtained, 119 patients undergoing
      genitourinary surgery or inguinal hernia repair under general anesthesia, were included in
      study. Patients with head or neck anomalies, syndromic patients, patients undergoing
      emergency surgery and patients with a history of difficult airway were excluded from the
      study. Patients were grouped according to their ages; Group I (1-2 years,n=38), Group II (3-5
      years,n=46) and Group III (6-8 years,n=35). USG measurements were performed following
      sevoflurane induction in groups I and II. In group III, USG measurements were performed
      following premedication with intravenous midazolam 0.05 mg/kg . Thyrohyoid distance, glottic
      and subglottic diameters were measured with ultrasonography. The size of the endotracheal
      tube according to Bae's formula ( internal diameter of Endotracheal tube = 0.705 x subglottic
      diameter - 0.091) was calculated and recorded. Before intubation, endotracheal tube
      (cuffed/uncuffed) was selected using age-related formulas. In group II, anaesthesia induction
      was achieved with propofol 2 mg/kg. In all groups, endotracheal intubation was achieved with
      fentanyl 2μg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg. Endotracheal tube size was considered as optimal
      when a leak was detected at 20-30cmH₂O inflation pressures. If a resistance was felt in the
      subglottic region, the tube was exchanged with a smaller and was exchanged with a larger (0.5
      mm) size if a leak occurred at inflation pressures lower than 20cmH₂O. Intubation duration ,
      Cormack-Lehane scores and Intubation Difficulty Scale scores were recorded. For comparison of
      age related formula and Bae 's formula, only patients who were intubated with un-cuffed
      endotracheal tube were evaluated.
