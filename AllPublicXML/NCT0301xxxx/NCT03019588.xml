  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      versus paclitaxel in Asian, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive participants with
      advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have progressed after
      failure of any combination chemotherapy containing a platinum and a fluoropyrimidine agent.

      The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab prolongs Overall Survival (OS) compared
      to paclitaxel and that pembrolizumab prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) assessed by blinded central
      radiologists' review compared to paclitaxel.

    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression.</description>

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who had a Complete Response (CR: Disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters) per RECIST 1.1.</description>
