    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to initially access the safety and effectivity of RC18 combined
      with methotrexate (MTX) in comparison with the use of methotrexate alone in participants with
      moderate to severe Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have an inadequate response to MTX therapy.
