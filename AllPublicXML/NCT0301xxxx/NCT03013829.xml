    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a targeted educational approach
      designed to increase knowledge about the risks and benefits of living donation generally and
      KPD (Kidney Paired Donation) specifically, enhance KPD self-efficacy, reduce KPD concerns,
      and facilitate informed decision making about KPD among incompatible or cross-match positive
      donor-recipient pairs.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the
      effectiveness of a video-based KPD education intervention to improve knowledge,
      self-efficacy, concerns, and informed decision-making about KPD in incompatible potential
      living kidney donors (LKDs) and intended transplant recipients. There will be equal
      allocation of LKDs and intended recipients to both KPD education conditions: (1) Usual Care
      (UC) group and (2) UC plus video-based KPD education group. All enrolled LKDs and intended
      recipients will complete a baseline survey and another survey 2 weeks post-intervention.
      Additionally, follow-up data will be gathered on KPD decision-making, participation, and
      reasons for non-participation at 3 months post-intervention.

      Settings and target population. The study will be conducted at two kidney transplant programs
      in the United States: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC; Boston, MA) and Medical
      University of South Carolina (MUSC; Charleston, SC). This study will target potential LKDs
      and their intended recipients whose histocompatibility testing has determined them to be
      incompatible with each other.

      Randomization. Random assignment to education group will occur immediately following
      completion of the baseline survey. Randomization will be done with the LKD, with the
      randomized group matched to the intended recipient. The randomized group is the same for the
      LKD-recipient pair to reduce the risk of contamination, which is a critical threat to
      internal validity in this type of study. For instance, if a LKD was assigned to the KPD
      video-based education group and their intended recipient was assigned to the UC (Usual Care)
      group, there is the real possibility that there would be some diffusion of treatments in
      which the LKD discusses some elements of the intervention with the recipient and this, in
      turn, may influence the recipient's living donation and KPD knowledge, concerns, and
      decision-making processes. A simple unrestricted random allocation sequence will be used.
      REDCap will be used to generate the randomization sequence, which will be accessible to the
      site coordinators and transplant educators. The PI and Co-Investigators will be blinded to
      subjects' allocation assignment.

      Interventions. Usual Care (UC) Living Donation and KPD Education. Incompatible potential LKDs
      and recipients will receive living donation and KPD-specific education as they usually do in
      both the BIDMC and MUSC kidney transplant programs. As noted previously, potential LKDs are
      informed of their incompatibility during a phone call with the donor nurse coordinator. At
      this time, the KPD option is described and the potential LKD is provided with living donation
      information and a link to the UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing) KPD website
      (https://www.unos.org/donation/kidney-paired-donation/), which includes a written description
      of KPD. This information is available in English and Spanish. For those who do not have
      internet access, the written educational materials are mailed. The potential LKD is advised
      to call the donor nurse coordinator with any questions about KPD and/or to initiate the full
      donation evaluation. An identical KPD educational process occurs for the intended recipient,
      although this is done with their own transplant nurse coordinator and only if their potential
      donor decides to initiate the full donation evaluation. Incompatible LKDs and recipients
      assigned to the UC group will be sent an email after randomization, which will include a
      reminder to visit the UNOS website and the link will be provided again in this email.

      Video-Based KPD Education. Incompatible LKDs and recipients assigned to the video-based KPD
      education group will receive the same living donation and KPD educational materials as those
      in the UC group. Also, as in the UC group, they will be encouraged by the site coordinator to
      review the educational materials. In addition, following randomization to this group,
      participants will be sent an email encouraging them to watch the embedded KPD education
      video. This video will be professionally designed and will highlight the operational features
      of KPD and address the specific barriers highlighted in our formative research. The primary
      goal of these sessions is to increase living donation and KPD knowledge of risks and benefits
      and to reduce specific concerns that are based on inaccurate information. The intent is not
      to persuade LKDs or recipients to pursue living donation or KPD, but to ensure that they have
      sufficient information to make an informed choice that is consistent with their own values
      and preferences.

      Assessment Time-points. Study data will be collected from participants at three different
      time points.

      Baseline. Participants will complete a 30-minute online assessment via REDCap following email
      consent but prior to randomization. The questionnaire assessment will gather sociodemographic
      information, assess primary and secondary outcomes, and measure important covariates.

      Post-Intervention. Two weeks after randomization, participants will complete a 20-minute
      REDCap assessment of the primary and secondary outcomes, uptake of the written and video
      educational elements, any discussions they have had with others about living donation or KPD,
      educational intervention process and evaluation, and any steps they have taken to pursue
      further donation evaluation. The rationale for the timing of this assessment is to re-assess
      the primary and secondary outcomes in close proximity to the delivery of living donation and
      KPD-specific education yet that provides sufficient time for the participant to assimilate
      and consider the information acquired.

      Follow-up. Three months following the living donation and KPD-specific education,
      participants will complete a brief REDCap assessment to learn of their final decision
      regarding living donation and the factors that contributed to it. The rationale for the
      timing of this follow-up assessment is that the vast majority of incompatible potential LKDs
      and recipients who have been offered KPD have achieved a final disposition within this time
      period.

Participants will also be asked about reasons for not pursuing further evaluation or not registering for KPD. This outcome will measure action steps taken with regards to living donation and KPD.</description>
