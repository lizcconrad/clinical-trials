  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomised, open-label, multicentric study to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 6 cohorts of patients with specific rare cancers
      who have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease, which is resistant or
      refractory to standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist, or is not
      considered appropriate, and for which no other experimental treatment options are available,
      in order to identify subsets of patients that may benefit from treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to enrol up to 350 patients in total with between 20 and 50 patients assigned
      to each cohort according to indication, as follows:

        -  Cohort 1: Rare sarcoma

        -  Cohort 2: Rare ovarian cancer

        -  Cohort 3: Primary central nervous system lymphomas

        -  Cohort 4: Rare thyroid cancer

        -  Cohort 5: Rare malignant neuroendocrine cancer

        -  Cohort 6: Germ-cell cancer

        -  Cohort 7: NK/T-cell lymphoma

      The study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all
      patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly
      sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in
      the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from
      the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.

             days of treatment initiation. For patients with documented liver metastasis ASAT/ALAT
             ≤ 5x ULN is acceptable.

         12. Strictly normal blood levels of calcium and magnesium, measured within 14 days of
             treatment initiation.

         13. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 1 (Oken, 1982).

         14. Estimated life expectancy ≥ 90 days.

         15. Patients who are sexually active must agree to use a medically accepted method of
             contraception (e.g. implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some
             intrauterine devices or vasectomized partner, for participating women; condoms for
             participating men) or practice complete abstinence, beginning 14 days before the first
             administration of the investigational product (IP), while on treatment and for at
             least 5 months after the last administration of IP for female patients, and 7 months

         16. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to the first administration of IP. If urine test results are
             positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

         17. Women who are breastfeeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first
             administration of IP and for at least 120 days after the last administration of IP.

         18. Patients must be affiliated to a Social Security System or equivalent.

          4. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          5. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or current
             pneumonitis.

          6. History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody therapy

          9. Has known symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Patients with
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without
             evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of
             trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no
             evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least
             7 days prior to trial treatment.

         10. Has known carcinomatous meningitis or a history of leptomeningeal disease, except for
             patients with primary CNS lymphoma.

         11. Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 xULN or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 50 ml/min.

         12. Other malignancies within the past 5 years other than basal cell skin cancer or in
             situ carcinoma of the cervix.

             infection (HIV 1/2 antibodies), or a known history of active Tuberculosis bacillus.

         15. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study treatment. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated vaccines and are
             allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated
             vaccines, and are not allowed.

         16. Active alcohol or drug abuse.

         17. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.

         18. Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the subject
             to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.
