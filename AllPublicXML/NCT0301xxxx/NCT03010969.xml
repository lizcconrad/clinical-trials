      The aim of the clinical study is:

        1. to examine the association between postoperative endothelial function, indirectly
           measured by reactive hyperemia index, and major adverse cardiovascular events including
           myocardial injury and cardiac death within 30, 90 and 365 days of acute abdominal
           surgery.

        2. to examine the association between postoperative endothelial function, indirectly
           measured by reactive hyperemia index, and non-cardiovascular complications including
           non-cardiac death within 30, 90 and 365 days of acute abdominal surgery.

        3. to examine the importance of the postoperative blood glucose level and the pulmonary
           function for postoperative complications and death within 30, 90 and 365 days of acute
           abdominal surgery.

        4. to examine the association between postoperative endothelial function, pulmonary
           function and blood glucose level

        5. the qualitative part of the study will examine the postoperative subjective symptoms
           including acute and chronic pain, quality of recovery and functional status, depressive
           thoughts and post-traumatic stress disorder.

      The blood will be collected from a larger vein (e.g. the cubital vein). Cardiac troponin I
      Tetrahydrobiopterin: Blood is sampled into 4mL EDTA tubes. Immediately after withdrawal, a
      minimum of 1mL blood is mixed with 25μL DTE. The mixture is centrifuged at 2000g for 5
      minutes. Plasma is frozen and stored at -80°C.

      Arginine and ADMA: Blood is sampled into 4mL EDTA tubes. Blood samples will be centrifuged at
      3000g for 10 minutes, plasma frozen and stored at -80°C until analyzed with high performance
      liquid chromatography.

          -  Non-elective hernia repair without bowel resection.
