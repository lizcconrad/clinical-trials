    <textblock>
      This study will give a new insight to the physiotherapy fraternity in the effects of spinal
      manipulation in as clinical practice, as well as the patient's community in quick
      re-establishment of functional ability, pain decrease, and improvement of quality of life for
      economic reasons. In this high opinion, application of short-term intensive spinal
      manipulation for non specific chronic low back pain treatment is desirable.

      The protocol for group A included High velocity low amplitude thrust (HVLA) to the lumbar
      region of the spine between L1 and L5 vertebrae.The HVLA thrust will be performed with the
      patient side lying in a neutral.52 They take part in 12 treatment visits, 10 to 20 minutes
      sessions of SM over 2 weeks. Light soft tissue techniques (i.e., active and passive muscle
      stretching, and ischemic compression of tender points) may be used as needed to facilitate
      the manual therapy.

      The protocol for group B included sets of exercise therapy. There are three components to the
      exercise therapy (ET) program: self education, supervised exercise visits, and home exercise.
      The overall objectives are to help patient's manage their LBP and prevent future LBP
      recurrences. Total number of visits 12 (e.g., ability to perform exercises independently).

      Outcome:

      Patient self-report outcomes will be collected at first baseline visit and its base on the
      pain intensity and quality of life will be assessed by using numerical pain rating scale and
      EuroQol questionnaire. Objective outcome measures will be collected at the first baseline
      visit and its base on postural instability and pressure pain threshold will be assessed by
      using Win track platform and digital algometer.

    <description>Clinical outcomes will be assessed at baseline and following 2 weeks of participation in the study, Change from baseline in quality of life on EuroQoL questionnaire at 2 weeks.EuroQol questionnaire is a wide accepted questionnaire for health-related quality of life and consists of two components. Its first component (EQ-5D-5L) consists of five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). However, each dimension now has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.</description>

    <description>Clinical outcomes will be assessed at baseline and following 2 weeks of participation in the study, Change from baseline in pain instability on Numerical pain rating scale (NPRS). An11-point numeric pain rating scale will be used to assess pain intensity (primary outcome measure), with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 representing the &quot;worst possible pain&quot; at the time of the assessment. Pain intensity will be measured before and after treatment.</description>

    <description>Clinical outcomes will be assessed at baseline and following 2 weeks of participation in the study, Change from baseline in pain sensitivity (PPT) on Digital algometer.Pain sensitivity (PPT) will be measured on the lumbar area bilaterally. Digital Algometer (Jagson scientific Industries, Ambala-133001, Haryana, India) will be used with a circular rounded aluminium tip, 1 cm2, and with an application rate of 25 KN/s. The measurements will be performed twice and the average of the two registrations will be filed.</description>

    <description>High velocity low amplitude thrust (HVLA) to the lumbar region of the spine between L1 and L5 vertebrae. The exact level thrust will be at the discretion of the treating practitioner determined by the level with the greatest perceivable motion restriction. The HVLA thrust will be performed with the patient side lying in a neutral.They take part in 12 treatment visits, 10 to 20 minutes sessions of SM over 2 weeks. Light soft tissue techniques (i.e., active and passive muscle stretching, and ischemic compression of tender points) may be used as needed to facilitate the manual therapy.</description>

    <description>Self education, supervised exercise visits, and home exercise. The overall objectives are to help patient's mange their LBP and prevent future LBP recurrences. Total number of visits 12.Each visit starts with 10 minutes of self-care education to help patients establish and monitor goals aligned with the exercise program and enhance their understanding of LBP. Participants will be taught the importance of movement and activity, pain management techniques, and methods for developing spinal posture awareness during activities of daily living (e.g., lifting, pushing, pulling, sitting, getting out of bed, and using a backpack).</description>
