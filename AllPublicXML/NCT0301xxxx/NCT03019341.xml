    <textblock>
      The prevalence of nausea and vomiting after the administration of non-ionic contrast media
      has rarely been assessed. Thus, the aim of our study is to evaluate the prevalence and risk
      factors of nausea and vomiting after the exposure to the non-ionic contrast media for
      computed tomography examinations in adults.

      There is no robust evidence or guideline for fasting prior to contrast-enhanced CT scan in
      patients. Substantial heterogeneity exists on fasting prior to contrast-enhanced CT
      worldwide. Through dedicated questionnaires, the investigators plan to prospectively assess
      the prevalence and the risk factors for nausea and vomiting after the exposure to the
      non-ionic contrast media agent in adult patients undergoing computed tomography examinations.
