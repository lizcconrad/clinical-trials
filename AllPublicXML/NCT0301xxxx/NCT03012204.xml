      To compare the effects of various combinations between 6 hertz(Hz) rTMS &amp; LFrTMS on the limb
      motor dysfunction due to cerebral vascular disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is the basic principle for functional recovery after cerebrovascular disease to restore
      the original balance in reciprocal inhibition between affected hemisphere and unaffected
      hemisphere.

      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuroplastic technique
      rebalancing interhemispheric competition after stroke. Low frequency rTMS (LFrTMS) on
      contralesional hemisphere or high frequency rTMS (HFrTMS) on lesional hemisphere might be the
      basic choice.

      6 hertz(Hz) primed LFrTMS on lesional primary motor cortex has the stronger effect than
      LFrTMS alone does on one hand; the other newly-developed combination, i.e. HFrTMS on lesional
      primary motor cortex and LFrTMS on contralesional primary motor cortex might also be more
      effective than they do respectively on the other hand.

      The main aim of our research is to find out which combination is better by considering both
      safety and efficiency.
