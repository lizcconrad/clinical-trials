    <textblock>
      Prostate Cancer Survivorship 360º is a collaboration-based initiative involving prostate
      cancer (PC) and survivorship researchers/clinicians from three Canadian prostate centers with
      the goal of identifying and tracking unmet supportive care needs of patients with localized
      PC and responding to these needs through survivorship care. The current randomized control
      trail (RCT) will focus on the development and evaluation of a facilitated electronic Prostate
      Cancer Survivorship Care Plan (PC-SCP). The aims of this project are: 1) to develop an
      appropriate and tailored SCP and transition care delivery process; and 2) to conduct an RCT
      to evaluate whether a personalized PC SCP intervention is more effective than usual care (UC)
      on patient activation (primary outcome) and access to services, self-Management support,
      satisfaction with information, HRQoL and cancer worry (secondary outcomes). Data from a
      multi-site prospective database- Prostate Cancer Survivorship Information System (PC360-IS)
      will be used to electronically populate the survivorship care plans. Overall, this proposal
      represents initial steps in uniting the country in sharing programmatic resources, data,
      expertise, and enthusiasm to transform survivorship care for men with PC and their families.

    <textblock>
      A Phase III RCT will evaluate the superiority of a Survivorship Care Plan (SCP) intervention
      (SCP-Int) compared with usual care (UC) after primary curative prostate cancer (PC)
      treatment. Each of the three sites has designated clinical study leads (AM, LG, and ST), high
      referral volumes and study leads' patients will be entered into the PC360-IS database which
      will be interfaced to the PC-SCP system to consolidate patient details and generate
      personalized SCPs. Research ethics approval will be obtained at each site. The trial will be
      registered with clinicaltrials.gov and reported using the CONSORT recommendations for trials.

      The study population inclusion criteria are as follows: Histologically confirmed localized
      (T1-T3N0M0) PC; age at diagnosis &gt;18 years; treated with curative intent; treatment received
      &gt;1 month and &lt;6 months; disease-free as defined by absence of somatic disease activity
      parameters as per oncologist/urologist; consented to participate in the PC360-IS database.
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients who do not receive treatment and are followed by active
      surveillance; inability to complete study questionnaires.

      Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either the intervention arm or the control
      arm. A biostatistician will randomly assign participants to ensure that both the study RA and
      the participants are unaware of the treatment (SCP-int)/control groups (UC). Consenting
      patients will be registered into the study and randomized to receive either the SCP-Int or
      UC. Patients in the SCP-Int arm will be scheduled for the SCP-Int appointment on the same day
      as the patient's first (or second) follow-up appointment.

      Eligible patients will be sent a study information letter which will be signed by the
      patient's urologist/ oncologist one month after the end of primary treatment. The RA will
      then contact patients to further explain the study. If agreeable, the patients will be sent
      consent forms, two stamped envelopes, and a baseline questionnaire to complete prior to the
      scheduled follow-up appointment. The patients will be asked to mail back the signed consent
      form and the completed questionnaire in each the envelopes provided.

      Participants will have as much time as needed to decide if the participants would like to
      participate in the study prior to signing the consent form. The Research Analyst will obtain
      consent.

      Planned trial interventions: SCP-Int: Patients in the SCP-Int arm will be asked to attend a
      one-time appointment with a trained oncology nurse (study nurse). To avoid additional travel
      and related costs to the patient, this appointment will be scheduled on the same day as the
      patient's follow-up appointment. The SCP-Int is comprised of two components: a 30-minute
      nurse-led face-to-face intervention and the provision of a tailored PC-specific SCP (PC-SCP).
      The intervention will be developed based on an established person-centred nursing framework
      with a tailored approach to customizing the intervention to the individual and will focus on
      the provision of self-management education and support and promote access to and coordination
      of post-treatment care including appropriate referrals to relevant programs and services
      (including TrueNTH solutions). The content of the PC-SCP will provide structure to the
      appointment. Persistent effects and concerns that are identified will prompt the development
      of a tailored management plan (i.e. patient education, referral to programs and services)
      captured within the PC-SCP. Relevant patient education and TrueNTH materials will be linked
      electronically. The appointment will focus on empowering the PC survivor to actively
      self-manage persistent treatment effects and to decrease the patients' risk of late effects
      by providing effective health information, support, and self-management support. Nurses will
      integrate a number of &quot;active behaviour change ingredients&quot; including the integration of
      motivational interviewing techniques which are effective in increasing healthy behaviours.
      Usual Care (UC): Patients in the UC arm will receive care according to usual practice. This
      usually involves a brief office visit (approximately 5-10 minutes) with pertinent history and
      physical examination related to surgical/radiation recovery, review of the pathology and
      general instructions regarding the next step in follow-up. In addition, patients in the UC
      arm will be able to access any supportive care programs or service available at the hospital
      according to usual practice. Currently, SCPs and dedicated transition appointments are not
      provided as part of a standard of care.

      Allocation to trial groups: Patients will be allocated to either SCP-Int or UC by the
      Department of Biostatistics at Princess Margaret using a computer-generated randomization
      process (random blocks known only to statisticians). The research coordinator will telephone
      Biostatistics staff, who will not be involved in recruitment, to obtain the subject's
      assignment. Eligible patients from each site will be approached until the target number of
      participants is reached (or until a decision is made to stop recruitment).

      Data collection: Data will be collected and analyzed according to the outlined project aims.
      Based on CONSORT criteria, a screening log will enable data collection on eligible and
      non-recruited patients with reasons for non-recruitment recorded when known. All data will be
      entered into a secured, password protected database within the UHN server. A separate
      database will be used for participant tracking to prevent re-approaching patients
      unnecessarily, and to ensure patients are receiving the questionnaire packages according to
      the study timeline.

      Proposed primary and secondary outcome measures:

      The outcome measures were chosen based on recent consensus and recommendations on the
      evaluation of SCPs. Patients will be assessed at baseline (T0), 6 (T1), and 12 (T2) months
      post-treatment. This questionnaire package is estimated to take 45 minutes to complete.

      Primary Outcome: Patient activation will be measured using the Patient Activation Measure
      (PAM-13), a 13-items measure assessing knowledge, skills, beliefs, and confidence in managing
      health and health care. Patient activation is strongly related to a broad range of
      health-related outcomes. The primary outcome will be the overall score of the 13 items
      collected at T2.

      Secondary Outcomes: a) Supportive care services utilization: using the Health and Social
      Services Utilization Inventory (HSSUI) modified for use in cancer populations. Service types
      are grouped into five categories: Health Professionals, Institutional/Hospital Programs;
      Nursing and Homemaker Support Programs; Other Community and Social Support Program/Resources
      (will include True NTH solutions); Programs/Resources.; b) Self-Management Support will be
      assessed using the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ), designed to evaluate
      outcomes from patient education and self-management interventions for people with chronic
      conditions; c) Satisfaction with Information will be measured with the 25-item European
      Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life INFO25 module which
      evaluates satisfaction with information received by cancer patients; d) Quality of Life will
      be measured using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) which assesses
      PC-specific quality of life, and e) Cancer Worry will be measured using the Assessment of
      Survivors Concerns (ASC) measure which assesses fear of recurrence and health in cancer
      survivors.

      Proposed sample size and justification: Our sample size calculations are based on 85% power
      with an alpha-level of 0.05, a standard deviation of 16 and a difference between groups of 8
      points on the primary outcome (or half a standard deviation difference). Given these
      specifications, the required sample size is 146 patients (or 73 patients per arm). Assuming
      attrition of up to 20%, 180 patients will be recruited (or 90 patients per arm). Based on
      previous studies, we expect to enroll about 70% of eligible patients. The number of
      potentially eligible patients from participating sites is estimated to vary between 15-30
      patients per month. Based on these estimates and our anticipated participation rates, we
      anticipate recruiting 20 patients per month with total recruitment completed within 9 months.
      We anticipate at least 80% will complete the 12-month post-treatment follow-up. We will use
      multiple strategies to promote retention and prevent attrition. Reasons for participant
      attrition will be documented.

      Proposed analyses: Analyses will be performed adhering to the intention to treat principle.
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline demographic and clinical
      characteristics of participants in both groups. Recruitment bias and possible differential
      attrition will be assessed by calculating the standardized differences between the two arms.
      The overall PAM-13 score at 12 months adjusted for the baseline score will be compared
      between the two arms using the t-test if the data appears normal or the Mann-Whitney test
      otherwise. A p-value&lt;=0.05 will be deemed significant. Secondary analyses of all scores at
      each time point will be conducted utilizing the mixed effect modeling to account for the
      intra-patient and intra-centre dependency due to the repeated measures within a patient and
      the multi-centre design. The residuals will be inspected and data will be transformed when
      necessary. Due to multiple testing for the secondary analyses a Hochberg-Benjamini approach
      will be used to ensure that the type I error rate does not exceed 0.05.

      Cost-utility analyses: The analysis will also include a trial-based cost utility analysis.
      The health utility measured using the PORPUS-U and EQ-5D instruments will be used to provide
      patient-specific and group-mean estimates of quality-adjusted survival (Quality Adjusted Life
      Years). Costs from the payer perspective and from the societal perspective will be gathered
      using the HSSUI and an estimate of intervention costs. Inverse probability weighting will be
      used to adjust for induced dependent censoring. A net benefit regression approach will be
      employed to explore predictors of cost-effectiveness.
