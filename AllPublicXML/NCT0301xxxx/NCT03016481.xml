  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-year comparative effectiveness study funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes
      Research Institute (PCORI) and will test an adapted priority-based patient navigation versus
      care as usual among 300 survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) recruited from, and/or
      referred from, University of Rochester Medical Center providers. The goal is to improve
      patient safety, depression, and health function over the course of 12 months. In the
      Community Health Worker -Personalized Support for Progress (CHW-PSP) arm, created and tested
      in our first UR PCORI grant, in addition to meeting with a social worker, patients will work
      with a Community Health Worker (CHW) to complete a prioritization tool and meet as needed
      over the course of the next 6 months to navigate services and overcome barriers. In addition,
      patients will receive referrals to other professionals based on their prioritization and meet
      with the CHW at the time and place of their choice. Patients in the Care as Usual- Social
      Worker (CAU-SW) arm, will do intake with a social worker, who follows hospital procedures for
      intake and referrals, does a needs assessment, and offers safety planning in referral.

    <description>To assess whether CHW-PSP improves patient safety, as compared to CAU-SW Participants will complete the Conflict Tactics Scale-2 a modified from a 20-item self-report measure 10 assessing areas of negotiation, psychological aggression, physical assault, sexual coercion and injury. They will also complete the Danger Assessment, a 20-item measure to assess danger and lethality in a participant's experiences of violence and has documented reliability and validity. We will further assess safety with Steps for Safety instrument.The National Center for State Courts created the 18-item measure to document what safety steps a victim had taken post intervention. We will also receive Rochester Police Department (RPD) 911 call data, which is available to the public, and link the calls to our patients via address geomapping.</description>

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess whether CHW-PSP leads to improved depression and health function post-intervention (9 months). The PHQ-930 is a screen for major depressive disorder with good discriminant validity and sensitivity to change that has been validated in variety of settings.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of the Project Rose-SAFE intervention on the outcome of patient QoL will be mediated by increases in patient safety. The World Health Organization developed the WHOQOL-BREF to assess overall quality of life. It includes 4 summary scales: physical, psychological, social, and environment, plus a total score. The WHOQOL-BREF gives equal attention to the function and to a patient's assessment of the importance of that level of function, was designed to detect change over time, and is associated with change in depression.</description>

    <description>Subjects will meet with their CHW to prioritize their needs detected by the Promote psychosocial screening and identify their preferences for intervention using a secure, online card sorting tool called Optimal Sort. The subject will explain her/his rationale for each decision to the CHW, allowing them both to begin to identify goals. The prioritization survey results provide subjects a personalized package of services that map onto the four main intervention options: legal help, problem solving therapy, medical consultation, or social services.</description>
