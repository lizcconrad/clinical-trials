  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is known for development of severe
      cardiovascular co-morbidities. Systemic inflammation during acute exacerbations of COPD
      (AE-COPD) is thought to play a role in development of cardiovascular disease. Platelets
      contribute to acute cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis. When platelets are activated,
      they form complexes with monocytes. These platelet-monocyte complexes (PMCs) are an early
      process in atherothrombosis and promote inflammation. In COPD, platelet function in AE-COPD
      is scarcely studied. This study aims to address this gap by investigating platelet function
      and coagulation in patients with AE-COPD and after convalescence.
