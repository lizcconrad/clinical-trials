  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, cross-over study is to explore the effects of pea hull fiber
      on bowel movement frequency, transit time, appetite, gastrointestinal symptoms, microbiota
      composition and activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An 8-week randomized, cross-over study will be carried out to assess the efficacy of pea hull
      fiber. Participants will complete a 2-week baseline period during which appetite, stool
      frequency, and stool consistency (transit time) will be collected by an online questionnaire,
      and participants will collect a single stool. Dietary data (Automated Self-Administered
      24-Hour diet recall) will be obtained at baseline and at each study visit. Participants will
      be randomized on or about day 15 and consume snacks without pea hull fiber for a 2-week
      control period, and snacks with added pea hull fiber for a 2-week treatment period separated
      by a 2-week washout period. In both intervention periods, participants will complete daily
      questionnaires to assess stool frequency and consistency (transit time). An online
      questionnaire assessing appetite will be administered once per week. The GSRS will be
      competed at each study visit. During washout periods, the same data will be collected as will
      be done during the baseline and intervention periods. Participants will be asked to collect
      one stool during baseline and during weeks 4, 6, and 8 for a total of 4 stools. Stool samples
      will be analyzed for changes in the microbiota.
