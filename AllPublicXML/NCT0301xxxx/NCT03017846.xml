  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cantharidin is cited in the dermatology and pediatric literature as a valuable treatment
      option. Treatment is often available in private practice offices, where a prescribing
      physician may offer a non-FDA approved treatment on an individualized basis. The situation is
      different in many hospital and academic settings, such as our own for example, where the
      formulary is defined through a FDA-approved indication. The absence of an indication
      precludes its addition to many hospital formularies, thus limiting the options available to a
      prescribing physician and denying patient access to a treatment offered in the private
      practice setting. An indication and formulary status require controlled clinical trials on
      the safety and efficacy of cantharidin in MC. The objective of this trial is to see if this
      commercially-viable cantharidin formulation has a comparable safety and efficacy profile as
      formulations previously studied under conditions which most closely match the what has been
      historically done in the clinic.
