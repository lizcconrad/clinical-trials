  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomised, open-label, multicentric study to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of nivolumab monotherapy in 6 cohorts of patients with specific rare cancers who
      have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease, which is resistant or refractory to
      standard therapy, or for which standard therapy does not exist, or is not considered
      appropriate, and for which no other experimental treatment options are available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to enrol up to 250 patients in total with between 20 and 50 patients assigned
      to each cohort according to indication, as follows:

        -  Cohort 1: Non-clear cell RCC

        -  Cohort 2: Rare head and neck cancer

        -  Cohort 3: Rare skin cancer

        -  Cohort 4: MSI-nonCRC

        -  Cohort 5: Penile cancer

        -  Cohort 6: POLE exonucleasic domain mutated cancer

      The study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all
      patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly
      sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in
      the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from
      the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.

         16. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to the first administration of IP. If urine test results are
             positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.

         17. Women who are breastfeeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first
             administration of IP and for at least 90 days after the last administration of IP.

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          5. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, or current
             pneumonitis.

             evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of
             trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no
             evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least
             7 days prior to trial treatment.

         12. Other malignancies within the past 5 years other than basal cell skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

         13. Active serious infections in particular if requiring systemic antibiotic or
             antimicrobial therapy.

         15. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study treatment. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated vaccines and are
             allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated
             vaccines, and are not allowed.

         16. Active alcohol or drug abuse.

         17. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical factors potentially hampering
             compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule.

         18. Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion makes it undesirable for the subject
             to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.
