      The proposed study will assess the feasibility of an exercise and dietary intervention in men
      with castrate resistant prostate cancer with secondary outcomes assessing improvements in
      physical functioning, fatigue, quality of life, and body composition.The study will have 2
      arms, with one set of participants randomized to resistance exercise training intervention
      plus dietary advice and the other arm will be standard of care plus exercise advice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although there have been advances in recent years, therapeutic options remain limited for men
      with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). There is an unmet clinical need for
      interventions which can improve quality of life, functional capacity and cancer related
      fatigue. Adjunctive exercise therapy could be a potentially effective treatment for these
      men. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated numerous benefits in physiological and
      psychosocial outcomes in men with advanced prostate cancer. Further, there is observational
      evidence linking physical activity with reduced disease specific mortality after a diagnosis
      of cancer. Observational data also indicates that preserving skeletal muscle mass can improve
      responses to chemotherapy. The proposed study will assess the feasibility of an exercise and
      dietary intervention in men with castrate resistant prostate cancer with secondary outcomes
      assessing improvements in physical functioning, fatigue, quality of life, and body
      composition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men with Castrate resistant prostate cancer

          -  Men with histologically confirmed PCa on long-term ADT with either

               -  PSA&gt;2ng/ml above nadir or PSA level that has risen serially on at least two
                  occasions (each at least 4 weeks apart) in the presence of castrate levels of
                  testosterone or;

               -  Evidence of symptomatic disease progression whilst undergoing first line androgen
                  deprivation therapy (ADT) in the presence of castrate levels of testosterone or;

               -  Radiographic disease progression whilst undergoing first line ADT in the presence
                  of castrate levels of testosterone

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Participation in other trials which might bias the evaluation of the primary
             objectives of the present study.

               -  Current participation in regular physical activity (defined as purposeful
                  physical activity of a moderate intensity for 90 minutes per week for at least
                  six months).

               -  Unstable angina, uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction,
                  pacemakers.

                  condition that would limit the ability to understand and complete the study
                  assessments and complete the required questionnaires, recall and record of
                  dietary information would be excluded.
