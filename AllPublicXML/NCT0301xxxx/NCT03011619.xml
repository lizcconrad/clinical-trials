  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderately to severely depressed subjects will be randomized to the &quot;Control Group,&quot; who will
      receive care as usual, or the &quot;CBT Group,&quot; who will receive care as usual in addition to the
      manualized course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants assigned to the CBT condition will receive the usual standard of care during an
      inpatient psychiatric hospitalization. This includes but is not limited to medication
      management, group therapy, and individual therapy. If a patient is randomly assigned to the
      enhanced CBT group, manualized CBT, including a sequence of sessions that builds upon prior
      sessions and planned exercises, including worksheets and journal entries.The training M.D.,
      who is a treating physician on HCC-10, will also intermittently and randomly observe the CBT
      sessions to ensure the manual properly is being followed. Although the control condition may
      contain elements of CBT as per the clinician completing the therapy, it is not manualized,
      does not include specific exercises to be completed between sessions, and is not a course
      that builds upon skills from the previous day, as in the CBT condition. Participants assigned
      to the control condition will receive the usual standard of care during an inpatient
      psychiatric hospitalization. This includes but is not limited to medication management, group
      therapy, and individual therapy.

    <measure>Montgomery-Ashberg Depression Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>A ten-item clinician-administered questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with mood disorders. The ten questions rate the severity of symptoms on scale of 0 (not present), 2 (mild), 4 (moderate), and 6 (severe). It is designed to be sensitive to change, so is often the scale of choice when interventions, such as psychotherapies, electroconvulsive therapy, or drug trials, are being studied.</description>
