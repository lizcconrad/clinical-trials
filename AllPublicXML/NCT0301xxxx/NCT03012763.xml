    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine pharmacokinetics of the probe-drugs sulfasalazine,
      given in 240 ml non-caloric water and paracetamol, fexofenadine and valsartan after oral
      administration, given in 240 ml non-caloric water, in 240 ml caloric drink or in 240 ml
      grapefruit juice prior to ingestion and to visualize the localization and to measure the
      filling volume of stomach, small intestine as well as ascending, transverse and descending
      colon by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging after oral administration of 240 ml water
      (non-caloric water), after administration of 240 ml caloric drink and after administration of
      240 ml grapefruit juice.

    <description>Dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance examination gradient-echo T2-weighted HASTE images (TR 1300 ms, TR 321 ms, flip-angle 160°) will be acquired on a 1.5 Tesla MRI. A tube filled with 20 ml water will be fitted on the abdomen of the volunteers in order to have an internal reference for imaging. The obtained MRI files will be investigated with common radiological software (OsiriX, Voxar 3D, Fiji, 3D slicer). From the DICOM files there will obtained: Gastrointestinal volumes and their kinetics for stomach, small bowel, colon segments and gallbladder.</description>
