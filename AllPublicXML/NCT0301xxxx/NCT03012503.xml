      Background: Neck pain effects a significant number of individuals and is commonly treated
      with chiropractic cervical manipulation. The temporary increases in neck pain following
      cervical manipulation may contribute to a lack of compliance with prescribed therapy that
      following this therapy which in turn commonly contributes to protracted symptoms. Topical
      menthol has previously been shown to decrease pain shortly following application. The purpose
      of this study was to determine if patients with mechanical neck pain who received topical
      menthol gel applied to their neck prior to cervical manipulation would have less pain and
      increased neck range of motion following cervical manipulation than patients who did not
      receive menthol.

      Methods: Patients, mean ages 35 years old, with non-radicular mechanical neck pain were
      randomly assigned to a control (n=31) or a treatment (n=29) group. Five minutes before
      cervical manipulation, controls received a placebo gel applied to their neck while the
      treatment group received a menthol containing gel (Biofreeze速) applied to their neck.
      Participants rated their neck pain on a 10-point scale prior to gel application (Pre) and at
      one minute (T1), 10 minutes (T2), 20 minutes (T3), and 30 minutes (T4) post cervical
      manipulation. Six measures of neck range of motion were assessed prior to topical
      applications of gel and at T1 and T4. ANCOVA repeated measures were performed to compare pain
      ratings and neck range of motion following manipulation while controlling for Pre measures.

    <description>Six measures of neck range of motion were assessed in the sagittal, frontal, and horizontal planes using the Acumar DataCapture hand-held dual inclinometer. This device has demonstrated a high degree of reliability (.87 - .92) without requiring calibration 21. These assessments included the neck motions of flexion, extension, right side bending, left side bending, left rotation and right rotation.</description>

    <description>The estimated surface area of the average adult's neck is 350cm and the standard dose of Biofreeze速 to achieve a clinically significant effect has been sited to be 1ml/200cm2 of skin surface area. Using this data approximately 1.75 ml of the assigned gel was applied to each participant's neck (posterior, anterior, left lateral and right lateral) by the same member of the research team, 5 minutes prior to an independent practitioner performing cervical manipulation on the participant.</description>
