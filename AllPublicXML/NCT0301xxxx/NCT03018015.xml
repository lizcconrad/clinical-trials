  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will be conducted in order to assess bioequivalence of the Test product
      (Ibuprofen 400 mg oral powder) and the Reference product 1 (Brufen 400 mg film-coated
      tablet), an approved market product in the European Union. Testing for bioequivalence will be
      performed considering AUC0-tlast and Cmax obtained after oral single dose fasted
      administration of ibuprofen.

      In addition to the conventional immediate release tablet used as Reference 1, a soft capsule
      formulation will be applied as Reference 2 (Spalt Forte 400 mg Weichkapseln), as an example
      for a product with a very fast absorption rate.

      All 3 immediate release preparations contain 400 mg ibuprofen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial will be performed in a single centre, open-label, randomised (order of
      treatments), balanced, 3-period, 6-sequence, single dose change-over design with
      administration under fasting conditions separated by a washout period of at least 2
      treatment-free days.

      Blood sample collection will be performed over 16 h after administration. This time is
      considered adequate to characterise plasma concentration vs. time profiles long enough for
      reliable estimation of the extent of absorption, i.e. the AUC derived from measurements is
      expected to cover at least 80 % of the AUC extrapolated to infinity.
