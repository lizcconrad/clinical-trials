        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a histologically documented primary, recurrent or residual
             meningioma which is unresectable.

          2. Patients must have active meningioma, which is defined to be one of the following:

               1. Progressive disease within the past 2 years.

               2. Recurrent Disease, as defined by the reappearance of a previously completely
                  resected meningioma, within the past two years.

               3. New disease, defined as a diagnosis of meningioma within the previous two years

          3. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease which is documented on CT or MRI
             scan.

          4. Patients should have already received radiotherapy unless radiotherapy is
             inappropriate due to tumor location(s) or unless radiotherapy, after discussion with
             the patient's physician, has been refused. If patients have received prior
             radiotherapy, this treatment must have been completed more than one year prior to
             study entry with documented progressive disease since completion of radiotherapy.

          5. Patients must be 18 years or older, and must have a performance status 0-2 by
             Southwest Oncology Group criteria.

          6. Patients must not have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for meningioma.

          7. Patients must have serum creatinine, SGOT, and bilirubin â‰¤ 2 x IULN.

          8. Patients requiring simultaneous administration of corticosteroids for cerebral edema
             must have been receiving a stable dose of corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks prior
             to study entry.

          9. Patients receiving anti-epileptic medications are eligible. However barbiturates
             should be avoided if possible.

         10. Patients with meningiomatosis (diffuse meningeal infiltration resulting in only
             nonevaluable meningeal thickening) are not eligible. However, patients with multiple
             measurable or evaluable meningioma tumor masses are eligible.

         11. Patients with malignant meningioma are not eligible. Malignant meningioma is defined
             as meningioma that demonstrates hypercellularity, loss of architecture, nuclear
             pleomorphism, numerous mitoses, focal necrosis, and brain invasion.

         12. Patients who have had additive or ablative modulation of sex hormone or glucocorticoid
             pathways within the preceding 3 months (not including stable corticosteroid therapy
             for cerebral edema) are not eligible. Such modulations include but are not limited to
             birth control pills, bilateral oophorectomy or orchiectomy, progestational inserts,
             oral or vaginal exogenous estrogens, androgens or antiandrogens, progestational
             agonists, tamoxifen, aminoglutethimide, o,p-DDD, ACTH, glucocorticoids not for
             cerebral edema, and leuprolides (or other LH-RH inhibitors). Patients must not have
             received prior mifepristone therapy for meningioma.

         13. Patients must not have serious intercurrent medical illness; that is, any illness that
             in the opinion of the investigator would prevent following the study regimen.

         14. Patients with clinical adrenal insufficiency requiring exogenous corticosteroid
             replacement are not eligible.

         15. Patients with a known allergy to mifepristone are not eligible.

         16. Patients with base of brain, cavernous sinus or optic nerve meningiomas or with visual
             symptoms must have a formal visual field examination.

         17. Pregnant or lactating women may not participate. Pre-menopausal women and men of
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective
             local contraceptive method (such as a condom, diaphragm, or IUD) or abstinence during
             and for 3 months after study therapy.

         18. Patients with other prior or concurrent malignancy within the preceding 5 years,
             except surgically treated squamous or basal cell skin cancer or cervical cancer in
             situ, are not eligible.
