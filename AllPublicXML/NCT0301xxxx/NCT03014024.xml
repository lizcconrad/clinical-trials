    <textblock>
      Conservative treatment of distal radius fracture is immobilisation with cast for 4-6 weeks.
      After removing the cast, it is common to still have pain, swelling and reduced mobility in
      the wrist. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of LLLT on the hand.

      Patient with distal radius fractures are after removal of the cast are recruited form Bergen
      Emergency Department, where the are randomly divided into two groups with concealed
      allocation. Patient will be treated 3 times a week, for 3 week. After removal of the cast,
      the patients pain threshold, swelling, AROM, strength and function is measured. The patients
      will meet for following-up controls until 26 weeks after injury.

    <description>After inclusion in the study, patients will be treated with LLLT. The laser is a super pulsed infrared laser with a wavelength of 904 nm, belonging to laser class 3B. Patient will be treated from dorsal side of the wrist on the fracture area, and distal ulna area from the palmar side. Total 20 second on each side (3 points), with 3,6 J/cm2. the light from the laser is not visible to the eye, and will not give any perceptible stimulus. The x-ray will be used to find the fracture line.</description>

    <description>After inclusion in the study, patients will be treated with placebo LLLT. This placebo laser is identical in appearance to the other super pulsed infrared laser with a wavelength of 904 nm, belonging to laser class 3B. Patient will be treated on the same areas, and have the same procedure and time. Since the light from the laser is invisible neither the participant nor the therapist will know whether the laser is a placebo.</description>
