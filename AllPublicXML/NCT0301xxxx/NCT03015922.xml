  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit patients currently receiving either lenalidomide or pomalidomide
      whose disease is relapsing. This is a dose escalation study and the aim is to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of REOLYSIN® that can be given in combination with lenalidomide
      or pomalidomide. The study will also investigate the safety, side effects and effectiveness
      of this treatment combination. Pomalidomide and lenalidomide will be evaluated separately as
      two separate groups.
