  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the incidence of gastric cancer has been substantially declining for several
      decades, it is still the sixth most common cancer and the fourth most frequent cause of
      cancer death worldwide. Surgery is still the only curative option for gastric cancer.
      However, most patients are unable to undergo surgery because of late stage, unresectable
      disease. The prognosis for these patients is very poor. Although the Magic trial showed that
      perioperative chemotherapy can increase the rate of curative surgery and significantly
      improve overall survival in patients with operable gastric or lower esophageal
      adenocarcinomas, no pCR events were reported in this trial. The intervention arm in PREACT
      consists of pre-operative chemotherapy, pre-operative radiochemotherapy, surgery and
      post-operative chemotherapy. The control arm consists of pre-operative chemotherapy, surgery,
      and post-operative chemotherapy. The primary purpose of PREACT is to investigate whether the
      addition of radiochemotherapy to chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in the
      pre-operative setting in improving disease free survival in patients with locally advanced
      gastric or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma.

    <description>A standard D2 gastrectomy was recommended. The type of gastrectomy performed depended on the location and extent of the primary lesion. For middle third tumors, the gastric margin was recommended to be more than 5 cm, and a total gastrectomy was performed. For lower third tumors, a 2 cm duodenal margin was recommended and a subtotal or total gastrectomy was considered. For upper third tumors, a 3 cm esophageal margin was recommended and a total gastrectomy or esophagogastrectomy was performed. Billroth I or Roux-en-y gastrojejunostomy was performed for distal gastrectomy patients, Roux-en-y esophagojejunostomy was performed for total gastrectomy patients.</description>
