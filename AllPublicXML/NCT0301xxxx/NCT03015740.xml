  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable or recommended dose
      of MGCD5 that can be given with nivolumab to patients with kidney cancer. Researchers also
      want to learn if this dose can help to control the disease. The safety of this drug
      combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. MGCD516 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only. Nivolumab is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of many types of cancer, including kidney cancer.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 4
      dose levels based on when you join this study. The dose of MGCD516 you receive will depend on
      how well previously enrolled patients tolerated the study drug. All participants will receive
      the same dose of nivolumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 14 days (2 weeks).

      You will take MGCD516 by mouth every day while you are on study. Each dose should be taken in
      the morning at about the same time each day. You should take MGCD516 at least 2 hours after
      and 1 hour before your next meal. For example, you can take your dose in the morning at least
      1 hour before breakfast.

      You will be given a study drug diary to keep track of when you take each dose and if you miss
      or vomit any doses. You should return any empty study drug bottles or leftover study drug to
      the clinic at the beginning of each cycle.

      You will also receive nivolumab by vein over 60 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond. You
      will not receive nivolumab during Cycle 1.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue to receive the study drugs for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in
      your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      Every 2 weeks:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  At Week 2 and week 4, you will complete quality-of-life questionaires.

      At Weeks 6 and 12 and then every 12 weeks after that:

        -  You will have an MRI and/or CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. If needed, you
           may also have an x-ray or bone scan.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the level of sugar in your blood. You
           must fast for 8 hours before this test.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, urine will be collected for routine tests. You will
           complete the quality-of-life questionaires.

      At Week 12 and then every 6 months after that, you will have an ECHO. You may have this test
      more often if the doctor thinks it's needed.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a CT or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen,
           and pelvis.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      You will be called by a member of the study staff every 3 months to ask how you are doing and
      if you have started any new anti-cancer treatments. This information may be collected from
      your medical record instead. This phone call should take about 5-10 minutes.

      These calls will stop if you decide you no longer want to take part in this study.

             examination finding, or clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a
             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of MGCD516 or nivolumab or that
             might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at
             high risk from treatment complications.

         16. Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week
             (7 days) of study entry or during study period.
