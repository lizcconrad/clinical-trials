  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborns with unilateral cleft lip/ palate will be treated pre-surgically by Vacuum formed
      aligners in order to evaluate its effect on Nasoalveolar complex.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      newborns with unilateral cleft lip/ palate will be allocated into two groups: treatment group
      will receive Vacuum formed aligners while control group will not receive Vacuum formed
      aligners.

      the follow-up period will be 3 months till surgical lip closure. the assessment will be
      through a questionnaire for the parents' satisfaction outcome, standardized photographs for
      measurement of nasal changes and interlabial gap outcome and digital maxillary models for the
      maxillary dimension change outcome.
