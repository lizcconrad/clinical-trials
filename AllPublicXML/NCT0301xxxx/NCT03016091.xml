      A Phase II, Open-label, Single Arm Trial of Pembrolizumab for Refractory Atypical and
      Anaplastic Meningioma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, single arm, open label, interventional study. The goal of
      this study, is to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of pembrolizumab for the treatment of
      recurrent or progressive meningioma (WHO grades II-III) or hemangiopericytoma (HPC). All
      patients will receive IV pembrolizumab, at a dose of 200mg, every 3 weeks. Patients will be
      treated until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Treatment can be stopped after one
      year of treatment in case of stable disease or completer response, with re-initiation of
      treatment upon progression. Expression of PD1 and PD-L1 will be tested, on tumor cells, using
      IHC staining on biopsy material obtained from previous surgeries.

      All patients will have a baseline neurologic and clinical exam, MRI scan, a brain dedicated
      CT-PET scan, a baseline cognitive exam and QOL assessment with a dedicated questionnaire.
      Patients will have a clinical and neurological exam every treatment cycle. MRI scan will be
      repeated after 2 months from the beginning of the trial drug administration and then every
      2-3 months. There are no designated and specific criteria for response assessment in the
      treatment of meningioma. Therefore, response evaluation will be made using the RECIST 1.1
      criteria, as used for solid tumors. The trial will allow the continuation of pembrolizumab in
      case of stable or improved clinical response, when pseudo-progression is suspected in the
      MRI. In addition, response assessment will also be made according to the RANO criteria, as
      used for high grade glioma. This will be compared to the RECIST evaluation, but will not be
      used for treatment decision making.
