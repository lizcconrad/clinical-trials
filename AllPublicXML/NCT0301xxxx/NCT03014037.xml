  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal conditions are common sources of pain. Specifically, osteoarthritis affects
      nearly 27 million people in the United States. This disease leads to the breakdown of the
      cartilage surfaces of the joints, which serve as the connection points between the bones of
      the body, causing a large amount of pain and disability in patients. Increasing the number of
      available treatment options for osteoarthritis is becoming increasingly more important as
      Americans continue to age. Using stem cells taken from bone marrow is one of the
      non-operative treatments that has been gaining popularity in the recent past. This study aims
      to clarify how this procedure should best be done by comparing stem cell concentrations and
      patient outcomes (short and long term) in patients who have stem cells taken from one area vs
      two (unilateral vs bilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) aspirations).

      two (unilateral vs bilateral posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) aspirations).

      This research study involves the participant being randomly placed into one of two groups;
      one group will have cells taken from one hip, and the other will have cells taken from both
      hips. Both of these approaches are performed in clinics currently, and both are considered to
      be standard of care. All bone marrow collected for the purposes of this study will be
      obtained by the principal investigator while performing the standard procedure. In obtaining
      these sample the physicians will abide by the standard of care set forth for the Bone Marrow
      Aspiration Concentrate procedure.

    <measure>Change Quality of Life assessed by the Emory Quality of Life (EQOL) Survey Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, Follow Up (Up to One Year)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQOL survey measures five dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The participant will be asked to answer questions regarding these measures and to indicate their current experience on a scale from 1 to 3; 1 being &quot;no problem&quot; and 3 being &quot;most extreme problem&quot;. The answers to these question are put together to create a 5 digit composite score.This composite score can be indexed to a lookup table which produces a single summary score from 0 to 100. The lookup table we use is weighted and normalized to the United Stated general population.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment, Follow Up (Up to One Year)</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS questionnaire is an instrument to assess the patient's opinion about their osteoarthritis and associated problems. It consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. A total lower score indicates more problems.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Capacity of Isolated Cells to Differentiate Down Cell Lineages</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Cell Culture (Up to 21 Days)</time_frame>
    <description>Bone marrow aspirate will be placed in 10 mL heparinized tubes and nucleated cells will be isolated with a density gradient and re-suspended in complete culture medium for plating. Isolated adherent cells will be processed for the ability to differentiate down osteogenic-, adipogenic- and chondrogenic-lineage after cell harvest. Specifically, isolated cells are treated with different media to induce their differentiation into 1) osteo-progenitor cells (identified by positive staining with Alzarian red, 2) adipocytes (identified by positive staining with Oil-Red) and 3) chondrocytes (identified by positive staining with Alcian blue). The presence of these phenotypes should be prevalent by 3 weeks; if not, the cells are not considered pluripotent for that lineage and hence would not be classified as mesenchymal stem cells.</description>
