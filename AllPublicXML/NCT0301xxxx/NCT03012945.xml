  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is one of the most important treatments for malignant tumor; on the other
      hand, tumor recurrence and/or metastasis are the major reasons of treatment failure. The
      outcome after surgery mostly depends on the balance between the immunity of human body and
      the capability of implantation, proliferation and neovascularization of the tumor.
      Preclinical and retrospective studies suggest that anaesthetic techniques and drugs may
      affect the long-term prognosis in patients undergoing cancer surgery. The investigators
      hypothesize that epidural anesthesia-analgesia may improve the long-term outcome of the
      elderly patients who are scheduled to undergo major thoracic and abdominal surgery for the
      treatment of malignant tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is the main treatment for potentially curable solid tumors. However, it is
      unavoidable that some tumor cells are disseminated into the circulatory or lymphatic system
      during surgery. And quite a number of patients develop tumor metastasis and/or recurrence
      after surgery, which are associated with poor long-term outcome. The development of tumor
      recurrence and/or metastasis after surgery is mostly dependent on the balance between the
      anti-tumor immune function of the human body and the ability of implantation, proliferation
      and neovascularization of the tumor cells.

      Multiple surgical factors may influence the balance between the anti-tumor immune function
      and tumor recurrence. For example, the presence of the primary tumor inhibits angiogenesis,
      whereas tumor resection eliminates this safeguard against angiogenesis; surgical manipulation
      releases tumor cells into the circulation; surgical response inhibits natural killer (NK)
      cell activity and can promote the development of tumor metastases; local and systemic release
      of growth factors during surgery may also promote tumor recurrence both locally and at
      distant sites.

      Furthermore, studies show that general anaesthetic techniques and drugs may influence the
      cellular immune function and long-term outcome. For example, it was found that ketamine and
      thiopental, but not propofol, suppressed NK cell activity; all three drugs caused a
      significant reduction in NK cell number; isoflurane and halothane inhibit interferon (IFN)
      stimulation of NK cell cytotoxicity; nitrous oxide interferes with DNA, purine, and
      thymidylate synthesis and depresses neutrophil chemotaxis; opioids have been shown to
      suppress cell-mediated and humoral immunity.

      Considering the potential harmful effects of general anesthesia/anesthetics, there is
      increasing interest on the effect of regional anaesthesia. Retrospective studies
      investigating the relationship between epidural anesthesia and outcome after cancer surgery
      give different results. In a meta-analysis, regional anesthesia was associated with increased
      the survival rate (HR = 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.96, P = 0.013), but had no
      effect on the rate of tumor recurrence/metastasis (HR = 0.88, 95% Cl 0.64-1.22, P = 0.457).
      The investigators hypothesize that epidural anesthesia may produce favorable effects on the
      long-term outcome of the elderly patients who were scheduled for major cancer surgery under
      general anesthesia. However, there is no sufficient evidence in this aspect.

    <description>Patients assigned to this group (experimental group) received combined epidural-general anesthesia (combined Epi-GA) and patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). An epidural catheter was placed before anesthesia induction. General anesthesia was induced and maintained in the same manner as in the control group, with the addition of a continuous infusion or intermittent boluses of 0.5%-0.75% ropivacaine given through the epidural catheter for anesthesia maintenance. Patient-controlled epidural analgesia was used for postoperative analgesia (0.12% ropivacaine and 0.5 ug/mL sufentanil in 250 mL normal saline, programmed to deliver a 2-mL bolus with a lockout interval of 20 minutes and a background infusion of 4 mL/hr).</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to this group (control group) received general anesthesia (GA) and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA). General anesthesia was induced with midazolam, sufentanil, propofol and rocuronium. Anesthesia was then maintained by inhalation of oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture (1:1-2) and sevoflurane, and/or continuous intravenous infusing of propofol. Sufentanil and rocuronium were given when needed. Other types of opioids and muscle relaxants were also provided when necessary. Patient-controlled intravenous analgesia was used for postoperative analgesia (50 mg morphine in 100 mL normal saline, programmed to deliver a 2-mL bolus with a 6-10 minutes lockout interval and a 1 mL/hr background infusion).</description>
