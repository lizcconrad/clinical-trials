    <textblock>
      Patients who had at least two risk factors of PONV (Postoperative nausea and vomiting) and
      underwent laparoscopic surgeries under general anesthesia were assessed for eligibility.
      Patients who developed PONV within the first 2 hours after anesthesia received intravenously,
      in a randomized double-blind manner, ondansetron 4 mg or ramosetron 0.3 mg. Patients were
      then observed for 24 hours after drug administration. The incidence of nausea and vomiting,
      severity of nausea, requirements for rescue antiemetic and adverse effects at 0-2 and 2-24
      hours after drug administration were evaluated. The primary endpoint was the rate of patients
      exhibiting complete response, defined as no emesis and no further rescue antiemetic
      medication for 24 hours after drug administration.

    <description>Ondansetron also has been reported as effective prophylactic and therapeutic 5-HT3 receptor antagonist for the treatment of PONV. Ramosetron has been shown to have a very strong effect for preventing PONV in previous meta-analyses, but in recent report, its clinical significance may be questioned to request for additional study.</description>

    <description>Ramosetron is a newly developed selective 5-HT3 (5 hydroxytryptamine 3) receptor antagonist with longer duration of action up to 48hours and higher receptor affinity, than its previously developed congeners, including ondansetron.</description>
