        Case Exclusion Criteria:

        Subject has one of the following:

          1. Pseudoaneurysm;

          2. Previous infection or trauma in the damaged part of aorta;

          3. Pregnancy female;

          4. Participate in other clinical trials in the last 1 months.

        Control Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age and gender are matched with cases;

          2. No aortic disease was detected by outpatient ultrasound;

          3. No family history of cardiovascular disease;

          4. Normal biochemical indicators;

        Criteria for culling, shedding and suspension testing:

          1. Culling: Unqualified cases and controls. Data of culled subjects can not be used for
             statistical analysis;

          2. Shedding: Subject that self withdrawal, loss to follow-up, or quitted by doctors;
             Reasons for shedding should be indicated for each shed subject.

          3. Suspension: a) The researchers found significant safety problems or wrong study
             design; b) Researchers cannot continue clinical research due to funding or management
             reasons; c) Director ends the study. When suspension happens, all the CRF table should
             be reserved for future reference.
