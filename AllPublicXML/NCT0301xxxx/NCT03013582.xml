  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tendon adhesions of the hand remain a ubiquitous problem facing hand surgeons and hand
      therapists alike. Despite their commonality, no consensus exists as to the best means of
      preventing adhesions, or the most ideal methods to treat them once they have occurred. The
      purpose of this study is to compare patient outcomes after standard operative tenolysis
      performed for adhesions of the hand to outcomes after tenolysis with the use of allograft
      human amniotic membrane.

      Patients who are scheduled to undergo operative tenolysis of the flexor and/or extensor
      tendons of the hand will be recruited. Our target enrollment is 40 patients (20 control plus
      20 experimental), based on the power analysis detailed in the next paragraph. Enrolled
      patients will be randomized to either standard operative tenolysis, or tenolysis with
      placement of AlloWrap. Randomization will be performed by computerized random number
      generator. All surgeries will be performed by one senior fellowship-trained hand surgeon.
      Baseline measurements of total active motion (TAM), passive range of motion (PROM), and
      survey scores of the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH) and Patient
      Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) will be recorded pre-operatively. In addition, patients' pain
      level will be assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) both at rest, and during the
      examination. These same values will be re-evaluated at post-operative follow-up visits at 2
      weeks, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. PROM will also be evaluated intra-operatively by the
      surgeon, and documented.
