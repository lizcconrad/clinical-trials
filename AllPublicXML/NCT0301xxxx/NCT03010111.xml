      The investigators aim to study the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) using
      whole-blood interferon-r release assays, and determine the risk factors of LTBI in Korean
      health care workers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of latent tuberculosis infection developed in Korean health care workers</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The participants performed QuaniFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-IT test) and blood sampling at enrollment. So, the length of time which from the start of the first test of very first participants to the end of test of very last participant is 3 months. The percentage of participants with LTBI in health care workers was evaluated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Annual incidence of latent tuberculosis infection in Korean health care workers</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after first QFT-IT test (12-15 months)</time_frame>
    <description>QFT-IT test was performed at enrollment and repeated at point of one year after enrollment. So, the length of time which from the start of the first test of very first participants to the end of the second test of very last participant is 12 to 15 months. The percentage of participants with positive conversion in follow-up QFT-IT test (second test) was evaluated in participants who had negative results in the first QFT-IT test. Annual infection of LTBI was evaluated with the conversion of QFT-IT test through annual check up of QFT-IT test.</description>
