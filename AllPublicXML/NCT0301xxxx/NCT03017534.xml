  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism responsible for improvement following manual physical therapy techniques is
      unknown. Previous studies have indicated both biomechanical and neurophysiologic effects
      which may be responsible for clinical changes observed. Yet, other studies report clinical
      changes following sham interventions. Through a mixed-methods design, this study aims to gain
      more understanding of the social and contextual factors that may be related to the
      improvement often observed following manual therapy techniques.

      A convenience sample will be utilized to obtain subjects. Subjects will be given a brief
      questionnaire to identify possible contraindications for manual therapy treatment techniques
      and exclude individuals if necessary. Subjects will be randomized into one of eight groups
      (three variables, each with two conditions including: therapist gender match/mismatch, lab
      coat worn/not worn, detailed explanation/colloquial conversation about the technique) and
      participate in neurodynamic testing for the upper quarter via the Upper Limb Provocation
      Test. Subjects who are determined to be positive for one or more extremities will receive a
      sham thoracic spine manipulation technique. After application of the technique, previously
      positive limbs will be retested. Individuals who respond favorably to the sham technique upon
      reassessment will participate in an exit interview with open-ended questions in attempt to
      gain more insight into the factors which may have influenced their neurodynamic mobility
      improvement.

    <description>Subjects will lie on their back with their shoulder slightly off the edge of a treatment table. The investigator will sidebend the subjects neck away from the extremity being tested and gradually move the extremity into the following positions: scapular depression, shoulder 90 deg abduction, shoulder 90 deg external rotation, forearm supination, wrist/finger extension, and elbow extension. The investigator will assess for symptoms at each phase throughout the test. At the onset of symptoms, sensitization maneuvers will be completed to determine if the origin of the symptoms is neurodynamic in nature and not myofascial.</description>
