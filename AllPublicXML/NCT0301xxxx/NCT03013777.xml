  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the severity of anxiety and
      depression in adult patients with familial dysautonomia. Patients will be enrolled in an
      8-week CBT program. All CBT sessions will be done either in person at the NYU Dysautonomia
      Center or over the phone to help accommodate disability and potential physical limitations of
      our patient population.

      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), defined as a program of interventions that utilize
      education to teach relaxation, healthy coping skills, stress management, assertiveness
      training in order to help the individual identify and correct maladaptive beliefs in
      combination with education to help practice symptom reduction and improve quality of life and
      function. Patients will participate in eight forty-five minute sessions of CBT with a mental
      health therapist in order to help treat generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety disorder due to
      another medical condition (familial dysautonomia), major depressive disorder, persistent
      depressive disorder (dysthymia), substance/medication- induced depressive disorder,
      depressive disorder due to another medical condition.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Short, but comprehensive scale that consists specifically to the criteria for diagnosis in the DSM-V. The PHQ-9 is effective and sensitive as an instrument in establishing tentative depressive disorder diagnoses while also assessing severity of depressive symptoms. The brevity and criterion validity of the scale make it an appropriate, dual purpose instrument for assessing the severity of depressive disorder within a clinical trial.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>10-item questionnaire that objectively measures global self-worth. The Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale is a 10-item questionnaire that objectively measures global self-worth. The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is a 10-item scale scored using a four-point response. The scale has extensive and acceptable reliability and validity, both convergent and discriminant</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI has 40 items, 20 items for each of the S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety sub scales. The STAI was chosen for brevity while also providing a broad coverage of DSM V diagnostic criteria for anxiety. The STAI has proven efficacy in measuring valid self-reports of anxiety symptoms and propensity for anxiety.</description>
