  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is an incurable, devastating, inherited
      skin disease caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene that encodes for type VII collagen (C7),
      the major component of anchoring fibrils (AFs), structures that mediate epidermal-dermal
      adherence. Thirty percent of RDEB patients have nonsense mutations. The investigators
      recently demonstrated in 5 such patients that intradermal and topical gentamicin induced
      &quot;read-through&quot; of their nonsense mutations and created robust and sustained new C7 and AFs at
      the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) of their skin and also stimulated wound closure and
      reduced new blister formation. No untoward side effects occurred. Herein, the investigators
      propose evaluating the safety and efficacy of intravenous gentamicin in these patients. In
      theory, this intravenous administration has the possibility of treating simultaneously all of
      the patients' skin wounds. The investigators also propose optimizing the concentration and
      manner of delivery of topical gentamicin. The unambiguous milestones will be increased C7 and
      AFs in the patients' DEJ, improved EB Disease Activity Scores, and absence of significant
      gentamicin side effects.
