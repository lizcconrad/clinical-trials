  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is the most prevalent personality disorder in young
      community population whose most severe complication is suicide. Pharmacotherapy should not be
      used as the primary treatment for BPD as the benefits are unclear. Psychotherapy is the main
      treatment for people with BPD and the current recommendation is adapting available
      comprehensive treatments to develop easier and briefer therapies that are also effective.
      Iconic Therapy is an innovative option whose good clinical results should be validated on a
      clinical trial.

    <textblock>
      Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in the early adulthood is an increasing diagnosis among
      general population. First symptoms detection and early intervention might help prevent its
      aggravation and further BPD diagnosis. Iconic Therapy is an innovative manual-driven
      psychotherapy to specifically and intensively treat BPD symptoms. Preliminary clinical
      results are good. The aim of the present study is to assess the effectiveness of the Iconic
      Therapy in comparison to a support structured therapy in an ecological setting (Spanish
      public specialized mental health care). The study is planned as a randomized controlled
      prospective trial that will randomize 60 young people (15 to 25 years old) with suicidal
      ideation/self-injuring behaviour and borderline personality traits. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the two groups: Iconic Therapy or support structured therapy on a
      1:1 basis. Both the Iconic Therapy and the support therapy programs consist of 10-12 weekly
      sessions delivered by two trained psychologists for about 8-12 outpatients on group format.
      The primary outcome measure is the change of symptoms severity assessed by the Borderline
      Personality Disorder List (BSL-23). Secondary outcomes include suicidal ideation and
      behavior, non-suicidal self-injures maladjustment to the daily life and economic evaluation
      for health care. Assessments will be performed at baseline after the intervention 6 and 12
      months of follow-up. It is hypothesized that those attending the Iconic Therapy group will
      show a permanently reduction of the severity of symptoms as compared with those attending the
      structured support group. Data will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE)
      models.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the severity of borderline personality disorder measured by Borderline Personality Symptom List (BSL-23).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12 months after inclusion.</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire (BSL-23) is a dimensional instrument: the most widely used to assess borderline personality disorder symptomatology improvement in clinical trials. The Spanish validated version of the questionnaire will be used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sociodemographic variables</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The following socio-demographic data will be collected: gender, age, marital status, parents´nationality, coexistence (no studies, primary studies, Secondary studies, University, Professional formation), occupation (student, working, both studying and working, pensioner) and family member or allied friend´s phone number for further contacts.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the suicidal ideation and behavior measured by the Columbia Suicide History Form (SSRS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12 months after inclusion.</time_frame>
    <description>this instrument measures ideation (wish, thinking, intention and plan), ideation severity (frequency, duration, control capacity, disuasory elements and reasons) and suicidal behavior (attempts and acts). It is considered an adequate tool for treatment planning and research.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on non-suicidal self-injure diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12 months after inclusion.</time_frame>
    <description>It does not exist a specific validated scale to assess non suicidal self injures so the investigators collected and asked about all the 6 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V) criteria. The investigators aim to separately describe the incidence of suicide attempts/acts vs non suicidal self injures in this study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the economic evaluation measured by the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) - adapted Spanish version (CSRI-Spanish version)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12 months after inclusion.</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire to assess use of healthcare/social care services and other economic impacts. This instrument has two subscales to assess either direct costs (emergency services/hospital admissions use, specialised medical consultations, prescribed diagnosis trials and consumed medication) or indirect costs (absenteeism and quantity/quality of job performance on a 100-point scales).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the maladjustment to the daily life measured by the Maladjustment Scale (EI).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12 months after inclusion.</time_frame>
    <description>It is a brief instrument of 6 self-report items assessing maladjustment to the daily life on psychiatric population. A six point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 5 (very strong) is used. It is sensitive to therapeutic changes.</description>

    <description>The Iconic Therapy program consists of two parts: a) an intensive program of 10-12-week basic skills group 60-minute duration with a range of 6 to 8 face-to-face inserted sessions and b) an additional one-year program of 4 to 6 gradually less frequent face-to-face sessions. The groups are typically lead by two trainers —therapist and co-therapist- for about 8-12 outpatients. Added to these established sessions, a variable number of face-to-face individual sessions with the principal investigator will also take place. They will depend on participant´s requirements. They will consist on coaching their demands and providing human support throughout the study.</description>
