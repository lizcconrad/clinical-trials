  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cohort study, the investigators will study the asymptomatic period preceding the
      onset of active Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) in HIV‐infected individuals from VL endemic
      regions in Ethiopia as an avenue to develop an evidence‐based screen and treat strategy to
      prevent progression to active VL.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV co-infection drastically increases the risk of developing active VL. Clinical outcomes
      are dire in immune-compromised patients even with the best available treatment, and relapse
      is frequent. The incubation period may provide an important window of opportunity for a
      pre-emptive &quot;screen an treat&quot; approach in HIV co-infected patients to prevent progression
      from infection to the active disease. However, no recommendations exist to date due to lack
      of solid evidence.

      It is not known which patients are at highest risk of disease progression, which role
      parasite/host/HIV factors play in the asymptomatic infection phase, and what the diagnostic
      values of existing Leishmania infection markers are. Such information is needed to develop a
      prognostic clinical tool for the detection of HIV patients at high risk of developing active
      VL.

      Therefore, the aim is to study the asymptomatic period preceding the onset of active VL in
      HIV‐infected individuals from VL endemic regions in Ethiopia as an avenue to develop an
      evidence‐based screen and treat strategy to prevent progression to active VL. This will be a
      prospective cohort study with two years of follow-up for patients who remain VL free.
      Patients developing active VL during the study period will be followed for one year after
      disease onset.
