      This study evaluates the longitudinal health and social outcomes of adolescent mental health
      service users who are at the transition boundary of their child and adolescent mental health
      service, and whether the implementation of a model of managed transition at the service
      boundary benefits them, as compared to usual care.

      The MILESTONE study focuses on the period when young people attending a children and
      adolescents mental health service (CAMHS) need to move on, or &quot;transition&quot;, to an adult
      mental health service (AMHS), if they still require care or treatment. We know from other
      research that this transition is not always properly managed and that improving the
      transition process can have a positive impact on the health and well-being of young people in
      this position. We want to evaluate what impact the different transition experiences have on
      young people's health and well-being, and whether the process of Managed Transition has any
      benefits as compared to usual care.

      The MILESTONE study is run in eight European countries (UK, Ireland, Belgium, Holland,
      France, Germany, Italy and Croatia). CAMHS in the study regions are selected to provide the
      young people in their care that are reaching transition age either usual care or a novel
      service called &quot;Managed Transition&quot;, which includes the use of a new decision support tool,
      the Transition Readiness and Appropriateness Measure (TRAM). This should help with decision
      making and enable better transitions by identifying cases for whom transition from CAMHS to
      AMHS is advisable and appropriate, or who can be safely discharged or referred to a community
      based service. CAMHS are randomly assigned to provide the intervention of Managed Transition
      or usual care. The health and well-being of the young people attending these services is
      assessed at the start of the study and then followed-up for 24 months to see whether they
      transition to AMHS or are discharged or referred to some other service.

Feedback of TRAM findings to the CAMHS clinician to support decisions made regarding transition, communication with stakeholders and the transition process. Clinicians will be expected to communicate the findings to the young person and parent/carer, and, if a referral is made, to send the TRAM feedback to the adult clinician along with the referral letter.
The clinicians will also receive information prior to recruitment begin on the use of TRAM and the way in which it fits in with optimal transition.</description>
