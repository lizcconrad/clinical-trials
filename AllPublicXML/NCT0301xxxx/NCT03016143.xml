    <textblock>
      The study is a single centre, phase II, double-blind, randomized, comparative trial that
      explored the immunogenicity and safety of single dose a allantoic split inactivated seasonal
      influenza vaccine and VAXIGRIP vacccine in healthy adults the two age groups (in persons 18
      to 60 years of age and older than 60 years).

    <description>Seroconversion rate was measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer for each of the three strains (A/H1N1 strain, A/H3N2 strain, B strain), 21 days after vaccination. Seroconversion rate was defined as the percentage of participants achieving a minimal 4-fold increase from the Baseline HI antibody titer in participants with a Baseline titer ≥10, or achieving an HI antibody titer of ≥40 in participants with a Baseline titer &lt;10.</description>

    <measure>Seroprotection Rate of HI Antibody Titer</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline HI Antibody Titer at 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Seroprotection rate, defined as the percentage of participants with HI antibody titer of ≥40, was measured by HI antibody titer for each of the three strains (A/H1N1 strain, A/H3N2 strain, B strain), 21 days after vaccination. Day 1 data is reported for reference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded solicited injection site and systemic adverse events in a Subject Diary. Solicited Locals AEs were: Injection Site Pain, Injection Site Redness, Injection Site Swelling, Injection Site Induration and Injection Site Ecchymosis. Solicited Systemic AEs were: Pyrexia, Malaise, Chills, Fatigue, Headache, Sweaty, Myalgia, Arthralgia, Nausea and Vomiting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reporting One or More Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events are defined as unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless of relationship to the medicinal product. TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Abnormal Safety Laboratory Tests at Least Once Post Dose Reported as AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with any abnormal standard safety laboratory values (Chemistry, Hematology and Urinalysis) collected throughout the study reported as AEs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serious adverse events (SAEs), including abnormal laboratory findings</measure>
    <time_frame>21 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) are medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, result in disability/incapacity or are a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.</description>
