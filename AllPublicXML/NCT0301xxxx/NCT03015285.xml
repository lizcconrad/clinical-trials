    <textblock>
      Adults with high anxiety sensitivity (AS) and a mental health diagnosis of anxiety,
      depression, or posttraumatic stress will be recruited and will be randomly assigned to either
      transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for AS or disorder-specific CBT for their
      primary mental health problem. The study outcomes - AS, anxiety, mood, and substance use
      symptoms, and functional impairment - will be assessed at pre-and post-treatment and 6 and 12
      months post-treatment via standardized self-report measures completed by participants and a
      standardized diagnostic interview.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While our previous work has provided some evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
      for anxiety sensitivity(AS) reduces mental health symptoms, the current study aims to
      determine whether this treatment works as well as traditional disorder-specific CBT (which
      aims to treat the specific disorder a person presents with, such as CBT for panic disorder
      for someone with panic disorder) in treating anxiety and depression. This will be the first
      study to have looked at this question.

      Our objectives are to determine:

        1. if there is a difference in the extent to which CBT for AS vs. disorder-specific CBT
           reduces, in the short- and long-term, a) AS, b) symptoms of a person's primary and
           secondary mental health problems, and c) functional disability (i.e., a person's ability
           to function in day-to-day life);

        2. if the two treatments lead to differences in the number of participants who no longer
           meet the requirements for a diagnosis (of their primary or secondary mental health
           problems) in the short- and long-term; and

        3. if the treatments are seen as similarly satisfactory by participants.

      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned (via online random number generator) to
      either transdiagnostic CBT for AS or disorder-specific CBT for their primary mental health
      problem. Both CBT interventions are evidence-based, guided by treatment manuals/workbooks
      (provided to participants), and involve 12 weekly therapy sessions. The AS intervention will
      also involve a physical exercise component (i.e., running/brisk walking 3x/week starting on
      week 5) and participants will be provided with a wearable fitness device designed to provide
      physiological indices of arousal and track physical activity. The study outcomes - AS,
      anxiety, mood, and substance use symptoms, and functional impairment - will be assessed at
      pre-and post-treatment and 6 and 12 months post-treatment via standardized self-report
      measures completed by participants and a standardized diagnostic interview.

    <time_frame>baseline (i.e., start of study), 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The ASI-3 is an 18-item self-report measure that indexes the amount of fear an individual experiences with respect to anxiety-related body sensations. Participants indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with each item (e.g., &quot;It scares me when my heart beats rapidly&quot;) on a 5-point Likert-type scale.</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic status as measured by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (i.e., start of study), 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Administered by a trained researcher blind to treatment condition. The SCID-5 has been widely used in numerous research studies and is well empirically validated. At each time point, we will assess participants' primary and secondary diagnoses as well as the overall number of diagnoses for which they qualify.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General distress as measured by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (i.e., start of study), 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales - 21. The DASS-21 is a shortened version of the 42-item DASS and is composed of three subscales: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress. Individuals indicate the extent to which a particular negative emotional state (e.g., &quot;I found it difficult to relax&quot;) has applied to them over the past week on a 4-point Likert-type scale (0 = Did not apply to me at all to 3 = Applied to me very much or most of the time).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>General distress as measured by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation measure (CORE-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (i.e., start of study), 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE-10) is a brief, 10-item self-report measure designed to assess common presentations of symptoms of psychological distress. Participants are asked to indicate how often in the past week they have felt a series of symptoms (e.g., &quot;I have felt tense, anxious, or nervous&quot;) on a 5-point Likert-type scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional disability as measured by the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (i.e., start of study), 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale will be used to measure functional impairment in three domains: work/school, family life, and social. Using a 10-point visual analogue scale, participants rate the extent to which their general mental health symptoms disrupt their work/school, family life/responsibilities, and social life. Participants also indicate the number of days their mental health symptoms caused them to miss school/work as well as the number of days their symptoms had caused their performance to be reduced during the past week. The SDS is well-validated and widely used with a range of populations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Drinking Motives as measured by the Modified Drinking Motives Questionnaire - Revised (MDMQ-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (i.e., start of study), 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The MDMQ-R measures drinking motives. Respondents estimate how often they drink for the reason specified in each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hazardous alcohol use as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (i.e., start of study), 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Despite being designed as a screening tool, the AUDIT is commonly used to assess alcohol use problems pre- and post-treatment. The AUDIT is a 10-item self-report measure that asks participants to report on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, and alcohol-dependent behaviours. Responses are scored on 5-point Likert-type scales. Finally, participants report if they have experienced problems caused by alcohol use on a 3-point Likert-type scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol-related problems as measured by the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP-2R)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline (i.e., start of study), 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SIP-2R consists of the three items from each of five subscales. Participants are asked to indicate the frequency with which they have experienced each of 15 drinking-related problems on a 4-point Likert-type scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment alliance as measured by the Working Alliance Inventory - Short-form (WAI-SR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Only at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WAI-SR is a 12-item self-report questionnaire comprised of three subscales: Goals, or agreement on the goals of therapy, Tasks, or agreement on the tasks of therapy, and Bonds, or the bond between the therapist and the client. Participants indicate the extent to which each of these statements reflects their experience on a 5-point Likert-type scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment satisfaction as measured by several short researcher-generated questions</measure>
    <time_frame>Only at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess satisfaction with the different components of treatment, participants will answer a series of open-ended questions about their experience (e.g., &quot;Was the treatment convenient for you to engage in?&quot;; &quot;Did you find the telephone therapy sessions helpful?&quot;) after all parts of treatment are completed (i.e., at 12 weeks).</description>
