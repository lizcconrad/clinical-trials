        This study will recruit patients with metastatic cancer with or without evidence of
        cachexia, defined as ≥5% drop in body mass in less than 12 months. Controls without cancer
        but similar in age, sex, and body mass index will be recruited.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 35-80 years

          -  Diagnosis of metastatic cancer with cachexia (≥5% drop in body mass in less than 12
             months), metastatic cancer without cachexia (&lt;5% drop in body mass in 12 months) or no
             history of cancer but similar in age and sex as other groups.

          -  Contraindications to MRI (e.g., pacemaker, ferrous materials within body).

          -  Active coronary artery disease or history of unstable macrovascular disease (unstable
             angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization of coronary, peripheral
             or carotid artery within 3 months of recruitment)

          -  Renal insufficiency/failure (serum creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dl)

          -  Oral warfarin group medications or history of blood clotting disorders.

          -  People who have taken Bevacizumab

          -  Debilitating chronic disease (at the discretion of the investigators)

          -  Previous injury/trauma/surgery to the region being measured without full recovery

          -  Pain in the area to be assessed

          -  Any medical condition affecting the ability to execute a maximal muscle contraction

          -  The presence of infections, highly communicable diseases (AIDS, active tuberculosis,
             veneral disease, hepatitis) or metastatic bone disease that may interfere with safely
             executing maximal effort.

          -  Significant neurological or musculoskeletal disorders or disease that may interfere
             with safely executing maximal contraction

          -  Any congenital, developmental, or other bone disease or previous surgeries that may
             interfere with successful testing
