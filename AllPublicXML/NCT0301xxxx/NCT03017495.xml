  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this phase 1 trial are to evaluate the effect of food on the
      pharmacokinetics (i.e. how long and how much a compound is present in the blood) of
      ACT-541468 and to evaluate whether ACT-541468 can affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a
      CYP3A4 substrate.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Food effect will be assessed by comparing the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of a single
      dose of ACT-541468 under fasted (Treatment B) and fed (Treatment C) conditions.

      Potential CYP3A4 inhibiting / inducing effects of ACT-541468 will be assessed by comparing
      the PK parameters of midazolam alone (Treatment A) and midazolam given with a single dose of
      ACT-541468 (Treatment B) or with multiple doses of ACT-541468 (Treatment D).
