  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to answer specific questions about new ways to provide
      services for youth at-risk of suicide.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project will be able to provide services to high-risk youth in Ohio. This
      randomized controlled trial for youth discharged from inpatient psychiatric hospital will be
      able to determine what combination of services is best suited to reduce subsequent suicide
      attempts and re-hospitalization.

      All youth (ages 10-18), that fit the inclusion criteria, will be recruited from the inpatient
      unit at Fairview Youth Inpatient Unit. Patients will be consented, enrolled, and assigned to
      group by the Research Coordinator working at the unit. The Methodologist/ Statistician will
      generate a random allocation sequence using random number generator and communicate group
      assignment to the Research Coordinator. There will not be any restriction on randomization.
      The PI will be blinded to all group assignments.

      The clinical research tools and screens that will be administered in this study include:
      Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), The Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ),
      The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), Ohio Scales, Children's Global Assessment Scale
      (CGAS), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI-I).

      The participants of the study will be seen by the child psychiatrist (Dr. Varkula) and the
      research coordinator at the initial appointment, and a 6 month follow-up (Dr. Falcone). The
      C-SSRS and the SIQ will be administered at the initial appointment and the follow-up
      appointment. The study's research coordinator will be regulating the 3 month phone call and
      scheduling the 6 month up visit and administering the Ohio Scales questionnaire with the
      parents and/ or guardians of the child. There will also be a 12 month follow-up phone call
      conducted by the research coordinator. During this time, the information for the C-SSRS
      questionnaire, the SIQ, the Ohio Scales (for both the parent and the child), the CGI-I, and
      the CGAS will be administered.

    <description>The patient will be referred for regular (Standard of Care) outpatient psychiatry/ psychology services or continue with the services that they were receiving prior to admission. They will be followed up by calling patient families at 3 months (post their initial appointment) and at 12 months. They will also have 1 research visit at 6 months (with Dr. Falcone), which they will schedule during their 3 month follow-up call; the Suicide Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ) will be administered. The patients assigned to this group will also be receiving 10 caring follow-up post cards at the following weeks and months (post-discharge from the inpatient unit): 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, 5 months, 7 months, 9 months, 12 months, and on the patient's birthday.</description>

    <description>Frontline Services will be administering (at least 9) crisis intervention phone calls to the patients; more calls will be made if they feel it is necessary for the safety and health of the patient. Follow up calls will ask the patient questions about following up in the future, whether they have had thoughts about suicide, whether they are in imminent danger of suicide by the end of the call, and whether the patient is stable. At the end of the call, the patient will be asked to rate their suicidality on a scale of 1 to 10.</description>
