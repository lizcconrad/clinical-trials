      The study population is comprise of 90 women those age varies between 18-38 year-old. The
      first group will comprise of 30 women with polycystic ovaries or anovulatory cycles, the
      second group will comprise of 30 women with diagnosis of unexplained infertility and the
      third group will comprise of 30 women those partners with male subfertility. A 2 cc blood
      sample for Kisspeptin analysis will be drawn from the antecubital vein from each
      participants. The patients will receive 50 mg clomiphene citrate at the fifth day of the
      menstrual period and follicular development will be measured with serial ultrasound follow
      up.

      The study population is comprise of 90 women those age varies between 18-38 year-old with
      wish of baby for at least one year despite of unprotected sexual intercourse, patent tubes
      confirmed in hysterosalpingography , follicle stimulating hormone levels &lt;12 IU. The first
      group will comprise of 30 women with polycystic ovaries in ultrasound examination or
      anovulatory cycles, the second group will comprise of 30 women with diagnosis of unexplained
      infertility, normal menstrual periods and without known male factor infertility and the third
      group will comprise of 30 women those partners with sperm count between 5x106 -15x106 /mL,
      type A + type B motility &lt;%32 and Kruger morphology &lt;4%. A 2 cc blood sample for Kisspeptin
      analysis will be drawn from the antecubital vein from each participants and centrifuged and
      sera will be kept in -80 C till recruitment has been completed. Kisspeptin, E2, Progesterone,
      anti-mullerian hormone levels will be measured with ELISA method. The patients will receive
      50 mg clomiphene citrate at the fifth day of the menstrual period and follicular development
      will be measured with serial ultrasound follow up.
