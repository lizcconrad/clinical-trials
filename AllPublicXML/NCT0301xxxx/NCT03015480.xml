      This pilot study tests the feasibility of remotely delivered medical nutrition therapy (MNT),
      focused on increasing fruit/vegetable intake, and decreasing sodium and red/processed meat
      intake, in the treatment of patients with stage 1-3a chronic kidney disease (CKD) and
      diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with diabetes and stage 1-3a CKD receive instructions on downloading and using
      MyFitnessPal on their smartphone or computer to log meal data daily, weekly website
      educational materials, and weekly telephone visits with a dietician for 8 weeks. Patients
      receive a follow-up phone call from the dietitian and 5 and 11 months for further support and
      counseling, and are also invited to attend a local dietitian-led grocery tour. This pilot
      study examines the feasibility of remotely delivering MNT using MyFitnessPal in patients with
      diabetes and stage 1-3a CKD. Main outcomes include sodium intake assessed by 24 hour urine
      collection as well as other dietary measures related to kidney disease (sodium/potassium
      ratio, Healthy Eating Index score, 24-hour urine phosphorus, estimated net endogenous acid
      production) and health measures (24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, weight,
      albumin/creatinine ratio)
