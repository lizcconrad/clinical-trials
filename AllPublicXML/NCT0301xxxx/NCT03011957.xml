      MATCH is an observation study of HIV-infected adults on effective antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) and demographically matched uninfected adults to evaluate muscle and aging.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MATCH is a non-randomized observational longitudinal study. We will recruit HIV infected
      adults (50 to 65 years old) and demographically matched uninfected control subjects to be
      followed for 4 years over the course of a 5 year study. The targeted age range of 50-65 is
      chosen to evaluate aging HIV infected individuals at risk for early frailty in the United
      States. All subjects will undergo blood draws and physical function assessment, and a subset
      will undergo a CT scan of muscle and will have a muscle biopsy taken.

      A substudy will be performed on a subgroup of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men from the
      main cohort to measure daily physical activity by using an activity tracker.

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Inflammation at baseline and yearly for 3 years will be assessed by measuring circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., CRP, IL6) and soluble monocyte/macrophage biomarkers (e.g., sCD14, sC163). These multiple measurements will be aggregated to arrive at one composite inflammatory score. Outcome will be assessed in association with HIV status and physical function.</description>
