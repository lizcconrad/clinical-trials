  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access protocol/compassionate use single institution study designed to
      determine the palliative benefit and toxicity of 131I-MIBG in patients with progressive
      neuroblastoma and metastatic pheochromocytoma who are not eligible for therapies of higher
      priority. Response rate, toxicity, and time to progression and death will be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis: Relapsed/Refractory neuroblastoma, with an original diagnosis made
             histologically or from elevated urine catecholamines with abnormal tumor cells in bone
             marrow OR relapsed/refractory pheochromocytoma.

          -  Disease status: Progressive disease at any time (defined as any new lesion or an
             increase in size by &gt;25% of pre-existing disease), or a failure to respond to standard
             therapy. Patients must have evidence of MIBG uptake into tumor at ≥ one site within 6
             weeks prior to entry on study and subsequent to any intervening therapy

          -  Prior therapy: A minimum of two weeks since should have elapsed since any chemotherapy
             causing myelosuppression. It must be a minimum of three months since receiving
             radiation to any of the following fields: craniospinal, total abdominal, whole lung,
             total body irradiation. For any other sites of radiation, at least 2 weeks should have
             elapsed. For patients who received radiation to the only site of MIBG-avid disease
             within two months of study entry, biopsy confirmation of residual active disease is
             required, with positive bone marrow being sufficient. At least 7 days should have
             elapsed since completion of therapy with a biologic agent and at least 3 half-lives
             should have elapsed since therapy with a monoclonal antibody. No cytokine therapy may
             be given within 24 hours of receiving 131I-MIBG. Patients may have received prior MIBG
             therapy, provided they demonstrated a response or stable disease initially, with
             progressive disease occurring at least 35 days following treatment.

          -  Organ function: ANC &gt;500/uL, platelets &gt;20,000/uL with transfusion allowed. Bilirubin
             ≤2x ULN, AST/ALT ≤10x ULN.Serum Creatinine ≤2x ULN OR 24-hour creatinine clearance OR
             GFR ≥60ml/min/1.73m2. Normal lung function demonstrated by no dyspnea, exercise
             intolerance or oxygen requirement. Oxygen saturation ≥94% on room air. No clinically
             significant cardiac dysfunction and ejection fraction ≥45% on echocardiogram.

          -  Stem cells: Patients must have a minimum of 2.0 x106/kg viable CD34+ peripheral blood
             stem cells for re-infusion following 131I-MIBG. An additional back-up of 2.0x106/kg
             CD34+ cells is recommended but not required.

          -  Life expectancy longer than 8 weeks,Karnofsky or Lansky performance status of ≥ 50%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating patients

          -  Disease of any organ system that would compromise the patient's ability to participate
             in the study, including hemodialysis. Significant organ impairment should be discussed
             with the Principal Investigator prior to study entry

          -  Patients with active grade 3-4 infection, as defined by the NCI CTCAE V4.0.

          -  Patients with known MBIG-avid brain parenchymal disease (leptomeningeal or skull based
             metastases are eligible).

          -  In patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma, a urinalysis must be preformed prior to
             study enrollment. If proteinuria is present, a 24 hour urine must be collected and
             total protein determined. If the 24-hour urine protein is above the institutional
             upper limit of normal, the patient is excluded.
