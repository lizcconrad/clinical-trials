  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No medication existed for BQ dependence. No clinical trials existed for the drug therapy.
      Previous study showed that BQ possessed the antidepressant effect via pathway of monoamine
      oxidase A (MAO-A). An animal model also found that the arecoline from BQ has a property as
      MAO-A inhibitor. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that inhibition of the MAO-A or
      antidepressants might reduce the BQ addiction severity.

      The investigators will conduct the randomization and double blinded with placebo controlled
      study with 90 participants with BQ dependence from the Family Medicine and ear, nose, and
      throat (ENT) outpatient department (OPD). All participants shall agree the informed consent.
      The range of age is from 18 to 65 years old. The participants are diagnosed as BQ use
      disorder without other psychiatry co-morbidity, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual (DSM)-V criteria. Those who have severe physical illness, psychiatric illness, and
      other substance use disorder except cigarettes are excluded. All participants receive the
      semi-structure interview by DSM-V, International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10, and
      Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview by the psychiatrist. Before the intervention,
      the participants will finish their basic data, daily amount of cigarettes, betel nut, medical
      history and psycho-social rating scales. Next, in addition to counseling, the investigators
      will continue or modify the optimal antidepressants based on the previous results.

      The investigators will evaluate their BQ use condition as what has been measured in the
      natural observation study of the first year. The investigators will check the outcome
      measurement by visual analog scale, betel quid withdrawal severity scale, Yale-Brown
      Obsessive-Compulsive (Y-BOCS) - betel quid (BQ) scale. The investigators also followed their
      hamilton depression scale; Beck depression index; and Beck anxiety index in the baseline,
      2nd, 4th, 6th , and 8th week. The investigators also obtained the participants' gene type if
      the participants also agree for the prediction of oral cancers.

      We'll conduct the betel-quid (BQ) dependence clinical trial since 2016. Eligible cases will
      be enrolled for the following 8 week double-blinded placebo controlled trial. The groups will
      be divided into three groups. Outcome measures include BQ use condition, addiction severity
      rating scale, emotional rating scale including Beck Anxiety Index (BAI), Beck Depression
      Index (BDI), Hamilton Depression Scales (HAMDs), and urine BQ metabolites.
