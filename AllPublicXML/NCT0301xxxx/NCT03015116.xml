    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Plantar fasciitis, a degenerative injury of the connective tissue in the foot,
      results in pain-related disability in Service Members and beneficiaries and contributes to
      decreased physical activity and excessive healthcare costs. Even if effective, current
      treatment protocols may require 6-12 months of therapy to return individuals to pain-free
      activity. Photobiomodulation (PBM), or low level laser therapy, uses non-ionizing light to
      elicit biological changes in tissues resulting in beneficial therapeutic outcomes. Evidence
      supports use of PBM for other degenerative connective tissue conditions, such as Achilles
      tendinopathy and epicondylitis. Unfortunately, previous studies of PBM for treatment of
      plantar fasciitis lack optimized treatment parameters and therefore have been inconclusive on
      its clinical effectiveness.

      SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. Establish feasibility of and adherence to a photobiomodulation protocol in
      conjunction with and compared to usual care for plantar fasciitis treatment. 2. Assess the
      clinical effectiveness of photobiomodulation in conjunction with and compared to usual care
      to improve function and decrease pain and in patients. 3. Assess the difference between two
      photobiomodulation dose parameters in conjunction with and compared to usual care for plantar
      fasciitis treatment.

      DESIGN: The investigators will use a prospective randomized controlled trial to meet the aims
      of this exploratory study. METHOD: A sample of 114 military healthcare beneficiaries will be
      randomly assigned to either usual care, usual care plus PBM lower dose, or usual care plus
      PBM higher dose groups. At baseline, during the treatment protocol, and at long term (3 and 6
      month) follow-up, measures of foot function and pain will be collected for analysis. The
      proposed methods will allow the study team to establish if PBM accelerates recovery compared
      to usual care, as well as determining the optimal dose for future trials comparing PBM to
      other, more invasive, therapies for plantar fasciitis.

    <description>The FAAM is a 29-item self-report instrument that assesses physical function in foot and ankle impairments which included plantar fasciitis cases in development. There are two subscales, Activities of Daily Living (21-item) and Sports (8-item). Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale (4='no difficulty at all' to 0='unable to do'); points are transformed to a percentage (100%=no dysfunction). Test-retest 0.89 &amp; 0.87 for Activities of Daily Living &amp; Sports subscale; internal consistency α=.98, minimum clinically important difference 8 &amp; 9 points for ADL &amp; Sports subscale, respectively.</description>
