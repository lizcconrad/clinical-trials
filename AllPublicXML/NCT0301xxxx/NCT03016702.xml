  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether two new cognitive &quot;stress tests&quot; may help
      distinguish between people at lower or higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's Disease. The
      investigators are trying to understand how these cognitive &quot;stress tests&quot; work in people who
      have not been diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and are not exhibiting symptoms of
      Alzheimer's Disease. Study subjects will undergo testing of memory and executive function
      during functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) of the brain and also during a walking
      test.

      The objective is to establish the feasibility and evaluate the role of two novel tests of
      cognitive resilience for use in identification of early Alzheimer's Disease. The
      investigators hypothesize that exposure to the controlled stressor of increased cognitive
      task demand will evoke measurable phenotypes of poor resilience, which will be associated
      with Alzheimer's Disease risk. The study will include 30 volunteer participants from the Duke
      Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Registry (ADPR). The ADPR cohort has been characterized
      according to genetic risk based on genotype at loci associated with Alzheimer's Disease. The
      investigators will recruit a sample from the ADPR that includes 15 people in the &quot;genetic
      high risk&quot; group and 15 people, matched by age, in the &quot;genetic low risk&quot; group.
      Investigators and experimenters are masked to the genetic profile of all participants. All
      participants will undergo two cognitive stress test protocols. Both protocols include memory
      and executive function components, one done during functional MRI and one while ambulating on
      a force sensor mat. Both cognitive stress tests are minimal risk; the primary risk of this
      study is loss of confidentiality. Genetic testing is not performed as part of this protocol;
      the sampling strategy will make use of prior genetic testing results, which are not revealed
      to the primary investigators. In addition to determining whether scores on the two novel
      tests statistically differ by AD risk groups, the project will establish the tests'
      feasibility and characteristics for use in future study.

    <description>This group includes subjects with APOEe4 homozygotes, the genetic profile associated with the highest risk for late-onset AD and the next highest-risk group, APOE e3/e4 heterozygotes. To target the highest risk among the APOEe3/e4 heterozygotes in ADPR, the study team will consider TOMM40-'523 variant status. Although there is uncertainty about the independent role of TOMM40 in AD risk-stratification (especially across racial/ethnic groups), this study will use TOMM40-'523 to guide heterozygote selection based on findings that among e3/e4 heterozygotes, longer TOMM40-523 polyT sequences are associated with earlier age of onset for late-onset AD.</description>
