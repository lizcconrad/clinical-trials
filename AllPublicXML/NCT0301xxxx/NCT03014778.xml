      This study is necessary in order to provide proof the effectiveness of Chlorhexidine
      gluconate and its safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known from the literature that the use of Povidone-iodone based solution for
      vaginal preparation before surgery is fraught with side effects and sensitivity, and often
      does not provide sufficient eradication of colonies of pathogens from the operation field.

      It is also known that Chlorhexidine gluconate in low concentration provides a better result
      and does not cause side effects more than Povidone-iodone, but the chlorhexidine is still not
      approved for washing the mucous membranes. This study is necessary in order to provide proof
      of its effectiveness and safety.
