      This active surveillance will include all NSCLC patients treated with nintedanib per the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria at approximately 20 selected centers until it is confirmed that
      100 patients treated with nintedanib are included and that baseline characteristics of 100
      additional patients (or as many patients as in the nintedanib group if &lt;100) planned to be
      treated with single agent docetaxel are collected from the same centres during the same time
      frame, or until a maximum of two years, whichever occurs first
