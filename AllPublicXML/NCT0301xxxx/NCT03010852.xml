  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative (PO) hypoventilation, atelectasis and hypoxemia after bariatric surgery are
      common and multifactorial, contributing to prolonged oxygen (O2) therapy after surgery and
      even at hospital discharge. Incentive spirometry (IS) is recommended postoperatively but its
      success in preventing postoperative atelectasis and hypoxemia (POH) heavily depends on
      patient compliance with IS effort and frequency. The investigators hypothesize that a focused
      education preoperatively on IS for POH and intensive monitoring of patient compliance with IS
      therapy in the early postoperative period shortens postoperative oxygen therapy, decreases
      POH episodes, and improves respiratory outcomes after bariatric surgery, compared to patients
      receiving standard of care.

    <description>One of the study investigators will meet eligible patients in the preoperative visit to the UCH Weight Loss Surgery clinic, inform and consent the patient and introduce the first education on IS therapy, highlighting its possible benefits and the importance of compliance (patient's inspiratory effort and frequency). This IS education will be repeated in the preoperative area immediately before surgery. The site will then follow the patient postoperatively. The site will directly check on the patient in the PACU and later in his/her hospital room at least 3 times a day during the first 3 days or sooner if their O2 therapy is discontinued for 2h. During these PO check ups The site will reinforce the IS use, monitor the patient's performance of IS and ask him/her about other respiratory symptoms.</description>
