    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects of nivolumab and to see how well it works when
      given together with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide in treating patients with Hodgkin
      lymphoma that has come back and does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide may
      work better in treating patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the anti-tumor activity of nivolumab as single agent and in combination with
      ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide (ICE) chemotherapy (nivolumab [N]ICE) as assessed by
      complete response (CR) rate prior to autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of nivolumab +/- ICE chemotherapy through evaluation of
      toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      II. Obtain estimates of overall response rate (ORR), response duration and survival (overall
      and event-free).

      III. Summarize stem cell mobilization outcomes (e.g., total CD34(cluster of differentiation
      34)+ cell yield, number of apheresis days, proportion of patients who achieve &gt;= 2 x 10^6
      CD34+ cells/kg).

      IV. Evaluate Hodgkin lymphoma biological markers in subjects treated with nivolumab.

      V. Among subjects who undergo autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT), estimate
      the post-AHCT overall/progression free survival (PFS) probability and cumulative incidence of
      relapse/progression, non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100-days, 1-year and 2-years.

      VI. Among subjects who undergo autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT),
      characterize post-AHCT toxicities during the first 30- and 100- days post stem cell infusion
      by type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course and duration.

      VII. Among subjects who undergo autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT),
      evaluate short and long-term post-AHCT complications, including: delayed engraftment
      (neutrophil and platelet) and infection, graft versus host disease and sinusoidal obstruction
      syndrome.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Collect deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) from lymphoma specimens and
      serial plasma samples for future biomarker evaluation.

      II. Evaluate potential changes in Hodgkin lymphoma biological markers of patients treated
      with nivolumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every
      14 days for 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with CR or partial response (PR) receive nivolumab for an additional 6 weeks. Patients with
      only stable disease (SD) after 6-week nivolumab treatment receive nivolumab for an additional
      6 weeks or receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, etoposide IV on days 1-3,
      ifosfamide IV continuously over 24 hours on day 2, and carboplatin IV on day 2 every 21 days
      for 6 weeks per physician/investigator's discretion. Patients with progressive disease (PD)
      after 6-week nivolumab treatment or patients with PR, SD, or PD after 12-week nivolumab
      treatment receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1, etoposide IV on days 1-3, ifosfamide
      IV continuously over 24 hours on day 2, and carboplatin IV on day 2. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

             the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after curative therapy

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease or history of brain
             metastases are excluded from study

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued

          -  Recent infection requiring systemic treatment that was completed =&lt; 14 days before the
             first dose of study drug

          -  Active with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), subjects who are
             positive for hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis B surface antigen must have a
             negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result before enrollment, those who are PCR
             positive will be excluded; subjects who have an undetectable human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) viral load with CD (cluster of differentiation)4 &gt;= 300 and are on highly
             active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) medication are allowed; previously treated
             hepatitis C patients are also allowed; as there is potential for hepatic toxicity with
             nivolumab or nivolumab/ipilimumab combinations, drugs with a predisposition to
             hepatoxicity should be used with caution in patients treated with nivolumab-containing
             regimen
