      This study compares patients with post traumatic elbow stiffness and evaluate the range of
      motion improvement with two types of treatment: surgical release versus non-surgical
      rehabilitation protocol with orthoses.

      The study of the treatment of post-traumatic stiffness of the elbow presents numerous
      challenges. Due to the great variability of the types of lesions, causes and symptomatology,
      there are great difficulties in the homogenization of protocols and in the comparison of
      results between the different treatments. Patients with different levels of severity and time
      of stiffness, presence of arthrosis or not, and significant symptoms such as pain.

      For patients with elbow stiffness without vicious consolidation, pseudoarthrosis,
      intra-articular synthesis material or heterotopic ossification, and who have already failed
      conventional therapy, basically have two treatment options. Which will be the subject of this
      study: surgical release or non-surgical rehabilitation protocols with orthoses.

      In meta-analysis, evaluating the elbow range of motion gain with rehabilitation protocols
      associated with orthoses, the mean gain varies from 20º to 40º, depending on the type of
      orthosis used. On the other hand a systematic review evaluated movement gain with different
      surgical techniques. Observed a mean gain of 51º for open releases, but with higher
      complication rates. However, there are no comparative studies in the literature comparing
      this 2 types of treatment for post traumatic elbow stiffness: surgical release and
      non-surgical rehabilitation protocol with orthoses in patients who have already performed
      conventional physiotherapy with no success.
