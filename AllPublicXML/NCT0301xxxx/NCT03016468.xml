    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm trial to evaluate the safety of the transition from
      Selexipag to Remodulin® then Oral Treprostinil in Symptomatic Subjects with Pulmonary
      Arterial Hypertension (PAH). The study will include about 30 subjects at approximately 10
      clinical trial centers. The treatment phase of the study will last approximately 16 weeks.

    <description>Remodulin will be provided in vial strengths of 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/mL. Subjects will be admitted to the hospital and IV Remodulin will be initiated within 12 hours after the last dose of selexipag. Subjects will remain under observation in the inpatient setting for at least the first 72 hours of Remodulin administration. Subjects will be transitioned to an equivalent dose of SC Remodulin at discharge.</description>

             with connective tissue disease, PAH associated with HIV infection, PAH associated with
             repaired congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt (at least 1 year since repair with
             respect to the date of providing informed consent), or PAH associated with appetite
             suppressant or toxin use.

          2. The subject must be classified as WHO FC II or III at Baseline.

          3. The subject is receiving selexipag for the treatment of WHO Group 1 PAH for a minimum
             of 90 days from Baseline.

          4. Subject is in need of escalation of therapy, as determined by the Investigator.

          5. Subject must be receiving a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved PDE5-I or sGC
             stimulator and/or an ERA and has been at the current stable dose for at least 28 days
             prior to Baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is receiving selexipag for any other disease or condition other than the
             treatment of WHO Group 1 PAH.

          2. The subject has a Baseline 6MWD of less than 150 meters.

          3. The subject's Baseline 6MWD has decreased more than 40% from the pre-selexipag
             baseline.

          4. The subject has a history of ischemic heart disease (defined as either symptomatic or
             requiring anti-anginal therapy or experienced a documented myocardial infarction
             within the previous 6 months of Baseline), or a history of left sided myocardial
             dysfunction as evidenced by a PAWP greater than 15 mmHg or a left ventricular ejection
             fraction less than 40%.

          5. The subject has previously been treated with any parenteral prostacyclin or oral
             treprostinil for a period of 90 days or more.

          6. The subject has a history of 1 or more of the following signs of relevant lung disease
             within 180 days before Baseline:

               1. Total lung capacity less than 60% of predicted normal.

               2. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second is less than 55% of predicted normal.
