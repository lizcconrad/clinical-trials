      A prospective, multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled, blinded study combining active
      Nexstim NBS-guided 1Hz rTMS or sham-rTMS targeting the healthy hemisphere with standardized
      task oriented rehabilitation will be conducted in patients with post-stroke motor impairment
      of the upper limb. The therapy will be provided for 6 weeks and primary outcome assessed 6
      months later.
