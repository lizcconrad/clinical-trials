      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of high-grade (i.e. Grade
      3-4 and Grade 5 of CTCAE v4.0) adverse reactions of interest in patients with metastatic RCC
      who have progressed during or after receiving at least one prior systemic anti-angiogenic
      treatment and who are eligible for nivolumab monotherapy.

      The present study will be carried out in patients suffering from refractory metastatic Renal
      Cell Carcinoma. The overall study population consists of 450 adult patients.

      In France, 10600 patients were diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2010. At the time of their
      diagnosis, approximately 30% of patients present with metastatic disease, with 90 to 95% of
      that metastatic disease being of the clear-cell histology.

      The present study is a multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, phase II safety study in
      patients who are suffering from metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma and who have progressed
      during or after one prior systemic anti-angiogenic treatment. Patients intolerant to prior
      systemic anti-angiogenic treatment can also be eligible.

      The dose and schedule of nivolumab in this study will be 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Nivolumab
      will be administered every 2 weeks until death, disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or
      withdrawal of the informed consent. 450 patients should be included over a period of 1 year

         12. Known or underlying medical condition (e.g., a condition associated with diarrhea or
             acute diverticulitis) that, in the investigator's opinion, would make the
             administration of study drug hazardous to the patient or obscure the interpretation of
             toxicity determination or adverse events.

         13. History of uncontrolled seizures, central nervous system disorders or psychiatric
             disability judged by the investigator to be clinically significant, precluding
             informed consent, or interfering with compliance of oral drug intake.

         14. Unwillingness to give written informed consent, unwillingness to participate, or
             inability to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.
