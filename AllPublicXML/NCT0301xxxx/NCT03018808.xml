  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment for COPD patients are both critical to minimize the
      progression of COPD and improve outcomes. Also, evidence suggests that high eosinophil
      (specific type of white blood cell that protects body against certain kinds of germs) level
      is associated with increased risk of both moderate and severe exacerbations in COPD patients.
      To date, there is insufficient amount of data that describes the prevalence of COPD in
      Brazilian primary care units. Thus, this multicenter, cross-sectional study conducted in five
      centers located in five different Brazilian cities will provide estimation about the
      prevalence of COPD in primary care and will also determine the levels of eosinophils in
      subjects with confirmed COPD diagnosis. Approximately 2,500 eligible subjects are expected to
      be enrolled in the study.
