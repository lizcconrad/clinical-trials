  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common clinical condition associate with a negative impact
      not limited to the patients but also to the partner that sleep in the same bed. Is it
      reasonable to speculate that the partner suffer sleep deprivation, increased level of
      irritability, insomnia, fatigue, among others due to the loud snoring caused by the OSA
      patient. Although previous data reported impaired sleep quality in partners of patients with
      OSA, it is not clear in literature whether OSA promotes cardiovascular impact and if the
      treatment of OSA promotes some cardiovascular benefits in (the) partner beyond the
      improvements in the subjective and objective sleep. Thus, the main objectives of this
      randomized controlled study are: to evaluate the impact of three months of randomization
      (treatment with nasal CPAP or nasal strips) on the endothelial function, blood pressure
      (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring), sleep duration (wrist actigraphy for 1 week) and
      sleep quality (Pittsburgh Questionnaire) and the frequency of OSA in the bed partners of
      patients with moderate to severe OSA and a recent diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS)
      according to the ATP III criteria derived from an ongoing randomized study conducted in our
      Institution.
