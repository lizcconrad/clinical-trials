    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of genetically modified T cells and decitabine in
      treating patients with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come
      back or has not responded to previous treatments. White blood cells called T cells are
      collected via a process called leukapheresis, genetically modified to recognize and attack
      tumor cells, then given back to the patient. Decitabine may induce and increase the amount of
      the target protein NY-ESO-1 available on the surface of tumor cells. Giving genetically
      modified T cells and decitabine may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the autologous NY-ESO-1 redirected T cell
      therapy in combination with decitabine and low-dose IL-2 in patients with treatment
      refractory or recurrent epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the persistence of genetically modified cells in the peripheral blood, and at
      tumor sites.

      II. To examine the effect of the treatment on tumor as measured by objective tumor response
      and progression free survival, both assessed by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).

      III. To assess the occurrence of target antigen and/or major histocompatibality complex (MHC)
      loss variants upon disease recurrence.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the post treatment phenotype and functionality of genetically modified T cells
      isolated from peripheral blood and from tumor sites.

      II. To assess changes in immunoscore, Tregs, Myeloid cell subsets, and antigen spreading in
      peripheral blood and tumor site.

      III. To assess the influence of demographic and disease molecular characteristics on
      treatment outcomes of complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE:

      COURSE 1: Patients receive decitabine IV daily over 1 hour on days 1-3, cyclophosphamide IV
      over 2 hours on days 5 and 6, and genetically engineered NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes IV
      and intraperitoneally (IP) on day 9. Patients also receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC)
      twice daily (BID) on days 10-23.

      COURSE 2: Patients receive decitabine IV daily over 1 hour on days 31-33, genetically
      engineered NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes IV and IP on day 37, and aldesleukin SC BID on
      days 38-51.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly at 3-9 months, every 6
      months for 4 years, and then annually for up to 15 years.
