    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an eating strategy in adults undergoing chemotherapy for non-small cell
      lung cancer. Subjects will be allocated to a randomized or observational arm based on
      baseline measurements. In the randomized arm, half of participants will add certain foods to
      what they normally eat, while the other half will continue to eat their habitual diet.
      Subjects in the observational arm will continue to eat their habitual diet.
