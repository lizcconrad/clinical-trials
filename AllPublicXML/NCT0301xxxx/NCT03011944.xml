    <textblock>
      A nutrition-focused QIP will be implemented as standard of care at select branches of the
      home health division of the health care system. The QIP will be comprised of three groups of
      patients, Group 1 will consist of hospitalized, at-risk/malnourished patients being
      discharged to home health, Group 2 will consist of outpatients at-risk/malnourished patients
      enrolled in home health and Group 3 will consist of SNF, at-risk/malnourished patients being
      discharged to home health. Groups will be followed for 90 days post enrollment. The QIP
      groups will be compared to historical controls, concurrent controls, and matched concurrent
      controls across other sites within the health system.
