  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective study aims to assess, on a large number of clinical trials (CT), the
      usefulness of converting CT eligibility criteria into standardized queries performed on
      commonly available data, i.e. Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) databases in order to estimate
      the potential recruitment of clinical trials centers.

      Efficacy of this Clinical Trial Recruitment Support Systems (CTRSS) will be checked against
      thorough examination of patient files.

      Primary objective is to estimate the precision of the prediction system, i.e. ratio of
      numbers of eligible patient files / numbers of candidate patient files.

      As secondary objectives, the study aims:

        -  to measure the recall rate or sensitivity of the system: ratio of number of candidates
           patient files / number of recruited patients;

        -  to measure the ability of coding: proportion of codable criteria (inclusion criteria or
           non inclusion criteria) into normalized language;

        -  to measure the time required for coding criteria and the time required to execute the
           queries on the national DRG database;

        -  to evaluate the reliability of coding process by an independent coding of a random
           sample of 30 protocols;

        -  to analyse influence of characteristics of the clinical study (design, disease, ...) and
           of the investigation site (volume, teaching status, ...) on the precision and
           sensitivity of the prediction system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed on a large sample (near 100) of multicenter terminated clinical
      studies with public funding covering therapeutic, diagnostic or prognostic studies. Selection
      (inclusion, non inclusion) criteria of each CT will be translated into a normalized
      description using ICD10 and french nomenclature of medical or surgical procedures (CCAM,
      Classification Commune des Actes Médicaux), these very nomenclatures being used in the french
      DRG system. Then a dedicated program will query the French DRG national database called PMSI
      (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information).

      For each CT and for each center, the query will select &quot;candidate&quot; patients whose eligibility
      will be checked by thorough examination of the whole patient file by dedicated data
      extractors. In addition, already recruited patients will be compared to the prediction of the
      system.

      Collected data span the period between 2010 and 2014, as well as with the medical files.
