  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A poor therapeutic observance is described between 3 and 76% cases in systemic lupus. It is
      associated with an increased risk of relapses, hospitalizations, morbidity and poor renal
      prognosis.

      New treatment protocols exist and are indicated in second intention in case of good
      compliance. An assessment of therapeutic adherence is therefore essential.

      Patients with systemic lupus diagnosed for at least 6 months, or skin lupus, who have been
      prescribed with Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine), will be included in the study.

      The study primary objective is to determine risk factors for non-observance

      The secondary objectives are to:

        -  Measure the observance rate of patients with systemic lupus in Martinique.

        -  Describe the parameters that influence observance: evaluation of the disease and
           associated comorbidities, psychosocial assessment, assessment of the doctor-patient
           relationship, evaluation of the disease representations.
