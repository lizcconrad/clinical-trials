    <textblock>
      Sources of Strength is an evidence based program for youth suicide that trains student key
      leaders to strengthen social connectedness and healthy norms school-wide and is listed on the
      National Registry of Evidence Based Programs and Practices (NREPP). This project will expand
      the existing evidence base by evaluating Sources of Strength for sexual violence outcomes in
      a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in twenty-four high schools.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present few programs systematically address broader social-ecological factors such as
      school-wide norms and youth-adult connectedness that research identifies as major drivers of
      sexual violence. To address this gap, this application proposes a large-scale RCT evaluation
      of Sources of Strength to evaluate for sexual violence perpetration outcomes. Sources of
      Strength is an evidence based program for youth suicide that trains student key leaders to
      strengthen social connectedness and healthy norms school-wide and is listed on the National
      Registry of Evidence Based Programs and Practices (NREPP). This project will expand the
      existing evidence base by evaluating Sources of Strength for sexual violence outcomes, which
      has never been done before. Twenty-four high schools will be recruited and stratified (rural
      or urban) and randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) immediate Sources of Strength
      intervention, (b) wait-list for Sources of Strength Implementation after 16 months.
