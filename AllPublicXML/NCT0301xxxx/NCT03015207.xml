          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 and 34.9 kg/m^2 (both inclusive). Overweight should
             be due to excess adipose tissue, as judged by the investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any concomitant illness or disorder, which in the investigator's opinion might
             jeopardise the subject's safety or compliance with the protocol

          -  Subjects aged above or equal to 40 years with an estimated 10-year atherosclerotic
             cardiovascular disease (ASCVD according to ACC/AHA (American College of Cardiology
             /American Heart Association) guideline) risk above or equal to 5%

          -  Male subjects who are not sexually abstinent or surgically sterilised (vasectomy) and
             are sexually active with female partner(s) and who are not using a highly effective
             method of contraception (such as condom with spermicide) combined with a highly
             effective method of contraception for their non-pregnant female partner(s) (Pearl
             Index below 1%, such as implants, injectables, oral contraceptives, intrauterine
             devices, diaphragm or cervical cap+spermicide), and/or intend to donate sperm in the
             period from screening (visit 1) until 3 months following administration of the
             investigational medical product

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription medicinal products including herbal products
             and non-routine vitamins, within 2 weeks prior to screening, with the exception of
