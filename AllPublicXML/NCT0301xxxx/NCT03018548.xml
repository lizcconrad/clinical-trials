      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes significant morbidity and mortality, accompanied by high
      related costs. Recent hypotheses concerning the pathophysiology of TBI invoke Strain Shear
      Theory and Cavitation Theory. We propose to test the importance of the latter by directing
      blast waves into containers that are either partially or completely filled with blood and
      measuring markers of lysis.

      These experiments are designed to better understand the demonstrated effectiveness of mild
      jugular compression according to the principle of the Queckenstedt Maneuver to reduce the
      likelihood of TBI by filling up the compliance of the cranial space. A device (C-Collar) is
      being developed by Q30 Labs, LLC (Q30), to accomplish this effect.
