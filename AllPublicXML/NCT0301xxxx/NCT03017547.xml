  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients will be randomized to receive either IC14
      (a single dose of 4 mg/kg followed by 2 mg/kg on Days 2-4) or placebo. Study participation
      will be for a total of 28 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 160 patients with ARDS will be randomized to receive either IC14 at a dosage of 4 mg/kg
      on Study Day 1, then 2 mg/kg once daily on Study Days 2-4 or placebo for 4 days beginning
      within 48 hours of meeting inclusion criteria. Study participation will be for 28 days.
