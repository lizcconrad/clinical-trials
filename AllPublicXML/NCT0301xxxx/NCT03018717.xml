    <textblock>
      Information and communications technologies (ICT) currently constitute a key element in the
      innovation and improvement of providing health-care to frail populations with advanced
      chronic diseases, but it´s efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness has not yet been proven
      conclusively. The investigators are going to carry out a multi-center, randomized, parallel
      groups, phase III clinical trial in adult patient with heart and/or lung advanced
      diseases,aiming to analyze the efficacy and cost-efficacy of tele-monitorization of
      bio-parameters added to optimal standard of clinical care (shared clinical care plan)
      compared to the shared clinical care plan exclusively.

      a total number of 510 patients will be divided in 3 centers: Hospital University Virgen del
      Rocío; Hospital University Virgen Macarena and Public Hospital Comarcal of Serranía de Ronda.
      Patient will be randomized in Tele-monitoring Constant (TELEPAC) To analyze the efficacy and
      cost-efficacy of incorporating tele-monitoring of bio-parameters into the shared
      comprehensive clinical care plan or in Standard Clinical Care (PAC) based on a comprehensive
      clinical assistance shared between Primary Care and Hospital Care.
