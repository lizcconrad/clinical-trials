  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to pilot test a web-based, patient-centered educational program that
      encourages the patient to have an informed discussion about pain medication options with
      their emergency department (ED) provider.

      This multi-site, randomized trial will evaluate an m-health program designed to aid the
      patient in making an informed decision about their pain treatment. Patients reporting to the
      ED with an injury-related chief complaint who agree to participate are randomized to receive
      the intervention program, My Healthy Choices, or an attention-matched control. My Healthy
      Choices pairs tailored education with a patient decision aid to describe what opioid and
      non-opioid pain medications are, assess the patient's risk factors for opioid-related adverse
      effects, and produce a tailored report that patients are encouraged to share with their
      doctor. Data are collected through surveys at three time points during the ED encounter
      (baseline, immediately after the intervention, and just before discharge), and at a 6-week
      follow-up survey. The primary outcomes are whether the patient prefers an opioid pain
      reliever (OPR) and whether the patient takes an OPR. The investigators hope this program will
      facilitate patient-provider communication, as well as reduce the number of prescriptions
      written for OPRs and thus the number of patients exposed to prescription opioids and the
      associated risks of addiction and overdose.

    <description>My Healthy Choices explains what opioid pain medications are, assesses and explains the patient's risk factors related to taking opioids, assesses patient preferences about pain medications, and produces a tailored patient report based on the answers. The patient is encouraged to show the report to the treating ED clinician so they can discuss medication options for treating the patient's pain. Following discharge from the ED, intervention group participants discharged with a prescription pain reliever receive messages about safe medication use, storage, and disposal and access to an educational web portal that contains more information on prescription pain medications and safety.</description>
