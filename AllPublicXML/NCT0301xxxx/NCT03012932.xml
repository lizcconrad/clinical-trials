    <textblock>
      The proposed study will examine the implementation of a Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)
      self-sampling intervention for under screened LBQ women living in South Florida. The study
      will enroll participants to receive the self-sampling intervention in community venues. The
      purpose of this study is to pilot the self-sampler for feasibility and acceptability within
      this underserved population.

    <description>All participants will receive HPV self-sampling intervention. HPV self-sampling is a cervical cancer screening that can be done in private, using a device that is similar to a tampon. This intervention tests for high-risk HPV, the primary cause of cervical cancer. Each participant will complete the intervention one time only.</description>
