    <textblock>
      The program is to improve STEMI medical care quality in China. With the documents issued by
      National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People's Republic of China, the program
      was initialed in at least 200 primary PCI capable hospitals together with hundreds of
      adjacent non-primary PCI capable hospitals in 15 provinces. STEMI patients with symptom onset
      within 30 days will be enrolled in 3 periods. In each period with 6-month interval, 30
      patients will be enrolled consecutively from each PCI-capable center initially and from
      non-primary PCI capable hospitals later, thus at least 18,000 STEMI patients from primary PCI
      capable hospitals will be enrolled and all of them will be followed up for 1 year. Key
      performance indicators (KPIs) in STEMI care will be collected using both national PCI online
      registry and a program STEMI online registry database for the purpose of improvement of
      medical care. Hospital KPIs rank report and problem-based resolution will be feedback to each
      hospital after data analysis in each period. Comparison of every two cross-sectional data
      (self) and within one cross-sectional (inter-hospital) data will be used to evaluate the
      improvement of medical quality.
