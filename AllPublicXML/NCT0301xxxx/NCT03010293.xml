  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcer represents a frequent clinical condition in patient with spinal cord injury or
      after prolonged Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. Osteomyelitis constitutes a severe
      complication with a poorly known management, and is associated with a high rate of relapse,
      leading to a high-burden in hospital bed-days, financial cost, surgical intervention,
      antibiotic use, morbidity and mortality, and nursing care. In our reference center for bone
      and joint infection management, the medical and surgical strategies are systematically
      discussed during pluridisciplinary meetings. Most patients benefit from a two-stage surgical
      strategy (debridement with initiation of vacuum-assisted closure therapy until reconstruction
      using muscular flap) with prolonged antimicrobial therapy. In this context, our study aims to
      evaluate this complex approach and to determine risk factors of treatment failure in order to
      improve patient management, focusing on optimization of empirical antimicrobial therapy after
      each surgical stage, delay between the two surgical stage, and duration of antimicrobial
      therapy.
