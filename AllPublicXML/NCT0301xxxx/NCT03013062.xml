  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the pulmonary artery hypertension is defined based on MPAP and the two previous
      formulae relating MPAP and PAT were derived in western population, the investigator planned
      to conduct a prospective study to derive a new formula for measuring MPAP from PAT in Indian
      population and compare the accuracy of all the three formulae

      After obtaining ethics committee approval and informed patient consent, minimum 25 patients &gt;
      18 years of age who are undergoing cardiac surgery with the invasive monitoring of pulmonary
      artery pressure will be enrolled in this study.The demographics and the preoperative
      echocardiographic measurement will be noted. In the operating room, once the intravenous
      access is obtained, central venous catheterisation and pulmonary artery catheterisation will
      be done as per the institutional protocol. Once the Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is
      performed patient will be induced with opioids, intravenous or inhalational agents, and
      muscle relaxant according to the patient clinical and hemodynamic condition. Once the patient
      airway is secured with tracheal tube, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed
      before and after bypass, which is routine in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery in the
      institution. Echocardiographic images will be analysed by two separate echocardiographers to
      detect inter-individual variability. Patient blood pressure and heart rate will be maintained
      within 20% of their baseline value throughout surgery. Based on the patient condition at the
      end of surgery, extubation will be done in the operating room or in intensive care unit (ICU)
      after a period of elective ventilation.
