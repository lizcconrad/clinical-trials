      This phase II trial studies the side effects of autologous dendritic cells pulsed with tumor
      lysate antigen vaccine and nivolumab and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      glioblastoma that has come back. Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells may help the body
      build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving dendritic
      cell-autologous lung tumor vaccine and nivolumab may work better in treating patients with
      glioblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination treatment of autologous
      dendritic cells pulsed with tumor lysate antigen vaccine (DCVax-L) and nivolumab.

      II. To compare overall survival (OS) from the date of surgery in a pooled evaluation of group
      1 subjects receiving DCVax-L and group 2 subjects receiving DCVax-L and nivolumab to recent
      historical standards.

      III. To compare OS between the two groups.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety. II. Feasibility. III. Tumor response. IV. Immune response. V. Quality of Life
      (QoL). VI. Overall survival (OS). VII. Overall survival rate at 9, 12, and 18 months. VIII.
      Progression-free survival (PFS). IX. Evaluation of the safety of the DCVax-L + nivolumab
      combination regimen.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate correlation of quantitative assessments of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)
      proliferation (CD8+/Ki-67+ staining).

      II. Estimate difference in PD-1 and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression between density or
      clonality with clinical responses to combination therapy in recurrent glioblastoma subjects.

      III. Estimate differences between outcome groups in monocytic PD-L1 expression at baseline
      and over time.

      IV. Estimate differences between outcome groups in circulating tumor DNA, circulating tumor
      cells, and CD4+ T cells at baseline and over time.

      V. Estimate difference in PD-1 and PD-L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) expression between
      archived and study samples.

      VI. Explore patterns of tumor proteomic profiling. VII. Estimate efficacy of combination
      therapy by progression-free survival (PFS), rates of contrasted tumor change over time, and
      overall survival (OS).

      VIII. Explore effect of nivolumab on TIL proliferation (CD8+/Ki-67+ staining). IX. Explore
      whether oligoclonal T cell populations within tumor tissue are similarly expanded in
      peripheral blood after nivolumab, the magnitude of which correlates with clinical responses.

      X. Explore if changes in specific MRI parameters correlate with tumor and peripheral blood
      immune responses.

      XI. Explore if a mesenchymal gene expression signature present in the initial archived tumor
      sample correlates with T lymphocytic response in tumor after nivolumab.

      XII. Correlate changes of positron emission tomography (PET) in tumor with the following: TIL
      density or clonality, clinical outcome, T cell measures in peripheral blood, clinical
      toxicity.

      XIII. Correlate changes in PET in lymph nodes with the following: TIL density or clonality,
      clinical outcome, T cell measures in peripheral blood, clinical toxicity.

      XIV. Correlate changes in PET in organ tissue with TIL density or clonality.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive dendritic cell-autologous lung tumor vaccine intradermally (ID) on
      days 0, 7, 14, and weeks 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 20.

      GROUP II: Patients receive dendritic cell-autologous lung tumor vaccine as in Group I, and
      nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 0, 14, and weeks 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17,
      and 20.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 12 months.

             before the projected day 0

               -  It is critical to reduce steroid administration to the lowest possible dose, as
                  steroids interfere with DCVax-L manufacturing by hampering the ability of
                  monocytes to adhere to plastic surfaces during purification; leukapheresis should

          -  Acute infection: any active viral, bacterial, or fungal infection that requires
             specific therapy; antibiotic therapy must be completed at least 7 days prior to the
             first DCVax-L/nivolumab administration

          -  Fever &gt;= 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (F) (38.6 degrees Celsius [C]); if considered
             possibly transient, retesting is allowed

          -  Unstable or severe intercurrent medical conditions

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) who are pregnant or lactating or who are not
             using adequate contraception and willing to do so to avoid pregnancy for 5 months

          -  Males who are sexually active with WOCBP and not willing to use any contraceptive
             method with a failure rate of less than 1% per year for 7 months after the week 20
             visit

          -  Any dose of steroids exceeding 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) within 2 weeks
             prior to study drug administration
