      The goal of this prospective, non‐randomized, multicenter clinical trial is to determine
      whether robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty performed with TSolution One® System is safe
      and effective for use as an alternative to the conventional manual techniques. Clinical and
      radiographic outcomes for robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty performed with the
      TSolution One® System will be collected preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively
      up to a follow‐up period of 3 months. These outcomes will be compared to the ones reported in
      the literature for conventional manual techniques.

      This clinical investigation will be conducted as a prospective, non‐randomized, multicenter
      study. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the TSolution One® System
      is safe for use as an alternative to manual planning and sawing/cutting techniques based on
      the rate of intra-operative and postoperative TKA complications with a follow-up period of 3
      months, and to compare this rate to the rate reported in the literature. The secondary
      objective of this study is to demonstrate that the TSolution One® System is effective for use
      as an alternative to conventional manual techniques by comparing the rate of malalignment for
      mechanical axis greater than 3° to the rate reported in the literature (i.e. 32%); and to
      summarize the distribution of improvements in patients' self-reported assessment of
      postoperative function and quality-of-life from baseline to 3 months. Additionally, the
      preoperative planning alignment goals (i.e. Knee V‐V Alignment; Hip‐Knee Angle in Coronal
      Plane; Femoral Joint Line Alignment Angle; Tibial Joint Line Alignment Angle; Tibial Slope
      Angle) will be compared to the post‐operative alignment.

      Investigators will recruit subjects from patients in their practice who require unilateral
      total knee arthroplasty. Patients will be screened to identify eligible candidates based on
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of one hundred fifteen (115) patients will be
      enrolled in the study across the participating sites. All patients will sign an informed
      consent form prior to participating in the study.

      Prior to undergoing the investigational procedure, the patients will complete baseline
      surveys of function and quality of life (Knee Society Score survey and the SF‐12 Health
      Survey) and have baseline radiographs and a CT scan of the knee.

      Each patient will then undergo robotic‐assisted total knee arthroplasty with the TSolution
      One® System. The investigators will evaluate intra‐ and postoperative complications.
      Postoperative radiographs and a CT scan will be used to measure limb alignment using a
      standardized radiographic evaluation protocol. Each patient will complete a postoperative
      Knee Society Score survey and the SF‐12 Health Survey to assess functional outcomes and
      quality‐of‐life following the investigational procedure.
