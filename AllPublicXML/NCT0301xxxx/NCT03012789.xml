  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of different surgical resections (R0, R1,
      R2) on circulating NET transcripts (PCR score or NETest). A drop in circulating NET levels
      will be correlated with surgical excision. Secondly, variation of circulating NET transcripts
      will be correlated to NET recurrence to test whether this analysis may constitute an early
      predictive marker of disease relapse.

      Biomarker-based tools that can accurately predict gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor
      (GEP-NET) treatment response and tumor recurrence are currently not available. Circulating
      biomarkers that are associated with GEP-NETs are limited to measurements of plasma
      chromogranin A (CgA). The investigators have developed a PCR-based tool to quantitate (score)
      the circulating GEP-NET molecular signature (&quot;liquid&quot; biopsy) with high sensitivity and
      specificity. This signature can identify all types of GEP-NETs including small (1cm)
      non-metastatic tumors, is significantly reduced after tumor debulking and is decreased
      following surgical &quot;cure&quot;. Elevated post-surgical scores are associated with tumor recurrence
      within 6 months in ~40% of cases. Current NET treatment protocols are associated with tumor
      recurrence (progression free survival) ranging from 5-18 months. The majority of patients
      will experience a relapse within 18 months irrespective of the treatment approach. The
      investigators hypothesize that a PCR measurement of circulating NET mRNA can accurately
      predict the extent of surgical resection (tumor removal) and elevated scores can predict
      tumor relapse before this occurs. This biomarker protocol seeks to test this hypothesis and
      evaluate whether changes in plasma CgA are as effective in predicting resection and
      recurrence.
