  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is treatment of choice for insomnia (CBT-i). Many patients
      in psychiatric care have sleep problems including insomnia, but are rarely given the choice
      to participate in CBT to improve their sleep. Patients with ADHD is a patient group with high
      levels of sleep difficulties. Sleep problems in this patient group can be both more general
      such as insomnia, but can also be related to the ADHD itself and to the use of ADHD
      medication. In a previous pilot study, the investigators developed a version of CBT-i that
      would target sleep problems in this population. The basis was CBT-i, but with more emphasis
      on sleep promoting behaviors specific to ADHD (e.g. appropriate timing of ADHD-medication),
      techniques that would also alleviate sleep phase problems, (e.g. the systematic use of light
      and darkness), and techniques to target more general sleep disturbing habits (e.g. not
      winding down before bed time), that are also common in patients with ADHD. This treatment was
      well tolerated and gave moderate effects on insomnia severity in the pilot study. In a
      naturalistic randomized controlled trial, the investigators now evaluate the effects of this
      psychological treatment on sleep and symptoms of ADHD in patients at the ADHD-clinics,
      Northern Stockholm Psychiatry, Sweden.

    <description>Self-rating questionnaire regarding the use of sleep promoting behaviors. The questionnaire was constructed for the current project and consists of two parts. The first part includes 16 statements such as &quot;Last week I got out of bed within 15 minutes of waking up&quot; to be answered by number of days the last week this was true (i.e. from 0 to 7). The other part is to be answered on a 6-point Likert scale from &quot;Not at all true&quot; to &quot;Entirely true&quot;, with 7 statements like &quot;I get out of bed the same time every morning&quot;.</description>

    <description>This is a version of CBT for insomnia (CBT-i) developed during the pilot phase of this Project. Traditional CBT-i is adjusted for use in the adult ADHD population. This behavioral intervention adresses not only traditional aspects of insomnia, but also sleep phase problems and other aspects of sleep specifically relevant to the ADHD-population. Treatment is given as 10 weekly group sessions with telephone calls from the therapist between sessions to increase adherence and adress individual patient needs.</description>

    <description>Usual care at the ADHD-clinic. This mostly entails managing pharmacological treatment for ADHD, comorbid psychiatric problems and/or sleep problems. The clinic also provides different group treatments, for instance mindfulness groups and groups for developing behavioral strategies for managing ADHD symptoms, and individual therapy.</description>
