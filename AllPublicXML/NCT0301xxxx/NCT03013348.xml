  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a validation study of a post-processing method intended to identify psychogenic
      nonepileptic seizures by analysis of surface electromyographic (sEMG) artifact previously
      recorded during routine video-electroencephalographic (vEEG) monitoring
