    <textblock>
      A randomized multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel group design consisting of a 2-week
      run-in period followed by a 6-week treatment period of the placebo, Test product (Budesonide
      80 mcg / Formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5 mcg), or Reference product Symbicort® inhalation
      aerosol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pivotal trial that will examine therapeutic equivalence of a new generic fixed-dose
      combination product containing Budesonide 80 mcg / Formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5 mcg and
      reference listed drug (RLD) Symbicort® inhalation aerosol in adult patients with chronic but
      stable asthma as defined in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel
      Report 3 (NAEPP 3) guidelines. To ensure adequate study sensitivity the test and reference
      products should both be statistically superior to placebo (p&lt;0.05) with regard to the
      bioequivalent study primary endpoints.

      A secondary study objective is the safety and tolerability of the test compound.

          -  Moderate-to-severe asthma with a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;45% and &lt;85% of predicted
             normal, measured at least 6 hours after short-acting β agonist (SABA)and at least 24
             hours after the last dose of long-acting β agonist (LABA), at the screening visit and
             on the day of treatment

             albuterol inhalation (pMDI)

          -  Patients should be stable on their chronic asthma treatment regimen for at least 4
             weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Currently non-smoking; having not used tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars,

          -  Able to replace current regularly scheduled short-acting β agonists (SABAs) with
             salbutamol/albuterol inhaler for use only on an as-needed basis for the duration of
             the study (subjects should be able to withhold all inhaled SABAs for at least 6 hours
             prior to lung function assessments on study visits)

          -  Willing to discontinue their asthma medications (inhaled corticosteroids and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life-threatening asthma, defined as a history of asthma episodes(s) requiring
             intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnia, respiratory arrest or hypoxic
             seizures, asthma-related syncopal episodes(s), or hospitalizations within the past
             year or during the run-in period

             disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, etc.)

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant disease or abnormality including
             congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled coronary artery
             disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. In addition, historical or
             current evidence of significant hematologic, hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric, renal,
             or other diseases that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the patient at
             risk through study participation, or would affect the study analyses if the disease
             exacerbated during the study

          -  Patients who required systemic corticosteroids (for any reason) within the past 4
             weeks

          -  Hypersensitivity to any sympathomimetic drug (e.g., formoterol or albuterol) or any
