  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no available medical treatment options for patients with non-functioning pituitary
      adenomas (NFPA) or with resistant prolactinomas to dopamine agonists (DA) who are not cured
      by surgery. The study of the receptors by quantitative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)
      expression levels and immunohistochemistry analysis might end with a better understanding of
      these tumors. Besides that, it will be assessed the in vitro and in vivo responses to
      pasireotide (for NFPA and prolactinomas) and cabergoline (for NFPA). These responses will be
      compared with the receptor expressions which may be a tool as a predicting element of the
      response to these compounds.

      The goals of this study are: to verify whether cabergoline and pasireotide are effective in
      NFPA to control tumor re-growth as adjuvant therapy after neurosurgery and whether
      pasireotide is capable of normalizing the prolactin levels in patients with prolactinomas
      resistant to cabergoline; to assess the mRNA levels of dopamine receptor type 2 (DR2) and
      SSTR1-5 and their protein expression; to evaluate the in vitro hormonal response to
      cabergoline, octreotide and pasireotide; and to determine whether the mRNA DR2/SSTR1-5 and/or
      protein expression and/or in vitro hormonal response to cabergoline, octreotide and
      pasireotide correlates with the in vivo response to the former and to the last one. With this
      data the investigators intend to establish if the mRNA analysis and/or protein expression in
      NFPA and resistant prolactinomas might be predictive or foretelling factors concerning drug
      treatment in patients with this kind of pituitary tumors and also evaluate if there is any
      response in vitro or in vivo to the treatment with pasireotide in NFPA and resistant
      prolactinomas and with cabergoline in NFPA.

    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sella and prolactin will be performed before (baseline) and after 6 months of treatment with cabergoline or pasireotide.

    <description>For non-cured patients with prolactinomas resistant to cabergoline, MRI will be performed immediately before and six months after the onset of pasireotide treatment. The anti-secretory effect will be evaluated by prolactin dosage every month.
For patients harboring a NFPA, treatment will be started at least 3 months after neurosurgery, when a pituitary MRI clearly shows the presence of a residual tumor without any possible misinterpretation of postsurgical changes. In this case, the drug efficacy will be evaluated clinically by visual field and by MRI six months after pasireotide treatment.</description>

            <description>For non-cured patients with resistant prolactinomas, MRI will be performed immediately before and six months after the onset of pasireotide. The efficacy will be evaluated by prolactin dosage every month.
For patients harboring a NFPA, treatment will be started at least 3 months after neurosurgery. In this case, the drug efficacy will be evaluated by MRI six months after pasireotide.
Pasireotide: The patients with NFPA will be randomized into two groups: (A) the first one will be treated with pasireotide at the dosage of 900 µg s.c. twice a day for 6 months; (B) the second one, with cabergoline 3 mg/week for six months.
The patients with resistant prolactinomas will be treated with pasireotide at the dosage of 600 µg s.c. twice a day. After four weeks of treatment, the patients who normalize serum prolactin level will be maintained at the same dosage, the others who do not achieve normal prolactin level will have their dosage raised to 900 µg s.c. twice a day for six months.</description>
