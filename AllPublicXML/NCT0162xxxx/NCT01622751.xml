      Context: Adiponectin is an adipose tissue-derived hormone with an insulin sensitizing effect,
      and has been related to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. In addition, children with
      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness and the abnormality of
      rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

      Objective: To determine if the sleep stages are related to the plasma levels of adiponectin,
      resistin, and RBP4 (retinol binding protein-4), and whether these relationships are
      influenced by age, obesity and insulin resistance.

      This comparative study was carried out in 28 PWS children and 18 controls. The enrolled PWS
      children were volunteers out of a pool of approximately 100 PWS children followed at Samsung
      Medical Center [median age 8.0 years, interquartile range (7.0-10.5 years), BMI: median 24.2
      kg/m2 (23.0-27.5 kg/m2)] and 18 obese healthy children [median age 9.0 years interquartile
      range (7.0-11.0 years), BMI: median 24.2 kg/m2 interquartile range (23.1-27.6 kg/m2)].

        The study population comprised 28 children with PWS and 18 controls. The enrolled children
        with PWS were volunteers from a pool of approximately 100 children with PWS followed up at
        the Samsung Medical Center. The controls were healthy children from several elementary and
        middle schools located in the southern areas of Seoul.
