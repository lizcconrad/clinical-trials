  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal oxytocin versus
      intranasal placebo to improve symptoms in schizophrenia patients who have residual symptoms
      despite being on adequate treatment with antipsychotic medication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is two-site clinical study taking place at UCSD and UCI. Approximately 71 patients at
      each site will be randomly assigned to either intranasal oxytocin or vehicle placebo at this
      site.

      The total duration for each individual subject will be 6 weeks on study medication (placebo
      or oxytocin).

The items on the PANSS focus on symptoms that are common in patients with psychotic disorders and include hallucinations, delusions and disorganization as well as mood disturbances.</description>
