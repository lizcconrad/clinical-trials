  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a brief intervention in video format
      delivered in the post assault medical exam setting and including education about assault
      reactions and instruction in and modeling of successful coping strategies would reduce post
      assault drug use or abuse and PTSD symptoms as compared to standard care.

      The intervention being evaluated was shown at the time of the post assault medical exam and
      includes two main components: preparation for the medical exam; and information about and
      modelling of coping strategies that may help women cope in the aftermath of assault. The
      intervention content is delivered via video. Intervention and standard care groups were
      compared with regard to measures of substance use and abuse and symptoms of PTSD and other
      potentially comorbid problems including symptoms of depression or other anxiety.
