      Compare the response rate after 6 months of hormone treatment (or a major change in hormone
      treatment) in metastatic breast cancer, according to the uptake of FES in metastatic lesions
      taking-up FDG on PET/CT at baseline. Hypothesis: best response rate will be observed in
      patients with all metastases taking up FES prior to treatment.

      Main objective: Compare the response rate after 6 months of hormone treatment (or a major
      change in hormone treatment) in metastatic breast cancer, according to the uptake of FES in
      metastatic lesions taking-up FDG on PET/CT at baseline.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  evaluate diagnostic performance of FES PET/CT

        -  determine whether FES PET/CT is able to detect metastases that are not visible on FDG
           PET/CT. This point may constitute a direct benefit for the patient

        -  precise the nature of discordant FES/FDG foci

        -  validate and improve the interpretation criteria for FES PET/CT

        -  confirm the perfect tolerance
