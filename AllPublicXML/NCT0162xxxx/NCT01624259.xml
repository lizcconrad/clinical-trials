Noninferiority of 1.5 mg LY2189265 relative to 1.8 mg liraglutide was demonstrated if the upper bound of the two‑sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the difference in mean change in HbA1c between the 1.5 mg LY2189265 arm and 1.8 mg liraglutide arm was below 0.4%.</groups_desc>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 Steady-state Beta (β)- Cell Function (HOMA2-%B) at 26 Weeks</title>
        <description>The homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) quantifies insulin resistance and beta-cell function. HOMA2-%B is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady-state beta cell function (%B) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population was set at 100%.
LS means of the HOMA2-%B change from baseline to primary endpoint at Week 26 was adjusted by fixed effects of treatment, country, baseline HbA1c strata, and baseline HOMA2-%B value as covariate, via an ANCOVA analysis using LOCF.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters PR and QTcF (Fridericia's) Intervals at 26 Weeks</title>
        <description>The QT interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave. QTcF is the measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave adjusted using Fridericia's formula. PR is the interval between the P wave and the QRS complex. These parameters were calculated from electrocardiogram (ECG) data. LS means of change from baseline for the PR and QTcF intervals will be analyzed using the MMRM similar to MMRM model for primary outcome, using corresponding baseline and HbA1c strata. Only ECGs obtained at scheduled visits will be used in these summaries and analyses.</description>
