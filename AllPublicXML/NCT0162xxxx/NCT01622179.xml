      The purpose of this study is to estimate the effective of two suture methods in the treatment
      of Achilles rupture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achilles tendon rupture is one of the most common tendon injuries in the adult population.
      The incidence of this injury is increasing as aging adults continue their participation in
      high-demand sports. Although the impact of an Achilles tendon rupture is substantial, often
      resulting in prolonged disability and rehabilitation. Studies have showed that the operation
      treatment of acute Achilles tendon ruptures had some advantages. But the rebuild of blood
      supply was not involved in previous studies. And the epitenon of tendon is the interior
      layer, closest to the endotenons which contains the vascular supply. Main difference of two
      suture methods were if the epitenon was repaired and sewed indirectly or unrepaired and sewed
      directly.
