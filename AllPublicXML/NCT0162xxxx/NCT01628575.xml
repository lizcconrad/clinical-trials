    <textblock>
      Periodontally accelerated orthodontics, also known as PAO, is a novel technique combining
      alveolar corticotomy and bone grafting prior to commencing orthodontic treatment. Using this
      technique orthodontic de-crowding and space closing, can be completed in 60-70% less active
      orthodontic treatment time. The addition of particulated bone graft following decortication
      allows for the widening of the bucco-lingual alveolar bony dimension, thus creating space for
      the movement of teeth, without the creation of dehiscences, usually a negative sequel of the
      standard orthodontic treatment.

      Aim: To evaluate the use of the PAO technique for the treatment of 20 adult patients 1 year
      post orthodontic treatment.

      Methods: 20 periodontally healthy adult patients requiring orthodontic treatment were
      admitted in the departments of Periodontics and Orthodontics in Hadassah Medical Center. All
      patients underwent full orthodontic and periodontal examination upon admission including a
      pretreatment CBCT scan. Decortication followed by grafting was made after the orthodontic
      appliances have been placed. The orthodontic appliances were activated immediately after
      surgery and every 2 weeks. During the 1 year follow up a periodontal and orthodontic clinical
      evaluation were made, as well as a CBCT scan.

      20 patients were periodontally and orthodontically examined. including: full chart:ppd, free
      gin line, bleeding on probing, plaque score, teeth mobility. cephalometric analysis, clinical
      photographes, full periapical x rays.

      perio=ortho treatment plan was scheduled, a periodontal surgery for the decortication of
      buccal bone and bone grafting was preformed.

      at the same day orthodontic appliances were activated. in the follow up exam a full
      periodontal exam will be made (as at the beginning).

      the patient will be referred to CBCT scan. all dicom files will be uploaded to simplant
      software, and measurements will be made: buccal bone width from crest to apex. distance from
      CEJ to crest. presence of root dehiscence and fenestrations. root resorption.

      clinical measurements:

        -  recessions
