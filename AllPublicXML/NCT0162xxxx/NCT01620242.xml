  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center phase II study assessing whether cabazitaxel could be efficient for
      treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer after failure of cisplatin,
      cetuximab and taxanes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be treated with intravenous cabazitaxel 25 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (D1=D22) for 6
      cycles.

      In absence of progression disease or unacceptable toxicity, the treatment could be continued
      until a maximum of 10 cycles.

      Disease response will be assessed every 6 weeks (i.e. every 2 cycles) clinically and by
      CT-scan.

      An interim analysis will be carried out after the inclusion of the first 10 eligible and
      assessable patients.
