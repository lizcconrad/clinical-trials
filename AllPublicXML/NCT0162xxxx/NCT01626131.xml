  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot intervention study is to examine the efficacy of exercise
      for reducing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric and
      somatic symptoms. The sample will be composed of veterans aged 18-65 with combat-related PTSD
      (N = 40). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Participants in the
      exercise training group (n = 20) will receive three 60-75 minute sessions per week of
      combination aerobic and resistance training for eight weeks. In the control stretching group,
      participants (n = 20) will receive training in whole-body flexibility three times per week
      for eight weeks. Secondary objectives include 1) determining feasibility of the intervention
      (as measured by the percentage of prescribed days of exercise completed by each participant,
      and percentage of time exercising completed at the prescribed intensity and duration); 2)
      determining the influence of exercise training on aerobic fitness and strength in the sample;
      and 3) determining whether psychiatric/somatic symptom improvements are associated with
      improvements in fitness and strength. Finally, exploratory objectives will include examining
      whether exercise training can improve early signs of heart disease, and whether certain
      biomarkers (using MRI and fMRI data and inflammatory markers) are associated with treatment
      response.

    <description>Participants will engage in 3 aerobic and resistance exercise sessions (~60-75 min total per session) weekly for 8 consecutive weeks.
Aerobic exercise will be performed for 30 minutes on a treadmill 3 times weekly. Before beginning, 10 min of stretches will be performed. Each exercise bout will begin and end with a 5-min warm-up and 5-min cool-down on the treadmill, not included in the prescribed exercise duration.
Eight resistance exercises will be performed immediately following the aerobic exercise: lat pulldown, triceps pushdown, seated chest press, upright row, bicep curls, leg press, shoulder press, and abdominal crunches. Participants will perform two sets of 10 repetitions of each. A rest interval of 60 seconds will be taken between exercises. Research staff will initially assist the participants in choosing the proper resistance to use, and weight will be increased once 15 repetitions can be performed while maintaining proper form.</description>

    <description>Participants will engage in stretching sessions that will focus on whole-body flexibility. Participants will perform 3 sessions per week (~60 min) of 3 sets of 14 stretches focused on the muscle groups targeted by the exercise training (i.e., deltoids, pectorals, lats, forearms and biceps, triceps, quadriceps, hamstrings, and groins). Each stretch will be performed for 20 seconds and a rest interval of 60 seconds will be taken between each set.</description>
