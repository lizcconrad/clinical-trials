      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether an anti-inflammatory medication,
      pentoxifylline, reduces depressive symptoms and improves artery function. Participants in
      this trial will be older primary care patients (60 years and up) who are depressed but do not
      have a history of cardiovascular disease. Half of these patients will receive pentoxifylline,
      and half will receive placebo. In addition, participants in both arms will receive an
      evidence-based psychological treatment called Beating the BluesÂ®, which is a computerized,
      cognitive behavioral treatment program for depression. The investigators will use
      questionnaires to assess change in depressive symptoms and an ultrasound test to measure
      change in artery function from pre- to post-treatment. It is hypothesized that patients who
      receive pentoxifylline will show greater improvements in both depression and artery function
      than patients who receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, and depression is the leading cause of
      disability in the United States. Previous research suggests that systemic inflammation may
      play an important role in the development of both depression and cardiovascular disease.
      Therefore, Aim #1 of this study is to examine whether adding an anti-inflammatory medication
      (pentoxifylline) to standard depression treatment (cognitive-behavioral therapy) improves
      both depressive symptoms and endothelial dysfunction, a sign of early cardiovascular disease.
      Aim #2 is to evaluate candidate mediators of treatment effects by examining whether
      reductions in multiple markers of systemic inflammation account for treatment-related
      improvements in depressive symptoms and endothelial dysfunction. To achieve these aims, a
      clinical trial of older depressed primary care patients free of cardiovascular disease is
      being conducted. Patients will be randomized to one of two groups: a standard depression
      treatment (a cognitive-behavioral treatment program) plus pentoxifylline or standard
      depression treatment plus placebo. The treatment phase of the study will be 12 weeks. At
      baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks, patients will undergo assessments of depressive symptoms,
      various inflammatory markers, and endothelial function. Our index of endothelial function is
      brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, a noninvasive measure of endothelial function.
      Demonstrating that medications targeting systemic inflammation are effective for concurrently
      treating late-life depression and reducing CAD risk would place anti-inflammatory approaches
      in the collection of depression treatment strategies, as well as CAD prevention strategies,
      of the primary care provider. This change to clinical practice should result in improved
      management of both late-life depression and cardiovascular risk, which in turn would reduce
      disability, CAD morbidity, and mortality among older adults.

    <description>Patients underwent ultrasound assessment of brachial FMD in accordance with established guidelines at pre- (0 weeks) and post- (12 weeks) treatment. After a 10-minute supine rest, high-resolution baseline images of the brachial artery were obtained from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles. Next, the forearm cuff was inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes and then was rapidly deflated. At 60 and 90 seconds post-deflation, images from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles were acquired. FMD values were computed as the % change in brachial diameter at either 60 or 90 seconds after cuff deflation</description>

    <description>Self-reported depressive symptom severity was measured at pre- (0 weeks) and post- (12 weeks) treatment visits by the 20 depression items from the Symptom Checklist 90 (Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale; SCL-20). Each item on the scale ranges from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total scores are the average across all response items and range from 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating greater levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>BtB is a widely used, empirically supported, computer-based, CBT program for depression designed for use in primary care clinics. BtB utilizes an interactive, multimedia format to deliver and eight 50-minute, weekly therapy sessions. General topics covered include identifying and challenging automatic thoughts, cognitive errors, core beliefs, and attributional styles; activity scheduling; problem solving; graded exposure; task breakdown; sleep management; and relapse prevention. In addition to session work, patients are assigned homeworks that are customized to their needs and reviewed at the start of each session. A progress report, including whether the patient is experiencing suicidal ideation, is generated at the end of each session.</description>

        <description>Patients underwent ultrasound assessment of brachial FMD in accordance with established guidelines at pre- (0 weeks) and post- (12 weeks) treatment. After a 10-minute supine rest, high-resolution baseline images of the brachial artery were obtained from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles. Next, the forearm cuff was inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes and then was rapidly deflated. At 60 and 90 seconds post-deflation, images from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles were acquired. FMD values were computed as the % change in brachial diameter at either 60 or 90 seconds after cuff deflation</description>

        <description>Self-reported depressive symptom severity was measured at pre- (0 weeks) and post- (12 weeks) treatment visits by the 20 depression items from the Symptom Checklist 90 (Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale; SCL-20). Each item on the scale ranges from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total scores are the average across all response items and range from 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating greater levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Missing data precluded analysis of two secondary outcome variables: IL-1Î± and IL-1Î².
Due to the very small sample of randomized patients, conclusions should not be drawn from the results of this pilot trial.</limitations_and_caveats>
