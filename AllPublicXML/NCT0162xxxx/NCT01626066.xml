  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Real-time detection of cancer cells during surgical removal of a tumor is important.
      Currently when tissue is removed at the time of surgery, the removed tissue goes to pathology
      when the margins (edges of the tissue) are examined to see if cancer cells are present. This
      may take a few to several days. Patients tissue with positive (cancer cells present) margins
      may require additional therapies including surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine
      a safe dose of a new imaging agent (LUM015), like a fluorescent contrast agent or dye, that
      will show in the tumor area during surgery and may help facilitate visualization of tumor for
      its removal.

    <description>The pharmacokinetic parameters to be measured will include: area under the curve (AUCt), maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (tmax) and first-order terminal (elimination) rate constant. Secondary (derived) parameters will include: terminal half-life (t1/2), clearance (CL), mean residence time (MRT), and apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz). The distribution of these parameters will be described for each dose cohort separately; breast and sarcoma patients will be combined.</description>

    <measure>To analyze cathepsin protease expression in tumors.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Cathepsin expression in tumors, measured in arbitrary units by Real-Time PCR compared to adjacent normal tissue when available, will be assessed in sarcomas and breast tumors. For each tissue specimen the expression of cathepsin will be compared to the imaging signal. Scatterplots of cathepsin level against imaging signal will be made according to tissue type within each dose cohort.</description>
