      -  Baseline:

             -  Standard preparation of the osteotomy

             -  Placement of 2 dental implants

             -  On each implant one of both types of healing abutments is placed

             -  Suturing

             -  Standardized radiography to measure bone-levels at baseline

             -  Digital impression of the surrounding gingiva with an intra-oral scanner (a
                non-invasive method) to measure the baseline level of the gingiva

        -  2 weeks after Baseline:

           o Removal of the sutures

        -  4 weeks after Baseline:

             -  A 2nd digital impression of the soft tissue with an intra-oral scanner

             -  Collecting crevicular fluid by placing paperpoints in the provided apertures in the
                healing abutments for 60 seconds without bleeding.

             -  Measuring of the pocket depth in the provided apertures in the healing abutments
                with an automated probe.

             -  Removal of the Healing Abutment with the attached soft tissue en-bloque.

             -  Placement of a new, regular, Encode Healing Abutment.

        -  10 weeks after Baseline:

             -  Start of standard prosthetic procedure. In this study we expect that the soft
                tissue attachment (i.e. the gingival attachment) will be stronger and earlier
                achieved at the nano-structured healing abutments than at the normal, uncoated
                healing abutments. This would lead to a more stable soft tissue complex on the long
                rung and thus providing a more predictable aesthetic outcome. Secondly, a stronger
                attachment would mean a stronger barrier against micro-organisms and might
                influence the occurrence of peri-implantitis.
