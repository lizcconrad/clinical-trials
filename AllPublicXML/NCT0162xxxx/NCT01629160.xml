    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate feasibility of using new technologies to
      characterize ventricular wall motion in patients indicated for mapping and ablation
      procedures. Echo will be performed preoperatively and patients will receive a 1-month
      followup telephone call.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be in sinus rhythm

          -  Have the ability to provide informed consent for study participation and be willing
             and able to comply with the Clinical Investigational Plan described evaluations

          -  Be undergoing mapping and ablation that requires left heart access for either
             ventricular tachycardia (VT) or atrial fibrillation (AF) according to HRS (Heart
             Rhythm Society)/ESC (European Society of Cardiology)/German National guidelines. The
             patient needs to have at least one of the following indications for left heart mapping
             and ablation to be included in the study: a) Symptomatic sustained monomorphic VT
             (SMVT), or b) Frequent PVCs, non-sustained VT, or VT that is presumed to cause
             ventricular dysfunction, or c) Bundle branch reentrant or interfascicular VTs, or d)
             Symptomatic AF with indication for ablation per current HRS/ESC/German National
             guidelines in a patient who is either 1) refractory or intolerant to at least one
             Class 1 or Class 3 antiarrhythmic medication, or 2) unable/unwilling to take
             antiarrhythmic drug therapy and chooses ablation as the first line of therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have permanent AF

          -  Exhibit Cheyne-Stokes respiration

          -  Have a recent myocardial infarction within 40 days prior to enrollment

          -  Have undergone cardiac surgery or coronary revascularization procedure within 3 months
             prior to enrollment or be scheduled for such procedures

          -  Have had a recent CVA or TIA within 3 months prior to enrollment

          -  Be less than 18 years of age

          -  Be pregnant

          -  Be currently participating in any other clinical investigation
