  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle fatigue affects adversely the athletesÂ´ performance and it is therefore one of the
      most investigated topics currently. However we do not know accurately the mechanisms that
      produce it.

      The aim of this study is to determine the influence of the Kinesio taping (KT) application in
      the paravertebral muscle fatigue in a sample of healthy young subjects.
