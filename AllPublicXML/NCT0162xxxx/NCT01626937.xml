      Goal of the study: To show that prehospital NPPV use for COPD decompensation, as compared to
      only standard medical treatment, might enable a decrease in intubation rate.

      Primary end point: the rate of endotracheal intubation in the first three hours after
      randomization.

      Secondary en points: rate of endotracheal intubation after third hour, rate of prehospital
      and ICU mortality, ICU days, effects on clinical parameters (respiratory rate, SpO2, heart
      rate, arterial blood pressure, consciousness) and arterial blood gases (pH, PaCO2, PaO2), 30
      days mortality, delays between first medical contact and in-hospital admission, relation
      between initial pH level and endotracheal intubation.

      Inclusion criteria: Adult patients (&gt;18 years), with GCS≥10, known or suspected COPD and
      presenting acute respiratory decompensation with respiratory acidosis.

      Exclusion criteria: Cardiac or respiratory arrest, upper gastro intestinal tract haemorrhage,
      shock, serious ventricular arrhythmia, severe sepsis, multiple organ failure, serious
      cranial-facial trauma, upper airways obstruction, undrained pneumothorax,
      uncooperative-agitated patients refusing the technique, respiratory distress with bradypnoea
      &lt; 12/min, pauses gasps repeated bradycardia, intractable vomiting, acute traumatic
      tetraplegia, persistant hemodynamic instability with PAS&lt;90mmHg, ensuitable environment.

      Randomization: Assignment to NPPV group or standard therapy group will be performed at the
      time of arrival of the SAMU team to the patient, by calling a physician located at the
      calldispatch center who will connect to the web site of the clinical research unit from
      Bordeaux university hospital.

      Period of study: 25 months (24 months for patients inclusion and 1 month for follow-up).

      Number of patients: 199 patients in each group i.e 398 patients (significance level of 5%,
      power of 80%; 50% expected decrease of intubation rate, i.e. from 20 to 10%).

      Main investigator: Dr Pierre-Arnaud Fort, MD, Pôle Urgences-SAMU47-Réanimation, Centre
      Hospitalier Saint-Esprit - Agen.

      Participating centers : 20 SAMU-SMUR corresponding to 19 departments in France.

    <description>After nebulisation of bronchodilatators and administration of corticosteroid therapy, non invasive positive pressure ventilation will be started out of hospital and continuously in COPD patient with acute respiratory distress and respiratory acidosis, using a facial mask, with initial level of inspiratory pressure at 8 mmHg then according to VTe and/or respiratory rate; expiratory pressure at 4 mmHg then according to persistance of inspiratory work, level of FiO2 for an objective of SpO2 between 88 and 92%. In case of failure, NIV will be stopped and endotracheal intubation realized if indicate.</description>

    <description>Conventional medical treatment includes nebulization of bronchodilatators every 15-20 minutes until hospital and corticosteroid therapy. If indicate during out of hospital setting, endotracheale intubation will be realized. After admission in hospital, non invasive ventilation could be started.</description>
