    <textblock>
      As the use of video games (VG) is rapidly increasing, many studies have tries to understand
      the effects of VG on the children and adolescents playing them.

      Most of the research was directed towards negative effects (especially violence, attention
      and school performance), producing mixed results.

      Recently, more studies had focused their attention on the opposite angle: The influence of
      the player's mental and behavioral parameters, influencing his VG playing patterns. The focus
      of most of these researches was time of playing, addictive patterns and exposure to violence.

      The current study will try to characterize the variance of VG playing pattern among
      adolescents diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, in order to better under the rich
      interaction between a player and his VG, and to understand whether VG playing patterns holds
      diagnostical clues for the child's diagnosis and his inner world.

      The participants will be asked to attend 2 session, 2 hours each, at 3-14 days interval.

      At the first session, after signing consent form, will asked to fill out questionaires
      regarding demographic data, personality, empathy trait, aggression state and trait and
      computer games usage.

      also, they will be asked to complete HTP and TAT psycho-diagnostic tests. Then, using heart
      rate variability (HRV) and Galvanic skin response (GSR), monitor of sympathetic tonus will be
      measured while playing a shooting and race game.

      At the end of the first session, they will be asked to fill additional aggression state
      questionaire.

      On the second session, monitored by HRV and GSR, they will be asked to play a role playing
      game (RPG) and real-time strategy game (RTS). At the end of session, they will be asked to
      fill additional aggression state questionaire.

      Parameters of playing patterns collected from the VG will be recorded and analyzed.
