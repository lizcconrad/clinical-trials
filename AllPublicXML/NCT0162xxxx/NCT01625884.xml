  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Turkey statin compliance is lower than EU countries. (EURIKA). We will assess the
      underlying causes of statin incompliance. The investigators will build patient and physician
      education programs to improve compliance in TURKEY. Our aim is to assess patients' and
      physicians' attitudes to statins by mean of HABIT Patient and Physician survey respectively.
