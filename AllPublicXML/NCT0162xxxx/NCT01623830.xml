  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this project is to determine if using a cue to trigger (and reactivate)
      the fear memory 10 minutes prior to exposure treatment sessions leads to less anxiety in
      patients with a fear of flying. The long term goals are to establish if targeting the
      reconsolidation of fear with a reminder of the fear is effective for human clinical
      populations in reducing relapse (return of fear). In this investigation, the investigators
      propose to treat 64 patients diagnosed with a fear of flying (FOF) using virtual reality
      exposure therapy (VRE). All patients in the study will receive exactly the same exposure
      treatment using a virtual airplane.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior to each VRE session, the investigators will test a brief, easy-to-implement
      manipulation that triggers the fear memory and presumably allows it to be changed in a way
      that prevents the fear from returning later (i.e., prevents relapse). The investigators
      propose to randomly assign eligible participants to 1 of 2 conditions: 1) VRE therapy
      preceded by a reminder of the feared stimulus (a VR clip of a virtual airplane taxiing and
      taking off) presented 10 minutes prior to all VRE therapy sessions, or 2) VRE therapy
      preceded by a neutral cue (a VR clip of a virtual living room) presented 10 minutes prior to
      all VRE therapy sessions. Participants will be evaluated pre- and post-treatment and at a 3
      month and 6 month follow-up visit to assess long-term effects.

    <measure>Fear of Flying Inventory (FFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post treatment (9 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>a 33-item scale measuring intensity of FOF. Items are rated on a 9-point scale ranging from 0 ( not at all) to 8 ( very severely disturbing). The possible range of scores is 0-264 with higher total scores indicating greater fear of flying intensity.Test-retest reliability for 15 WL patients was .92, and it has been sensitive to change with treatment.</description>

    <measure>The Questionnaire on Attitudes Toward Flying (QAF)</measure>
    <time_frame>post treatment (9 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>assesses history of FOF, previous treatment, and attitudes toward flying. It includes a 36-item questionnaire rating the level of fear on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to10 in different flying situations. The possible range of scores is 0 to 360 with higher scores indicating greater fear associated with flying. Test-retest reliability was .92, and split-half reliability was .99.</description>

    <measure>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>post-treatment (9 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>a 21-item measure of cognitive and vegetative symptoms of depression is widely used in a variety of populations, including trauma victims and is sensitive to treatment effects on depression. The possible range for scores is 0-63 with higher scores suggesting more severe symptoms of depression.</description>

    <description>The STAI-State is a 20-item self report scale employing a Likert scale format with 4 responses per item (1-4). The possible range of scores is from 20-80, and higher scores indicate greater levels of anxiety.Ten of the STAI items measure feelings of stress and anxiety, while the remaining ten items measure feelings of relaxation.</description>

             changes, and participants on medications will be monitored by their prescribing
             physician; and

        <description>assesses history of FOF, previous treatment, and attitudes toward flying. It includes a 36-item questionnaire rating the level of fear on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to10 in different flying situations. The possible range of scores is 0 to 360 with higher scores indicating greater fear associated with flying. Test-retest reliability was .92, and split-half reliability was .99.</description>
