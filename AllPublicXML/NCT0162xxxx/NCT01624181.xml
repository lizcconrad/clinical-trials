  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study the investigators want to determine, if a fast identification of germs,
      causing hospital-acquired infections of the lower respiratory tract, is possible through the
      use of MCC-IMS technology - a method that allows on time detection and identification of very
      small amounts of substances in gas samples. Therefore aspiration samples from the respiratory
      tracts of ventilated patients, which are suspected to develop such an infection, will be
      collected, cultivated and analyzed by MCC-IMS. The investigators want to determine if MCC-IMS
      diagnostic could be a faster alternative to conventional microbiological methods. The results
      of the MCC-IMS analyses therefore will be compared with results of conventional
      microbiological methods.

    <textblock>
      In this clinical feasibility study it is to be investigated if MCC-IMS analyses over clinical
      samples from ventilated critically ill patients could be a fast and secure alternative to
      conventional microbiological diagnostic methods in the identification of human pathogenic
      microbes in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia. Therefore aspiration samples from
      intubated and ventilated critically ill patients, which are suspected to develop such an
      infection, will be collected and cultivated for a short period of time. The headspace over
      these cultures will be analyzed using MCC-IMS - a technology that allows on time detection
      and identification of very small amounts of substances in complex and humid gas samples.
      Conventional microbiological investigations, including MALDI-TOF, will be carried out
      parallel to the MCC-IMS analyses.
