  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a pulmonary disorder caused by a complex
      hypersensitivity response to antigens released by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The
      management of ABPA includes two important aspects - institution of immunosuppressive therapy
      in the form of glucocorticoids to control the immunologic activity, and close monitoring for
      detection of relapses. Another possible target is to use antifungal agents to attenuate the
      fungal burden secondary to the fungal colonization in the airways. Oral corticosteroids are
      currently the treatment of choice for ABPA associated with bronchial asthma.They not only
      suppress the immune hyperfunction but are also anti-inflammatory. However, there is no data
      to guide the dose and duration of glucocorticoids and different regimens of glucocorticoids
      have been used in literature.Itraconazole, an oral triazole with relatively low toxicity, is
      active against Aspergillus spp. in vitro and in vivo. The activity of itraconazole against
      Aspergillus spp. is more than that of ketoconazole. The administration of itraconazole can
      eliminate Aspergillus in the airways and can theoretically reduce the allergic responses in
      ABPA. The new triazoles, such as voriconazole, have recently been found effective in the
      treatment of fungal infections. The investigators hypothesize that voriconazole might also be
      useful in the treatment of ABPA. The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of voriconazole therapy in patients with ABPA.
