  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have advanced cancer that has
      either gotten worse or is resistant to standard therapy.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the
      combination of Afinitor (everolimus) either with Kineret (anakinra) or Xgeva (denosumab) that
      can be given to patients with advanced cancer. The safety of these drugs will also be
      studied.

      Everolimus is designed to stop cells from dividing.

      Anakinra is designated to block a protein that is involved in tumor development, new blood
      vessels growing, and spread of cancer.

      Denosumab is designed to block the activity of a protein, which may prevent bone
      complications in cancer that has spread to the bone.

      This is an investigational study. Everolimus is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat pancreatic cancer that has gotten worse, advanced renal cell carcinoma, and a type of
      brain tumor called subependymal giant cell astrocytoma. Anakinra is FDA approved and
      commercially available for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Denosumab is FDA approved and
      commercially available to prevent bone problems in patients with solid tumors that have
      spread to the bone. The combination of everolimus either with anakinra or denosumab to treat
      advanced cancer is investigational.

      Up to 147 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      Dose escalation:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide if you
      will receive everolimus with anakinra or everolimus with denosumab. Once it is decided which
      combination you will receive, you will be assigned to a dose level based on when you join the
      study.

      Up to 3 dose levels of everolimus with anakinra will be tested. The first group of
      participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. Up to 6 participants will
      be enrolled at each dose level. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of
      everolimus with anakinra is found.

      One (1) dose level of everolimus with denosumab will be tested at first. Participants will
      receive the highest dose level. This is a dose level that has already been given off-study in
      clinical practice, and researchers have experience with it. If intolerable side effects are
      seen, up to 4 more lower dose levels may be studied. Each new group of participants will
      receive a lower dose than the group before it. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each
      dose level. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of everolimus with denosumab
      is found.

      Dose expansion:

      Once the highest tolerable dose of everolimus either with anakinra or denosumab is found, up
      to 14 more participants may be enrolled to further study the safety of each combination of
      drugs at that dose and the level of effectiveness of the study drugs in a certain tumor
      group.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      You will take everolimus by mouth at the same time every day with or without food, swallowed
      whole with a glass of water.

      If you receive anakinra, you will receive it by injection under the skin either to the upper
      arm, upper thigh, or stomach at the same time every day. The study doctor or nurse will teach
      you how to give the injections yourself.

      If you receive denosumab, you will receive it by injection under the skin either to the upper
      arm, upper thigh, or stomach on Day 1 of each cycle.

      Study Visits:

      On about Day 15-21 of Cycle 1:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any cancer symptoms.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Urine may be collected for routine tests if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Before starting Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any cancer signs and symptoms.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Urine may be collected for routine tests.

      Before every odd cycle starting Cycles 3, 5, and beyond:

      Â°Blood (about 1/2 tablespoon) will be drawn to check your immune system.

      Every 8 weeks, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI, and/or PET/CT scan to check the status
      of the disease. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tumor marker testing. After at
      least 6 months of taking the study drugs, you may have CT, MRI, and/or PET/CT scan and blood
      drawn every 12 weeks (every 3 cycles) if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine
      pregnancy test before starting each study cycle.

      If you are receiving the combination of everolimus and denosumab, blood (about 1 tablespoon)
      may be drawn more often to check your mineral levels if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Dosing:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Follow-up Visit:

      You will have a follow-up-visit within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs. You will
      be asked about any current health problems you may have and if you have had any side effects.
      If your study doctor thinks it is needed, you may have follow-up for a longer period of time.
