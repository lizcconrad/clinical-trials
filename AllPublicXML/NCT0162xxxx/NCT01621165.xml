  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mania has been considered to be, in part, a hyperadrenergic state. One focus of treatment of
      mania involves directly targeting this hyperexcitable state by reducing arousal with
      antiadrenergic agents. This can be achieved by decreasing norepinephrine release by
      stimulating presynaptic inhibitory receptors. Prazosin, FDA approved for the treatment of
      high blood pressure works in part by blocking postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptors.
      Prazosin has been found to be clinically useful for the treatment of Post Traumatic Stress
      Disorder. It is reasonable, therefore, to anticipate that prazosin might be helpful in the
      treatment of mania.

    <description>Prazosin and placebo will be gradually titrated over 10 days to a final dose of 10 mg/day, given in divided doses (three times a day). During this time subjects will be monitored for adverse effects to prazosin and manic symptoms will be monitored. Vital signs will be monitored three times a day throughout the study. If a subject receiving prazosin or placebo develops distressing adverse effects, the dose will be decreased to the next lower dose.If there is a greater than 15 mg mercury postural fall in systolic bBP, dosing will be held at the previous day's dose.Subjects who do not tolerate prazosin or placebo will be discharged from the study.</description>
