  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to determine whether the addition of an FOBT kit and educational
      materials to a second mailed invitation compared to a second mailed invitation alone
      increases use of appropriate screening tests (FOBT for average risk or colonoscopy if
      increased risk) by eligible persons within 6 months of the second mailing in:
      (1)Non-responders to an initial mailed CRC screening invitation from their family physician
      and, (2)Those who responded to the initial mailed CRC screening invitation and are due for
      repeat screening (i.e., &quot;recall&quot; patients). In addition, the investigators will also explore
      the impact of the investigators intervention in likely under-screened groups such as those
      living in more remote areas of the province and those with low socio-economic status as well
      as assessing the cost-effectiveness of this strategy.

    <description>The secondary outcome will be the uptake of lower gastrointestinal investigations (colonoscopy for an indication other than family history or colonoscopy done outside of CIRT, flexible sigmoidoscopy, barium enema) within 12 months, respectively, of the mailing as determined by the administrative data (CIRT, OHIP procedure or radiology code).</description>
