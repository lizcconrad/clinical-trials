    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study is conducted in Europe. The study is both retrospective and
      prospective.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the frequency of hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) in
      insulin-treated patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

        Approximately 3811 patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes are expected to be recruited.
        Patients will be asked to complete 2 self-assessment questionnaires, one retrospective and
        one prospective, to characterize severe hypoglycaemias during the last 12 months
        (retrospective questionnaire) and severe/non-severe hypoglycaemias during the coming month
        after inclusion (prospective questionnaire).
