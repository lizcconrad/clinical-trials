  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the quality of a transversus abdominis plane blockade
      with an intravenous pain therapy with opioids. Due to the relatively low side effect profile
      and comparably few contraindications, this method offers a good option, to be a standard
      procedure or better alternative in the treatment of pain in surgery of the prostate.
