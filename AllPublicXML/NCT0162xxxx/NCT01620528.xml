      A randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of elagolix in the management of
      moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain in adult premenopausal female subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study to assess
      the safety and efficacy of two doses of elagolix (Dose 1 and Dose 2) versus placebo in
      premenopausal 18 to 49 year old women with moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain.
      Approximately 875 subjects will be enrolled into the study at approximately 160 sites. The
      study consists of 4 periods: 1) Washout Period (if applicable); 2) a Screening Period of up
      to 100 days prior to first dose; 3) a 6 month Treatment Period; and 4) a Post treatment
      Follow-up Period of up to 12 months (if applicable). An electronic diary will be dispensed
      and training provided to record endometriosis-associated pain, uterine bleeding, and
      analgesic medication use for endometriosis-associated pain on a daily basis. Pregnancy
      testing will be performed monthly throughout the study. Subjects will be required to use
      non-hormonal dual contraception during the study, and will be counseled on appropriate and
      effective forms of birth control to promote pregnancy prevention.

        in the study.

        4. Subject has a Composite Pelvic Signs and Symptoms Score total score of ≥ 6 at Screening
        with a score of at least 2 for dysmenorrhea AND at least 2 for non-menstrual pelvic pain.
        5. Subjects must have at least two menstrual cycles 24 to 38 days within the Screening
        Period, prior to Day 1 Exclusion Criteria: 1. Subject is pregnant or breast feeding or is

        post-abortion, or post-pregnancy at the time of entry into the Screening Period.

        2. Subject has a history of previous non-response to GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, Depot
        Medroxyprogesterone Acetate, or aromatase inhibitors as assessed by subject report of no
        improvement in dysmenorrhea or non-menstrual pelvic pain (subject report of partial
        response to or side effects from these agents is not exclusionary).

        3. Subject has chronic pelvic pain that is not caused by endometriosis that requires
        chronic analgesic or other chronic therapy, or that would interfere with the assessment of
        endometriosis related pain.

        4. Clinically significant gynecologic condition identified on Screening transvaginal
        ultrasound or endometrial biopsy.

        5. Subject has a history of osteoporosis or other metabolic bone disease. 6. Subject has a
        current history of undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding.
