  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the corneal epithelial cell response associated
      with lens wear that results in solution-induced corneal staining (Phase1) and to determine
      the cell appearance in symptomatic and asymptomatic contact lens wearers (Phase 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consisted of 2 phases. In Phase 1, participants wore contact lenses pre-soaked
      overnight in contact lens solution for 2 hours and 4 hours, separate days. A minimum of 7
      days separated the wear periods. Ocular surface cells were collected after both wear periods.
      In Phase 2, participants wore their habitual contact lenses on a daily wear basis for 4 weeks
      with habitual lens care. Ocular surface cells were collected after Day 1 and Day 28. Phase 2
      included eligible participants who completed Phase 1 and new participants. A participant was
      considered to be asymptomatic if he/she can typically wear contact lenses comfortably for at
      least 10 hours/day a minimum of 5 days/week, and symptomatic if he/she typically wears
      contact lenses for a minimum of 3 days/week and experiences ocular discomfort after less than
      6 hours of wear. Phase 1 participants not eligible to participate in Phase 2 or uninterested
      in continuing into Phase 2 were exited from the study.

    <time_frame>Day 1 after 2 hours of wear; Day 7 after 4 hours of wear</time_frame>
    <description>The worn contact lenses were removed and epithelial (corneal) cells were collected directly from the ocular surface using an eyewash. Immediately following the eyewash, samples were taken to a laboratory and incubated with live/ dead stains. The number of viable (alive) cells was counted using a microscope. Cells collected from the right and the left eye were analyzed separately. A significant difference in viable cell count may indicate a physiological response to the contact lens and/or care regimen over time.</description>

    <description>The worn contact lenses were removed, rinsed and transferred in individual glass vials. Epithelial cells were collected directly from the ocular surface using an eyewash. Samples were taken to a laboratory and cells collected from each lens and each eye were counted separately using a microscope. The ratio of cells collected from the ocular surface and from the contact lens was calculated. A higher number indicates a higher percentage of cells collected from the contact lenses relative to the total number of cells collected.</description>

        <description>The worn contact lenses were removed, rinsed and transferred in individual glass vials. Epithelial cells were collected directly from the ocular surface using an eyewash. Samples were taken to a laboratory and cells collected from the right and the left eye were combined; cells collected from the right and the left lens were combined. The ratio of cells collected from the ocular surface and from the contact lens was calculated. A higher number indicates a higher percentage of cells collected from the contact lenses relative to the total number of cells collected.</description>

          <title>Ratio of Epithelial Cells Collected Directly From the Ocular Surface and Cells Collected From the Contact Lens at Day 1 and Week 4, Phase 2</title>
          <description>The worn contact lenses were removed, rinsed and transferred in individual glass vials. Epithelial cells were collected directly from the ocular surface using an eyewash. Samples were taken to a laboratory and cells collected from the right and the left eye were combined; cells collected from the right and the left lens were combined. The ratio of cells collected from the ocular surface and from the contact lens was calculated. A higher number indicates a higher percentage of cells collected from the contact lenses relative to the total number of cells collected.</description>

        <title>Ratio of Viable and Non-Viable Epithelial Cells at Day 1 and Week 4, Phase 2</title>
        <description>The worn contact lenses were removed, rinsed and transferred in individual glass vials. Epithelial cells were collected directly from the ocular surface using an eyewash. Samples were taken to a laboratory and incubated with live/dead stains. Cells collected from the right and the left eye were combined; cells collected from the right and the left lens were combined. The number of viable and non-viable cells was counted using a microscope. The ratio between viable and non-viable cell counts was calculated. A higher number indicates a higher percentage of non-viable cells relative to the total cell count.</description>
