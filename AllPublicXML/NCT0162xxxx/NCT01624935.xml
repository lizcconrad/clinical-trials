  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The enormous global burden of mental illness has been estimated through the publication of
      the Global Burden of Disease Study. Research confirms that populations exposed to mass trauma
      such as natural disaster bear a particularly high burden of mental disorders, with depression
      and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) generally being the top two adult psychiatric
      diagnoses. In traumatized populations, these disorders do not remit with replacement of
      material losses or resettlement to safe locations, but rather tend to become chronic
      conditions with attendant disability. PTSD and depression are risk factors for anger,
      interpersonal discord and violence, not only among those who have trauma and depression, but
      also among their spouses and children. This &quot;infectious&quot; model of trauma/violence is
      critically important in the setting of natural disaster, as increased levels of interpersonal
      violence within the afflicted community hinder its recovery. To date, there has been little
      research on the interpersonal effects of mass trauma. The proposed research is a randomized
      controlled trial of &quot;Interpersonal Therapy&quot; (IPT) versus wait list control (WLC) for
      survivors of the Sichuan Earthquake living in Shifang, China. IPT, a very effective therapy
      for depression, has been adapted for PTSD treatment and developing country settings. Measures
      will evaluate success of the treatment not only in terms of individual depression and PTSD
      symptoms, but also with respect to interpersonal functioning.

      Hypothesis 1: Relative to wait list control, fewer subjects who received IPT will meet
      criteria for Depression and PTSD at the conclusion of the RCT.

      Hypothesis 2: Subjects who received IPT will have greater improvement of social functioning
      than wait list controls.
