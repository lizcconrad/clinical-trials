  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of orally inhaled AP301 on alveolar liquid
      clearance in ALI (acute lung injury) patients with the purpose to assess the treatment
      associated changes of extravascular lung water (EVLW) within 7 days of treatment.
