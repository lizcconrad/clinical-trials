      One hundred and forty adult men concerned about their substance use and behaviors toward
      intimate partners, recruited in Washington State, will be enrolled in the trial. Participants
      are recruited through print and radio ads. Following a baseline assessment, participants are
      then randomly assigned to receive one of two interventions:

        -  The experimental intervention is a two-session motivational enhancement treatment. A
           personalized feedback report, containing information from the participant's assessment
           as well as normative comparison data, is reviewed, with the counselor employing
           motivational interviewing strategies intended to impact study outcomes.

        -  The comparison condition involves an educational brochure focusing on the legal, health
           and behavioral effects of intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and HIV risky
           behaviors.

      Following the two interventions, participants are reassessed at 1 week, 1 month, and 4 months
      following either intervention.
