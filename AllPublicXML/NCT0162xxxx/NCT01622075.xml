    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of successful interventional
      therapy and unblocked blood vessel maintaining in the treatment of coronary in-stent
      restenosis by paclitaxel -eluting PTCA- balloon catheter (3μg/mm2 balloon surface area)
      versus paclitaxel-eluting stent Taxus® Liberte, and the reference diameter of coronary artery
      stenosis is 2.5mm-4.0mm and the length ≤30mm.
