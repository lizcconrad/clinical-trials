  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to examine the acute kinematics and kinetics of
      utilizing the Tibion Bionic Leg in a sample of chronic post-stroke patients performing
      sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers across a range of assistance and resistance settings
      (internal to the device); to compare these metrics to baseline performance without the Bionic
      Leg; and to determine the Bionic Leg settings that optimize a restorative (equal force
      distribution) movement state in these patients.

    <textblock>
      Comprehensive motion (kinetics and kinematics) data specific to sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit
      transfers with and without the Tibion Bionic Leg. The Vicon Motion Analysis System will be
      utilized to track movement using markers on the subject and the Bionic Leg per the UCSF Human
      Performance Center's routine. Once outfitted with the marker system, patients will be
      instructed to perform multiple sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers while data is
      gathered.

      The sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers will be performed using a standard chair, with a
      seat height not less than 12&quot; from the floor. The chair will be positioned such that, at
      sitting rest, each of the subject's feet are positioned on limb-specific force plates (left
      and right).
