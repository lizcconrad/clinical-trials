  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out if the diets often recommended for patients with
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) provide adequate relief. The study will
      compare two diets that are used to treat IBS-D symptoms to see which one is more effective.
      The study will also measure the effect of these diets on the bowel flora, which are the good
      bacteria that inhabit the bowels in healthy people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms are often refractory to conventional therapies,
      there has been increasing interest in the role of diet in IBS. Certain foods may exacerbate
      symptoms of IBS. Thus, restricted diets have recently gained attention for the treatment IBS.
      The mechanism by which symptoms are improved is unclear, but these diets may improve symptoms
      by exerting changes on the GI microbiome.

      Aims:

      Primary Objective:

      -Compare the proportion of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) reporting adequate
      relief on Diet 1 vs Diet 2

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Assess the effects of these diets in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS on the
           gastrointestinal microbiota and blood based biomarkers.

        -  Compare the efficacy of Diet 1 vs Diet 2 in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS on
           pre-specified clinical and quality of life endpoints.

      Methods:

      This is a prospective randomized control trial of adults meeting the Rome III criteria for
      irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D). After a 2 week screening period and
      randomization, during which the severity of symptoms will be assessed and eligibility
      determined, patients will be randomized to Diet 1 vs Diet 2 for a period of 4 weeks.

      The primary endpoint will be a comparison of the proportion of patients in each group
      reporting adequate relief of their IBS symptoms. For the secondary clinical outcomes, a
      responder definition incorporating abdominal pain and stool consistency as proposed by the
      FDA will be utilized. Key IBS-D symptoms will be assessed daily and adequate relief of IBS-D
      symptoms will be assessed weekly during the randomization period. We will also determine if a
      difference can be detected with high probability in the relative abundance and variety of
      specific bacterial taxa between the two groups before and after the 4 week dietary
      intervention. In addition, blood samples will be collected before and after randomization to
      measure relevant biomarkers of immune activation.

    <description>Composite endpoint: A responder will report a ≥30% reduction in mean daily abdominal pain score and a decrease in mean daily BSFS value of ≥1 compared to baseline for ≥2 of 4 treatment weeks. The proportion of responders between the 2 groups will be compared.</description>

    <description>An abdominal pain responder will report a ≥30% reduction in mean daily abdominal pain score compared to baseline for ≥2 of 4 treatment weeks. The proportion of responders between the two groups will be compared.

    <description>For stool consistency, a responder will be defined as one who reports a decrease in mean daily BSFS value of 1 or more compared to baseline for ≥2 of 4 treatment weeks. The proportion of responders between the 2 groups will be compared. Between group differences in the proportion of patients with a decrease in BSFS value of ≥1 compared to baseline at the end of each treatment week will also be assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of these 2 diets on the gut microbiome (number and species) in the context of IBS is not known. A change in the microbiota may be a mechanism through which symptom response is mediated.
We will be measuring the shift in the relative abundance (richness) and variety (diversity) of gut microbial taxa in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) in response to dietary intervention. Stool microbiome would be collected and analyzed using the PhyloChip™ Assay (Second Genome Inc., San Bruno, CA).</description>

    <description>Recent attempts have been made to identify a serological biomarker profile (Prometheus Therapeutics &amp; Diagnostics, San Diego, CA) which accurately identifies patients with IBS. We intend to perform a biomarker test panel at enrollment in all study subjects to assess whether specific combinations of biomarkers can positively or negatively predict response to either diet.</description>
