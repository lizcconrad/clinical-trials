      The purpose of this study is to further assess the safety and performance of Seal-V as an
      adjunct to standard surgical procedure for achieving hemostasis in patients undergoing
      peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries using synthetic grafts.

          -  Male or female of &gt;18 years of age

          -  Signed Informed Consent

          -  Patients requiring vascular reconstruction surgeries using synthetic (such as PTFE,
             Dacron) or autologous (such as native veins) grafts, including the following:

          -  Peripheral bypass surgeries, such as arterio-arterial bypasses [including:
             axillo-(bi)femoral, ilio-(bi)femoral, femoro-femoral, ilio-popliteal, femoro-popliteal
             (including below knee), femoro-tibial vessel bypass]

          -  Patients able and willing to complete all follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vascular surgery other than peripheral bypass surgeries and arteriovenous (AV)
             dialysis access shunt procedures as described above

          -  Reoperation at the same treatment site

          -  Known sensitivity to device materials, such as indigo carmine dye or alginate

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Systemic infection

          -  Participation in another clinical trial or treatment with any investigational agent in
             past 30 days

          -  Congenital coagulation disorders (e.g., thrombocytopenia [&lt;100,000 platelet count],
             thromboasthenia, hemophilia, or von Willebrand disease)

          -  Severe congenital or acquired immunodeficiency (e.g., HIV infection or long term
             treatment with immunosuppressive drugs)

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the operating field

        Intraoperative Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major intraoperative complications that require resuscitation or deviation from the
             planned surgical procedure

          -  Intraoperative change in planned surgical procedure that results in the patient no
             longer meeting preoperative inclusion and/or exclusion criteria

          -  Local infection at the operating field
