  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether the restriction of the non paretic upper limb (UL) is a factor that could
      interfere at the sensorimotor UL recovery for chronic stroke subjects and to verify the
      impact on daily function, quality of life. In this pilot, randomized, blind and allocation
      concealment clinical trial, nineteen individuals with chronic stroke was randomly assigned,
      after the first evaluation, into two groups: group without restriction (G1), subject only to
      the specific training of paretic UL, and restricted group (G2), which underwent specific
      training of paretic UL and use of the restriction of non paretic UL

    <measure>To investigate the impact that the restriction of non-paretic upper limb recovery would have on sensorimotor with Fugl-Meyer Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Upper extremity motor impairment was evaluated using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale (FM).This scale has a total score of 66 points for upper limbs, reflecting a mild motor impairment (≥ 50), moderate to severe (50-20) and severe (&lt; 20).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM consists of 18 items divided into 6 subscales measuring self-care, sphincter control, transfer, locomotion, communication, and social cognition ability. Each item is rated from 1 to 7 based on the required level of assistance to perform the basic ADL (maximum score, 126). Higher scores demonstrate greater independent participation in daily activities.</description>

The volunteers were evaluated before the beginning of the interventions, and the next day after completion of the 12 therapy sessions through the Fugl-Meyer Assessment</description>
