      The purpose of this study is to estimate the overall response rate of subjects with relapsed
      or refractory Adult T-cell Leukemia-Lymphoma (ATL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CCR4 expression in ATL patients has been demonstrated to be very high and has been associated
      with shorter survival compared with CCR4-negative patients. KW-0761, a monoclonal antibody
      targeted to CCR4, has been shown to be safe and tolerable in several clinical trials in
      subjects with a variety of T-cell malignancies, including ATL, mycosis fungoides and Sézary
      syndrome. The objective of this study is to estimate the overall response rate of KW-0761 for
      subjects with relapsed or refractory ATL.
