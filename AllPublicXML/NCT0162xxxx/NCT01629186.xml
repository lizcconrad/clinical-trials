      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of a novel cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
      technique—nasopharyngeal oxygenation with nose-close and abdomen-compression (NPO-NC-AC)—in
      small infants during flexible bronchoscopy (FB).

      METHODS: Infants with body weight (BW) &lt;5.0 kg and receiving nasal diagnostic or
      interventional FB (dFB, iFB) were enrolled. Under NPO (0.5 L/kg/min), when infant's heart
      rate (HR) &lt;80 beats/min or oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt;85% for more than 10 seconds, rescue
      NC-AC was initiated. It was performed by (1) increased NPO flow to 0.5-1.0 L/kg/min; (2) NC 1
      second for inspiration; and (3) AC 1 second for expiration with simultaneously released
      nostrils. Repeat doing steps (2) and (3) at a rate of 30 cycles/min until HR, SpO2, and blood
      pressure (BP) returned to normal. Cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored and analyzed.

    <description>During and after this FB procedure, vital signs are continually monitoring. When the heart rate (HR) &lt;80 beat/min (measured by continuouse wave and digit form of EKG monitor) and lasting &gt;10 seconds. Immediately rescued with rhythmic NC-AC. If the heart rate did not reach to its acceptable level (&gt;80 beat/min) within 2 minutes, then traditional CPR procedures involving bag-mask ventilation, ET intubation, Ambu bag ventilation or even chest compressions were substituted.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will continually monitoring by pulse oximeter for 2 days after the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>During FB procedure, vital signs are continually monitoring. When the oxygen saturation &lt;85% (or more than 10% below the original baseline in already cyanotic infant)by pulse oximeter and lasting &gt;10 seconds. Immediately rescued with rhythmic NC-AC. If the oxygen saturation did not reach to its acceptable level (&gt;85%) within 2 minutes, then traditional CPR procedures involving bag-mask ventilation, ET intubation, Ambu bag ventilation or even chest compressions were substituted.</description>

    <description>During and after the FB procedure, vital signs are continually monitoring. When the mean blood pressure &lt;50mmHg (measured by continuous non-invasive sphygmomanometer every 5 minutes and one hour, respectively) and lasting morethan one hour. Immediately rescued with rhythmic NC-AC. If the mean BP did not reach to its acceptable level (&gt;50mmHg) within 10 minutes, then traditional CPR procedures involving bag-mask ventilation, ET intubation, Ambu bag ventilation or even chest compressions were substituted.</description>

    <description>Cardiopulmonary parameters were measured and recorded at baseline, just before and at every minute during NC-AC, and at the end of the FB session. In infants who already had an arterial line, arterial blood gas (ABG) analyses were taken for study. Data was represented as mean ± SD. The results obtained from the baseline and different stages. The values were considered statistically significant only when p &lt; 0.05.
Technique failure was defined as: any vital signs of hypoxia did not return to accepted levels(HR&gt;100 beat/min, SpO2&gt;90%, mean BP&gt;50 mmHg)within 2 minutes of the experimental CPR technique. Then traditional CPR procedures involving bag-mask ventilation, endotracheal intubation, Ambu bag ventilation or even chest compressions were substituted.</description>
