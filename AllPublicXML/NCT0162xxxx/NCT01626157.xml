  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is present in the Cystic fibrosis (CF) airway from the time of infancy, and
      worsens with the onset of chronic infection. Therapies with proven benefit are associated
      with decreased airway inflammation. Thus, sensitive and reproducible biomarkers of airway
      inflammation have long been sought as a necessary component to improved clinical care and to
      facilitate therapeutic trials for CF. FEV1, the standard outcome measure in CF, is recognized
      as an insensitive outcome measure. the investigators have identified a panel of 10 genes
      which sensitively predict resolution of pulmonary inflammation, in response to therapy of an
      acute pulmonary exacerbation. With the goal of yielding a technically simple but unique CF
      biomarker assay, the investigators have tested whether proteins signified by these genes show
      large changes in expression following treatment of acute pulmonary exacerbations. Protein
      quantifications are among the most common measurements performed in clinical laboratories
      around the world. Based on preliminary findings that changes in white blood cell proteins
      mirror changes seen in the genes, the investigators propose to identify top candidate
      proteins, from the investigators gene panel, which change in response to exacerbation
      therapy. Once identified, these proteins will be quantified directly with a new blood test
      which is inexpensive and simple to perform. The investigators propose to validate this blood
      test in a single site trial. If successful, this proposal will yield a biomarker assay that
      will be available to validate in a multi-site trial and provide unique insights into
      mechanisms that regulate white blood cell activation and recruitment in CF lung disease.
