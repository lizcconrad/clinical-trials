      In the current study, the investigators propose to measure the five domains of social
      cognition identified by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) as relevant to
      individuals with psychosis (i.e., theory of mind, attribution style, emotion recognition,
      social perception, and social knowledge). The investigators will also explore the association
      between different domains of social cognition and outcomes relevant to psychotic disorder
      (e.g., symptomatology, social functioning, and vocational functioning).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that individuals with longstanding psychotic disorders suffer from
      deficits in social cognition (i.e., the cognitive skills needed to successfully navigate
      social interactions). However, to date, there have been few attempts to measure multiple
      components of social cognition within the same population of individuals with psychosis.
      Thus, the interrelationships between various aspects of social cognition remain unclear. In
      the current study, the investigators propose to measure the five domains of social cognition
      identified by NIMH as relevant to individuals with psychosis (i.e., theory of mind,
      attribution style, emotion recognition, social perception, and social knowledge). The
      investigators will also explore the association between different domains of social cognition
      and outcomes relevant to psychotic disorder (e.g., symptomatology, social functioning, and
      vocational functioning).
