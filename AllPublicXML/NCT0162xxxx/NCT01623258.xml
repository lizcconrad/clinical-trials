      The objective of this trial is to define the rate of upstaging of colon carcinoma lymph node
      metastasis with sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping.

      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the rate of lymph node metastasis between
      conventional histopathological processing of lymph nodes and SLN mapping with detailed
      pathologic examination using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in patients undergoing resection of
      colon carcinoma.

        Up to 150 male or female military healthcare beneficiaries over the age of 18 years

        diagnosis of biopsy-proven, primary, non-metastatic (Clinical Stage I,II or III) colon
        carcinoma will be enrolled. Subjects with colonic masses clinically consistent with colon
        cancer, and eventually confirmed by pathology, will also be enrolled.
