  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In Norway each year 130-150 children are born with heart disease that requires
      lifelong medical follow-up. Children with heart defects have reduced motor skills and reduced
      physical capacity compared with healthy peers. Increased knowledge in the children themselves
      and the general public, along with psychosocial interventions improve the child's ability to
      cope with the consequences of their disease. Descriptions of the experiences that Norwegian
      children with heart disease and their parents have about participation in rehabilitation
      programs is limited. Geilomo children's hospital has 75 years experience in rehabilitation of
      children with chronic illness, and started in 2005 to welcome children with heart disease. At
      present there is no rehabilitation institutions in Norway that has a special group programs
      for children with heart disease. Geilomo want to establish such a group for children aged 6-7
      years and 11-12 years.

      Main objective: The investigators will use of methods to learn more about the following:

      Study 1: The purpose is to generate knowledge about how children with heart disease and their
      relatives experience participation in a rehabilitation program at Geilomo children's
      hospital.

      Overarching question: How do children with heart disease and their guardians to participate
      in a rehabilitation program, and the impact of this on their daily life afterwards?

      Study 2: The purpose is to help a) to give the children an increased level of activity in the
      home environment.

      Question: Will children with heart disease increase their activity levels at home after a
      stay at Geilomo? 2b) for the children to improve their physical fitness. Question: Will
      children with heart disease have improved their physical condition three months after a stay
      at Geilomo?

      Work schedule: The project will have a duration of 3 years. The project will seek approval of
      the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics in May 2012. Interview Guide, information
      sheet and consent form has been prepared. Data collection for the study 2AB can start in
      March 2013. The first interviews will be conducted after 3 months, in June 2013. Data
      collection is expected to be completed in December 2013. The analysis will take place in
      parallel with the interview work. In 2014 and 2015 completed the writing of articles (3
      pieces) and publication of results.

      Method: In order to shed light on the problem in study 1, the investigators will use
      semi-structured interview. 16 children and 16 parents to be interviewed after 3 months. Study
      2a) To get information about their child's activity level in the home environment the
      investigators will use structured questionnaires. It is one form for children (36 persons)
      and another form for their parents (36 persons). Study 2b) All children (36 persons)
      conducting physical fitness test at the first visit and after three months. Children can be
      referred from across the country via the referral form. Dr. Henrik Holm (OUS) and Dr. Asle
      Hirth (HUS) determines participation according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Parents submit a written consent on behalf of themselves and their children.

      Scientific significance: This application describes two related studies, both of which are
      expected to provide important information that can provide better services for children with
      heart disease.
