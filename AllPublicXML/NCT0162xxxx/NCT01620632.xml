  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to collect data on the technical aspects of
      Lasparoscopy-assisted ERCP and patient outcomes to help guide future medical care of patients
      with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients would have had a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the past that had altered their gastric
      anatomy. Now they have developed bilary and/or pancreatic problems that require and ERCP.
      With their altered gastric anatomy a standard ERCP would not be possible. Thus they are
      scheduled for a Laparoscopy-assisted ERCP.
