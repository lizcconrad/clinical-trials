  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global loss of muscle mass and strength associated with aging is a cause of functional
      impairment and disability, particularly in the frail elderly. Respiratory function can be
      severely compromised if there is a decrease of respiratory (RM) strength complicated by the
      presence of comorbidities and physical immobility.

      Previous studies have shown that the specific RM training is an effective method to increase
      RM strength, both in healthy people and patients. In this case, specific RM training may be
      regarded as a beneficial alternative to improve RM function, and thus prevent physical and
      clinical deterioration in this population.

      The hypothesis is that specific RM training would improve RM strength and endurance in the
      experimental groups vs. control who do not participate in RM training.

      Institutionalized elderly people with an inability to walk were randomly allocated to a
      control group, a Threshold group or a Pranayama group. Both experimental groups performed a
      supervised RM training, five days a week for six consecutive weeks. The maximum inspiratory
      and expiratory pressures (MIP and MEP) and the maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) were
      assessed at four time points in each of three groups.

      Studies have shown that general aerobic exercise training is accompanied by significant
      respiratory physiological benefits, including gains in RM strength and endurance (Larson, et
      al., 1999; Sheel, 2002; Watsford, et al., 2005; Lacasse et al., 2006). This benefit appears
      to be greater when general exercise conditioning is combined with specific RM training
      (Weiner, et al., 1992; Wanke, et al., 1994; Larson, et al., 1999; Hill y Eastwood, 2005;
      O'Brien, et al., 2008). However, many frail elderly are not able to perform general aerobic
      exercise, related or not to ADL, as it is mentioned above (e.g., institutionalized elderly
      with comorbidities, functional impairment and RM weakness). In this case, specific RM
      training may be used as a beneficial alternative to maintain or improve RM function (Watsford
      and Murphy, 2008), and thus prevent deterioration in this functionally impaired elderly.

      The most commonly used techniques of specific RM training are: a) isocapnic hyperpnoea (Leith
      and Bradley, 1976; Belman and Mittman, 1980), b) respiratory resistive loading (Pardy, et
      al., 1981; Sonne and Davis, 1982; Belman, et al., 1986), and c) respiratory threshold loading
      (Clanton, et al., 1985; Chen, et al., 1985; Martyn, et al., 1987; Larson, et al., 1988).
      Apart from these three well-known techniques, other less studied types of exercise such as
      the controlled breathing exercises of Yoga, Pranayama, may also be added to this list
      (Kulpati, et al., 1982; Manocha, et al., 2002; Donesky-Cueco, et al., 2009).

    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline (time zero) and at the end of the training protocol (week 7).</time_frame>
    <description>MIP is probably the most frequently reported noninvasive estimates of inspiratory muscle strength. Ever since Black and Hyatt (1969) reported this technique it has been widely used in patients, healthy control subjects across all ages, and athletes. Pressure is recorded at the mouth during a quasi-static short (few seconds) maximal inspiration. The manoeuvre is generally performed at Residual Volume (RV).

Ever since Black and Hyatt (1969) reported this technique it has been widely used in patients, healthy control subjects across all ages, and athletes.

    <time_frame>The groups were assessed at baseline (time zero) and at the end of the training protocol (week 7).</time_frame>
    <description>This ventilatory test is a non-invasive technique and is a measure of both inspiratory and expiratory muscle endurance. The MVV is the largest volume that can be breathed in and out of the lungs during a 12 -15 second interval with maximal voluntary effort.
