  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late-life depression is associated with physical limitations, greater functional impairment,
      increased utilization and cost of health care, and suicide. Collaborative care, linking
      primary and mental health specialty care, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of
      late-life depression in primary care settings in Western countries. The primary aim of this
      project is to implement a depression care management intervention, and examine its
      effectiveness on the depressive symptoms of older patients in Korean primary care settings.
      Based on chronic disease management theory and previous Collaborative care management studies
      in western countries, we propose to test a Depression Care Management intervention,which
      includes care manager to support a primary care physician of depression in their old
      patients. Care manager'd role are monitoring the progress of treatment, supporting patient's
      adherence, educating patients/ family and facilitate communication between providers. Also
      psychiatrists provide consultation and supervision of care managers. Using a randomized
      controlled design, we will examine whether the Depression care management is an effective
      treatment for patients with late life depression in rural Korea. The primary outcome would be
      the improvement of depressive symptoms of patients in primary care setting.
