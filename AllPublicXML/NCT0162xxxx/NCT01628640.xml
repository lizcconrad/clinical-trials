      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant vesicular stomatitis
      virus expressing interferon beta in treating patients with liver cancer or solid tumors with
      lesions that have spread to other parts of the body and do not respond to treatment. The
      study virus has a gene inserted into it which will allow production of interferon beta, which
      is a substance that will restrict the spread of the virus to tumor cells and not healthy
      cells. It will also have some independent anti-cancer activity. Although the primary goal of
      this study is to evaluate the safety of delivery of this viral agent to people, patients may
      benefit clinically by having shrinkage or stabilization of their tumor or reduction in their
      cancer related symptoms (e.g., pain). Funding Source - FDA OOPD.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of recombinant vesicular stomatitis
      virus-expressing interferon-beta (VSV-IFN-beta) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) refractory or intolerant to sorafenib therapy and patients with advanced solid tumors
      with liver predominant locally advanced/metastatic treatment refractory disease. (Arm A) II.
      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VSV-IFN-beta in patients with advanced solid
      tumors with subcutaneous/cutaneous lesions. (Arm B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the tumor response rate, injected lesion (TNi) and distant lesion (TNd)
      necrosis rate (with TNi and TNd response defined as &gt;= 30% increase in necrosis from
      baseline) and overall survival. (Arm A)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VSV-IFN-beta in patients with HCC by or
      advanced solid tumors with liver predominant disease or subcutaneous/cutaneous lesions by
      measurement of VSV-IFN-beta in blood by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
      (RT-PCR).

      II. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFN-beta by way of measuring serum
      interferon-beta and also VSV-RT-PCR of VSV-IFN-beta listed above.

      III. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-hIFN-beta specific) and natural killer (NK)
      cell responses.

      IV. Assess status of human interferon beta pathway pre/post therapy in tumor/normal liver
      tissue (status of IFN-beta, interferon stimulated gene factor 3 [ISGF3 complex constituting
      signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/2 and p48 (ISGF3 gamma)]).

      V. Assess phosphorylation of STAT1/2 post-therapy. VI. Evaluate transcription of interferon
      mediated genes (protein kinase R, the death receptor-tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-related
      apoptosis-inducing ligand [TRAIL], 2'-5' oligoadenylate/ribonucleic acid [RNA]se L proteins,
      heat shock proteins [Hsp 60/70/90], major histocompatibility class antigens and interferon
      regulatory factor [IRF]-7).

      VII. Assess presence of VSV in tumor/normal liver subsequent to administration of VSV-human
      IFN-beta (hIFN- beta).

      VIII. For HCC patients only, assess preliminary relationships between hepatitis C genotype
      (in those patients that are hepatitis C positive) and any evidence of anti-tumor efficacy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or advanced solid tumor with liver lesions
      receive recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing interferon beta intratumorally in a
      single tumor location on day 1.

      ARM B: Patients with advanced solid tumor with subcutaneous/cutaneous lesions receive
      recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing interferon beta intratumorally in up to 5
      lesions on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 weeks for 3 years.
