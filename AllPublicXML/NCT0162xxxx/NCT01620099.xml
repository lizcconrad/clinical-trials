  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is an inflammatory disease affecting the whole respiratory system, from central to
      peripheral airways. Anti-inflammatory treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with or
      without long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA), is the cornerstone of asthma management
      [GINA Guideline - available at www.ginasthma.com]. Nevertheless, a considerable subset of
      asthmatic patients neither benefits from ICS nor gain optimal asthma control even with
      ICS/LABA combinations.

      The involvement of the distal lung, i.e. the peripheral membranous bronchioles &lt; 2 mm in
      diameter (so-called small airways), in the pathogenesis of asthma has been extensively
      investigated and its significance debated. However, whether specifically targeting distal
      lung abnormalities can lead to further clinical benefit is still an open question. In this
      context, interest has been raised by hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) pressurised metered-dose
      inhalers, which can deliver compounds with a mass median aerodynamic diameter that is
      significantly smaller than other available devices, leading to increase peripheral airways
      drug deposition.

      Up to 30% of asthmatic patients smoke, mirroring the rate found in the general population.
      Several data document that smoking habit negatively affect corticosteroid efficacy in asthma.
      In particular, asthmatic patients who smoke experience faster lung function decline,
      increased frequency of exacerbations and reduced asthma control despite being regularly
      treated. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to address the issue of reduced
      corticosteroids responsiveness in smoker patients. However it has been never investigated
      whether reduced corticosteroid responsiveness in asthmatic patients who smoke can be related
      to more severe small airways involvement leading to impaired distribution or impaired
      peripheral deposition of inhaled corticosteroids. If this is the case, asthmatic patients who
      smoke might benefit from a pharmacological approach able to target and to reach small
      airways.
