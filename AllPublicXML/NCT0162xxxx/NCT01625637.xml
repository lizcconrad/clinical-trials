  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part study. In Study 2, smokers who want to quit smoking will participate in a
      4 week smoking cessation program combining weekly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with
      weekly regular-AAT or placebo-AAT training. We hypothesize that adolescent smokers will
      exhibit stronger approach tendencies towards smoking-related stimuli in the tobacco Approach
      Avoidance Training (AAT) task when compared with nonsmokers and that adolescent smokers who
      are trained to avoid smoking related stimuli using the AAT will avoid tobacco approach
      tendencies in the AAT test trials and the Implicit Association Task, when compared to
      adolescent smokers who are not exposed to AAT training. We also hypothesize that adolescent
      smokers who are trained to avoid tobacco in a training AAT in combination with CBT will have
      better abstinence rates compared to those who receive placebo AAT training with CBT.
