  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An effective vaccine against malaria is urgently needed to combat the scourge of this
      disease. Before candidate vaccines can be tested in endemic countries, they are first tested
      in human volunteers in so-called Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI's). Ideally, a
      candidate vaccine should be tested against multiple strains of malaria, representative of the
      disease's global distribution. To date, however, only one such strain (NF54) has been broadly
      used in CHMI's.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the course of infections with 2 novel malaria strains
      to those with NF54 in human volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria remains responsible for an intolerable burden of morbidity
      worldwide and an effective vaccine is sorely needed to aid control efforts. Before candidate
      malaria vaccines can enter full-scale (phase IIb) field trials in endemic areas, they must
      first be tested under controlled circumstances in (phase IIa) clinical human malaria
      infection studies. Since Pf isolates display a wide genetic diversity across the globe, phase
      IIa challenge infections should be conducted with both homologous and heterologous strains.

      Since 1998 a highly successful Controlled Human Malaria Infection model at the UMC St
      Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, has been employed both to test candidate vaccines and to
      answer fundamental questions about pathophysiological and immunological mechanisms during
      early Pf infection in human volunteers. To date largely the NF54 strain of P. falciparum has
      been used in this Nijmegen model, with which extensive experience has meanwhile been
      acquired. In order to increase the portfolio of Pf strains available for future phase IIa
      studies, it is first necessary to document in detail the parasitological, clinical and
      immunological characteristics of new candidate strains during a controlled human malaria
      infection. In this study, the strains NF135 and NF166 will be compared in this regard with
      the well-characterised NF54 strain.
