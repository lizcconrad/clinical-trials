      What is the intensity of F-PET uptake in healthy and osteo arthritic femur and acetabulum,
      compared to the uptake adjacent to four analyzed endoprosthetic components 1½ and 6 months
      after surgery?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A clinical study of 26 patients, age 50-69 years, healthy unless osteoarthritis in one hip,
      randomized in four groups plus a reference group of same 26 patient´s contralateral healthy
      hip.

      Intervention will be surgery with a total hip arthroplasty. The studied endoprosthetic
      components are: Cemented Lubinus SP II stem with a ceramic 32 mm head, a cemented Lubinus
      cross linked cup (Waldemar Link, Hamburg, Germany). Palacose cement with gentamycin, applied
      with 3:rd generation cementation technique will be used for those cemented implants.

      Uncemented HA-coated Corail stem with a ceramic 32 mm head (DePuy, Johnson &amp; Johnson, USA), a
      fibrous metal Regenerex RingLoc cup (Biomet, Warsaw, Il, USA) All cups will have cross linked
      Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHWMP).

      Clinical score, radiography and PET uptake of Fluoride tracer (SUV) adjacent to the
      prosthetic surfaces will be analyzed.
