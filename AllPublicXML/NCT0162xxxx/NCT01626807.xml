  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Just two generations ago, walking or bicycling to school was the norm for a substantial
      number of US children, e.g. 48% of children walked or biked to school in 1969 versus only 13%
      in 2009. This decline occurred in the same timeframe as the childhood obesity epidemic, which
      is at record high levels in the US and affects low-income and ethnic minority children the
      most. This project will test &quot;the walking school bus&quot; (WSB) program, in which children walk
      to and from school with adults, and its impact on low-income, ethnic minority children's
      walking to school, physical activity, and risk for obesity. Ultimately, this line of research
      has the potential to provide a low-cost, easy to disseminate program to reduce risk of
      obesity and cancer for at-risk children.

      The investigators Specific Aims among 3rd-5th grade children include:

      SA1) To recruit 770 child-parent dyads from 22 elementary schools over 4 years and conduct a
      cluster randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a WSB program on children's
      walking to school, physical activity, and BMI z-score over a school-year SA2) To collect and
      analyze data on individual-, school-, and macro-level influences on changes to children's
      walking to school resulting from the WSB program

      The Primary Hypotheses to be tested, in comparison to control children, include:

      H1) The WSB program will increase children's walking to school over a school-year.

      H1a) Parents' outcome expectations and self-efficacy will mediate the relationship between
      the WSB and changes to children's walking to school.

      H1b) Walkability, safety, and acculturation will moderate changes to children's walking to
      school.

      H2) The WSB program will increase children's physical activity and decrease BMI z-scores over
      a school-year.

      H3) The WSB program will increase school-level pedestrian safety behaviors over a
      school-year.
