  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine the biologic causes of inflammation in patients with Transverse
      Myelitis (TM) Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) and related conditions. While
      patients will be treated according to decisions with their treating physician, this study
      will collect data and samples from patients prospectively to gain a better understanding of
      the disease. We are seeking to understand why some patients respond to medications, while
      others do not. We also seek to understand what happens biologically, preceding relapses.
      Gathering these data and samples will allow researchers to identify new ways of diagnosing
      and treating these diseases. Data and samples will be shared with researchers around the
      world to support collaborative efforts to treat these conditions.

      This study seeks to determine the biologic causes of inflammation in patients with
      Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO), Transverse Myelitis (TM), optic neuritis (ON), related conditions
      and healthy controls. While patients will be treated according to decisions with their
      treating physician, this study will collect data and samples from patients prospectively to
      gain a better understanding of the disease. We are seeking to understand why some patients
      respond to medications, while others do not. We also seek to understand what happens
      biologically, preceding relapses. Gathering these data and samples will allow researchers to
      identify new ways of diagnosing and treating these diseases. Data and samples will be shared
      with researchers around the world to support collaborative efforts to treat these conditions.

      Patients will agree to share medical records, complete questionnaires and donate samples on a
      timed basis.
