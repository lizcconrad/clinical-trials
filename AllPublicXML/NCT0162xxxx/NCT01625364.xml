      The purpose was to evaluate effectiveness and impact of an academic and counseling asthma
      health education program (SHARP) for fourth- and fifth-grade students diagnosed with asthma.
      Students attending schools randomized to the low-dose control condition received Open Airways
      for Schools (OAS). The first aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of SHARP, compared to the
      low-dose group, for students on cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of asthma
      management at 1, 12, and 24 months post-intervention. We hypothesized that compared to
      students enrolled in elementary schools who received the low-dose program, students in
      elementary schools that received SHARP would increase asthma knowledge (cognition) and
      logical reasoning abilities for managing acute episodes (cognition), acceptance of asthma as
      a chronic condition (psychosocial), and use of effective asthma health behaviors (behavior).
      The second aim was to evaluate the long-term impact of SHARP, compared to the low-dose group,
      for students on condition characteristics, use of healthcare services, and quality of life at
      12 and 24 months post intervention. We hypothesized that compared to students enrolled in
      elementary schools who received the low-dose program; students in elementary schools who
      received SHARP would decrease asthma severity, use of healthcare services, and school
      absenteeism due to asthma, and increase participation in life activities (quality of life).

      Over 7 million US children younger than age 18 years are currently diagnosed with asthma, and
      approximately 4 million children experience exacerbation of asthma symptoms annually. The NIH
      National Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma specify that part of a
      successful management program includes educating students with asthma and their caregivers
      about the condition. The guidelines recommend expanding education of students and families to
      schools and community settings. An academic and counseling program was developed for older
      school-age students with asthma and their family caregivers titled Staying Healthy-Asthma
      Responsible &amp; Preparedâ„¢ (SHARP). A two-group prospective randomized single-blinded design was
      used. The sample consisted of two cohorts of students diagnosed aged 9-12 years with asthma
      and their caregivers from varying socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. Cohort dyads
      were drawn from 23 elementary schools that were located in a diverse, moderately sized,
      medically underserved, inner-city community. The schools were matched based on projected
      enrollment numbers, standardized reading and math scores, free/reduced lunch eligibility, and
      racial/ethnic proportions prior to randomization. Recently retired certified elementary
      schoolteachers, identified by the district, were trained to serve as interveners to deliver
      both programs in the schools during instructional time.
