  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humans attain binocular vision from the two retinal images of both eyes through a series of
      sensory and motor processes that culminate in the perception of stereoscopic depth. Looking
      at a scene creates two slightly different images on the retinas which is due to the eyes'
      different positions on the head. This so called binocular disparity provides information to
      calculate depth and therefore enables stereopsis. Physiologically the two retinal images are
      superimposed and merge into one stereoscopic image.

      If one image is presented to one eye in an experimental setting, and a completely different
      image is presented to the other eye, the investigators visual system, analogous to diplopic
      vision, is not able to fuse these image stimuli. Instead, a phenomenon called binocular
      rivalry occurs. Here, both images are seen alternating and the brain can switch back and
      forth between these images.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of objective changes to image
      quality on the investigators subjective stereoscopic perception. This psychophysiological
      testing is done by looking at different images and thereafter by subjective grading of the
      image quality.

      The investigators hypothesize that overlapping image modifications occurring in both eyes are
      detected immediately, but changes, that are rotated by 90 degrees against each other, should
      be suppressed and result in one stereoscopic image, reduced in image quality. Whether this
      also accounts for more detailed images, such as reading cards, is questionable.
