      metastatic or postoperative persistent medullary thyroid cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a neuroendocrine tumor originating from thyroid C cells.
      Neuroendocrine tumors have been demonstrated to express somatostatin receptors as well as
      mTOR pathway. The somatostatin analogues now available (octreotide and lanreotide) act
      preferentially through the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst2). In MTC, these compounds
      have been reported to exert anti-secretive effects on calcitonin but no anti-proliferative
      effects.SOM230 (pasireotide) is a new somatostatin analogue showing a peculiar binding
      profile with high affinity for sst1, sst2, sst3, sst5. Preliminary data show SOM230 to be
      effective in a phase II study on patients with metastatic carcinoid. RAD001 (everolimus) is a
      novel agent that interacts with mTOR. It was demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in
      neuroendocrine tumor cell lines. Some clinical trials have explored the efficacy of a
      combined therapy with RAD001 plus octreotide in patients with digestive neuroendocrine
      tumors, highlighting encouraging results in term of tumor control.In particular, octreotide
      and RAD001 seem to show a synergistic activity in inhibiting neuroendocrine tumor
      proliferation.

    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of start therapy until the end of the study, every 30 days, up to 6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be evaluated using assessment of adverse events and laboratory data. The assessment of safety will be based on the frequency of adverse events and on the number of laboratory values that are new or worsening based on the common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade. Other safety data (e.g. vital signs) will be considered appropriately.</description>
