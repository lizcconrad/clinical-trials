      Title: Evaluating New Radiation Techniques for Cardiovascular Imaging

      Background:

      - Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) scans involve the use of radiation to
      create the pictures. Heart and blood vessel CT scans can cause high radiation exposure.
      Different methods of creating CT pictures have been developed to reduce the radiation dose.
      Researchers want to see how effective these new methods are in producing accurate CT scans.

      Objectives:

      - To study new ways of taking pictures of the heart or blood vessels using computed
      tomography.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults at least 18 years of age who will be having imaging studies to help detect heart or
      blood vessel problems.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples
           will be taken to check kidney function.

        -  Participants will have a CT scan of the heart and blood vessels. A contrast agent may be
           used to improve the quality of the images. The scanning session may last up to 2 hours.

        -  Participants will have follow-up contact 90 days after the scan, and then yearly contact
           for the next 5 years.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac CT angiography is associated with radiation exposure. Different methods of creating
      CT pictures have been developed to reduce the radiation dose to the subject. The purpose of
      this research study is to learn whether these new imaging methods are accurate or predict
      subject outcomes.

        Participants will be enrolled at the NIH Clinical Center where a total of 3000 subjects
        will be enrolled. Subjects will be recruited from clinical cardiac CT referrals which
        generally follow published guidelines6 for appropriate use ofcardiac CT; however, these
        guidelines only define the most common clinical scenarios and individuals which do not fit
        the guidelines may have a clinical indication based on the referring physician s medical
        judgment. Enrolled@@@subjects must be able to travel to the NIH for study visits.

             (age)-0.203 x 0.742 (if the subject is female) or x 1.212 (if the subject is black)
