  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with breast cancer and lymphoma often experience many short and long-term side effects
      as a result of both the cancer and the necessary treatments.

      Receiving extra assessments and care from teams of multiple health professionals has been
      shown to be helpful for people with other health problems, such as heart disease. These
      'multidisciplinary' teams may include nurses, doctors, pharmacists, dietitians, exercise
      therapists, counselors, and other specialists. Currently, the investigators do not know if
      receiving extra assessments from a multidisciplinary team is helpful for people receiving
      cancer treatment.

      In this study, the investigators hope to learn the effect of extra assessments and early
      interventions from teams of health care professionals in people diagnosed with cancer, during
      and after the treatment period.

      After initial assessments, participants will be randomized to multidisciplinary team
      intervention or usual care.
