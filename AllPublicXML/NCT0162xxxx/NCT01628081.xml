    <description>Target lesions will be evaluated for 3 components: erythema, induration, and scaling. Each component will be given a score using the following scale: 0=none, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked. The Target Lesion Severity (TLS) score is calculated as a sum of the 3 components.</description>
