  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an on-screen prompt put on the work
      computer every 30 minutes is effective in getting office workers to reduce prolonged periods
      of sitting at work.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prolonged bouts of uninterrupted time spent sitting is associated with indicators of poor
      health, independent of how physically active a person is. Many occupations are now sedentary,
      and are characterised by long periods spent sitting at a desk. Brief education on the
      benefits of standing regularly and breaking up prolonged sitting will be provided to
      participants, working at a Scottish University. One intervention group will additionally have
      software installed on their work computer which placed a prompt window in the centre of their
      screen for 1 minute every 30 minutes. The prompt will remind participants to stand-up and
      take a break, and the window cannot be removed or minimised.

A prompt with the message &quot;stand up, take a break&quot; is placed on the screen of the work computer for 1 minutes every 30 minutes, from the time the computer is switched on in the morning. The prompt is contained in a window 11x9 cm in the centre of the screen. The prompt cannot be removed or minimised, but work can continue in any windows visible around the prompt. The prompt is on the computer for 5 days.</description>
