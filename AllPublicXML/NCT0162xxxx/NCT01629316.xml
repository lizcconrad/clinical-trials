      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine if a comprehensive intervention supporting
      seek-test-and-treat results in a significant reduction in the potential for HIV-infected
      prisoners to transmit their virus after release from prison.

      Aim 2: Compare the effect of standard prison test-and-treat (sTNT) with the TNT-imPACT
      (imPACT) intervention on viral load 24 weeks following prison release.

      Aim 3: Describe and model secondary outcomes, comparing them between sTNT and TNT-imPACT
      study arms. These outcomes include post-release HIV transmission risk behaviors, incident
      STIs, adherence to ART, medical care appointments, emergence of ART resistance mutations, and
      predicted HIV transmission events.

      For Aims 2 and 3:

      Participants:

      We will enroll 400 HIV-infected men and women, age 18 years and older who are incarcerated in
      the NC Department of Correction (NCDOC) or the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ)
      and scheduled for prison release in approximately 12 weeks, who are receiving ART and have an
      HIV RNA level that is below 400 copies/mL.

      Procedures (methods): Participants will be consented, enrolled, and then randomized 1:1 to
      one of two conditions:

        1. standard test-and-treat (sTNT), which is the current standard of care, wherein following
           HIV testing, the DOC provides to HIV-infected inmates ART during incarceration and
           referral to community-based care and services by prison staff as well as a supply of
           antiretroviral medication (30 days in NC, 10 in TX) upon release, or

        2. TNT-imPACT (imPACT),which includes the sTNT plus our integrated, multi-component
           intervention targeting multiple levels to enhance adherence to HIV therapy and linkage
           to and engagement in clinical care, to maintain viral suppression after release.

      All participants will be followed for up to 24 weeks post-release.

          -  Documented HIV infection

          -  Incarcerated in the NCDOC at a facility within a 3 hour drive from Chapel Hill OR

          -  For NC - planning to remain in state after release and returning to a community within
             a 3 hour drive of Chapel Hill

          -  For TX - returning to one of the following areas: Houston, Dallas, and Ft. Worth
             (including their suburbs)

          -  Scheduled for release from prison

             for injury to staff (this criterion is designed to minimize risk to study personnel
             who will conduct study-related visits with participants in the communities to which
             they return and may be informed by input from correctional staff)

          -  Pending charges that would likely lead to transfer of custody or other condition which
             would otherwise prevent or significantly delay release from custody.
