    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be one of the most pressing problems facing all countries around
      the world as the population ages.AD is a slowly evolving process that likes begins years to
      decades before the clinical symptoms area manifest. However, as one would like to identify
      the disease process at an earlier point in the clinical continuum, the precision of the
      diagnosis is reduced. Therefore, the challenge is to try to identify the process at the
      pre-dementia stage and enhance the specificity of the clinical diagnosis through the use of
      imaging and other biomarkers. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents an attempt to
      characterize subjects at an early clinical phase of AD and subjects with MCI have been a
      target for prevention trials. There are two pathological landmarks, in terms of
      extra-cellular senile plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Although present
      symptomatic treatments provide some benefit to patients with AD, they are not the solution
      for AD. Up to date, there are still no therapies can alter the underlying nature of the AD
      process. Therefore, the earlier the intervention takes place, presumably, the greater the
      protection against further neuronal damage will be appreciated.The Alzheimer's Disease
      Neuroimaging Initiate (ADNI) is a consortium of universities and medical centers in the
      United States and Canada established to develop standardized imaging techniques and
      biomarkers procedures in normal subjects, subjects with MCI and subjects with mild AD. ADNI
      has been a groundbreaking project, establishing pre-competitive collaboration and real-time
      data sharing among academia and industry investigators to clarify the relationships among
      demographic, genetic, clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging and biochemical measures throughout
      the course of AD neurobiology, in order to facilitate the development of effective
      therapeutics.This project has exceeded expectations, providing insights into disease
      mechanisms as well as hugely valuable advances, based primarily on the use of standardized
      biomarkers, to drug development programs. A number of the leading disease-modifying drug
      development programs are now employing ADNI methodology toward more efficient trial design,
      particularly in the critically important early (pre-dementia) AD population
