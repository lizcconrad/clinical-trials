      This study is being conducted to evaluate the hypothesis that study subjects will be more
      responsive to follow-up phone calls made from personal cell phone numbers than from hospital
      landline numbers. To evaluate this, study subjects previously enrolled in a cardiac biomarker
      study (the Early Identification of Acute Coronary Syndrome study) were randomized to receive
      their follow-up phone calls (the calls associated with the Early ID study occur at 30 days
      and 1 year after initial enrollment) from either a hospital office landline or from the
      personal cell phones of the research assistants making these calls. This was done as a 1:1
      randomization. The number of call attempts required to reach the study subjects were recorded
      as the calls were made and the date of successful follow-up was recorded once contact was
      made.
