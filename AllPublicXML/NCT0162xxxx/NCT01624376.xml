    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of locally
      administered DLX105 in treating enterocutaneous fistulas in Crohn's Disease patients.

      The study will consist of a screening period of approx. 2 weeks, a 4-week treatment period
      and a 2-week follow-up period. An end-of study visit is scheduled on Day 43, 2 weeks after
      the last study visit.

      Beside investigation of the safety and tolerability of locally administered DLX105, the
      purpose of the study is also to evaluate the response rate and time to response of
      enterocutaneous fistulas following local injection of DLX105 (secondary objective).
