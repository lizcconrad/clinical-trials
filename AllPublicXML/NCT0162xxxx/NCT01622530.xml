  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amputees often choose not to wear prostheses due to marginal performance or may settle for a
      prosthesis that offers only cosmetic improvement, but lacks function. A simulation tool
      consisting of a robotics-based human body model (RHBM) to predict functional motions, and
      integrated modules for aid in prescription, training, comparative study, and determination of
      design parameters of upper extremity prostheses will be developed.

      The main objective of collecting and analyzing human movement during several common tasks is
      to optimize and validate the robotics based human model. The range of motion data of subjects
      performing activities of daily living such as opening a door, turning a wheel, grooming,
      eating, bilateral lifting, as well as recreational and sport activities such as swinging a
      baseball bat, and golf club will be analyzed. This motion analysis data will also be used to
      compare data between four groups: a control group (n=10), a braced group simulating
      prosthesis use (n=10), a group wearing a transradial prosthesis (n=10) and a group wearing a
      transhumeral prosthesis (n =10).

      Data will be collected by an 8 camera ViconÂ© motion analysis system during one 3-4 hour
      testing period. Forty-five reflective markers will be attached to subjects skin and clothing
      via a double sided adhesive electrode collar. The cameras work on an infrared spectrum and
      the markers are passive reflective spheres. Relations between marker positions and anatomical
      / known positions on the body are used to calculate the positions of body segments.This
      analysis will provide information on movement strategies, compensatory motion, and socket
      movement associated with the selected tasks for transradial and transhumeral prostheses.
      Differences in the range of motion of the prostheses users and control subjects will be
      calculated to determine compensatory motion. The movement of the prosthesis's socket as a
      function of task and other factors will also be measured. Measured data will be used to
      minimize error in the simulation of the upper body movement. Knowledge of human motor
      function given in the recorded data can be extended to give insight to movement parameters
      when designing new prosthetics. Simulations will be optimized to the collected data using a
      regressive best fit method.

        Two groups will be studied: non-amputees and upper limb amputees. The subjects will be
        recruited from around the community.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects will be capable of providing an informed consent.

          -  Normal healthy adult subjects and upper limb amputees that currently use a prosthesis
             to complete activities of daily living will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects younger than 18 or older than 65 will be excluded.

          -  Adults that are unable to consent will be excluded from the study.

          -  Subjects that have health issues or injuries that would prevent them from lifting five
             pounds or completing simple tasks of daily living will be excluded from the study.

          -  Subjects will be asked if they are able to lift five pounds, open a door and drink
             from a cup without pain or injury. Before study set up and recording begins, subjects
             will be asked to practice these tasks to insure that they are capable of completing
             them.

          -  Pregnant women will be excluded from this study due to the changes in some physical
             abilities during pregnancy.
