  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is also a major risk factor for development of dementia later in life.
      Findings from our studies suggest that the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin may be
      important in cognitive function in the elderly. The investigators have previously reported
      eggs to be a highly bioavailable source of lutein and zeaxanthin. Our study evaluates
      long-term egg intervention as a treatment strategy for age-related cognitive impairment which
      could possibly prevent the onset of dementia. The investigators have also shown that lutein
      supplementation significantly improved verbal fluency scores in healthy older women. Our
      studies have shown that egg interventions can significantly increase serum lutein
      concentrations in older adults. Based on the sum of our findings, the next logical step will
      be to investigate the ability of lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs to influence
      cognitive function in older adults. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a
      significant increase in cognitive function measures in older adults provided with meals
      containing 2 egg/day at the end of 6 months, while no significant improvements will be
      observed in older adults given daily meals containing egg substitute.

      The proposed study is designed as a randomized, placebo controlled trial that tests the
      effects of 6 month supplementation with 2 eggs/day on cognitive function in older adults.
      Secondary analyses will determine whether baseline MP density predicts relative effectiveness
      of the intervention on cognitive function. Secondary outcomes include plasma biomarkers of
      oxidative stress and inflammation.

      The study is designed as a placebo controlled trial that tests the effects of 6 month
      supplementation with 2 eggs or 4 ounces of egg substitute a day on cognitive function in
      older adults. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Secondary analyses
      will determine whether baseline macular pigment density (a non invasive measure of lutein and
      zeaxanthin in neural tissue) or choline status predicts relative effectiveness of the
      intervention on cognitive function. Secondary outcomes include plasma biomarkers of oxidative
      stress and inflammation, choline bioavailability, and genetic variants related to endogenous
      choline production. Participants will be recruited from community-dwelling men and women aged
      &gt; 50 yr, and potential participants will be screened to meet cognitive and functional
      criteria. Participants will be pre-screened by telephone; those who appear to meet criteria
      will undergo further screening. The study will include baseline (0 month), 3 and 6 month
      visits for study procedures, and monthly telephone calls. Given that there is a visible
      difference between the two interventions (eggs, egg substitute), a blinded study is not
      possible.
