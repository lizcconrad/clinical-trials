    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to collect clinical data to support an FDA
      510(k) submission for the Nidek Non Contact Tono/ Pachymeter NT-530P. The secondary objective
      is to evaluate any adverse events found during the clinical study.

      Following data analysis will be conducted for tonometer and pachymeter readings. One of eyes
      of one patient becomes an object of the analysis. Regarding the intraocular pressure, higher
      IOP readings of either right or left eye are used for analysis. Regarding CCT, the readings
      of either right or left eye are randomly assigned to analysis in the order of registration.
