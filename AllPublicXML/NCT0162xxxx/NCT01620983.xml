  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing knee replacement surgery and who have high levels of pain catastrophizing
      are at risk for poor outcome. The clinical trial is designed to determine if a pain coping
      skills training intervention delivered by physical therapists and supervised by psychologists
      is more effective at reducing pain and improving function and is more cost effective than
      arthritis education or usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 25% of patients following knee arthroplasty have disabling pain following
      apparently successful surgery. Recent research suggests that pain catastrophizing plays a key
      role in determining which patients with knee arthroplasty have a poor outcome. In addition to
      this evidence, a substantial literature suggests that pain coping skills training is
      effective for patients with chronic pain but the intervention has not been studied for
      surgical patients with severe arthritic knee pain. We designed the Knee Arthroplasty pain
      coping Skills Training (KASTPain) trial to address this research need. This Phase III
      three-arm randomized clinical trial seeks to combine a strong and diverse group of
      researchers to examine an important and understudied area in the joint arthroplasty
      literature. The KASTPain trial will be the first to examine the utility of a perioperative
      pain coping intervention for this substantial population of patients.
