      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of MK-1029 on lung function in the
      treatment of adults who have persistent asthma that is uncontrolled with the use of
      montelukast (ML). Participants will use randomized study drug (either MK-1029 or placebo) for
      two separate 4-week treatment periods. All participants will also use ML during the treatment
      periods.
