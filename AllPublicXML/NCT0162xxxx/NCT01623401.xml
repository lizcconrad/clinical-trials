      This is a Phase 1 open-label study in healthy volunteers who will receive oral 200 mg TR 701
      FA once daily for 10 days (Days 1 through 10) and undergo safety evaluations including
      ophthalmologic and neurologic assessments before (Screening or Day -1), 1 day after final
      study drug administration (Day 11 or earlier if a subject discontinues treatment), and 2 to 4
      weeks after the last study drug administration (Late Follow-up Visit).

    <description>The primary objective is to determine the safety of oral 200 mg TR-701 free acid (FA) administered once daily for 10 days in healthy adults. Safety outcome measures include the number and proportion of participants with adverse events, changes in vital signs and ECG, and evaluation of physical examination changes including neurologic and ophthalmologic exams.</description>
