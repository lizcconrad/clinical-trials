      Dose escalation study with a dose expansion phase, to evaluate safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of two dose levels of BKM120 when administered
      orally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm study, with a starting dose of BKM120 at 80mg/day. Two dose levels:
      80mg/day and 100mg /day will be tested in the dose escalation phase. At least 3 patients will
      be enrolled at each dose level and at least 6 evaluable patients required to be treated at
      the recommended Phase II dose(RP2D)/MTD dose. After dose escalation the 80mg/day and the
      100mg /day dose levels will be expanded to evaluate up to approximately a total of 15
      patients each (if 100mg is determined as the RP2D/MTD).

    <time_frame>During Cycle 1 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) for dose escalation with overdose control will guide the dose escalation. The recommended dose is the one with the highest posterior probablity of DLT in the target interval(16%,33%) among the doses fulfilling the overdose criterion that there is less than 25 % chance of excessive toxicity. A clinical synthesis of the available toxicity information including adverse event that are not DLTs, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, efficacy as well as the recommnendations from the BLRM will be used to determine the dose.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically-confirmed, advanced unresectable breast cancer or
             advanced carcinoma with squamous cell histology (including NSCLC, SCCHN, and

             is required to determine the PI3K activation status. Whenever possible ≥ 20 unstained
             slides is preferred.

          -  Patient has measurable and/or non-measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 guidelines for
             solid tumors

          -  Patient is an adult (female or male) ≥ 18 years of age on the day of consent signature

          -  Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≤ 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received previous treatment with a PI3K inhibitor

          -  Patient has symptomatic CNS metastases

          -  Patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases may participate in this trial. The patient
             must have completed any prior local treatment for CNS metastases ≥ 14 days prior to
             the start of study treatment (including radiotherapy and/or surgery). If the patient
             is receiving ongoing corticosteroid therapy, the following criteria must be met:

          -  The patient must be receiving a stable or decreasing dose ≤ dexamethasone 4 mg/day or
             equivalent anti-inflammatory potency of another corticosteroid

          -  The dose of corticosteroid may not have been escalated for at least 14 days before the
             start of study treatment

          -  Patient is currently receiving increasing or chronic treatment with corticosteroids
             (&gt;dexamethasone 4 mg or equivalent anti-inflammatory potency of another
             corticosteroid) or another immunosuppressive agent.

          -  Note: Topical applications (e.g., rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., obstructive airways
             diseases), eye drops or local injections (e.g., intra-articular) are allowed. Patients
             with previously treated and asymptomatic brain metastases, are permitted to use
             corticosteroids as per specific protocol criteria

          -  Patient is currently receiving treatment with drugs known to be moderate or strong
             inhibitors or inducers of isoenzyme CYP3A. The patient must have discontinued strong
             inducers for at least one week and must have discontinued strong inhibitors before the
             treatment is initiated. Switching to a different medication prior to starting study
             treatment is allowed.

               -  Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
