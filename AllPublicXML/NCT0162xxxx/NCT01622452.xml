  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a frequent complication after cardiac surgery. It
      is estimated that 40-70% of all cardiac patients show cognitive dysfunction during the first
      post-surgical week. Six weeks after surgery, this incidence decreases to 10-40% and the
      figure remains stable over the long-term.

      The investigators will recruit 50 patients undergoing elective valve surgery and each patient
      will receive complete evaluation a) preoperative, one week before surgery; b) early
      postoperative, before hospital discharge; and c) late postoperative, 8 weeks follow up.

      The investigators will apply Diffusion Tensor Imaging, 1Proton-Magnetic Resonance
      Spectroscopy and Morphometry studies with correlation to neuropsychological test battery to
      evaluate POCD.

    <description>On the basis of scientific literature, the patients during the first post-cardiosurgical week can show cognitive dysfunction in 40-70% of the cases, decreasing after 6 weeks to 10-40%, remaining stable over the long-term. To identify corresponding brain specific microstructural variations, simultaneously to the neuropsychological evaluation, the same group of patients will undergo to MRI with standard sequence and advanced morpho-structural methods (DTI and VBM). Comparing data with a group of healthy age-matched subjects (20), quantitative measurements by VBM and DTI will be carried out to identify GM and WM variations, subsequently correlated with onset of POCD.</description>
