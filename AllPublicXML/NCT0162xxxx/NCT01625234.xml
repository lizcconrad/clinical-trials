  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first human study to use X-396 (ensartinib), a drug being developed for treatment
      of advanced cancers. The initial purpose of the study is to determine the largest amount of
      X-396 that can be safely given to humans (the maximum tolerated dose). Once the recommended
      Phase 2 dose has been determined, an expansion phase will assess the preliminary anti-tumor
      activity of X-396 in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. The study will also provide
      early information on how the body handles the drug (pharmacokinetics) and on the efficacy of
      X-396.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study of X-396 (ensartinib) in humans and the investigational drug will be
      given as a once or twice daily oral dose in 28 day cycles until there is disease progression
      or unacceptable safety issues. X-396 will be given to small groups of patients (1 - 6) at
      each dose level and the patients will be observed to see if there are any adverse safety
      effects. As long as there are no unacceptable safety issues after 28 days, the dose of X-396
      will be increased for the next group of patients. This process will continue until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of X-396 is reached. Once the MTD is reached, up to 170
      additional patients will also be given X-396 to further determine the activity of X-396 in
      patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. These additional patients will be
      enrolled in the following 5 expansion cohorts: ALK TKI-naïve patients, patients that
      progressed on crizotinib, patients that progressed on one or more 2nd generation ALK TKIs
      (patients may or may not have also received prior crizotinib), patients with asymptomatic CNS
      metastases, and patients with leptomeningeal disease.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor
             malignancy. Patients may be ALK TKI-naive or may have received prior crizotinib and/or
             second generation ALK TKIs. In addition, patients with a known ALK 1198 mutation will
             be allowed.

             -For the expanded cohort portion of the study, patients must have NSCLC with ALK
             genomic alterations; however, patients will be allowed to enroll based on local
             FDA-approved ALK results.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Group ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1.

          3. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.

          4. Adequate organ system function.
