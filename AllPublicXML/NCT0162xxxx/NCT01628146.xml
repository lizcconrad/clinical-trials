  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IV study is an open, prospective, single-center, single-surgeon bilateral eye
      study to investigate the bilateral uncorrected intermediate visual acuity of presbyopic
      hyperopic patients, who have been treated with Presbyopia Algorithm SUPRACOR.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The developed software algorithm SUPRACOR uses the subjective refraction of the eye to create
      a treatment for the distance vision correction. This part of the treatment does not show any
      difference to a regular LASIK treatment for hyperopic cases. In addition to the treatment for
      the distance vision an additional central ablation component will be added to address the
      near vision.

      Excimer Laser Technolas® 217z100P, High Speed Session Management Software (KERACOR V5.0) and
      ZYOPTIX Cards as well as all the diagnostic devices that are used in the #1162 study are CE
      certified and are used for their standard purpose.

      This study will be conducted at Mater Private Hospital (Eye Laser Department) by Professor
      Michael O'Keefe who would recruit up to 40 subjects according to the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria.

             visit.

          5. Manifest Refraction for both eyes:

               -  Sphere: +0.75 D to +5.00 D

               -  Spherical Equivalent: +0.75 D to +4.0 D

          6. Subjects must have presbyopia as determined by an age-related need for optical aid
             (≥+1.50 D) for reading with their best distance correction

          7. The proper SUPRACOR treatment for the patient must target the dominant eyes for
             distance at 0.0/ 0.25 dpt and the following eye for near at -0.5/-0.75. The delta
             between the targets must remain 0.5 dpt

          8. Subjects who have be screened successfully for acceptance of the SUPRACOR simulation

          9. Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have gas permeable (GP) lenses discontinued
             for at least 3 weeks and soft lenses discontinued for at least 1 week prior to the
             preoperative evaluation in the eye to be treated. Contact lens wearers who wear their
             contact lenses for any amount of time between the preoperative baseline examination
             and the operative visit must not be treated.

         10. Corneal topography should be normal.

         11. Subjects who are contact lens wearers must have 2 central keratometry readings and 2
             manifest subjective refractions taken preoperatively at least one week apart. The
             refraction values must not differ by more than 0.50 D as defined by manifest
             refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE). The keratometry values must not differ from
             the previous values by more than 0.50D in either meridian.

             measured with the phoropter must be correctable to at least 1.0 (Snellen20/20 or 6/6)
             in both eyes.

             Pupil-o-Meter function must be between 3.5mm and 6.5 mm

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects for whom the combination of their baseline corneal thickness and the planned
             operative parameters for the LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 microns of
             remaining posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively.

          2. Subject for whom a flap thickness other than 100-120µm is planed

          3. Eyes for which the baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibits a difference of
             greater than 0.75D in sphere power, or a difference of greater than 0.50D in cylinder
             power, or a difference in cylinder axis of more than 15 degrees compared to the
             baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction. For manifest cylinder of less than 0.75D,
             the difference in cylinder axis will not be taken into consideration.

          4. Subjects for whom the preoperative assessment of the ocular topography indicates that
             one or both eyes are not suitable candidates for treatment based upon the suggested
             computer-simulated treatment plan.

          5. Any subject who is going to be co-managed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist who is
             not approved as a Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH Excimer laser Investigator.

          6. Subjects with anterior segment pathology, including dry eye syndrome and cataracts
             which in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with best spectacle-corrected VA

          8. Subjects with any residual, recurrent, or active ocular disease, or corneal
