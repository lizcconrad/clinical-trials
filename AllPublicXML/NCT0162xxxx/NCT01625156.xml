      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of tivantinib when given in
      combination with temsirolimus in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to
      other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Tivantinib and temsirolimus may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      ARQ197 (tivantinib) in combination with temsirolimus in adult subjects with advanced solid
      tumors who are extensive cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 19 (CYP2C19)
      metabolizers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the tolerability and/or MTD of ARQ 197 and in combination with
      temsirolimus in adult subjects who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers (CYP2C19*2/*2, *2/*3 or
      *3/*3 polymorphisms).

      II. To identify the pharmacokinetic parameters of ARQ 197 after a single dose and at steady
      state in extensive and poor CYP2C19 metabolizers.

      III. To assess the steady state pharmacokinetics of ARQ 197 alone and in combination with
      temsirolimus.

      IV. To determine impact of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4/cytochrome
      P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (CYP3A4/5) polymorphisms on ARQ 197
      pharmacokinetic parameters.

      V. To determine the pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus and its active metabolite sirolimus in
      combination with ARQ 197 and compare to historical pharmacokinetic data.

      VI. To determine impact of CYP3A4/5 polymorphisms on temsirolimus pharmacokinetic parameters.

      VII. To describe the dose-limiting toxicities and determine the safety profile of the
      combination of ARQ 197 and temsirolimus.

      VIII. To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of ARQ197 and temsirolimus in patients
      with advanced solid tumors.

      IX. To correlate archived tumor tissue expression of c-Met with objective response to ARQ 197
      and temsirolimus therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of tivantinib.

      Patients receive tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and temsirolimus intravenously (IV)
      over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (days 8, 15, 22, and 29 of course 1). Courses repeat
      every 28 days (35 days in course 1) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.
