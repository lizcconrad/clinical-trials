    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study in antiretroviral (ARV)-naïve Human immunodeficiency
      virus 1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid infected subjects is to compare the response rate at Week 48
      of a daily regimen of Atazanavir (ATV)/ Ritonavir (RTV)HS 300/100 mg combined with either one
      additional drug [Lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg daily] or 2 additional drugs
      [Tenofovir/Emtricitabine(TDF/FTC) 300/200 mg daily].
