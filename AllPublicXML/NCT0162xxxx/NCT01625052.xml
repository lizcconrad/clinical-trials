  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators group has performed a number of studies on novel airway devices, including
      an observational study on the performance of a new supraglottic airway named Baska mask. In
      this new study the investigators wish to determine which criteria best predict the correct
      size of the Baska mask to be used in male patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our observational study of the performance of the Baska mask suggests that this novel
      supraglottic airway has promise as an alternative to the current standard device, the
      laryngeal mask airway (LMA). Our results indicate that while the manufacturer weight criteria
      work reasonably well in females this may not be the case in males. The investigators wish to
      determine how well the manufacturer recommended sizing criteria for the Baska mask work in
      males.

      This study is designed to determine which criteria best predict the correct size Baska mask
      to use in male patients. In addition the investigators will monitor the performance and
      safety of this device (insertion success rate, seal pressures, time to and ease of insertion,
      failure rate, complications etc)
