  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical safety and efficacy of dual-axis
      rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease by
      directly comparing it to standard coronary angiography (SA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dual-axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) was developed as an innovative adaptation
      of rotational angiography (RA), but it requires a longer coronary injection compared to
      standard coronary angiography (SA). The risk of complications from the contrast agent (such
      as discomfort, warmth, pain, hypotension and bradycardia) is increased with the use of DARCA.
      It remains to be evaluated whether this approach is also suitable for coronary angiography,
      especially using in the patients with complex coronary lesions. Previous studies revealed
      promising results, but the number of patients included did not provide sufficient statistical
      power to allow a valid comparison of DARCA with SA. The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      the feasibility, safety, clinical tolerance, and hemodynamic effect of DARCA in comparison to
      the well-established SA.

    <measure>Clinical safety of the patient during coronary angiography(CA)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of CA</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were closely observed and questioned regarding discomfort and adverse events during or immediately after CA. The sensation of warmth or pain, including chest pain, is considered as discomfort. Adverse events include arrhythmias, hemodynamic compromise, chest pain described as angina-like pain and any untoward event which jeopardises the patient's life or prolongs the planned hospital stay. If patients experienced bradycardia, only bradycardia with a decrease in heart rate of 20% from the baseline was counted. Hemodynamic compromise was defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure by &gt; 20 mmHg to &lt; 90 mmHg.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient safety determined by contrast and radiation dose</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of CA</time_frame>
    <description>The contrast usage (ml) and radiation exposure (mGycm2) are recorded from the point of selective catheter engagement in the coronary ostium to the completion of the diagnostic study. The contrast and radiation to perform isocentering are included during DARCA. The contrast and radiation required to engage the coronary ostia, exchange catheters, and perform non-coronary angiography are excluded from the analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical utility of dual-axis rotational coronary angiography(DARCA)</measure>
    <time_frame>At time of CA</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical utility of DARCA is determined by the number of additional acquisitions required beyond the protocol and the procedure time required for completing CA.The procedure time (sec.) is recorded from the point of selective catheter engagement in the coronary ostium to the completion of the diagnostic study. The time to perform isocentering is included during DARCA. The time required to engage the coronary ostia, exchange catheters, and perform non-coronary angiography is excluded from the analysis.</description>
