  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Along with the improvement of the accuracy of detection of HBV serological markers, the
      optimization of antiviral therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection
      becomes feasible. Currently, the recommendation of optimized treatment especially interferon
      therapy are mainly based on retrospective studies, it still lacks prospective evidence. This
      study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacoeconomics benefits of 48 weeks
      optimized interferon therapy (switch to telbivudine or plus adefovir dipivoxil) for HBeAg
      positive CHB with inadequate response to 24 weeks interferon treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inadequate response to interferon therapy at 24 weeks were enrolled in this
      study and accepted the optimized therapy (add on ADV or switch to LDT) for 48weeks. All these
      patients were followed for 48 weeks and the HBeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA level were
      observed. Safety and the economic effect of the two optimized therapy methods also were
      observed.
