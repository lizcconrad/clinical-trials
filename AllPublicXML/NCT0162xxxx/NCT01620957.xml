  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies in healthy volunteers have suggested that the synchronized functional
      connectivity in the DMN (Deafult-Mode Network) would sustain the mental content at rest, and
      when required, a switch in the activity between the DMN and other networks involved in
      specific congnitive functions, would occur. This interaction permit to make the hypothesis,
      that baseline brain activity is likely to shape our ongoing &quot; stream of consciousness &quot; and
      could correlate with conscious perception. The investigators hypothesized that DMN
      connectivity strength would be related to the level of consciousness of brain-damaged
      patients. The investigators will follow severely brain-injured patient in coma. Clinical
      examination using standardized behavioural scales: FOUR score (Full Outline of
      UnResponsivess), Coma Recovery Scale-Revised); and brain imaging assessesments using MRI
      (functional and anatomical connectivity, cortical thickness) will be performed at: 3 to 30
      (visit 1), and 60 (visit 2) days after insult. If patient recover a normal conscious state
      between 30 and 60 days, an additional clinical and brain imaging assessment will be performed
      to identify related changes in brain activity (visit 1*) Monitoring of vital parameters will
      be performed in patients by a senior anaesthesiologist throughout the experiment.

    <description>To date, the functional significance of DMN resting state connectivity patterns remain unclear. We hypothesized that DMN connectivity strength would be related to the level of consciousness of non-communicative brain-damaged patients, as assessed by standardized behavioural scales (FOUR score, CRS-R). Furthermore, we expected that a disruption of functional connectivity in the DMN could predict brain-damaged patient's recovery.</description>

        We will analyse DMN functional and anatomical connectivity in severely brain-injured
        patients in coma and during the first two month following brain injury. All patients will
        be admitted from one of the four Critical Care Units of University Teaching Hospital of
        Toulouse, France.
