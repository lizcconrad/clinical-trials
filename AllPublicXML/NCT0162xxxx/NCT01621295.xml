  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Communication is an important component of comprehensive cancer care impacting patient
      satisfaction, adherence, and quality of life. The wide array of issues addressed in cancer
      clinical interactions makes communicating about a broad range of topics (including quality of
      life, communication, symptom control, complementary/alternative therapies, costs, treatment
      burden, prognosis, anxiety, side-effects, sexual function, palliative care options, etc.)
      especially interesting and potentially challenging. Some of these topics may not be routinely
      addressed in the clinical interaction or may require consultative support from other members
      of the comprehensive cancer care team. One frequently overlooked critical element in research
      on communication between cancer clinicians, their patients, and their primary care clinicians
      is describing real-time consultations between patients and their clinicians. These
      interactions provide rich material for assessing key psycho-social dynamics and identifying
      issues that patients find important in their care. In order to devise systems of care that
      optimize the patient experience, it is critical that clinicians and researchers understand,
      appreciate, and systematically characterize the richness and complexity of the
      decision-making process in routine cancer consultations between cancer patients and their
      treating clinicians. This study seeks to assess the patient experience in cancer care by
      observing patients and their physicians in their clinical interactions and following them for
      several months to see how their care went. By describing in-depth the conversations and
      experiences of patients in these clinical interactions, this study will lay the foundation
      for practice-based interventions to optimize patients' interactions with their cancer care
      teams.
