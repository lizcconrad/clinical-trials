      The study hypothesis that treatment with Erythropoietin (EPO) combined with Human
      Erythropoietin (HUO) therapy will result in hematologic improvement in thalassemia intermedia
      patients.

      Second is to determine whether any of the following correlate with improved hematologic
      response:

      A decrease in hemolysis, as assayed by a decrease in LDH, compared to baseline
      levels,baseline Erythropoietin levels,baseline hemoglobin levels and baseline reticulocyte
      counts (or % circulating nucleated erythroblasts/100 WBCs).

      Goal:

      The aim is to assess the possibility of steady increase of hemoglobin levels in thalassemia
      intermedia patients by at least 1g/dl above baseline levels during therapy using Hydroxyurea
      and Erythropoietin, growth evaluation,quality of life (QoL) and decline transfusion
      requirements during study period. Also to report and compare adverse events with other
      published data regarding.

      THE following criteria are used when including the patient in the study:

      Patients with thalassemia intermedia.Diagnosis based on genetic mutations, hemoglobin
      electrophoresis and characteristic clinical data at presentation. Patients requiring
      different transfusion requirements and not transfusion dependent.Patients having a baseline
      hemoglobin of less than or equal to 6-8g/dl.Patients with normal renal and liver function.

    <description>Hydroxyurea (Myers-Squibb, USA) was administered in dosages ranging from 15 up to 35 mg/kg/day orally over 7 days/week. Hydroxyurea toxicity was defined as a white cell count of less than 2500/μL or a platelet count of less than 100,000/μL, in which case the drug was discontinued. White cell count and platelet count were determined on a monthly basis. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes, and malaise, experienced during the first 6 h after taking the HU will be considered as clinical toxicity.
