    <time_frame>From the start of study treatment (Visit 2) until follow-up contact (Visit 6) (up to 13 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an other important medical event, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs (occurring at a frequency threshold &gt;=5%) and SAEs.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, is an other important medical event, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs (occurring at a frequency threshold &gt;=5%) and SAEs.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the 3 Total Nasal Symptom Score (3TNSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period, Week 1 to 2, Week 3 to 4, Week 7 to 8, and Week 11 to 12</title>
        <description>The 3TNSS is the sum of the 3 individual symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Each symptom is scored on a scale from 0 to 3; the range of sums for the 3TNSS is 0 to 9. The symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3; a larger score indicates more severe symptoms. The participant's parent/guardian who signed the informed consent form (ICF) or the participant themself scored nasal symptoms every day during the screening period and the treatment period. The Baseline value is defined as the average 3TNSS over the last 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). For the entire assessment period, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the mean score for the entire treatment period minus the score at Baseline.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the 4 Total Nasal Symptom Score (4TNSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period, Week 1 to 2, Week 3 to 4, Week 7 to 8, and Week 11 to 12</title>
        <description>The 4TNSS is the sum of the 4 individual symptom scores for sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal itching. Each symptom is scored on a scale from 0 to 3; the range of sums for the 4TNSS is 0 to 12. The symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3; a larger score indicates more severe symptoms. The participant's parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the participant themself scored nasal symptoms every day during the screening period and the treatment period. The Baseline value is defined as the average of the 4TNSS in the last 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). A mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Symptoms of eye itching, tearing, and redness were scored by the participant's parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the participant themself using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (a larger score indicates more severe symptoms) and were recorded in the participant's diary. The TOSS is the sum of all three symtpom scores and ranges from 0 to 9. The mean of the Baseline period is defined as the mean score of 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). The mean of each assessment period is defined as the mean score of the entire treatment period (12 weeks), Week 1 to 2, Week 3 to 4, Week 7 to 8, and Week 11 to 12. For each assessment period, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Change From Baseline in the Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS) Over the Entire Treatment Period, Week 1 to 2, Week 3 to 4, Week 7 to 8, and Week 11 to 12</title>
        <description>Symptoms of eye itching, tearing, and redness were scored by the participant's parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the participant themself using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (a larger score indicates more severe symptoms) and were recorded in the participant's diary. The TOSS is the sum of all three symtpom scores and ranges from 0 to 9. The mean of the Baseline period is defined as the mean score of 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). The mean of each assessment period is defined as the mean score of the entire treatment period (12 weeks), Week 1 to 2, Week 3 to 4, Week 7 to 8, and Week 11 to 12. For each assessment period, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Percent change from Baseline=(mean score at the post-Baseline assessment minus the score at Baseline) divided by the Baseline value * 100.</description>

        <description>Four individual symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal itching) were scored on a scale from 0 to 3 using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3; a larger score indicates more severe symptoms. The participant's parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the participant themself scored nasal symptoms every day during the screening period and the treatment period. The Baseline value is defined as the average of the symptom scores in the last 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). A mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Eye Itching, Tearing, and Redness Over the Entire Treatment Period, Week 1 to 2, Week 3 to 4, Week 7 to 8, and Week 11 to 12</title>
        <description>Three individual symptoms (eye itching, tearing, and redness) were scored by the participant's parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the participant themself using a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (a larger score indicates more severe symptoms) and were recorded in the participant's diary. The mean of the Baseline period is defined as the mean score of 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). The mean of each assessment period is defined as the mean score of the entire treatment period (12 weeks), Week 1 to 2, Week 3 to 4, Week 7 to 8, and Week 11 to 12. For each assessment period, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>The participant's parent/guardian who signed the ICF or the participant themself scored the participant's troubles with daily life once daily using the following scale: 0, None; 1, Few troubles; 2, Intermediate between 3 and 1; or 3, Painful and complicating daily life. The mean of the Baseline period is defined as the mean score of 4 consecutive days prior to Visit 2 (start of the treatment period). The mean of each assessment period is defined as the mean score of the entire treatment period, Week 1 to 2, Week 3 to 4, Week 7 to 8, and Week 11 to 12. For each assessment period, a mean score for each participant was calculated using available diary data from the assessment periods, taking the average of non-missing data during the period. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>
