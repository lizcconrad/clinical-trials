    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab may have a better effect on brain necrosis caused by radiotherapy.This randomized
      trial aims to investigate whether bevacizumab may alleviate radiation-induced brain necrosis
      in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The effect will be compared with outcomes in
      patients receiving steroid therapy.

    <textblock>
      Radiation-induced brain necrosis is a severe complication of radiotherapy in patients with
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Current neuroprotective therapies show limited benefit in
      ameliorating this complication of radiotherapy. This study is a randomized, single blind
      clinical study. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether bevacizumab can
      alleviate radiation-induced brain necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and to
      compare the treating effect between bevacizumab and steroid.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have received radiotherapy for histologically confirmed nasopharyngeal
             carcinoma.

          -  Prior irradiation &gt;/= 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Radiographic evidence to support the diagnosis of radiation-induced brain necrosis
             without tumor recurrence.

          -  Age&gt;/= 18 years. Because on dosing or adverse event data are currently not available
             on the use of bevacizumab in patients &lt;18years old.

          -  No prior bevacizumab therapy.

          -  No evidence of very high intracranial pressure that suggests brain hernia and needs
             surgery.

          -  Fertile women who are willing to take contraception during the trial.

          -  Routine laboratory studies with bilirubin &lt;/=2 * upper limits of normal (ULN),
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) &lt; 2 * ULN, creatinine &lt;1.5 * ULN, red-cell
             count &gt;/= 4,000 per cubic millimeter; white-cell count &gt;/=1500 per cubic millimeter,
             platelets &gt;/= 75,000 per cubic millimeter; Hb &gt;/=9.0. PT, APTT, INR in a normal range.

          -  If with history of seizures, patients should be on anticonvulsant therapy. However,
             preference will be enzyme-non-inducing anticonvulsants.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  The patient has no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk
             of bleeding; there is no evidence of serious or non-healing wound, ulcer or bone
             fracture.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any of the following should be excluded: 1) evidence of metastatic
             disease; 2)evidence of tumor invasion to major vessels(e.g. the carotid); 3) history
             of bleeding related to tumor or radiotherapy during or after the completion of
             radiation.

          -  Evidence of active central nervous system hemorrhage.

          -  History of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation or intra-abdominal abscess
             within 28 days prior to study enrollment.

          -  inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt; 140 mmHg and/or
             diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt; 90 mmHg despite antihypertensive medication)

          -  Severe complications: 1) History of large vessel cerebrovascular accident (CVA) within
             6 months; 2) Myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months; 3) New York
             heart association grade II or greater congestive heart failure; 4) Serious and
             inadequately controlled cardiac arrhythmia; 5) Significant vascular disease (e.g.
             aortic aneurysm, history of aortic dissection); 6) Clinically significant peripheral
             vascular disease; 7) severe infection.

          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Patients who have received steroid therapy for radiation-induced brain necrosis before
             the study.

          -  History of anaphylactic response to bevacizumab.
