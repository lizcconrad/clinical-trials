  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage ankle arthritis (ESAA) is a debilitating condition associated with severe pain,
      dysfunction, and reduced quality of life. Many patients with ESAA have difficulty walking for
      even 100 feet or up a single flight of stairs. Patients seeking surgery for ESAA have two
      primary treatment options: ankle arthrodesis (i.e., ankle fusion) and ankle arthroplasty
      (i.e., ankle replacement). Few studies have directly compared the effectiveness of these two
      procedures, and no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed.

      The investigators will compare the following in subjects undergoing ankle arthrodesis and
      ankle arthroplasty before surgery, and post-surgery at 3 and 6 months, and on an annual basis
      up to ten years.

        1. Overall physical function and ankle specific function

        2. Ankle pain intensity and interference with activities

        3. Activity levels

        4. Overall general health

        5. Post-surgical complication rates

      The investigators will also identify prognostic factors that are predictive of higher
      physical function, ankle specific function, reduced pain, improved general health, and
      overall patient satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From study inception until March 2014, the investigators conducted a multi-site randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of ankle arthrodesis and ankle
      arthroplasty over a 2-year follow-up period. The study used a modified Comprehensive Cohort
      Design. Subjects unwilling to randomize to surgery could still participate in the study by
      entering into the preference cohort and select surgery in consultation with their surgeon.

      By March 2014, no subjects had entered into the randomized cohort. The Data and Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended stopping recruitment in the randomized arm of the study
      since no subjects were willing to randomize to surgery. All patients were enrolled in the
      preference cohort and selected arthrodesis or arthroplasty. Despite the change in study
      design, the objectives remain unchanged.

    <description>All surgeons will employ a well-established technique of rigid internal fixation. In this technique, the joint is prepared by removing cartilage from the surfaces, the bones are positioned as desired, and screws and/or a plate are attached to compress the bones together and prevent motion. This technique obviates the need for a cast or external support. Patients are allowed to walk with weight bearing aids immediately. Radiographs are performed at 6 weeks to determine weight bearing status. Weight is allowed on the limb in increments over the 6 to 12 weeks after surgery.</description>

    <description>Protocols are similar among participating centers. Each surgeon uses an anterior surgical approach between the tibialis anterior tendon and the toe extensor group, splints the ankles for 2 weeks, and restricts weight bearing for the first 6 weeks. Radiographs are performed at 6 weeks to determine weight bearing status. The study involves only FDA approved implants with which the surgeon has established experience.</description>
