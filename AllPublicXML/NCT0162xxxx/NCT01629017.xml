  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project allows for the systematic collection and analysis of long-term follow-up
      clinical parameters in children who have received a stem cell transplant. The data collected
      will assist in determining appropriate intervention and treatment plans for patients enrolled
      on this study. In addition, future patients may benefit by having the ability to anticipate
      problems and develop methods of prevention or early intervention.
