    <textblock>
      This is a two part study. Part A of the study will evaluate the metabolites of GSK221149
      following single and repeat oral dosing and will also assess the pharmacokinetics of
      GSK221149 when administered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor Ketoconazole. Part B of the study
      will look at the pharmacokinetics of GSK221149 following a high fat meal.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than and equal to 1.5xULN (isolated
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             less than 35%).

          -  Single [QTc, QTcB or QTcF] less than 450 msec; or QTc less than 480 msec in subjects
             with Bundle Branch Block.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Female subjects between 18 and 45 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Child-bearing potential and
             is abstinent or agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol
             for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator)
             prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that
             point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 48 hours post last dose.

          -  Body weight greater than 50 kg and BMI within the range 19-29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol/urine cotinine screen.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an
             average weekly intake of greater than 7 drinks for females. One drink is equivalent to
             12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 1.5 ounces
             (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including
             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test at screening or prior to
             dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.
