    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) and heart attacks pose a serious health risk to men and women,
      however the knowledge about the real-life AMI management in China is limited. Within a
      nation-wide and regional representative probability sample of hospitals in China, 27,800 AMI
      inpatient cases will be sampled randomly from 2001 to 2011. The sampled medical records will
      be reviewed and abstracted in the national coordinating centre, in order to evaluate the
      treatment pattern, outcomes, and cost for AMI patients, during the past decade. Basic data
      and innovative evidence will accelerate evidence-based clinical practice and policy making,
      and improve AMI patients outcomes finally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major concern in public health globally, as well as in
      China, and remarkable variations of resources available and health system performance have
      been noted. Relatively limited information is available about how evidence-based therapies
      are incorporated appropriately into routine clinical practice. In addition, little
      information is available about the magnitude, prognosis, and optimal management of AMI, which
      is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity, both in rural and urban area.
      Practical and applied knowledge from large unselected population is needed to guide practice
      and policy for quality improvement and cost reduction.

      To investigate the treatment pattern and outcomes of AMI patients during the past decade in
      China, using a stratified two-stage cluster sampling design, from 175 sampled hospitals,
      13,900 AMI cases will be selected in 2011, and 6,950 in 2001 and 2006 separately. Photocopies
      of the 27,800 medical records of AMI cases will be sent to the national coordinating centre.
      Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features, diagnostic tests,
      medications, procedures, and in-hospital outcomes of patients will be abstracted by well
      trained professional abstractors. By characterizing differences in patients' features,
      comparing the use of medications and procedures, and examining the in-hospital outcomes,
      we'll define the gaps between clinical practice and guidelines, as well as the disparities
      across different regions and hospitals, to evaluated the treatment pattern and outcomes in
      the last decade in China. New knowledge will be generated about AMI management all over
      China, to provide evidence for policy-making and clinical guidelines, and to improve AMI
      patients prognosis in future finally.
