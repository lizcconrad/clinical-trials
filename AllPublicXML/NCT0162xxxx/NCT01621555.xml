      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between a patients
      pain sensitivity and their subsequent post-operative pain and surgical outcome in
      arthroscopic shoulder surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic shoulder surgery is increasingly performed on a daycase basis. Optimal pain
      relief is the goal as this not only improves patient comfort and allows expedient discharge
      from hospital, but also reduces the risk of developing postoperative chronic pain and may
      improve surgical outcome. However, optimal postoperative pain control in daycase surgery
      remains a challenge. There is considerable variation in the level of postoperative pain
      experienced between individuals and subsequent analgesia requirements. Previous studies have
      attempted to predict the level of postoperative pain an individual will experience, using a
      variety of complex preoperative pain and psychological assessments. Other investigators have
      focused on a simpler approach, by testing an individual's pain threshold to a single
      preoperative nociceptive (painful) stimulus, e.g. heat or pressure. Recent work has produced
      a simple questionnaire alternative to pain intensity testing, the Pain Sensitivity
      Questionnaire (PSQ). We hypothesise that a patient's pain sensitivity preoperatively may both
      affect the level of pain they experience postoperatively and their final surgical outcome.

      The aim of our study is to correlate a patient's pain sensitivity, as measured by the Pain
      Sensitivity Questionnaire, with the degree of acute postoperative pain (first 4 days) they
      experience and subsequent surgical outcome at 6 months.
