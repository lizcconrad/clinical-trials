    <textblock>
      The study will assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of providing brief, intensive
      case management for frequent users of hospital Emergency Departments who have mental health
      and/or addictions problems. The goals of the intervention are to support patients' transition
      to community-based health and social services and supports - including primary and urgent
      psychiatric care, peer support and other community services and supports - so as to improve
      patient wellbeing and reduce avoidable ED visits and hospitalizations.
