      The purpose of the study &quot;A comparison of vocal demands with vocal performance among
      classroom teachers&quot; is to gather information about the voice production of teachers using
      three separate strategies: (a) measures of voice assessed with the Computerized Speech Lab
      (CSL) and the Phonatory Aerodynamic System (PAS) instruments in the SIUC Voice Lab.
