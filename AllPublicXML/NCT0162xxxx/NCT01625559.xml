      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of RPE cellular therapy in patients with SMD
           Group

        -  When-MA09-hRPE cell transplantation to evaluate the safety of surgical procedures.

        -  In future studies intended to assess the number of transplanted hRPE cells.

        -  In the past, MA09-hRPE cell therapy used in the study was to evaluate the validity of
           the potential.

        -  Homologous retinal pigment epithelial cells derived from embryonic stem cells, future
           studies of drugs that are used in representing the potential validity to evaluate the
           optimal dose.

    <description>The transplantation of hESC-derived RPE cells MA09-hRPE will be considered safe and tolerated in the absence of:
Any grade 2 (NCI grading system) or greater adverse event related to the cell product
Any evidence that the cells are contaminated with an infectious agent
Any evidence that the cells show tumorigenic potential</description>
