  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of intranasal administration
      of 100, 200, and 400 μg of fluticasone propionate twice a day delivered by the OptiNose
      device with placebo in subjects with bilateral nasal polyposis. Two co-primary endpoints will
      be used in the study: reduction of nasal congestion/obstruction symptoms at the end of Week 4
      of the double-blind treatment phase measured by the 7 day average instantaneous AM diary
      symptom scores, and reduction in total polyp grade (sum of scores from both nasal cavities)
      over the 16 weeks of the double-blind treatment phase as determined by the Lildholdt scale
      score measured by nasoendoscopy.
