      The aim of the study is to investigate the correlation between increased bone metabolism in
      the 3 phase bone scintigraphy (TPBS) and decreased pressure pain thresholds in patients with
      complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) of the upper limb and a non-CRPS-group. The
      investigators assume that there will be a significant correlation between the investigated
      values in the CRPS-group whereas the non-CRPS-group shows no significant correlation.

    <textblock>
      Pressure pain of the distal hand joints is a predominant symptom of CRPS. But so far, the
      diagnostic value of pressure pain in the diagnosis of CRPS has not been investigated. We
      compared the pressure pain thresholds of the carpus, metacarpophalangeal and proximal
      interphalangeal joints to a region of interest-based (ROI) analysis of a TBPS in patients
      with CRPS and patients with limb pain of other origin (non-CRPS-group).Additionally, the PPTs
      were established for a healthy control group to get reference data.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease of the pressure pain thresholds of the distal hand joints</measure>
    <time_frame>half an hour</time_frame>
    <description>The pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were mesured for the carpus, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands. The mean of three determined measurements of each joint was taken as the final value. Subseqently the PPT were compared to the results of the 3 phase bone scintigraphy and the reference data of the healthy subjects.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increased bone metabolism in the 3 phase bone scintigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>All Patients with CRPS and limb pain of other origin underwented a 3 phase bone scitigraphy to investigate a possible increased bone metabolism. Phase one and two were recorded within the first five minutes after injection of approximately 500-700 MBq 99mTechnetium-labeled methylene diphosphonate. The third phase was obtained two to three hours after injection.</description>

        The study sample consists of three groups:

          1. Patients with CRPS of one of the upper limb type 1 (n=18)

          2. Patients with unilateral upper limb pain of other origin (n=17)

          3. Healthy subjects (n=18)

        All patients were recruited from the Department of Pain medicine and the Department of
        nuclear medicine of the University Hospital Bergmannsheil
