      The current research is aimed at using Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) as
      complementary therapeutic tool in the treatment of schizophrenia. Patients will be randomized
      into two groups (tDCS-active x tDCS-sham) accordingly to detailed protocol. Main outcome will
      be measured by specific clinical rating scales based on the assessment of negative symptoms.
      A total of 40 patients ought to be enrolled as specified in methodology. Secondary outcomes
      shall include collateral effects evaluation, anxiety and depressive scales as well as
      clinical monitoring.

      Overview

      The present study is a double-blind randomized clinical trial in which patients should be
      allocated from a General Psychiatry Service into two groups (tDCS-active x tDCS-sham).
      Subjects who fulfilled eligibility criteria will undergo ten days of consecutive stimulation
      (active or sham) and will return after two to four weeks for final clinical assessment.
      Patients who shown no response in rating scales and that were allocated to sham intervention
      group will be able to choose whether or not they want to undergo the active intervention at
      follow up (partial cross-over)

    <description>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation. Daily sessions with a total of 10 days intervention. Each intervention will take place with a 2mA intensity during 20 minutes. The current will be delivered by &quot;Chattanooga Iontophoresis Dual Channel Delivery Device&quot;, that stands for a 2-channels tDCS device in which previous dosage can be set as default to maintain frequently used treatment parameters. Main features include (a) Beeping alerts if electrode fault for open current or high impedance, low battery, treatment completion or power left on; (b)automatic 30 second current ramp up and down during power on/off keeps patient comfortable; (c) Current can be set in 0.1 mA increments between 0.5 mA and 4 mA.</description>
