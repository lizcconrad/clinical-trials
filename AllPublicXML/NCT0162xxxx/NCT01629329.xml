  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized, double blind study is to demonstrate that one dose oral
      &quot;excedrin migraine&quot; (acetaminophen, aspirin and caffeine) is not inferior when compared to
      one dose of intravenous prochlorperazine for the treatment of acute migraine headaches in the
      emergency department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe headaches often come to the emergency department seeking relief from
      their symptoms. There is some dating suggesting that over the counter treatment options are
      not inferior to treatment options offered in emergency departments. Patients presenting to
      the Einstein Emergency Department with IHS criteria for migraine headache will be approached
      by research associate and offered to participate in a randomized double blind study comparing
      excedrin migraine to compazine. Patients will be randomized by the hospital pharmacy. The
      pharmacy will distribute one of two packets, one containing prochlorperazine 10mg and 2
      placebo tablets, the other containing 2 generic AAC tablets without scoring (acetaminophen
      250mg, aspirin 250mg and caffeine 65mg in each tablet) and a placebo syringe. Patients will
      be monitored for improvement of pain, change in vital signs, and adverse events for two hours
      after receiving drugs. At 24 hours, the patients will be called back to access if they
      experienced any side effects from the time of discharge, and if they would take this medicine
      again if they experienced another migraine.
