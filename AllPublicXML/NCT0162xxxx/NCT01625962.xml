    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study to evaluate the associations between indices
      of brain structure and function (measured at baseline, as soon as possible after injury) and
      course of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Subjects will be service members
      who have sustained mild traumatic brain injury (classified as either &quot;impact-induced mTBI&quot; or
      &quot;blast-induced mTBI&quot;; n = 100 completers) or an extracranial injury (ECI) with no evidence of
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) (n = 100 completers). Subjects will complete an assessment
      battery at baseline and 6 months later that includes (1) structural magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived from a 3-Tesla magnet; (2)
      event-related brain potentials (ERPs) derived from brain electrical activity; (3)
      neurocognitive tests; and (4) neurological soft signs (NSS). Specific indices of brain
      structure and function derived from these assessments are hypothesized to demonstrate a
      significant relationship with course of PTSD symptoms, which will be measured at baseline, 3
      months, and 6 months.
