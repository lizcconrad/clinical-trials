      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an exercise program with a cycle
      ergometer in functional outcome and related-health quality of life (RHQL) in elderly patients
      with total hip arthroplasty.

      Behavioral: Ergometer Cycling Ergometer Cycling under the guidance of a physical therapist
      after the second postoperative week. These training sessions were scheduled to be performed
      two times a week for a time period of at least eith weeks.

      Behavioral: No ergometer cycling Patients of the no ergometer cycling group did not receive
      any ergometer cycling after surgery, only conventional exercises.
