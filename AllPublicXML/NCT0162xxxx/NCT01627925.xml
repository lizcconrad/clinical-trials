      Upper airway obstruction (UAO) is a frequently occurring complication during induction of
      general anesthesia. The American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) closed claim analysis of
      anesthesia complications indicate that a difficult airway is one of the most challenging
      scenarios continuously facing anesthesia providers.

      The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia has not been well understood. Posterior displacement
      of soft palate, tongue and epiglottis are believed to be the primary contributing factors.
      Obesity is well known to be an essential characteristic which reflects propensity to UAO. The
      mechanism of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with the upper airway obstruction
      observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal continuous positive airway pressure
      (nCPAP) via nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway patent with near 100% success in patients
      with OSA. Obesity is a major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea and obese patients have
      a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. Therefore, the investigators hypotheses that
      nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients under anesthesia. The
      investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the efficacy of nCPAP on
      maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      Upper airway obstruction (UAO) is an unpredictable and frequently occurring complication
      during induction of general anesthesia. Since obese patients ( BMI&gt;30 km/ m2) are more
      vulnerable to develop airway obstruction either during sleep or under anesthesia, and the
      segment of obese individuals in the entire population keep growing, difficult airway
      management under anesthesia becomes even more challenging than ever. The most serious event
      related to difficult airway management under anesthesia is &quot;cannot intubate, cannot
      ventilate&quot;. Unfortunately, even with modern technologic advances, 16% of death and permanent
      brain damage related to anesthesia have been attributed to failure of difficult airway
      management 3. The American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) closed claim analysis of
      anesthesia complications indicate that a difficult airway is one of the most challenging
      scenarios continuously facing anesthesia providers. Indeed, it can be a fatal complication of
      general anesthesia. Therefore, measures used to reduce the incidence of difficult airways
      during anesthesia remain to be improved.

      The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia has not been well understood. Posterior displacement
      of soft palate, tongue and epiglottis are believed to be the primary contributing factors.
      Obesity is well known to be an essential characteristic which reflects propensity to UAO.
      Accordingly, obese patients are a high-risk group for perioperative airway catastrophe and
      prone to develop progressively narrower pharyngeal airways due to an increase of soft tissue
      volume surrounding the pharyngeal airway. More and more evidence indicates that the mechanism
      of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with the upper airway obstruction observed
      during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) via
      nasal mask (NM) can maintain the airway patent with near 100% success in patients with OSA,
      if they can tolerate it. Under anesthesia, tolerance should not be an issue as the patient is
      anesthetized. Obesity is a major risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea and obese patients
      have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia. Therefore, the investigators hypotheses
      that nCPAP should eliminate airway obstruction in obese patients under anesthesia. The
      investigators propose to test this hypothesis and determine the efficacy of nCPAP on
      maintaining airway patency in obese patients who require general anesthesia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Thirty-two subjects with BMI limited in the range of 30 km/ m2 to 50 km/m2 and age of
             18-65 years will be enrolled. Subjects must also meet ASA physical status
             classification I-III, require general anesthesia for elective surgery and be able to
             breathe through both their nose and mouth while awake.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Patients with major cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, cerebral vascular
             disease or American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class IV or greater.

             2. Abnormal vital signs on the day of admission for surgery [heart rate (HR, &gt;100 bpm
             or &lt;40 bpm), blood pressure (BP, &gt;180/100 mmHg or &lt;90/60 mmHg), room air
             transcutaneous oxyhemoglobin saturation (SPO2) &lt;96%] that are not correctable with his
             or her routine medication or commonly used pre-operative medication.

             3. Having claustrophobia and not able to tolerate the mask. 4. Any person with an
             anticipated difficult airway or those with a history of difficult airway. This will
             include subjects who require or may require either a fiberoptic intubation or
             intubation while awake.

             5. Gastric-esophageal reflex disease that is refractory to treatment or a full
             stomach.

             6. The subject has been in bed for more than 24 hours. 7. Neurological symptoms
             associated with neck extension, a neurological deficit from a previous stroke or
             spinal cord injury, a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 2 weeks.

             8. Pregnant women and women less than one month post-partum. Ruling out pregnancy will
             be conducted by careful history and physical examination as performed routinely prior
             to surgery. If the history is believed to be unreliable, the patient will be excluded
             unless a pregnancy test is performed and the result of the test is negative.

             9. Emergency cases and subjects who have not adhered to the ASA NPO (Nil Per Os)
             guidelines.
