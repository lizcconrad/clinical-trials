      Background:

      - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common form of liver disease in the United
      States. It includes many conditions. Researchers want to study fatty liver disease by looking
      at people who have liver cirrhosis. They also want to look at people who are or were listed
      for liver transplants. Genetic studies may provide more information on the causes of these
      conditions.

      Objectives:

      - To study possible genetic causes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals of any age who have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and related conditions.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  Participants will provide a blood sample for genetic testing. Liver tissue from a
           transplant or biopsy may also be studied.

        -  Participants may also be asked to have an imaging study of the liver. This imaging study
           may be an x-ray or magnetic resonance imaging.

        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this research study.

      Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of liver disease in the
      United States. It includes a wide spectrum of conditions from benign hepatic steatosis to
      cirrhosis and liver failure. Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a term that describes
      specific histological characteristics of liver inflammation and seems to be a determinant
      step in the progression of NAFLD to cirrhosis and liver failure. The overall purpose of this
      study is to increase our understanding of the genetic background and pathophysiology of NAFLD
      through detailed review of physical, radiologic and pathology characteristics, when
      available. We will perform genetic analysis of known and candidate genes and will assess
      inheritance through evaluation of unaffected relatives. Most patients will be seen by
      hepatologists in transplant centers and hepatology clinics across the country. A subset of
      patients and their families may be seen at the NIH Clinical Center.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Although a liver biopsy is necessary to make the diagnosis of NASH, patients with
                  radiologic evidence of fatty liver and/or cirrhosis in which other causes have
                  been ruled out are eligible to participate.

               2. Patients who have already undergone liver transplantation for a confirmed
                  diagnosis of NAFLD or cryptogenic cirrhosis are also eligible to participate.

               3. Depending on their willingness to participate, subjects may enroll in DNA
                  laboratory-only or clinical-only. However, to conserve resources and meet study
                  objectives, subjects with known pathogenic mutations will be given priority in
                  selection for extensive clinical studies.

               4. Direct blood relatives (typically parents and siblings) of affected individuals
                  with NAFLD and associated conditions are also eligible to participate.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent (for themselves as adults, or on behalf
             of their children as minors) or assent.

          2. Pregnant women. Although fatty liver and cirrhosis are sometimes diagnosed during
             pregnancy, it is unclear if they were present before and just not diagnosed or if they
             develop as a complication of pregnancy. Additionally energy metabolism changes during
             pregnancy and lactation which may confound our analysis. If the condition persists
             after pregnancy and the diagnosis of NAFLD is

             clearly established, patients can be referred to the study.

          3. We will review a clinical description from the referring physician about a potential
             research subject to determine that the subject is appropriate to enter into the study.
             We reserve the right to exclude cases that are clearly not NAFLD or related to our
             direct research interests (e.g. fatty liver induced by chronic alcohol use, infectious
             causes, drug-related, or toxin-related). This almost never happens. However, as some
             of these environmental factors may contribute to a multifactorial etiology of hepatic
             changes, we may not exclude all such cases.
