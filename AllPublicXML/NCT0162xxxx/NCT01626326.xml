    <textblock>
      This is an initial pilot study to determine whether people will use a research version of an
      iPhone Stop Smoking app. The investigators primary measures will consist of rates of
      recruitment (that is, number of people installing the app), use of the app, and completion of
      follow-up surveys regarding self-reported smoking status. The investigators secondary measure
      will be obtained quit rates and number of cigarettes smoked before and after using the app.

      To enter the study, participants must download the app from iTunes at:

      https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/san-francisco-stop-smoking/id522832206?mt=8

    <textblock>
      The investigators research team has developed smoking cessation self-help tools administered
      as printed brochures and Internet stop smoking sites. These self-help tools have demonstrated
      quit rates similar to those obtained with the nicotine patch. The investigators now want to
      see if mobile device apps might also help people quit.

      This is the investigators first pilot study with a research version of the investigators stop
      smoking app for the iPhone. The investigators want to get estimates of how many people will
      download the app per month, how many will actually use the app, and how many will provide
      follow-up information on whether they quit, and if not, how many cigarettes they are smoking
      now. The investigators will use this information to plan a randomized controlled trial to
      determine efficacy of the app for stopping smoking.
