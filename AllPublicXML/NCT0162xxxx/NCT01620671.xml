  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of &quot;enhanced recovery after surgery&quot; has become increasingly popular in elective
      abdominal surgeries. Yet, the role of this concept has not been described in emergency
      procedures. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of fast-track surgery
      in patients with perforated peptic ulcer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a randomized, controlled clinical study. The patients with a
      preoperative diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer will be recruited for the study. Among
      those, the patients with a definitive diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer confirmed by
      surgical exploration will be included.

      The patients will be randomized according to their protocol number given automatically by the
      registration system of the hospital during admission. The patients who have an odd protocol
      number will have conventional surgical protocol, and those who have an even protocol number
      will have fast-track surgery protocol.

      The conventional surgical protocol for perforated peptic ulcers is composed of regular
      general anesthesia, postoperative pain control by intravenous analgesics, removal of
      nasogastric tube by the end of 48th postoperative hour, initiation of oral intake after
      clinical signs of active bowel movement is observed. Fast-track surgery protocol, however, is
      composed of general anesthesia with short-acting agents and the use of regional anesthesia if
      possible, removal of nasogastric tube during recovery from anesthesia, aggressive pain
      control, initiation of oral intake by the end of 48th postoperative hour.

      All of the patients will be scheduled for control gastroscopy in the end of six weeks after
      surgery.

      Primary end-point is the morbidity and mortality rate. Secondary end-points are length of
      hospital stay, readmission rate, endoscopic findings in control gastroscopy.
