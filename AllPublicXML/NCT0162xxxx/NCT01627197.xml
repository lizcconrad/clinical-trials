      Effect of adjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy to control tumor progression in patients
      cystectomized for locally advanced bladder cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For locally advanced bladder cancer patients, tumor relapse rates after radial cystectomy
      were even as high as 50%-62%.Five-year disease-specific survival and OS rates in the
      organ-confined disease (defined as ≤pT3a) were 78.9% and 68%, respectively. For the
      non-organ-confined disease (defined as pT3b or higher), the rates were about 36.8% and 30.3%,
      respectively.Systemic chemotherapy can only prolong survival for up to 14.8 months, although
      with multiple severe adverse effects, such as neutrocytopenia, infection/sepsis, renal
      dysfunction, mucositis, or gastrointestinal toxicity. Additionally, the mortality rate
      associated with systemic chemotherapy was about 1%-4%.Therefore, the objective of our study
      was to determine if adjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy with GC was able to reduce the
      systemic drug toxicities and yield a better clinical outcome.

    <description>This is an open-label, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 3 two-arm study.Patients with locally advanced TCC of the bladder are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms
Arm 1 (treatment):'Surgery of percutaneous catheter system for arterial chemotherapy is done in the Department of Invasive Technology. All medications were administered using percutaneous catheter system via a modified Seldinger technique.Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 intra-arterial,cisplatin 25 mg/m2 intra-arterial once a week for 3 weeks followed by 1-week rest period. Maximum of 3 cycles. Treatment begins between 1-5 weeks after radical operation (within 40 days is recommended).</description>

    <description>Arm 2 (control): No immediate post-surgery treatment. Patients undergo observation followed by cisplatin and gemcitabine as in arm I at local relapse, or receive intravenously chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine at multiple metastases</description>

    <description>Intraarterial (IA) catheterization was done in the Department of Invasive Technology. All medications were administered using percutaneous catheter system via a modified Seldinger technique. An angiographic catheter was inserted through the femoral artery into the internal iliac artery. The catheter tips were located superior to the origin of bilateral common artery.</description>
