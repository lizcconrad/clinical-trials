  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A dedicated therapeutic education program is an essential tool in the management of
      hypertension as well as in the control of other cardiovascular risk factors. The purpose of
      this study is therefore to evaluate the effect of such a therapeutic education program in
      general practice patients at high cardiovascular risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease recognize the major interest
      of an optimal control of all cardiovascular risk factors. It includes high blood pressure
      reduction, dietetic measures (weight loss - control of dyslipidemia and diabetes - regular
      physical activity), smoking cessation, stress management, … In that way, some authors suggest
      that it is essential for patients at high risk to have knowledge about their own pathology,
      medication, and to better understand the real benefit of specific lifestyle behaviors and the
      importance of blood pressure and glycaemia surveillance … The aim of this randomized
      controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a dedicated therapeutic education program to
      control blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in general practice patients at
      high cardiovascular risk.

      250 patients are being enrolled. All patients will receive standard care but only 125
      patients (randomized 1 to 1) will receive a structured therapeutic education program.

    <description>The intervention program takes place in 3 phases. First, the education team realizes an individual educational diagnosis to define the objectives of the intervention according to each patient's needs. Secondly, patients assist to 3 to 5 group sessions lasting 2 hours with a dedicated nurse focusing on medical therapy explanation and blood pressure self measurement education - and with a dedicated nutritionist focusing on stress management and nutrition program. Patients can also have individual consultations with the dedicated nutritionist. Finally, an individual assessment permits to evaluate the benefits of the program for each patient and to define new objectives.</description>
