  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to compare Tai Chi versus Resistance Exercise, Health
      Education and usual care for changes in cardiac functional capacity measured for ability of
      the heart to pump by measuring ejection fraction (EF), end systolic and diastolic volumes in
      heart failure (HF) patients. Also measured will be changes in physical function measured by
      walking speed and distance in the 6-min walk task, work performed during a bicycle task, and
      changes in daily physical activity. The investigators will compare groups for altered
      well-being including: depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, mindfulness, spirituality and
      quality of life. In addition the investigators will compare groups for altered vascular and
      pro-inflammatory markers, catecholamines, and autonomic function at rest and in response to
      the bicycle task. Also, the investigators will assess cardiac related hospitalization and
      death over a 12 month period by examining medical records.
