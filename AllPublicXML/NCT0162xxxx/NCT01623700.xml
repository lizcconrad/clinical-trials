      This observational study will based on the Register of Information and Knowledge About
      Swedish Heart Intensive Care Admissions (RIKS-HIA) and the Swedish Coronary Angiography and
      Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR) which since 2009 are merged into The Swedish Web-system for
      Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to
      Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART).

      The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of different antithrombotic treatment
      options (treatment duration, type of treatment and combination of treatments) in Acute
      Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients on outcomes such as recurrent ischemic events and mortality.
