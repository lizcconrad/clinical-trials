        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 20-35 years (inclusive).

          -  English as primary language.

          -  Have a minimum of a high school degree (note that GED is not sufficient).

          -  Females of Child-bearing Potential (FOCP) must have a negative urine or serum beta HCG
             pregnancy test at screening. FOCP must abstain from sexual activity that could result
             in a pregnancy, or use acceptable contraceptives throughout the period of study
             treatment exposure and for 30 days after the last study treatment. Acceptable
             contraceptives include IUDs, hormonal contraceptives (oral, implanted or injectable)
             and double barrier methods (such as condom or diaphragm with spermicidal gel). If
             hormonal contraceptives are used, the period of use must be sufficiently long to
             achieve pharmacological effectiveness prior to study treatment exposure (refer to
             individual product information for details on onset of effectiveness). FOCP who are
             not currently sexually active, must agree to use acceptable contraception, as defined
             above, if they decide to become sexually active during the period of study treatment
             exposure and for thirty days thereafter.

          -  Good physical and mental health based on a general medical, mental health
             questionnaire.

          -  Adequate visual, auditory and cognitive ability to complete the assessments within the
             Normal range (i.e., no more than 1 standard deviation below the mean for the subject's
             age and years of education).

          -  Willing and able to comply with all requirements defined within this protocol.

          -  Willing to obtain at least 7 hours of nighttime sleep during the evenings prior to
             study visits.

          -  Willing to avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours prior to visits.

          -  Willing to avoid alcohol for 24 hours prior to visits.

          -  Willing to abstain from caffeine after midnight prior to visits.

          -  Moderate daily user of caffeine (approximately 1-4 cups of coffee or equivalent per
             day).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current Axis I or Axis II comorbid psychiatric diagnosis or other symptomatic
             manifestations that, in the opinion of the examining physician (Investigator), will
             contraindicate treatment with caffeine.

          -  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

          -  BMI ≤ 19 or ≥ 30 kg/m2.

          -  History of drug dependence or substance use disorder based upon DSM-IV-TR criteria
             (excluding nicotine).

          -  Positive urine drug or alcohol drug test result.

          -  Users of nicotine products within 30 days of screening or during the duration of the
             study.

          -  Taking any over the counter or prescription medications other than birth control.

          -  Concurrent chronic or acute illness (such as allergic rhinitis or severe cold),
             disability, or other condition that might confound the results of rating tests
             administered in the study or that might increase risk to the subject. Similarly, the
             subject will be excluded if he or she has any additional conditions that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would preclude the subject from completing the study or would
             not be in the best interest of the subject. This would include any significant illness
             or unstable medical condition that could lead to difficulty complying with the
             protocol.

          -  Participation in an investigational study or received an investigational drug within
             the past 28 days.

          -  Individuals who do not maintain a routine nighttime sleep schedule (no shift work).

          -  Pregnant or lactating women, or women planning to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Hypertension or other chronic medical conditions.

          -  Judged by the Investigator to be unsuitable for enrollment in this study for any
             reason.

          -  Has been diagnosed with phenylketonuria.

          -  Individuals with sleep disorders (e.g. sleep apnea, primary or secondary insomnia).

          -  Known pre-existing medical condition.

          -  Has a fasting glucose of &gt;110 mg/dl.

          -  Has an allergy to wheat, soy, nuts or any other food.

          -  Has Kosher or Halal dietary restrictions.

          -  Reports never eating biscuits, cookies or crackers.

          -  Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≥ 12 at screening (i.e., evidence of excessive daytime
             sleepiness).
