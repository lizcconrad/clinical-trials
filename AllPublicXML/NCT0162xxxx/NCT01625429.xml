    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, single arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin (with trastuzumab for HER-2 positive patients) as
      neoadjuvant therapy in operable locally advanced breast cancer patients. The primary
      objective is pCR. The secondary objectives include ORR, 3-yr DFS, OS and safety. The sample
      size is 30.
