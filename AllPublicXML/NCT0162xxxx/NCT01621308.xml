    <textblock>
      Almost all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) need insulin treatment permanently.
      For selected patients who are unable to achieve glycaemic targets with subcutaneous (SC)
      insulin treatment, continuous intraperitoneal (IP) insulin infusion is an third-line
      alternative.

      Previous studies demonstrate that continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion (CIPII) using
      an implantable pump device improves glycaemic control and quality of life in patients with
      'brittle' T1DM. Nevertheless, literature comparing IP and SC insulin treatment is scarce.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effects of IP insulin delivery to SC
      insulin delivery.The null hypothesis (H0) of the current study holds inferiority of CIPII
      compared to SC insulin regarding long-term glycaemic control. The alternative hypothesis (H1)
      is the inverse: CIPII is non-inferior to SC insulin. In summary, H0: CIPII is inferior to the
      SC insulin treatment H1: CIPII is not inferior to SC insulin treatment

      This is an investigator initiated, open label and prospective matched-control study with a
      non-inferiority design. The trial duration is 36 weeks and is conducted in a single-centre
      (Isala Clinics, Zwolle). If non-inferiority is established superiority analyses are
      performed.

        The study sample consists of the subjects on CIPII, who participated in the crossover study
        performed by Logtenberg et al. (Diabetes Care 32:1372-1377, 2009) or subjects who already
        used CIPII at that moment (so, for a minimum of 4 years), and matched controls on SC
        insulin treatment .

        The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the previous study are described in detail in
        (Diabetes Care 32:1372-1377, 2009). In brief, it consisted of patients with T1DM, low
        fasting c-peptide concentrations (&lt;0.20 nmol/L), aged 18 to 70 years, treated with MDI or
        CSII and intermediate or poor glycaemic control; defined as glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)
        ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol) and/or ≥5 incidents of hypoglycaemia (&lt; 4.0mmol/L) per week.

        If subjects are on SC insulin, they must be able to 'function' as matched control for CIPII
        patients. The matching procedure, based on age and gender, will take place after patients
        are being included in the current study.
