  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that black cohosh, as a potentially therapeutic agent, will
      reduce the overall size and aggressiveness of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) when given in a
      pre-operative setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis of our research is that black cohosh has potential to be a
      well-tolerated, effective agent for the treatment of early breast cancer. This pilot study
      represents a first step in exploring this hypothesis by demonstrating preliminary evidence of
      specific anti-tumor effect of black cohosh on areas of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the
      breast.

    <description>Measure change in size of DCIS on routine imaging (i.e. mammography and/or ultrasound) obtained before and after 4 weeks of treatment with black cohosh, with correlation to specimen sizes; and
Determine differences in breast epithelial cell proliferation in areas of DCIS as measured by mean change in levels of Ki67 before and after 4 weeks of treatment with black cohosh. Ki67 levels will be assessed with traditional immunohistochemical staining as well as AQUA technology.</description>

    <measure>Assess adherence to a brief course of black cohosh.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To test this secondary hypothesis, we will:
Assess adherence to a brief course of black cohosh. Participants will be given an adequate supply of medication for 4 weeks +/- 1 week at the screening/enrollment visit. They will be instructed to bring their medication back on the day of surgery. Pill counts will be conducted by the research nurse to assess the participant's level of compliance.</description>

    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess this secondary outcome measure we will:
Assess safety and side effects through patient history, pill diary and safety labs.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient/subject is eligible for enrollment if all of the following inclusion
             criteria are met:

               1. Pre- and post-menopausal women ≥ 18 years of age newly diagnosed with DCIS
                  histologically confirmed on breast core biopsy

               2. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
                  document

               3. ECOG performance status 0-1

               4. Life expectancy &gt;12 months

               5. Willing to schedule definitive resection of DCIS 4 weeks +/- 1 week after study
                  enrollment

               6. Original breast core biopsy specimen available for pathologic review and staining
                  by Yale School of Medicine Department of Pathology

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient /subject will not be eligible for this study if any of the following
             exclusion criteria are met:

               1. Pregnant or nursing within past 6 months

               2. Lactose intolerant, lactose allergy or salicylate allergy

               3. Patients who have already undergone excisional biopsy for qualifying DCIS

               4. Patients with ipsilateral treatment for DCIS or breast cancer within 12 months
                  prior to entering this study

               5. Patients receiving any other chemotherapy or investigational agents

               6. Serious concomitant systemic disorders (including active infections) or
                  psychiatric illness/social situations that would compromise the safety of the
                  patient or compromise the patient's ability to complete the study, at the
                  discretion of the investigator.

               7. Liver function tests ≥ 20% of the institutional upper limits of normal

               8. Creatinine &gt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal

               9. ANC &lt; 1,500 /µL

                  biologic composition to black cohosh

              12. The effects of black cohosh on the developing human fetus at the recommended
                  therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential
                  must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth
                  control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation. Should a woman
                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
                  should inform her treating physician immediately.

              13. Prior/concurrent therapy including:

                  Tamoxifen, raloxifene, letrozole, anastrozole, or exemestane in the past 6 months

              14. Chemotherapy, biologic therapy (e.g., trastuzumab [Herceptin®]), or breast
                  radiotherapy to the breast currently affected by DCIS within the past 12 months

              15. Any exogenous hormonal therapy including estrogen-, progesterone-, and/or
                  androgen-based agents in the past 6 months

              16. Phytoestrogens or OTC medications with estrogenic or androgenic properties in the
                  past 6 months
