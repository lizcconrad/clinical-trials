  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to establish the best dose to safely infect healthy individuals with
      Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) via intravenous (IV) injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TÜCHMI-001 is a single center, open label, randomized and controlled human pilot study to
      optimize controlled human malaria infection(CHMI) administered by PfSPZ Challenge. Volunteers
      will be inoculated with PfSPZ Challenge. Controls will receive the PfSPZ Challenge by ID
      administration. The remaining volunteers will receive the PfSPZ Challenge by IV
      administration. All volunteers recruited will be healthy adults aged between 18 and 45 years.
      Safety and infectivity data will be collected for each of the regimens and dose-levels.

      Volunteers and clinical investigators will not be blinded to group allocation, however
      laboratory investigators processing blood films and samples for PCR analysis will be blinded
      to group allocation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The infectivity of the administration regimens will be assessed by thick film microscopy and PCR for P. falciparum DNA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 until day 21 or until treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Parasitology and parasite molecular biology tests: These tests are used to determine malaria parasites (thick blood smear and PCR). Both tests are performed at screening and then approximately every 12 hours during the period of intense observation from day 5 until day 21 or until treatment. Thereafter, these tests are performed during safety follow-ups at Days 28, 84, and 168. Turn over time for thick blood smear microscopy is &lt; 2 hours to ensure timely treatment in case of a positive result. PCR results are available only after study completion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The time from parasite inoculation to first detection of blood stage parasitemia will be assessed by thick blood film microscopy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5 until day 21 or until treatment</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The safety of PfSPZ Challenge administered ID or IV and the resultant P. falciparum infection will be assessed by analysing actively and passively collected data from clinical review of volunteers and laboratory measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening to Day 168</time_frame>
    <description>These tests include full blood picture (complete blood count), liver enzymes and creatinine. All of these will be performed once at screening, Day -1 (day before challenge), Day 21 when no parasitemia occurs until then and day of malaria diagnosis. Lastly, these tests will also be performed during safety follow up at Days 28, 84 and 168.</description>
