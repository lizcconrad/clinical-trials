  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to research the association between receiving Tysabri®
      (natalizumab), interferon beta-1a, glatiramer acetate or not having any treatment for your MS
      and how it may or may not impact certain white blood cells and other immunological markers.
      This information may be useful in identifying risk factors in developing progressive
      multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). It does appear that the risk increases with the total
      number of natalizumab infusions. Patients who have not yet started a disease modifying
      therapy or who have been on one other than natalizumab are needed as controls to see how
      these biomarkers change.

      Patients at various stages of natalizumab treatment as well as natalizumab naïve are needed
      to allow for analysis of the change in potential markers over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients at various timepoints in their MS treatment or who are beginning certain MS
      treatments will be consented and have blood specimens collected to allow for an immunological
      comparison. The decision to treat with disease modifying therapies is made independently from
      this observational study.

      Primary endpoint: To further understand the delineation of lymphocyte cell adhesion marker
      down regulation within a treatment naïve patient population and at various stages of
      treatment.

      Secondary endpoint: To understand the correlation between natalizumab pharmacodynamics,
      pharmacokinetics and lymphocyte cell adhesion marker down regulation.

      The results of various biomarkers and immunological testing (including CD62L, LFA-1, sCD62L,
      sLFA-1, sVCAM, VLA-4 saturation, IgG4, CBC with absolute differential) will be compared
      amongst the groups consented. The treatment naive group will be compared longitudinally.
