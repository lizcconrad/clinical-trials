        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18 and 27 kg/m^2, inclusive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormalities of physical examination, laboratory values, vital
             signs or ECG findings at the screening, as judged by the Investigator or
             Sub-Investigator

          -  Presence of acute or chronic illness sufficient to invalidate the subject's
             participation in the study or to make it unnecessarily hazardous, as judged by the
             Investigator

          -  Blood pressure in supine position at the screening, after resting for 5 min, outside
             the ranges 90-150 mmHg systolic or 40-90 mmHg diastolic

          -  Heart rate in supine position at the screening, after resting for 5 min, outside the
             range 40-100 beats/min

          -  Alcohol intake within 48 hours prior to the screening

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C antibodies or HIV (human immunodeficiency
             virus) antibodies positive

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal history or physical findings at the screening, which
             could interfere with the objectives of the study or the safety of the subject's
             participation, as judged by the Investigator

          -  History of significant allergy or hypersensitivity

          -  Known or suspected allergy to trial product or related products

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Smoking 10 cigarettes or more, or the equivalent, per day and is unwilling to refrain
             from smoking during 3 days prior to dosing and during the confinement period
