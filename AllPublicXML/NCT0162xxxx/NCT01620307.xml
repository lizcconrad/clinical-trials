  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe H1N1 pneumonia with acute respiratory failure shows hyperactive immune cells
      infiltration of lung. Rapamune, a mTOR inhibitor, modulates the immune response by blocking
      activation of T- and B-cells. To investigate the clinical efficiency of rapamune in severe
      H1N1 pneumonia with respiratory failure, this study was conducted.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From 2009 winter to 2011 spring, patients with flu-like symptoms in Chang Gung Memorial
      Hospital were screened by rapid antigen test and influenza subtype was confirmed by
      polymerization chain reaction (PCR). 38 H1N1 patients with severe hypoxemia
      [alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, (A-a) O2 gradient, &gt; 200 mmHg] requiring ventilator
      support were randomized to receive Rapamune (2mg/day) or not. Patients were then randomized
      to receive either Sirolimus (Rapamune 2mg/day, Pfizer) or not for a course of 14 days. The
      outcome variables include liberation of ventilator, ICU mortality, necessity of ECMO,
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and complications after admission to ICU
      were recorded. SOFA score composed of scores from six organ systems, graded from 0 to 4
      according to the degree of dysfunction/failure.

    <description>All patients were treated with Oseltamivir (Tamiflu, Roche) 50 mg twice a day for 10 days and oral prednisolone 20 mg/day for 14 days. At ICU admission, patients started on empiric antimicrobial therapy with moxifloxacin 500 mg per day until results of microbiological studies were available.
Each patient received best support treatment including mechanical ventilator, fluid resuscitation, gastrointestinal and thromboembolic prophylaxis, and enteral nutrition for most aspects of care. After radomization, patients were received Sirolimus (Rapamune 2mg/day, Pfizer)for a course of 14 days.</description>
