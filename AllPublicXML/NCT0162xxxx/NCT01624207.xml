    <textblock>
      The generic formulation of atorvastatin (Atorva®) 20mg was not inferior to the branded
      formulation of atorvastatin (Lipitor®) 20mg in this 8-week treatment of hyperlipidemic Korean
      patients. In PP analysis, the LDL cholesterol goal achievement rate was significantly higher
      in Atorva group. Both treatments were well tolerated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients were men or women aged between 20 and 79 years who have not achieved

             Panel Ⅲ (NCEP-ATP Ⅲ) guideline, with the treatment goal of LDL cholesterol being &lt;100
             mg/dL for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or CAD-equivalent disease, &lt;130
             mg/dL for patients with multiple risk factors (10-year coronary heart disease [CHD]

        Exclusion Criteria:

             unexplained serum creatinine kinase (CK) elevation &gt;2 times the ULN, chronic renal
             failure (a serum creatinine concentration &gt;2.5 mg/dL); in patients who experienced
