  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether attention bias modification training is an
      effective neurobehavioral therapy to improve depressive symptoms.That is whether attention
      bias modification training is superior to placebo in reducing depressive symptoms over 1 year
      after training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attentional bias has been theorized to play a critical role in the onset and maintenance of
      depression. Attentional bias modification training (ABMT), an experimental paradigm that uses
      training to induce adaptive attentional bias, was developed to test the causal model and this
      has therapeutic implications in depression.To test the effect of ABMT on treatment of
      depressive symptoms, a randomized, double-blind, placebo and blank controlled trial is
      conducted in college students who are experiencing mild-to-severe symptoms of depression.

    <description>Participants complete 8 sessions of attention bias modification training (ABMT) during a two-week period. ABMT is a modified dot probe task, in which a probe always appears in the location of neutral stimulus after the two stimuli (i.e. one is the depressive cue and the other is neutral) were simultaneously presented. In the ABMT,the probability that a probe appears in the location of neutral is 90%, and correspondingly,in the location of depressive stimuli is 10%. Each session consists of 218 trials, and the time to complete a training session is approximately 10 minutes.</description>

    <description>Participants complete 8 sessions of placebo training(PT) during a two-week period. Placebo training is a classic dot probe task, in which a probe appears after either of the locations that the two stimuli (i.e. one is the depressive cue and the other is neutral) were presented, with the same frequencies. In the PT condition, each session also consists of 218 trials, and the time to complete a PT session is approximately 10 minutes as well.</description>
