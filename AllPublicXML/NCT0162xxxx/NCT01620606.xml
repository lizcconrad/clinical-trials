  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is a common complaint of childhood, associated with
      considerable health care costs, disruption of normal activity, emotional distress, and
      long-term health effects. The study will test a treatment approach which, if successful,
      would substantially change the treatment for FAP and potentially for a wide range of
      childhood medical problems where parental responses to symptoms contribute to these adverse
      effects. The study would also provide a model which would be much more accessible than
      traditional face-to-face therapies to a broader range of families in need than are currently
      served.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional Abdominal Pain (FAP) affects 10 to 15% of children and has significant social,
      emotional, and financial costs, but no known organic cause and no accepted medical or
      behavioral treatment. The researchers have conducted studies that provide support for a
      theoretical model in which cognitive-behavioral and social learning processes (modeling
      and/or potentially reinforcing responses by parents) may contribute to the maintenance of
      illness behaviors and functional disability in children with FAP. The researchers
      subsequently tested a social learning and cognitive-behavioral intervention for parent-child
      dyads which focused on changing these parent behaviors as well as teaching coping skills to
      children. Results support the effectiveness of the intervention and the explanatory value of
      the theory, demonstrating that parental change is a key element in reducing children's
      symptoms. The proposed study will build on these findings by evaluating a parent-only
      intervention. Furthermore, our experience and that of other investigators indicates that
      alternative intervention models are needed for wider accessibility to the intervention for
      families in need. While a parent-only format is expected to increase accessibility, we will
      also evaluate the use of a remote telephone intervention.
