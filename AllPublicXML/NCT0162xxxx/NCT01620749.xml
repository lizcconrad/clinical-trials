        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any protocol-specific procedures

          -  Male and female patients with histologically confirmed melanoma

          -  At least one site of metastatic disease, as demonstrated on the pre-study 18F FDG
             PET/CT scan performed as part of routine clinical care

          -  Age &gt;/= 18 years

          -  Life expectancy &gt;/=3 months

          -  ECOG performance score of 0-2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding females

          -  Systemic anti-melanoma therapy within the 2 weeks prior to the pre-study 18F FDG
             PET/CT scan until after the 18F MEL050 PET/CT scan

          -  Patients whose clinical care may be compromised because of the delay resulting from
             performance of the 18F MEL050 PET/CT scan

          -  Patients whose only metastatic lesion is in the Central Nervous System

          -  Patients with urinary incontinence or patients who cannot comfortably hold their urine
             for more than 90 minutes

          -  Any serious medical condition which the investigator feels may interfere with the
             procedures or evaluations of the study

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with protocol and patients with a history of
             non compliance or inability to grant informed consent.
