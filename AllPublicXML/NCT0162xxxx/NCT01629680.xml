  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of common eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma are
      associated with ocular perfusion abnormalities. Although this is well recognized there is not
      much possibility to improve blood flow to the posterior pole of the eye in these diseases.

      For many years, moxaverine has been used in the therapy of perfusion abnormalities in the
      brain, the heart and the extremities. This is based on a direct vasodilatatory effect of the
      drug, but also on the rheological properties of red blood cells. In two recent studies the
      investigators have shown that intravenous moxaverine increases choroidal and retrobulbar
      blood flow in healthy young subjects, in elderly people with healthy eyes and in patients
      with eye diseases associated with hypoperfusion. The present study aims to investigate,
      whether ocular blood flow is also improved after oral administration of moxaverine.
