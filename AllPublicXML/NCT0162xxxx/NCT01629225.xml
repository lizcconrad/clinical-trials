    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between GRK4 polymorphisms and
      essential hypertension in southwestern Han Chinese and test whether these polymorphisms were
      associated with the changes in blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension treated
      with angiotensin II Type antagonist candesartan.

      All antihypertensive agents were withdrawn before the start of a 4-6 week, single-blind,
      after which the patients received candesartan 10 mg or 20mg once daily as monotherapy in a
      single-blind fashion. The doses were doubled after 1 weeks if DBP was ≥ 90 mmHg.
