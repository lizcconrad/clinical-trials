      To investigate effect of genetic variations on the toxicities and find optimal target
      population, the investigators planned to analyze the genetic polymorphisms of
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.

    <textblock>
      Transfusion-associated iron overload induces systemic toxicity. Recently, deferasirox, a
      convenient long acting oral agent, has been introduced in clinical practice with promising
      efficacy. However, some patients experience drug-related toxicities and cannot tolerate it.
      To investigate effect of genetic variations on the toxicities and find optimal target
      population, we planned to analyze the genetic polymorphisms of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A
      (UGT1A) subfamily, multi-drug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and breast cancer
      resistance protein (BCRP) among pediatric patients received deferasirox.

    <description>Genetic polymorphism associated with side effects of deferasirox
- Side effects:
Increased AST or ALT &gt; 5 x ULN or increased bilirubin &gt; 3 x ULN which was thought to be caused by deferasirox Serum creatinine level increase &gt; 50% above the baseline value.
Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA
Candidate genes exhibit polymorphisms and encodes proteins that are involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of deferasirox.
