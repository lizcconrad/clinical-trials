  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin and/or clopidogrel users are increasing due to increased prevalence of cardiovascular
      or cerebrovascular disease with an aging society in Korea. Also, the patients having
      endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early
      gastric cancer or gastric premalignant lesions including adenoma and dysplasia are increasing
      among aspirin and/or clopidogrel users. Practically, aspirin or clopidogrel is recommended to
      be stopped for 5~14 days before EMR or ESD because bleeding risk during or after procedure.
      And it is recommended to restart of aspirin and/or clopidogrel as soon as possible if
      immediate bleeding during or after the procedure is not occurred in consideration of
      thromboembolic risk. However, early restarting of aspirin and/or clopidogrel raise the risk
      of delayed bleeding and the risk of complications associated with delayed ulcer healing.
      Although it is important to determine the timing of restarting aspirin and/or clopidogrel in
      consideration of complications of post-EMR/ESD ulcer and thromboembolic risk, there is no
      definite guideline about the timing of restarting aspirin and/or clopidogrel.

      This study is aimed to determine the timing of restarting aspirin and/or clopidogrel for the
      patients having EMR or ESD among aspirin and/or clopidogrel users. The investigators planned
      to compare the delayed bleeding rate and ulcer healing rate in patients with post-EMR/ESD
      ulcer when take proton pump inhibitor (pantoprazole 40 mg per day) between the patients
      restarting aspirin and/or clopidogrel within 3~4 days after the procedure and the patients
      restarting aspirin and/or clopidogrel 2 weeks after the procedure during 4 weeks. The primary
      endpoint is delayed ulcer bleeding rate at 4 weeks after EMR/ESD. The secondary end point is
      ulcer healing rate within 4 weeks.
