  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the most common reason that patients present to an emergency department (ED) and is
      often inadequately managed. Evidence suggests that acupuncture is effective for pain relief,
      yet it is rarely practiced in the ED.

      In 1998, a United States National Institute of Health Consensus Conference Panel reviewed the
      status of acupuncture and concluded that: &quot;There is sufficient evidence of acupuncture's
      value to expand its use into conventional medicine and to encourage further studies of its
      physiology and clinical value.&quot; Similarly, in 2002, the World Health Organisation (WHO)
      stated that acupuncture is a safe, simple and convenient therapy and that its effectiveness
      as analgesia has been established in controlled clinical studies.

      Notwithstanding these difficulties, it has been shown that acupuncture analgesia in the
      treatment of chronic pain is comparable to morphine and that its better safety profile and
      lack of dependence makes it the preferred method of choice for these conditions.

      There are very few clinical trials of acupuncture for acute pain to inform clinical practice;
      that's why we have the idea to do this study in our emergency department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and the tolerance of acupuncture compared to
      intravenous morphine in the management of acute pain.

      The results will also identify the impact that acupuncture treatment may have upon health
      resource utilization in the ED setting.

      It is a randomized, prospective, controlled, conducted into emergency department. Acupuncture
      will be applied according to Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of
      Acupuncture (STRICTA).

      In all included we recorded at baseline :

      Age, sex, job, comorbidity, hour of beginning of pain. Injury nature and severity assessed by
      the Injury Severity Score (ISS) Mechanism of the injury and radiologic findings. VAPS :
      0-100%

    <description>-Group Acupuncture: Receiving protocol of acupuncture. Acupuncture is performed by a trained certificied resident.
The protocols, which allow acupuncture points to be selected from a pool of pre-determined points for each condition, provide sufficient standardization to assist replication, yet are flexible enough to allow individualized treatments. These protocols also allow for additional points, such as 'ashi points', to be used at the discretion of the acupuncturist. The location of the points, angle of insertion and depth of insertion were sourced from a popular text 'A Manual of Acupuncture'.
-Group Morphine: Receiving 5mg of morphine followed by intravenous administration of 2,5 mg morphine each 5 min, until VAPS becomes &lt;30%. Treatment failure is defined as VAPS&gt;30 %, 30min after beginning of the protocol. In this case, analgesic treatment was administered according to the treating physician discretion.</description>
