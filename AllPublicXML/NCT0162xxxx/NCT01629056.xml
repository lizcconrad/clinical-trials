  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the benefit of a new impedance-based computer software
      application during routine catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation, to see if this
      information improves short and long term electrical disconnection of the pulmonary veins.
      This study will be a single blind prospective randomised control trial in patients undergoing
      AF ablation. Study participants will be randomly assigned to undergo parts of their pulmonary
      vein ablation with, and parts of their ablation without tissue contact data displayed for the
      doctor performing the ablation to see. The pulmonary veins will then be studied at the end of
      the procedure, and at any repeat procedure in the future, to look for a difference in the
      recovery rate of the ablations performed using contact data, compared to those ablations
      performed without the use of this contact data. If a reduction in tissue recovery is achieved
      through the use of this tissue contact data, it may lead in the future to a reduced need for
      repeat ablation procedures, and better outcomes for patients.

      The investigators hypothesise that the use of the Ensite™ Contact™ ECI data will reduce the
      recovery of conduction, and promote long-term pulmonary vein isolation in patients undergoing
      left atrial ablation for atrial fibrillation.
