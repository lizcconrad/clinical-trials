      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the dose of radiation to the tumor
      but not the surrounding healthy tissue could be increased by using intensity-modulated photon
      therapy (IMRT) or intensity-modulated proton beam therapy (IMPT).

      In Phase I of the study, researchers want to find the highest tolerable dose of IMPT or IMRT
      that can be given to the tumor.

      In Phase II, researchers want to learn if IMPT can help to control the disease compared with
      standard proton therapy when both are combined with standard chemotherapy. Participants will
      also receive standard chemotherapy. Proton therapy and photon therapy are types of radiation
      therapy that are designed to use a beam of proton or photon particles (similar to getting an
      x-ray) to send radiation inside the body to the tumor.

      In IMPT and IMRT, the amount or strength of the protons or photons will be adjusted according
      to the size, shape, and thickness of the tumor. In this study, the tumor will receive a
      higher dose by adjusting the energy and scanning time of the protons or photons, which is
      called simultaneous integrated boost (SIB). The treatment will be done with image guidance.
      This newer type of radiation is designed to give a higher than standard dose of treatment to
      the tumor. It is also designed to focus the treatment on the tumor to avoid affecting the
      healthy tissue around the tumor as much as standard treatments.

      Study Groups:

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a
      study group based on when they join this study. Up to 5 groups of 3 participants will be
      enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study, and up to 100 participants will be enrolled in
      Phase II.

      If participant is enrolled in the Phase I portion, the dose of radiation therapy they receive
      will depend on when they joined this study. The first group of participants will receive the
      lowest dose level of radiation therapy. Each new group will receive a higher dose of
      radiation therapy than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This
      will continue until the highest tolerable dose of radiation therapy is found.

      If participant is enrolled in the Phase I portion, they will be randomly assigned (as in the
      flip of a coin) to receive either IMRT or IMPT. Participant will have an equal chance of
      being assigned to either group.

      If participant is enrolled in the Phase II portion, they will be randomly assigned (as in the
      flip of a coin) to receive either IMRT or IMPT. Participant will have an equal chance of
      being assigned to either group. For both IMRT and IMPT, participant will receive the highest
      tolerable dose that was tolerated in the phase 1 portion of the trial.

      Radiation Therapy Administration:

      Participant will first go through the standard radiation treatment planning procedure, called
      the marking session. This will include a PET/CT, MRI, or CT scan of the lung. A cradle will
      then be made to hold participant in the treatment position. After the marking session, a
      radiation plan will be made.

      Receiving IMRT and IMPT SIB treatments is very similar to the way a CT scan is performed.
      Participant will lie on a table and the treatment machine rotates around them without
      touching their body.

      Participant will receive up to 6 weeks of photon or proton therapy given 1 time a day, 5 days
      a week (Monday through Friday).

      Each daily treatment should take about 20-30 minutes to complete. Most of this time is used
      to position participant correctly before the machine is turned on. The actual time used to
      give the radiation should take about 3-5 minutes each day.

      Chemotherapy:

      Participant will also receive chemotherapy as part of the standard of care for the disease.
      The drugs participant receives will depend on the type of disease and what the study doctor
      thinks is in participant's best interest. Participant will sign a separate consent form to
      receive these drugs that includes their potential risks and benefits, as well as how they are
      given.

      Symptom Questionnaire:

      Participant will complete a symptom questionnaire. This will be done on the following
      schedule.

        -  before chemoradiation beings

        -  each week during chemoradiation

        -  each week until 16 weeks after chemoradiation is complete

        -  every other week from Week 16 until 12 weeks after chemoradiation is complete

        -  at participant's follow-up visits

      The symptom questionnaire should take about 10 minutes to complete each time.

      Study Visits:

      At least 1 time each week during chemoradiation (chemotherapy and radiation):

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Participant will be asked about any side effects they may have had.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Length of Treatment:

      Participant may continue receiving study treatment for up to 6 weeks. Participant will no
      longer be able to receive the study treatment if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if they are unable to follow study directions.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      After participant has completed chemoradiation, the study staff will call them 1 time each
      month to ask them about any symptoms they may have until 6 months after chemoradiation. Each
      phone call should last about 10 minutes.

      Participant will have their first follow-up visit 4-8 weeks after they have completed
      chemoradiation. Participant will have additional follow-up visits every 3-4 months from then
      on.

      At participant's first and second follow-up visit:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Participant will have PET/CT scans and SPECT scans to check their lungs and heart if the
           study doctor thinks it is needed.

      The remaining follow-up visits will include standard tests, a physical exam, and procedures
      that the doctor thinks are needed. For example, PET/CT and SPECT scans will be repeated any
      time the study doctor thinks they are needed.

      This is an investigational study. Photon therapy by IMRT and proton therapy by IMPT are
      delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. It is investigational to use
      SIB of IMRT and IMPT to learn if it is a better way to give a higher dose of treatment to the
      tumor while not damaging as much of the healthy tissue around it.

      Up to 100 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
