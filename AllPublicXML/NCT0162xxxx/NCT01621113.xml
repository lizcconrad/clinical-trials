      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment
      with dalfampridine in combination with locomotor training in persons with chronic, motor
      incomplete SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests that combining therapies could result in important gains in restoring
      function and improving quality of life in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Locomotor
      training is an activity-dependent rehabilitation therapy that provides repetitive stepping
      facilitated by manual assistance and body weight support on a treadmill. Recent studies
      report improvements in walking and standing in individuals with motor incomplete SCI that
      have undergone intensive standardized locomotor training therapy. Extended release
      dalfampridine (also known as fampridine or 4-aminopyridine [4-AP]) is a broad spectrum
      potassium channel blocker that has been shown in animal studies to increase conduction of
      action potentials in demyelinated axons. Dalfampridine was recently approved by the U.S. Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment to improve walking in persons with multiple
      sclerosis (MS). Demyelination is also a prominent feature of incomplete SCI that contributes
      to the clinical presentation of persons with these injuries.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of treatment
      with dalfampridine in combination with locomotor training in persons with chronic, motor
      incomplete SCI. We hypothesize that persons undergoing combination therapy with dalfampridine
      and locomotor training will show significantly greater improvements in walking speed and
      other measures of SCI function than those receiving locomotor training alone.
