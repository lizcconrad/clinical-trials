      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of whole body periodic acceleration
      for helping with symptoms of aches and pains suffered by many patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded cross-over study of whole-body periodic acceleration (WBPA) to ascertain
      if this treatment modality provides symptomatic relief of pain, stiffness, and abnormal gait
      and balance in a variety of conditions. The study will compare a specific mechanism of
      motion, whole-body periodic acceleration (WBPA), that has been shown to increase the release
      of beneficial mediators from the vascular endothelium into the circulation, to a control
      condition of slow passive motion that promotes relaxation but does not increase release of
      beneficial mediators into the circulation. The study tests the efficacy and safety of a
      commercially available device that consists of a motion platform, called Exer-RestÂ©, that is
      capable of producing both types of motion to be tested. In this investigation, 15 subjects
      will be randomly assigned to either procedure for 10 treatments for 2 weeks followed by a
      one-week &quot;wash-out&quot; period. Then the opposite treatment will be employed for two weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects qualifying for this study satisfy the following criteria:

          1. Over 18 years of age;

          2. Complain of either chronic pain, joint stiffness, and/or dysfunctions of gait and
             balance;

          3. Complaints have been annotated by a competent physician, and the subject has been
             evaluated for conditions that commonly contribute to the respective symptoms;

          4. Capable of completing the appropriate testing and baseline assessments, such as
             quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and questionnaires;

          5. Tolerate the motion and duration of treatment of the WBPA.

          6. Be available for regular visits to the research site for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        WBPA is contraindicated for subjects who are pregnant or who suffer with unexplained leg
        pain, skin eruptions, or who have unstable spinal injuries or conditions. Subjects who
        cannot tolerate the motion and duration of treatment are also excluded.
