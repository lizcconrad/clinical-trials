    <description>The primary outcome of the current study is the disease control according to the HER2 status. That is, the % of the patients who maintains at least stable disease by RECIST v1.1 at the time of the second tumor evaluation which will be taken at 6~8 weeks later after the first evaluation. The comparison will be done by Pearsons's chi-square test.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed metastatic, or recurrent AGC

          2. Previous use of fluoropyrimidine as palliative chemotherapy. Concurrent use of
             platinum is permitted. Patient with recurred disease within 6 months after the end of
             adjuvant therapy can participate to this trial.

          3. Documented HER2 expression status.

          4. Radiologically proven progression of disease.

          5. Age &gt; 20 years

          6. ECOG PS 0 - 2

          7. Life expectancy more than 3 months

          8. Adequate organ function for treatment including liver, kidney and bone marrow
             (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/ul, platelets ≥ 100,000/ul, AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x
             ULN, ≤ 5.0 x ULN if liver involvement, Total serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL)

          9. Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior administration of taxane or anthracycline as palliative chemotherapy. If those
             agents were used as adjuvant or neoadjuvant aim, at least 6 months should be passed.

          2. Uncontrolled medical comorbidities Congestive heart failure (NYHA class III or IV)
             Recent (within 6 months) unstable angina or myocardial infarct Clinically significant
             cardiac arrhythmia LVEF &lt; 45% Liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B or C) Interstitial
             pneumonia Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements

          3. Active CNS metastasis not controllable with radiation or steroid

          4. Concurrent administration of systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Palliative
             radiotherapy for pain control more than 2 weeks ago is acceptable.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women.

          6. Peripheral neuropathy G3~4.

          7. Metachronous malignancy other than adequately treated CIN of uterine cervix, basal
             cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
