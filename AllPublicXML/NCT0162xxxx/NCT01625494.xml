      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the proportion of patients with controlled Office Blood Pressure Measurements
      (OBPM), defined as Systolic blood pressure &lt; 140 mmHg and Diastolic blood pressure &lt;90mmHg,
      at the end of the study

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To examine over time the antihypertensive effect of the 4 doses of the fixed combination
           therapy irbesartan/amlodipine on OBPM (SBP (systolic blood pressure) and DBP (diastolic
           blood pressure)

        -  To examine the proportion of patients with controlled OBPM (systolic BP&lt;140 mm Hg and
           diastolic BP&lt;90 mmHg) of the different dose groups over time

        -  To determine the incidence and severity of adverse events.

        -  V1 (week 0): Inclusion visit.

        -  V2 (Week 4): Irbesartan/amlodipine 150/5 mg fixed combination visit

        -  V3 (Week 8): 1st dose escalation for patients in whom OBPM is not controlled (SBP ≥ 140
           mmHg or DBP ≥ 90mmHg,

        -  V4 (Week 12): 2nd Dose escalation visit for patients in whom OBPM is not controlled (SBP
           ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90mmHg
