  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden of tobacco use falls disproportionately on low-income populations, through high
      rates of primary smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. The remarkable progress in
      creating smoke-free environments in the U.S. over the past two decades has left smoker's
      homes as one of the primary sources of exposure to secondhand smoke for both children and
      nonsmoking adults. Intervention research that identifies effective and practical strategies
      for reaching the minority of households that still allow smoking in the home has considerable
      potential to reduce smoke exposure, but suitable channels to reach low-income families are
      limited. The proposed research will develop, evaluate and disseminate a brief smoke-free
      homes intervention through the established national infrastructure of 2-1-1 call centers.
      2-1-1 is a nationally designated 3-digit telephone exchange, similar to 9-1-1 for emergencies
      or 4-1-1 for directory assistance, that links callers to community-based health and social
      services.

      The proposed research has four specific aims: 1) Conduct formative research on intervention
      messages and materials for promoting smoke-free homes in low-income populations, applicable
      to both smokers and nonsmokers as household change agents; 2) Conduct a randomized controlled
      trial in the Atlanta 2-1-1 service area to evaluate the efficacy of a brief intervention to
      create smoke-free homes among 2-1-1 callers; 3) Conduct replication studies in Houston and
      North Carolina 2-1-1 systems to systematically test the intervention in varied populations
      and tobacco control climates, and 4) Disseminate the research-tested smoke-free homes
      intervention through a variety of mechanisms including a national grants program to 2-1-1
      systems and through the Tobacco Technical Assistance Consortium's linkages to the state and
      local tobacco control infrastructure in the U.S.
