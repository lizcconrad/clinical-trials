      The aim of this study is to determine the nutritional status, and factors affecting
      malnutrition in older people staying in hospitals.

      Objectives:

        -  To recruit a sample of older people in hospital

        -  To collect information on nutritional status, satisfaction with food-related life and
           experience with access to food in hospital.

        -  To assess the staffing attitudes to nutritional care of the older adult

        -  To undertake an audit of therapeutic ('special') diets served in hospitals, with respect
           to their nutritional adequacy and wastage

        -  To investigate predictors and correlates of malnutrition within the hospital setting and
           compare these relationships with those previously identified in care homes and the
           community.

        -  To make recommendations for practice to improve the nutritional status of hospitalised
           older adults.
