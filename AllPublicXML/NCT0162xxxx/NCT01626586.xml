  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study the investigators want more about how being in a group about diabetes
      helps your family versus individual treatment. The investigators are asking youth with
      diabetes and their parents to be in the research, because the investigators want to see if
      this diabetes group and/or individual therapy is helpful to your coping, adjustment, and
      family communication about diabetes.

      The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects the Group Therapy Project has
      on parents and child's management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) from both a group versus
      an individual therapy modality. We want to start a group and individual therapy program that
      looks at youth and family adjustment and coping at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital with
      patients who have T1DM. There has been research before on this group therapy and we want to
      look at it in a &quot;typical&quot; clinical setting at Cincinnati Children's Hospital for both group
      and individual therapy. This research is being done to understand how a peer and family-based
      group versus individual therapy can be helpful by looking at survey data as well as medical
      data before and after participating in the diabetes therapy program. This information will
      help us further develop prevention and intervention programs for other youth with T1DM and
      their families.

    <description>This study includes having an initial assessment completed; participating in a 6 session group therapy intervention over a 7 week time period; and returning at 2 and 4 months after group therapy intervention for &quot;booster&quot; follow-up sessions. During the group intervention sessions, the parent group and the youth group will each meet for about 45 minutes and then the families will come together to work on family goals for the last 15 to 20 minutes.</description>
