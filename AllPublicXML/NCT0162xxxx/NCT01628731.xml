      This study aims to verify if ethacrynic acid continuous infusion is superior to furosemide
      continuous infusion in total urine output production during the first 24 post operative
      hours.

      Diuretic therapy in children after open heart surgery is widely administered, though no
      evidence currently supports if an ideal drug or an ideal dosage can be recommended. Loop
      diuretics are the most effective drugs in terms of urine output production but may cause some
      collateral effects such as metabolic alkalosis, hypovolemia, hypokalemia, ototoxicity.
      Furthermore, some reports showed that loop diuretics usage can be associated with an
      increased risk of renal dysfunction and mortality. However, their use in children with signs
      of fluid overload, pulmonary edema or oliguria is mandatory and widely practiced.

      Furosemide and ethacrynic acid are often prescribed and administered without any specific
      indication, basing on clinicians preferences.

      No study so far, explored the hypothesis of which of these drugs is the most effective in
      terms of urine output production and safe in terms of renal function.

      This study aims to verify if ethacrynic acid continuous infusion is superior to furosemide
      continuous infusion in total urine output production during the first 24 post operative
      hours.
