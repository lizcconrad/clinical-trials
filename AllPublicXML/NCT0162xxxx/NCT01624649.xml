  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to explore the efficacy of methylphenidate
      hydrochloride in children and adolescents diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) by Kiddie-scheduled for affective disorders (SADS)-present and life time
      version (K-SADS-PL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 1-year open-label (all people involved know the identity of the assigned drug),
      multicenter, single arm, prospective, observational study to explore under natural setting
      the efficacy of drug treatment in children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD by K-SADS-PL
      (K-SADS-PL is a tool used for ADHD diagnosis. Patient may be diagnosed with ADHD by using
      K-SADS-PL to check if he or she meets the criteria according to Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of Mental Disorders &amp; edition (DSM-IV). After obtaining informed consent, investigator
      will prescribe stimulant or non-stimulant ADHD treatment medications (ie, Immediate release
      [IR]/extended release [ER]/osmotic release oral system (OROS) methylphenidate, atomoxetine).
      Efficacy and safety assessments will be performed at 4, 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks after the
      first day of giving study drug. Progression of symptom improvement and adherence will be
      investigated and associated variables (ie, demographic, clinical, familial and treatment
      factors) will be analyzed.

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Ratings are 1 = normal/not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = extremely ill.</description>

    <measure>Academic Performance Rating Scale (APRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24 and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>APRS is a 19-item scale, where parents rate the child's academic abilities and behaviors on a 5-point scale. Higher scores indicate greater academic performance.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression- Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I is a 7 point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. It is rated as 1, every much improved; 2, much improved; 3, minimally improved; 4, no change; 5, minimally worse; 6, much worse; or 7, very much worse.</description>
