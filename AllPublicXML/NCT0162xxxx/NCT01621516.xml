  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Under chronic immunosuppressive and corticosteroid therapy, transplant patients have a
      tendency to develop in the long-term diabetes. Patients who have received extra pancreatic
      tissue with their liver and small bowel transplantation have not yet developed insulin
      resistance or diabetes mellitus. We would like to investigate to which level insulin
      secretory capacity the extra pancreas together with the native pancreas has in these
      transplant patients using the hyperglycemic clamp. These data will be compared with the data
      obtained from healthy controls.

      The glycemic control in type 1 diabetic recipients of islet cell grafts is correlated with
      the ß-cell mass. In the standard technique for liver/small bowel transplant procedure
      previously described by Grant et al, the pancreas was removed. This surgical method was
      modified by Sudan et al and the donor pancreas was transplanted intact in these non-diabetic
      patients. Under chronic immunosuppressive and corticosteroid therapy, these patients with
      extra ß-cell mass have not developed insulin resistance or diabetes mellitus. To which level
      insulin secretory capacity the extra pancreas allograft together with the native pancreas has
      in these transplant patients are not yet known.

      Among the measures of pancreatic ß-cell-secretory capacity, the first-phase and steady state
      insulin secretion from the hyperglycemic clamp studies are believed to give the most robust
      estimates. Moreover, the hyperglycemic clamp and the euglycemic clamp yield comparable
      estimates of insulin sensitivity and, so that under appropriate conditions, the hyperglycemic
      clamp technique may be used to assess both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion in the
      same individual in a single experiment.
