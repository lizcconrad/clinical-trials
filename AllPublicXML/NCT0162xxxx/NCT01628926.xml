    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score (UPDRS) Part 3 Sum Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 16 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 3 sum score (on state) at 16 weeks after dosing.
UPDRS is a scale for monitoring Parkinson's Disease-related disability and impairment. The UPDRS consists of the following four sub-scales. Part 1: Mentation, Part 2: Activities of Daily Living, Part 3: Motor, Part 4: Complications. Part 3 assesses 14 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>

    <measure>UPDRS Part 3 Sum Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 8 and 10 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 3 sum score (on state) at 8 and 10 weeks after dosing.
UPDRS Part 3 assesses 14 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>UPDRS Part 2 Sum Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 2 sum score (average scores of on state and off state) at 16 weeks after dosing.
UPDRS 2 assesses 13 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Off Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in off time at 16 weeks after dosing. Off-time is a state where L-Dopa becomes ineffective. Off-time was measured by patient diary in hours/day.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in PDSS-2 sum score at 16 weeks after dosing. PDSS-2 is a scale for assessing sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease. PDSS consists of 15 questions about sleep and nocturnal disturbances. The score of each question ranges from 0 (never) to 4 (very frequent). The sum of each question serves as the scale score. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks after dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Change (LOCF) from baseline in CGI score. CGI improvement is a clinician-reported scale for assessing how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened from baseline.
The scale scoring criteria are 1: very much improved, 2: much improved, 3: minimally improved, 4: no change, 5: minimally worse, 6: much worse, 7: very much worse. A decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>

        <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in UPDRS Part 3 sum score (on state) at 16 weeks after dosing.
UPDRS is a scale for monitoring Parkinson's Disease-related disability and impairment. The UPDRS consists of the following four sub-scales. Part 1: Mentation, Part 2: Activities of Daily Living, Part 3: Motor, Part 4: Complications. Part 3 assesses 14 items. Each item is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum score serves as the sub-scale score. A higher score indicates a greater severity of symptoms. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>

        <description>Mean change (LOCF) from baseline in PDSS-2 sum score at 16 weeks after dosing. PDSS-2 is a scale for assessing sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease. PDSS consists of 15 questions about sleep and nocturnal disturbances. The score of each question ranges from 0 (never) to 4 (very frequent). The sum of each question serves as the scale score. Thus a decrease in the scores means improvement.</description>
