    <time_frame>3 years after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy is the standard of care for node positive cervical cancer. While there are several acceptable means to boost the disease in the low pelvis (i.e. brachytherapy, IMRT, or external beam), there is limited research into boosting gross disease in the pelvis or para-aortic region. This protocol is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of treating tumor bearing regions within the abdomen and pelvis, using an integrated boost technique and concurrent chemotherapy.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks following treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Acute DLT will be defined based on the side effects inherent from radiation therapy for gynecologic cancers, including effects on bowel, bladder, and skin.Since integrated radiation dose escalation is unlikely to substantially affect the hematopoietic system, only non-hematologic, grade 3-4, acute toxicity will be considered the primary dose-limiting toxicity (acute DLT). Dose limiting toxicity will include any of the following during treatment or within 6 weeks of completion:
Acute Grade 3-4 enteritis or proctitis
Acute Grade 3-4 bladder toxicity
Acute Grade 4 dermatologic toxicity</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of late dose limiting toxicities (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years following treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Late DLTs will be defined at grade 3-4 GI or GU toxicity with onset after 6 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <description>Many studies have utilized a sequential boost to deliver a total dose of 55 - 60 Gy to the pelvic sidewall (covering the lower pelvic lymph nodes), including 8-10 Gy that is usually delivered with brachytherapy (1-3). This study treatment plan will escalate the dose to pelvic and para-aortic nodal disease from 60 Gy in 2.4 Gy per fraction to 70Gy in 2.8 Gy per fraction in 3 dose cohorts, using an integrated boost technique utilizing the same number of fractions for all cohorts (25 fractions) while the elective volumes are held constant at 45Gy</description>
