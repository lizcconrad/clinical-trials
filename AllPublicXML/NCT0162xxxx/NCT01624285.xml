    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate) is a safe and
      effective treatment option for preventing liver cancer in high risk patients following liver
      transplantation. Liver transplantation is a treatment option for liver cancer patients, but
      despite transplantation, the liver cancer can recur in the new, transplanted liver. It is not
      known whether sorafenib is effective in preventing cancer recurrence in high risk patients
      following liver transplantation

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Two-year recurrence free survival (RFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. One-year recurrence free survival. II. Overall survival (OS). III. Safety. IV. Impact of
      drug-drug interactions (i.e. immunosuppression agents). V. Impact of biomarkers
      (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], protein-induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II [PIVKA II]).

      VI. Effects of therapy on wound healing. VII. Impact of hepatitis C viral recurrence.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID).

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID.

      In both arms treatment continues for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
