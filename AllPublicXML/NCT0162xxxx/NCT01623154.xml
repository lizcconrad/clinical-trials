    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare between the POCone® to the UBiT®-IR300 in measuring
      13CO2/12CO2 ratio in breath samples when used together with the BreathTek® UBT (urea breath
      test) Kit and the pUHR-CA web-based software program in identifying H. pylori infection in
      pediatric subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The same patients will be tested on both the POCone® and UBiT®-IR300. If the patients test
      positive for H. pylori, they will be given eradication medication and brought back in for a
      re-test.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Post Dose (15 min)</time_frame>
    <description>The study end-points are UHR values derived from DOB (delta over baseline) values obtained from the POCone and UBiT-IR300 (UHRP and UHRU, respectively) at Baseline and Post-Dose. Same patients will be tested on both the POCone and UBiT-IR300.
Subjects fasted for at least 1 hr prior test. Each patient provided breath samples in 3 blue (Baseline) breath bags-labeled &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot;. Subjects were given Pranactin-Citric solution (4oz) to drink, waited 15 min and collected 3 pink (post-dose) bags which were paired with the baseline bags in no particular order. Each pair was tested on both machines. The first two available pairs of UHR values were used for data analysis. The 3rd pair was used only if one of the first two samples did not produce a valid test result.
DOB values were generated by the two instruments for each Baseline and Post Dose pair. UHR values were claculated based on the DOB values and the subject's anthropometric variables (age, gender, ehight and body weight).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Tested Positive/Negative for H. Pylori</measure>
    <time_frame>Single Study Visit (1 hour of testing)</time_frame>
    <description>Qualified subjects from clinical sites underwent a standard urea breath test using the BreathTek UBT Kit. Breath samples were analyzed using both the POCone and the UBiT-IR300. DOB values from these two infrared spectrophotometers were converted to respective UHR values using pUHR-CA. The paired UHR values from each subject were evaluated for agreement.
UHR values of &gt;10 µg/min were considered positive for H. pylori and UHR values of &lt;10 µg/min were considered negative for H. pylori.</description>

Each pair was tested on both machines. The first two available pairs of UHR values were used for data analysis. The 3rd pair was used only if one of the first two samples did not produce a valid test result.
DOB values were generated by the two instruments for each Baseline and Post Dose pair. UHR values were claculated based on the DOB values and the subject's anthropometric variables (age, gender, ehight and body weight).</description>
          <population>Evaluable patients must drink all of the Pranactin-citric solution. Though all three sets of bags were analysed, the first two sets of valid values were used for analysis, regardless of the set designation (A, B or C). The values of individual sets (A, B or C) were not analyzed.</population>
