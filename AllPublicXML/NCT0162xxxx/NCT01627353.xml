    <textblock>
      The study is a blinded randomized clinical trial, comparing policies of high volume
      preemptive wound infiltration with a specific anesthetic cocktail versus standard of care (no
      wound infiltration and routine anesthesia) for post operative pain management after
      hysterectomy. Morphine use and pain will be measured during index admission, and pain will
      also be measured six weeks postoperatively. The study will be conducted at a single site,
      Rockyview General Hospital.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Operative Morphine</measure>
    <time_frame>For the entire post-operative hospital admission (3 days on average)</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of post operative morphine (PCA IV) will be recorded from the PCA device each day by the Acute Pain Service Nurses. The total dose (mg morphine) will be recorded for each 24 hour period, and summed for the complete postoperative period of admission.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain measurement using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) post operatively</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily until discharge (3 days on average)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete pain VAS in recovery and each hospital day post operatively until discharge.
The majority of papers comparing acute postoperative pain use a VAS. It is a simple measure that is easy to use by patients and currently in use by nurses at our site both in the post anesthetic recovery room and on the units. The VAS measures patient perceived pain intensity on a 10cm single axis scale ranging from no pain (0 cm) to worst pain ever experienced (10cm).</description>

The Anesthetic will be given as determined appropriate to the patient by the staff anesthetist with the addition of the following: 2 grams of Magnesium Sulphate, 10 mg of Dexamethasone, and 3 mg/kg of Lidocaine, half of which is given on induction and half of which is infused throughout the remainder of the case.</description>
