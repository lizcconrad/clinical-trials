      This clinical trial studies a supportive education program for Latina breast cancer
      survivors. The Bilingual Breast Cancer Education Intervention (BBCEI) may help Latina breast
      cancer survivors know what to expect after completing breast cancer treatment and prepare
      them to cope with cancer related survivorship issues

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. Describe the feasibility of implementing the BBCEI. II. Describe the
      cultural and linguistic appropriateness of the BBCEI. III. Determine topics requiring further
      emphasis in the BBCEI. IV. Identify ways to enhance program content, format, and materials.
      OUTLINE: Participants undergo 2 tailored BBCEI sessions within 1 month. At the beginning of
      the first session the research nurse will present the participants with a list of common
      physical and social concerns. The participant will then be asked to identify 3 topics that
      she wants to discuss. The research nurse will discuss with the participant any relevant
      supportive care resources and make the appropriate referrals. At the second session the focus
      of the BBCEI will be on psychological and spiritual well-being.
