      Advanced heart failure therapy (heart transplantation or LVAD) is underutilized and patients
      are underserved. The purpose of this prospective, observational study is to obtain
      multi-center data on the proportion of patients with CRT and/or ICD who are candidates for
      advanced heart failure treatment and obtain insights into patient and physician decisions
      regarding referral for advanced heart failure therapy.
