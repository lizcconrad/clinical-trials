  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and antitumor activity
      of WT2725. WT2725 will be administered to patients with advanced malignancies known to
      overexpress WT1
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with other WT1 vaccines in clinical trials has shown evidence of immunogenicity and
      clinical response in various malignancies.

      This study will assist with determining which dose level(s) to use in future clinical studies
      and will evaluate both clinical and immunological response.
