      This study is designed as a prospective, consecutive series outcomes study. Patients
      presenting with knee pain associated with bone marrow lesions that meet the inclusion
      criteria will be eligible to undergo Subchondroplasty procedure. The subjects will be
      followed for twenty-four (24) months after surgery via office visits and will be contacted
      once per year for up to 5 years post-operatively and asked questions regarding their pain and
      functioning to further understand long-term outcomes.. Seventy (70), a ( minimum of sixty-two
      (62)) patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Up to
      5 sites will participate in this study. The study is intended to provide an estimate of
      one-year and two-year clinical success with minimum bias and with sufficient statistical
      precision to permit meaningful comparison to commonly accepted two-year clinical success
      rates for currently available treatment alternatives. An improvement of 10 points on the Knee
      Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Pain Subscore on the KOOS Scoring System from
      baseline to 1-year post-operative is considered minimal perceptible clinical improvement and
      will be used to define the primary clinical success criterion for this study.
