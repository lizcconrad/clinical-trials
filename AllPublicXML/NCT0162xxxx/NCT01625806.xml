      This single-center, open-label, parallel group study will evaluate the effects of multiple
      doses of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics of single oral dose RO4602522 in healthy male
      volunteers. All subjects will receive a single oral dose of RO4602522 on Day 1. Subjects
      assigned to Group 2 will additionally receive ketoconazole (200 mg orally every 12 hours)
      from Day 1 to Day 17.
