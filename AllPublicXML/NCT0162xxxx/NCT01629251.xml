  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main focus of our research is the development of a closed-loop system for glucose control
      in people with type 1 diabetes. After having demonstrated the safety and efficacy of
      overnight closed-loop insulin delivery, we are extending the evaluation of closed-loop to the
      daytime. Meal-related insulin dosing can be challenging and prandial insulin overdosing can
      be associated with the occurrence of postprandial hypoglycaemia, thus representing a
      confounding factor of hypoglycaemia free glucose control during the day. A further
      investigation is needed to evaluate alternative strategies for prandial insulin dosing. We
      will study eight adolescents with type 1 diabetes during closed-loop insulin delivery
      combined with either standard or reduced insulin doses with the meals, in a randomised
      crossover design. Stable glucose isotopes will be administered to collect data for modelling
      of glucose turnover around the meals, during daily activities and overnight.

      The information provided by the use of glucose isotopes would be very helpful to increase our
      understanding of the physiology of glucose turnover and to facilitate the development of an
      improved control algorithm. Ultimately this study will help with the development of a
      closed-loop system to match insulin infusions to change in glucose levels in real life
      conditions.
