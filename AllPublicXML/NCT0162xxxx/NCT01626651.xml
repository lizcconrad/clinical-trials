      The purpose of this study is to assess the potential effects of ketoconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      sequential design study in healthy men. All participants will receive ibrutinib on Day 1 and
      ibrutinib in combination with ketoconazole on Day 7. Food will be restricted from the evening
      before dosing until 4 hours after dosing on Days 1 and 7. Following an overnight fast,
      ketoconazole will be given on Days 4 to 6, 1 hour prior to ibrutinib dosing on Day 7, and
      again on Days 8 and 9. All ibrutinib and ketoconazole doses will be administered with water.
      The participants will leave the study center on Day 10.
