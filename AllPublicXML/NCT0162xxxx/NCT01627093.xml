    <textblock>
      The goal of this data review research study is to collect medical record information from
      patients with head and neck cancer that have received or are scheduled to receive proton
      therapy at MD Anderson. Researchers will study the medical record information to try and
      improve therapy for future patients with head and neck cancer.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 450 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      If you agree to take part in this study, information will be collected from your medical
      records that is related to your personal medical history, diagnosis, and the treatment you
      received or are scheduled to receive for head and neck cancer. The information from your
      medical record will be collected at least 1 time, however, the study doctor may collect
      additional information from your medical records at any time in the future for the purposes
      of this study.

      You will complete 5 questionnaires before your treatment begins, at each visit during your
      treatment, and again at all follow-up visits related to your treatment. It should take about
      30 minutes to complete the questionnaires each time. The questionnaires may be performed in
      person by mail, by phone or by secure electronic methods. The research coordinator will
      notify you via telephone, mail or via electronic notification approximately 2-3 weeks after
      the questionnaire is sent to remind you and also give you the option of performing the survey
      by other means.

      All information that is collected for this study will be stored in a password-protected
      computer and database at MD Anderson for use in future research related to cancer.

      Your medical record information will be given a code number. No identifying information will
      be directly linked to your medical record information. Only the researcher in charge of the
      password-protected computer and database will have access to the code numbers and be able to
      link your medical record information back to you. This is to allow medical data related to
      your medical record information to be updated as needed. Other researchers using your medical
      record information from the password-protected computer and database will not be able to link
      any information back to you.

      Length of Study:

      After you sign this consent form, your active participation in this study will be over. Your
      medical record information may be collected indefinitely.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Retrospective chart analysis will be performed on all patients documented to have head
        and neck cancer treated with Proton Therapy at MDACC from January 1, 2008 through April 30,
        2012. We will prospectively consent patients who receive treatment from May 1, 2012 through
