      The purpose of this study is to assess the 4-site &quot;one-week&quot; post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
      regimen as a possible alternative to the 2-site updated Thai Red Cross (TRC) PEP regimen.

      Primary objective:

        -  To demonstrate that PEP using the new &quot;one-week, 4-site&quot; (4-4-4-0-0) intradermal (ID)
           vaccination regimen is non-inferior to PEP using the updated TRC (2-2-2-0-2) ID
           vaccination regimen.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Primary immunization: To describe the immune response in each group at Day 0, Day 14 and
           Day 90.

        -  Antibody persistence: To describe rabies virus-neutralizing antibody persistence during
           the 5 years after completion of PEP in each group.

        -  Booster vaccination: To describe the immune response induced by a single-visit 4-site
           intradermal booster vaccination in each group at Year 5.

        -  Safety: To describe the safety profile of each group after the primary and booster
           vaccinations.

      Participants with WHO Category II exposure will receive PEP, using &quot;one-week, 4-site&quot; ID
      vaccination regimen. Participants with WHO Category III exposure will receive PEP, using
      &quot;one-week, 4-site&quot; (4-4-4-0-0) ID vaccination regimen and pERIG Favirab® or using the updated
      2-site TRC (2-2-2-0-2) ID vaccination regimen and pERIG Favirab®. All participants will
      receive a &quot;single-visit, 4-site&quot; booster vaccination five years later.
