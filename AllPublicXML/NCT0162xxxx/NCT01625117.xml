    <textblock>
      The reintegration of former child soldiers and ex-combatants is a big challenge in war-torn
      countries. Former child soldiers and ex-combatants often suffer from mental health problems
      and show enhanced levels of aggression. The present study focuses on the reduction of
      appetitive aggression and the improvement of mental health in former child soldiers and
      ex-combatants in DR Congo.

    <description>During the proposed therapy, the client constructs a chronological narrative of his or her whole life which includes all traumatic experiences and perpetrated violent acts. All emotions, cognitions, sensory information, and physiological reactions are activated and linked to the autobiographical context.In five sessions the therapist and the client try to go through all important traumatic experiences and perpetrated violent acts. The sixth session is a group session with four to five clients. The group session is oriented on Interpersonal Psychotherapy and focuses on the role change from soldier to civilian.</description>
