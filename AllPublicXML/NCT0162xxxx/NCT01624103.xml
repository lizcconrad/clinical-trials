    <textblock>
      Results from our preliminary study accepted as e-poster presentation on ESRA (Bordeaux,
      September 2012.) showed significant difference in Comfort Score during Ultrasound Guided
      Supraclavicular Brachial Plexus block (US-SCB) between young and elderly population. However,
      it is unknown whether the difference in Comfort score (1) was associated with reduction of
      local anesthetic (LA) volume in elderly or it is attributed to elderly population by itself.
      The aim of the study is to compare the Comfort score during US-SCB placement in elderly
      patients undergoing upper limb surgery performed with two different volumes of local
      anesthetics (20 ml vs 32 ml).

    <textblock>
      Involutional changes of brachial plexus in elderly, assessed by measuring the cross-sectional
      area (CSA) of brachial plexus at the first rib, allowed a 35% reduction of LA volume for an
      effective US-SCB in comparison with the younger patients (2). Ultrasound-guided regional
      anesthesia becomes an increasingly popular technique and its performance must be as
      comfortable as possible. Therefore, Comfort score during block placement is extremely
      important. Comfort Score is consisted of maximum pain intensity (VAS), the satisfaction of
      the patient and the number of unpleasant events declared by the patients. It is calculated as
      the sum of each criterion, which was attributed a value of 0 or 1: VAS(&lt;or=30/100, 1;
      &gt;30/100, 0), number of unpleasant events (0, 1; &gt;or=1, 0) and satisfaction (satisfied or very
      satisfied, 1; acceptable or unsatisfied, 0). Comfort score of 3 or 2 is considered as
      comfortable while score 1 or 0 as uncomfortable block placement.

    <description>An independent observer unaware of the administered LA volume assessed Comfort score by evaluating maximal pain intensity resulting from block placement using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS: 0, no pain-100, maximum or worst imaginable) as well as by recording any unpleasant event during block placement and by recording patient satisfaction using a four-point scale (unsatisfied, acceptable, satisfied and very satisfied).</description>
