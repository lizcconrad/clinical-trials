  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to characterize the neurobiology of obesity in American Indians (AI) using
      functional MRIs to examine the correlation between brain response to food stimuli in AI
      women. A functional MRI (fMRI) is used to visualize brain activity when obese and lean AI
      women look at images of fattening food, non-fattening food and non-food objects. Additionally
      examined is the effect of the drug naltrexone to suppress brain response to visual food cues
      and calorie intake in the women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study looks at both obese and lean women. Each woman comes in for two visits. Each woman
      takes both the Naltrexone or placebo (one during each visit). Research staff and participants
      are blinded. Drugs are not used as treatment, but rather to provide information for possible
      future treatments.

      Hypotheses are:

        1. Compared with their lean counterparts, obese women will demonstrate more fMRI activation
           in the brain in response to visual food cues.

        2. Naltrexone will reduce the activation in reward-relevant brain sites in response to
           viewing photographs of fattening food as compared in placebo in both groups.

        3. Naltrexone will suppress spontaneous intake of food in obese and lean AI women.
