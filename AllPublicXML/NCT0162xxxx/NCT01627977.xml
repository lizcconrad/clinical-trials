    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of the combination of dye Lutein, Zeaxanthin
      and brilliant blue to stain the internal limiting membrane as well as the epiretinal
      membranes during the Vitrectomy surgery.

      Twenty five patients with epiretinal membrane, macular hole or proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy and indication of vitrectomy surgery will be selected to participate in this
