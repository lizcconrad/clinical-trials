  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate a possible reduction in pre-operative anxiety in
      patients undergoing major elective surgery, by providing multimedia information regarding the
      patient pathway to and from the Operating Theatre.

      To determine whether multimedia information reduces the level of pre-operative anxiety in
      patients undergoing major elective surgery. To evaluate the efficacy of a video, showing the
      patient pathway to and from the Operating Theatre, compared with standard information, a
      written leaflet, about the operating room experience and environment.
