    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have aplastic anemia (AA) or
      low/int-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if horse anti-thymocyte globulin (hATG),
      given in combination with methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, and G-CSF (filgrastim or
      pegfilgrastim), can help to control AA and/or low-int-1 risk MDS. The safety of this drug
      combination will also be studied.

      hATG is made from horse blood and targets immune cells known as T-lymphocytes. Since
      T-lymphocytes are believed to be involved in causing low blood counts in AA and in some cases
      of MDS, killing these cells may help treat the disease.

      Methylprednisolone and cyclosporine work to suppress immune cells called lymphocytes. This
      may help to improve low blood counts in AA and in some cases of MDS.

      Filgrastim and pegfilgrastim are designed to cause white blood cells to grow. This may help
      to fight infections and help improve the white blood cell count.

      This is an investigational study. hATG, cyclosporine, methylprednisolone, and
      filgrastim/pegfilgrastim are all FDA approved and commercially available for use in patients
      with AA and MDS. The use of filgrastim/pegfilgrastim with this drug combination is
      investigational.

      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be admitted to the
      hospital. On the first day, before starting the hATG, a small amount of diluted hATG will be
      injected under your skin to make sure that you are not allergic to it. If you have a
      reaction, more testing may be done. If the reaction is severe, you will be taken off study.

      On Days 1-4 you will receive methylprednisolone by vein over about 10 minutes. You will
      receive hATG by vein over 8 hours.

      If you are able to tolerate ATG without any significant side effects, you should be out of
      the hospital in about 4-5 days.

      On Days 1-180 you will take cyclosporine by mouth 2 times a day at about the same time every
      day.

      On Day 5 (or starting on Day 5) you will receive filgrastim or pegfilgrastim by an injection
      under your skin. Your doctor will decide which drug you will receive. If you receive
      pegfilgrastim, you will receive it one time on Day 5. If you receive filgrastim, you will
      receive it starting on Day 5. You will continue to receive it until your blood counts
      recover.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may be given
      a drug called eltrombopag to help increase your platelet counts if you have low platelets or
      complications related to low platelets. You may ask the study staff for information about how
      the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Visits:

      One time weekly for the first 4-6 weeks and then 1 time a month during Months 2-6

        -  Your complete medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature).

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At the end of Month 3 and then when the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone
      marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 6 months. You will no longer be able to take
      the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are
      unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      When you are off treatment, every 6-12 months you will be called by a member of the study
      staff. You will be asked about any side effects you may be having. The phone calls will take
      about 5-10 minutes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with the diagnosis of MDS (Low, Int-1 by IPSS, or hypocellular) who are
             either previously treated or untreated are eligible for this trial.

          2. Patients with the diagnosis of aplastic anemia who are either previously treated or
             untreated are eligible if they are not currently candidates for an allogeneic stem
             cell transplant.

          3. All ages are eligible.

          4. Patients must have been off of cytotoxic, immunosuppressive (except steroids), or
             targeted therapy for at least 2 weeks prior to entering this study, and have recovered
             from the toxic effects of that therapy to grade 1 or less.

          5. Adequate organ function as defined as: liver function (bilirubin &lt; 2mg/dL, AST &lt;3 x
             ULN), kidney function (creatinine &lt; 2.5 x ULN ).

          6. ECOG performance status of &lt;/= 2.

          7. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          8. A negative urine pregnancy test is required within 1 week for all women of
             childbearing potential prior to enrolling on this trial.

          9. Patient must have the ability to understand the requirements of the study and signed
