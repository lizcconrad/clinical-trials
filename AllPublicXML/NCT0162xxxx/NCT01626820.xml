Gastrointestinal symptoms included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and/or abdominal pain. Any =occurrence of any specified solicited general symptoms reported irrespective of intensity grade or relationship to vaccination, Any fever = oral temperature ≥38.0 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 symptoms = symptoms that prevented normal activities. Grade 3 fever = oral temperature ≥39.0°C. Related = symptoms considered by the investigator to have a causal relationship to vaccination</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs).</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 21-day (Days 0-20) post-vaccination period.</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited AE covers any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as occurrence of any unsolicited symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Reporting Any and Related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the entire study period (Day 0 - Day 20 after vaccination).</time_frame>
    <description>SAEs assessed included medical occurrences that resulted in death, was life threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, resulted in disability/incapacity or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject. Any was defined as occurrence of any symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination and related was an event assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</description>
