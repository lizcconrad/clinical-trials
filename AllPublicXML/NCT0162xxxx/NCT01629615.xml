      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical activity of BKM120 in patients with
      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, single-arm exploratory study
      of single agent BKM120 in the treatment of metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients.

      Patients will first undergo screening, tumor measurement and collection of available tumor
      block from the primary tumor and/or a metastatic site. Available tumor block is required in
      all patients per inclusion criteria. Analysis of this tumor block will be used for
      correlation of predictive markers and clinical response in order to define potential
      subpopulation that benefit from BKM120.

      Following confirmation of eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled. BKM120 will then
      be administered in a 100mg dose, orally, once daily, in a continuous schedule. A treatment
      cycle is defined as 28 days for the purposes of scheduling procedures and evaluations.

      Treatment with BKM120 will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity that
      precludes any further treatment, and/or discontinuation of the treatment by investigator or
      patient decision.
