  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients are highly variable in their body composition, specifically in the proportion
      of fat and muscle. Some patients tend to gain fat and lose muscle (or lean body mass) at the
      same time. These patients can develop severe muscle wasting, termed sarcopenia. Patients with
      sarcopenia have more severe treatment related toxicity requiring delays, dose reductions and
      stopping of treatment, and have reduced survival. One potential explanation for this is that
      patients with sarcopenia have a reduced volume of lean body mass into which chemotherapy
      drugs are distributed, resulting in a higher concentration and greater toxicity. This study
      will randomize lung cancer patients to either the standard dosing strategy based on body
      surface area or experimental, personalized dosing based on lean body mass. Based on
      retrospective findings in this patient population, the investigators expect to find that
      severe toxicity will be reduced for sarcopenic patients on the personalized dosing arm based
      on lean body mass.

      Retrospective findings of NSCLC patients treated with a cisplatin based chemotherapy regimen
      show that although all were given cisplatin at the standard rate of 75 mg/m2 according to
      lean body mass, when this was expressed in relation to individual lean body mass, there was a
      high degree of variation. Incidence of dose limiting toxicity was 41% in patients whose dose
      was within + 25% of the median value. However, sarcopenic patients received on average a 35%
      higher dose and 80% of these patients experienced severe toxicity requiring dose reduction or
      termination of therapy, a clinically unacceptable level. The relatively muscular subset of
      patients with higher lean body mass had a reduced level of severe toxicity compared to those
      at the median dose. These findings have led to the design of a study with the goal of
      reducing high levels of toxicity in sarcopenic patients. If the expected level of dose
      limiting toxicity in sarcopenic patients is 80% based on the standard method of dosing, this
      could be expected to be reduced to the median value of 41% dose limiting toxicity by the
      administration of cisplatin scaled to individual lean body mass. Hypothesis: Levels of severe
      toxicity in sarcopenic patients may be reduced to clinically acceptable levels by cisplatin
      dosing scaled to 3.1 mg/kg lean body mass compared with standard dosing of 75 mg/m2 based on
      body surface area.
