  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physiological stimulation therapy effectiveness will be proved with contractility sensor or
      CLS sensor (Closed Loop Stimulation), in BIOTRONIK CLS pacemakers to prevent from
      neuromediated syncope. Furthermore, not only will be investigated if this system eradicates
      syncopes, but also if the number of presyncopal episodes is reduced.

    <measure>Reduction of the recurrence of presyncopal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction of the recurrence of presyncopal symptoms: Since the CLS sensor can detect any changes in contractility, and presyncopal symptoms are preceded by a contractility increase, it is thought that CLS group patients will suffer less from these symptoms.</description>

    <description>Improvement of Quality of Life: Syncope produces uncertainties and fear to the patients. This will be checked if pacemaker implant improves QOL of these patients and if a specific programming scheme influences the outcome.</description>
