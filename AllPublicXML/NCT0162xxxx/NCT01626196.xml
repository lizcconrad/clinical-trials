  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several factors are important in achieving a successful colonoscopy, including patient
      acceptability of the bowel cleansing procedure and the overall quality of cleansing.

      This observational study has been designed to explore the main determinants of acceptability
      of the bowel cleansing procedure to the patient in an Italian &quot;real life&quot; setting. In
      addition, the study is to examine the determinants of quality of bowel cleansing and describe
      aspects of the technical performance of the colonoscopy (time to reach the caecum and adenoma
      detection rate).
