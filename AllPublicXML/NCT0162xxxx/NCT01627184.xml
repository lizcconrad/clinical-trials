    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate CGM glycemic control using the Dexcom G4 system as
      well as system performance during high levels of activity and home use by adult athletes with
      insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus, over an extended period of time.

    <measure>Glycemic Control during Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>multiple months, up to 6</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of time spent in euglycemia zone as well as hypoglycemia zone will be determined from the system glucose readings, particularly during subject's high levels of activity. Longitudinal data analysis methods will be used to assess the within-subject and between-subject effects of the glycemic control for the study population.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>System Utility and Usability</measure>
    <time_frame>multiple months, up to 6</time_frame>
    <description>The objectives of the study are to evaluate the Dexcom G4 system utility and usability during high levels of activity and home use. The assessments may be evaluated by, but are not limited to, the following:
Number and duration of sensors used by subject
Percentage of CGM system communication during wear
Percentage of CGM system glucose reading during wear
Incidence of System prompts and error messages recorded in the receiver</description>
