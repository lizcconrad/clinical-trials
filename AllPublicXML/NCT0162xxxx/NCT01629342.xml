      STANDARDIZED PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES MEASURED BY ACCELEROMETERS Background and aims: Physical
      activity may be assessed by several different methods. However, the use of accelerometers is
      the most direct method available for real-time measurements. The piezoelectric element of
      accelerometers records an electric voltage during movement which is then transcribed to
      Activity Counts (AC). Few studies have used Actical accelerometers to assess standardized
      physical activities and most of these were not applicable to patients in a hospital setting.
      No previous studies have applied Actical accelerometers to the wrists or ankles during
      standardized activities. The aim of this study is to record AC during different standardized
      activities frequently done by patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke.

      Methods: Patients discharged since February 2012 after a transient ischemic attack have been
      invited to participate in the study scheduled for June-September 2012 (nexpected=25). All
      participants wear 5 accelerometers (Actical), one at each wrist and ankle and one over the
      hip. Standardized physical activities include:

        -  treadmill walking (5 minutes, 1 and 4km/h)

        -  staircase walking (1 floor, normal pace)

        -  cycling with fixed load (5 minutes)

        -  standing up from sitting position and sitting down again (x5)

        -  standing up from supine position

        -  turning from left to right and back while lying in bed

        -  raising outstretched arm 90° (x5, standing position)

        -  eating (5 minutes, sitting position)

        -  drinking a glass of water

        -  sleeping (6 hours)
