  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel concept of self-gripping mesh has been developed to achieve secure and long-term
      posterior wall reinforcement. ProGrip™ mesh is a lightweight (40g/m2) monofilament
      polypropylene or polyester mesh with resorbable polylactic acid (PLA) micro-grips, which
      provide self-gripping properties during the first few months after implantation. The
      self-fixation of the mesh to the underlying tissues is instantly achieved at application,
      limiting or avoiding the requirement of sutures (which can penetrate underlying tissues and
      damage cutaneous nerves), and providing a near tension-¬free repair.

      Case series confirmed that Parietex ProGrip™ placed in onlay position allows a safe and
      painless treatment of incisional hernias and provides secure and efficient fixation mesh. On
      this basis, larger sizes Parietex ProGrip™ meshes have been developed for larger incisional
      hernia defect treatment. In order to assess the clinical outcomes following the use of
      ProGrip™ larger sizes in incisional hernia repair, this mono-center observational study has
      been initiated.
