    <textblock>
      This study explores the potential to improve the quality of response obtained after induction
      treatment in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), by giving a short and intense consolidation
      schema using high-dose rituximab. Patients in suboptimal response (Minimal Residual Disease
      persistence) after induction will be selected, as well as those who have a Minimal Residual
      Disease (MRD) relapse after having achieved MRD negativity.

  <detailed_description>

      This study is reserved for patients with residual disease at the end of therapy at the level
      of Minimal Residual Disease (MRD-positive either in the peripheral blood at least 6 months
      after the last dose of rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy or in the bone marrow at least
      3 months after the last dose of rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy). Patients who have
      achieved MRD eradication and who have MRD relapse (reappearance of residual leukemic cells
      using 7/8-color flow cytometry in peripheral blood or bone marrow) are also eligible for the
      study.

      Rituximab will be given intravenously at a monthly dose of 2000 mg four months (in total 4
      doses of 2000 mg each), starting within one month after informed consent signature.

      The patients will be followed during the treatment period with rituximab. A final evaluation
      will be done 3 months after the last dose of rituximab.

                  Marrow examination) after rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy (ICT), who show
                  persisting MRD either in the Peripheral Blood at least 6 months after the last
                  dose of rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy or in the Bone Marrow at least 3
