  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      S-1 has been also shown to be an effective drug for palliative chemotherapy in Eastern and
      Western GC patients. Recently, some case and small-sized studies have been reported on
      lacrimal drainage obstruction(LDO)caused by S-1.Suggested mechanism of LDO involves direct
      secretion of S-1 into the tear; thus the concentration of S-1 metabolite in tear is expected
      to be high in patients who developed LDO than in patients without LDO. We investigate the
      concentration of S-1 and its metabolites in tear and plasma and find out its correlation with
      side effects such as LDO. These results will also help us identify patients who are at high
      risk of developing S-1-associated side effects.
