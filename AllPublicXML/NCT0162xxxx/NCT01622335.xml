      The study is prospective and double blind. In the clinic, patients undergoing hysterectomy
      that meet the criteria for inclusion into the study and agreed to participate in the study
      will be randomized into two groups. In the first group of patients will receive Nitrous Oxide
      and In the second group of patients will receive oxygen during the general anesthesia.
