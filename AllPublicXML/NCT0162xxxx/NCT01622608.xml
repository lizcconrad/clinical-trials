  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether implementation of a web-based educational
      intervention using a &quot;vaccine information kiosk&quot; placed in primary care practice waiting
      rooms can reach a large number of parents and have a measurable impact on adolescent
      vaccination rates, specifically for Tdap, HPV, meningococcal, and influenza vaccines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents are a reservoir population for a variety of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs).
      Despite this, adolescent vaccination rates lag substantially behind national goals of 80%
      coverage for adolescent vaccines set forth by Healthy People 2020. This has been particularly
      the case for the vaccines most recently recommended for adolescents, such as the human
      papillomavirus (HPV) and seasonal influenza (flu) vaccines; national coverage levels in 2010
      for HPV were 32% (for series completion among females only) and 35% for flu vaccine. Uptake
      levels for the two other adolescent-targeted vaccines, tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis
      (Tdap) and meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) vaccines are currently at 69% and 63%,
      respectively.

      A major barrier to increased adolescent vaccination levels is the lack of parental and
      provider recognition that an adolescent is due for vaccine doses. For providers, there are
      the dual challenges of getting adolescents to come in for annual preventive care visits and
      also minimizing &quot;missed opportunities&quot; for vaccination (i.e. clinical interactions with a
      patient where a needed vaccine could have been provided but was not). Reminder/recall systems
      are one mechanism to help address both of these challenges for providers while also informing
      parents about the need for adolescent vaccines.

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics on kiosk utilization patterns overall, and disaggregated by various demographic, attitudinal and vaccination status categories will be derived. This will be assessed in intervention settings using data entered by parents, as well as paradata such as the order of web pages viewed, and time spent per page.</description>

    <measure>Usefulness of vaccine information kiosks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (provider survey) &amp; 3 months (parent survey)</time_frame>
    <description>Parent satisfaction with the material presented in the kiosk, as well as changes between parents' baseline survey (done at the kiosk) and follow-up email survey in: 1) parent attitudes about vaccination and 2) parent vaccine-specific vaccination intention will be assessed. Provider views on having the kiosks in the waiting room of their clinic will also be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of adolescents who had a change in their vaccination status in kiosk users compared to non-users.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Vaccination status will be determined primarily by medical record review, and augmented by parent report. The proportion of adolescents who had a change in their vaccination status (Tdap, MCV, HPV, Flu) before versus after their clinic visit (for non-users of the kiosk), or before versus after the date their parent first accessed the intervention (for users of the kiosk) will be assessed.</description>

    <description>The study kiosk will remain in the waiting room of participating practices for the duration of the study. Interested parents will self-direct to the kiosk in the clinic waiting room either before or after their child's appointment. Following consent, parents will complete a survey that assesses socio-demographics, baseline vaccination intention, and vaccine-specific beliefs, attitudes and experiences. The kiosk will generate tailored educational messages about adolescent vaccines. Parents can utilize the kiosk as many times as they wish during the intervention period.</description>
