  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Salvage chemotherapy for advanced urothelial cancer (UC) yields suboptimal response rates of
      15-40%, a median progression-free survival of 2-4 months and a median overall survival of 6
      months. A rationale for targeting angiogenesis in UC is supported by preclinical evidences
      and early signals of clinical activity of anti-VEGF TKI as demonstrated by our group with the
      use of pazopanib.

      Despite this activity, progression inevitably occurs and mechanisms determining resistance to
      conventional anti-angiogenic agents are under investigation.

      PF-03446962 (Pfizer Inc) is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) against ALK1 with
      dose-dependent antiangiogenic activity as demonstrated in nonclinical studies in a chimera
      mouse model bearing human tumor xenograft. The investigators suggest that PF-03446962 may
      increase current results for patients with advanced urothelial cancer failing upfront
      chemotherapy due to its mechanisms of action. Due to the lack of reliable and reproducible
      predictors of response as well as of imaging tools to assess tumor response, the trial will
      provide incorporation of 18FDG-PET/CT and contrast-enhanced ultrasound to stage and evaluate
      response of urothelial cancers, together with standard imaging modalities (RECIST criteria).
      Blood and tissue samples will be collected for translational purposes.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, non randomised, phase II proof-of-concept study of the
      monoclonal antibody against TGF-beta receptor ALK1 (PF03446962) for patients with urothelial
      cancer relapsing/progressing after first line chemotherapy.

      The study is planned according to Simon's Optimal two-stage design. The primary endpoint is
      the proportion of patients who are progression-free at 2-months. A 2-month PFS rate of 50% is
      not promising, while a 70% rate will be promising. In stage 1, 21 evaluable patients will be
      accrued. If 12 patients at least will be progression-free at 2 months, enrollment will be
      extended to the 2nd stage for further 24 patients. If, out of the total of 45 patients, 27 at
      least will be progression-free at 2 months, treatment will be declared worthy for further
      investigations.

      Maximum overall accrual is 45 patients. Type I and type II error rates will be set both at
      the 10% level.

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval from the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documented disease progression or death for any reason, with censoring at the date of last contact for alive patients. A patient who has not progressed or died by the date of the analysis cut-off or when the patient received any further anticancer therapy would have the PFS censored at the time of last adequate tumor assessment before either cut-off date or the commencement of further anticancer therapy date, respectively.</description>

    <description>Incidence of adverse events (AEs), defined as any new untoward medical conditions occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study drugs. AEs will be graded according to the NCI-CTC version 4.03 and the relationship of each AEs to study drugs will be assessed by the investigator.</description>

    <description>Overall Survival (OS) will be calculated as the interval from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of death for any cause, with censoring at the date of last contact for patients alive. The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the OS curve (median and 95% confidence interval).</description>

Circulating VEGF, soluble VEGFR-1, 2 and -3, soluble c-Kit, IL-6, 8, 12 and HGF will be evaluated by using multiplex ELISA plates.
Circulating tumor cells will be evaluated as a potential response biomarkers.</description>
