    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to assess the day 180 event free and overall survival after
      administration of a specified combination of fludarabine, busulfan, Total Body Irradiation
      (TBI), and thymoglobulin reduced intensity conditioning and 2 unit UCB stem cell transplant
      in a single institution setting in patients with hematologic malignancies for whom allogeneic
      transplantation is indicated.
