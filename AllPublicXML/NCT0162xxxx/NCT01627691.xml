      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Lotus™ Valve
      System for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in symptomatic subjects with severe
      calcific aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical valve replacement.

      The REPRISE II clinical study is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study designed to
      evaluate the safety and performance of the Lotus Valve System for TAVR in symptomatic
      subjects who have severe calcific aortic valve stenosis and who are at high risk for surgical
      aortic valve replacement (SAVR).

          -  Heart team assessment that the subject is likely to benefit from valve replacement.

          -  Subject (or legal representative) understands the study requirements and the treatment
             procedures, and provides written informed consent.

          -  Subject, family member, and/or legal representative agree(s) and subject is capable of
             returning to the study hospital for all required scheduled follow up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a congenital unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve.

          -  Subject with an acute myocardial infarction within 30 days of the index procedure

          -  Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack within the
             past 6 months, or has any permanent neurologic defect prior to study enrollment.

          -  Subject is on dialysis or has serum creatinine level &gt;3.0 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L.

          -  Subject has a pre-existing prosthetic heart valve (aortic or mitral) or a prosthetic
             ring in any position.

          -  subject cannot have more than moderate mitral, aortic or tricuspid regurgitation

          -  Subject has a need for emergency surgery for any reason.

          -  Subject has a history of endocarditis within 12 months of index procedure or evidence
             of an active systemic infection or sepsis.

          -  Subject has echocardiographic evidence of intra-cardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation.

             therapy with either aspirin or clopidogrel/ticlopidine

          -  Subject has active peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleed within the past 3
