  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is the examination of Mapisal® versus urea hand-foot cream as
      prophylaxis for capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome (HFS) in patients with
      gastrointestinal tumors or breast cancer, to assess the efficacy of Mapisal®.

      Mapisal® is a medical device that is approved for the prophylaxis and treatment of HFS.
      Initial clinical data and case studies on the treatment and prophylaxis of Caelyx-induced HFS
      have been impressive. Because the pathomechanism of HFS caused by capecitabine is the same as
      for Caelyx-induced HFS, it is expected reason that administering Mapisal® should result in a
      significant reduction of HFS caused by capecitabine. The urea hand-foot cream was selected
      for the standard arm, because it is used commonly, is accepted by patients, and seems to have
      a positive influence on the severity of the HFS in the experience of many oncologists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a frequently occurring, often dose limiting, dermatologic
      reaction associated with cytotoxic agents, such as capecitabine, liposomal doxorubicin, and
      doxetacel.

      Adverse events affecting the integument have posed significant challenges to oncologists in
      recent years in terms of selecting appropriate supportive therapies. Not only medications
      that inhibit EGFR receptors such as erlotinib, gefitinib, panitumumab or cetuximab, but also
      multiple-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib and other
      &quot;older&quot; medications such as capecitabine can often lead to skin-related adverse events that
      can be difficult to manage.

      These adverse events compromise skin-related quality of life and can lead to dose compromises
      or even the termination of treatment.

      To date, there are no side effects reported for the use of either Mapisal® or urea hand-foot
      cream, making both treatments safe. Given the potential benefits of the treatments in
      preventing HFS by reducing discomfort and impairment of quality of life, the conduct of the
      trial is regarded as justifiable and there is no indication that patients are exposed to an
      increased risk associated with study participation.
