      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of two different analgesic methods
      (Fentanyl vs Remifentanil) during major abdominal surgery on postoperative cognitive status
      of patients. In particular, whether there is a correlation between type of anesthesia and the
      appearance of postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD), including type of anesthesia and
      levels of pro and anti inflammatory cytokines and investigate whether there is an association
      between presence or absence of POCD and cytokines levels

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rey verbal memory test of words before and after major abdominal surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed the day before and after surgery and for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>In test of Rey to the subject is presented for 5 times the same list of 15 bisyllabic words or trisillabic common use of which he must recall as many as possible within 1 minute; after about 15 minutes the patient, meanwhile distracted by the test , must again try to remember the greatest number possible without a further reading. The maximum possible score of the first phase of the test is an expression of the ability of short term memory of the subject, the result of the test is repeated at a distance of 15 minutes is indicative of its storage capacity, to intermediate term.</description>

    <measure>Stroop Test before and after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed the day before and after surgery and for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>In the Stroop Test patient is instructed to read a random sequence of adjectives &quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; written in black font, then he refers the colour of a succession of circumferences filled of the three colors above in random order; finally, another random succession of three words &quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; written in three characters of the same colors, but not associated with corresponding adjective. Number of errors that the subject does in reading is an indication of its ability to attention</description>

    <measure>Quantitative determination of serum pro and anti inflammatory cytokines before and after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed the day before and after surgery and for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples will be made for the quantitative determination of serum cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-10 and IL-12. Determinations will be given by Multiplex Elisa method.</description>

    <description>In group A induction of anesthesia will be performed with Propofol (2mg/kg), Cisatracurium (0.15mg/kg)and continous infusion of Remifentanil (0.15mcg/kg/min).Anesthesia will be maintained by Sevoflurane with oxygen (Fi=40%)and air, with a MAC value to maintain BIS between 40 and 60. Intraoperative analgesia will be obtained with Remifentanil 0.15-0.25mcg/kg/min. Additional boluses of Cisatracurium (0.02mcg/kg)will be administered as needed during surgery. At the beginning of closure of the peritoneum bolus of morphine (0.1mg/kg)and acetaminophen 1g will be administered. Propofol and remifentanil infusions will be interrupted at the end of wound closure.</description>
