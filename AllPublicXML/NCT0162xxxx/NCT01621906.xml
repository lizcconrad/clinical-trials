  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different imaging methods to examine the response
      of brain metastases to WBRT. These two imaging methods will take pictures of the brain using
      : 1) a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner and 2) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
      scanner. A PET scanner resembles a CT or MR scanner.PET scans use radioactive substances also
      called as radioactive markers to &quot;see&quot; cancer cells. We plan to use [18F]FLT as a radioactive
      marker. FLT is used to image tumor growth. FLT PET scan is a new clinical procedure. It is in
      the testing stage of development unlike FDG-PET which is used more commonly used. Therefore,
      this is considered a &quot;research&quot; study. This will help us evaluate whether this scan will be
      safe and better used in the future to evaluate tumors. The amount of radiation to the body is
      small. The radiation from the radiotracer drug will be gone from the body in a few hours.
      There is no radiation risk from the MRI scans. Additionally, we also plan to use MRI imaging
      of the brain. We expect that [18F]FLT PET is better when compared to MRI and will give us
      more information about the brain metastases after WBRT.

    <description>by two modalities: FLT-PET and MRI. MRI is considered standard of care and response assessments are recorded as CR, PR, PD, SD, and unknown FLT-PET response assessments will be recorded as SUV-MAX and a decline by 25% is considered as significant . MRI measurements will be recorded at baseline and 10 to 12 weeks post WBRT. FLT-PET measurements will be recorded at baseline, 10 days post WBXRT, and 10-12 weeks post WBXRT.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing FLT PET findings with tissue analysis will enable us to determine if imaging results are concordant with histological findings and thus allow for confirmation of this hypothesis. In this manner, we propose to generate a bridge between tissue analysis and FLT-PET brain imaging studies. For patients needing to undergo craniotomy for resection of a brain metastasis after WBRT, tissue findings (radionecrosis versus viable tumor) will be correlated with radiologic assessment in an exploratory manner.</description>

    <description>Cohort 1 will include the first ten patients treated with WBRT concomitantly with sorafenib (on a separate phase I trial). We will perform a pilot study of serial FLT-PET imaging of the brain at baseline (&lt; 4 weeks prior to initiation of WBRT), up to 7-10 days post-WBRT and 10-12 weeks after WBRT in patients with metastatic breast cancer to the brain (N=20) treated with WBRT with or without sorafenib.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Cohort 2 will include patients treated with standard WBRT alone. Patients in both these cohorts will also be assessed with standard non-invasive MRI in addition to [18F] FLT PET at baseline (&lt; 4 weeks of WBRT) and 10-12 weeks after completion of WBRT.</description>

Patients will also be evaluated with MRI imaging at baseline and then 10-12 weeks after WBRT.
Patients will be followed with MRI every 3 months (+/- 7 days) for the first year and then every 6 months (+/- 7 days) thereafter which is the standard of care.</description>
