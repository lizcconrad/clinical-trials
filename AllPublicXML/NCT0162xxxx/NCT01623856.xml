      This research studies genes associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in young patients. Studying
      samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help doctors
      learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a preliminary investigation of the effects of loci strongly and consistently
      associated in prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and validation studies of
      childhood/adolescent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
      autoimmune diseases, and atopic diseases on the risk of NHL (lymphoblastic and Burkitt
      lymphomas) in children and adolescents.

      OUTLINE:

      DNA samples are analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism and genotyped by fluorogenic
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based allelic discrimination (Taqman) assays using the ABI
      Prism 7900HT reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR system.
