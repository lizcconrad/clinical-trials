      The Medtronic Market-Released DF4 Lead Imaging Study is a prospective, non-randomized study,
      multi-center clinical investigation.

      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to collect high quality medical images of the
      Medtronic Market-Released DF4 lead in the shoulder and heart. Images collected during the
      study will allow for lead design and testing processes better tailored to the implanted
      environment.
