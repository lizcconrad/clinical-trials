      Primary: To compare the post-operative pain in patients with neck extension and without neck
      extension.

      Secondary: To determine the benefit of neck exposure and peri-operative complications, which
      include duration of operation, intra-operative blood loss, recurrent nerve (RLN) injury and
      hypocalcaemia in both groups.

      Hypothesis: Patients who undergoing thyroidectomy without neck extension will have less
      post-operative pain and there are no significant difference of post-operation complications
      between both groups.

      Conventional open thyroid surgery is still one of the most common operations performed
      globally. Traditionally, patients who undergoing thyroid surgeries are usually positioned
      with extended neck by using pillow under shoulder in order to facilitate neck exposure and
      make the surgery easier. However, the degree of benefit from the extended neck is doubtful
      and there is little objective evidence that suggest extended neck thyroid surgery offers
      better outcomes. On the the hand, over-extension of the neck should be avoided because of it
      is associated with post-operative pain, vomiting, spinal damage and stroke. The objective of
      the present study is to compare the post-operative pain in patients with neck extension and
      without neck extension. In addition to that, we also like to determine the benefit of neck
      exposure and peri-operative complications, which include duration of operation,
      intra-operative blood loss, recurrent nerve (RLN) injury and hypocalcaemia in both groups.
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial, which will be conducted from 1st of March
      2012 till 30th September 2012. Given that approximately 300 to 400 patients would undergo
      thyroid surgery in each year, we estimated 180 patients will be recruited and randomly
      divided into 2 groups (neck extension and no neck extension) before undergoing open thyroid
      surgery for this trial. Visual analogue scale (VAS) is used to determine the post-operative
      pain. Primary end point and other peri-operative variables are then analyzed with SPSS
      software.
