      The investigators propose to obtain facial photographs for use in testing a computer
      algorithm that recognizes males at high risk for Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (XLHED).
      FDNA (www.fdna.com), a software company with expertise in the area of facial recognition, is
      collaborating with the Sponsor in algorithm development based on 2D photographs not requiring
      special photographic technologies. A frontal facial photograph will be taken at the time of
      study conduct. The anonymized photographs will be transmitted to FDNA for analysis. A limited
      number of unaffected controls will be also be recruited.

      A subset of affected males between ages 5 and 25 years will have the option of having a blood
      draw for a set of laboratory studies assessing nutritional status.

      As the first exploratory objective for this study, we propose to obtain facial photographs
      for use in testing a computer algorithm that recognizes males at high risk for XLHED. While
      3D facial profiling has been reported in HED, the technology does not meet the ease-of-use
      criteria for a universal screening tool. FDNA (www.fdna.com), a software company with
      expertise in the area of facial recognition, is collaborating with the Sponsor in algorithm
      development based on 2D photographs not requiring special photographic technologies. All
      males at risk for a diagnosis of XLHED and attending the 2012 NFED Family Conference will be
      eligible to participate. A short medical questionnaire will verify the clinical presentation,
      they will be requested to provide a baby photograph taken at up to 1 month of age (to be
      returned at study completion), and a frontal facial photograph will be taken at the time of
      study conduct. The anonymized photographs will be transmitted to FDNA for analysis. A limited
      number of unaffected controls will be recruited at the 2012 NFED Family Conference for the
      photography study, in addition to the control data already available in the FDNA database.

      As a second exploratory objective, a subset of affected males between ages 5 and 25 years
      will have the option of having a blood draw for a set of laboratory studies assessing
      nutritional status. HED-affected patients in general (including XLHED) are reported to have
      evidence of growth restriction (weight for height) in this age range without clear
      mechanistic evidence. A screening panel of nutritional laboratory tests has been designed in
      collaboration with experts in the field at the University of California, San Francisco
      (UCSF). Anonymized samples will be analyzed at UCSF.

        This study is being conducted among family members attending the 2012 National Foundation
        for Ectodermal Dysplasia (NFED) Family Conference, July 19-21, 2012, in Orlando, FL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males of any age who are registered and attending the 2012 NFED Family Conference;

          2. Conform to one of the following requirements for providing informed consent/assent:

               -  if more than 18 years of age, subjects must provide signed informed consent;

               -  if less than 18 years of age and it is determined that the subject is capable of
                  providing assent, both the assent of the subject and consent of the parent(s) or
                  guardian of that subject must be granted. Under this condition, both parents of
                  the subject should give their permission, unless 1 parent is deceased, unknown,
                  incompetent, or not available;

               -  if the subject is incapable of providing assent, the consent of the parent(s) or
                  guardian of the subject must be granted. Under this condition, both parents
                  should give their consent, unless 1 parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or
                  not available.

               -  Male subjects of original gender with genetic confirmation of an EDA mutation or
                  with the clinical characteristics of HED including a history of decreased
                  sweating;

               -  Unaffected, healthy male controls.
