  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the safety and effectiveness of four new candidate malaria
      vaccines; ChAd63 CS, ChAd63 ME-TRAP, MVA CS &amp; MVA ME-TRAP. These vaccines consist of viruses
      (ChAd63 and MVA) which have been genetically modified so (i) they cannot replicate in humans
      and (ii) they include parts of the malaria parasite; Plasmodium falciparum (CS and ME-TRAP).
      The hope is that these vaccines will induce immune responses in vaccinees that are able to
      prevent malaria.

      This proposed study will compare how effective ChAd63-MVA CS is at preventing malaria
      infection in UK volunteers following malaria challenge compared to ChAd63-MVA ME-TRAP.

      The study will be conducted at the University of Oxford's Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and
      Tropical Medicine (CCVTM), Oxford, UK and the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility in
      Southampton, UK. The malaria challenge will take place at the insectary at Imperial College
      (Infection and Immunity Section) in London, UK.

    <description>The safety of the vaccine regimens will be assessed by analysing actively and passively collected data from clinical review of volunteers and laboratory measurements.
The ability of the vaccines to induce malaria-specific immune responses (immunogenicity) will be assessed by the following laboratory tests;
(A) Interferon gamma ELISPOT. (B) Flow cytometry to measure T cell responses
Other laboratory investigations including microarray analysis may be performed.</description>
