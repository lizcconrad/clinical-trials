      The purpose of this feasibility study is to obtain preliminary safety and effectiveness
      information and develop procedural optimization for the Magnetic Anal Sphincter device (FENIX
      System) in reinforcement of anal sphincter function to treat severe fecal incontinence (FI).

    <description>The safety objective will be met via reporting all adverse events at various time points including implant, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (and then semi-annually until 5 years post-implant at U.S. sites). Serious device- and procedure-related adverse events will be summarized separately. Safety will be characterized by physical examination and pelvic X-ray evaluations.</description>

    <time_frame>12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Effectiveness will be characterized as the reduction of FI symptoms by subjective measurements using the FISI, Wexner, and FIQOL scores and a three week diary documenting episodes of incontinence.</description>
