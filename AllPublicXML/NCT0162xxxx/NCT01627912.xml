    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether red and white wine consumption has acute
      effects on postprandial biochemical markers related to platelet aggregation, inflammation and
      oxidative stress compared to water or 12.5% ethanol aqueous solution consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The last few years, epidemiologic studies indicate that regular moderate consumption of
      alcohol is associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease and heart attack, as well as
      with lower mortality. More specific, a J or U-shaped association between alcohol consumption
      and the incidence of coronary heart disease have been suggested, which means that there was
      lower disease risk in moderate alcohol consumers than in abstainers or heavy drinkers.

      The scientific interest was focused on wine after the term &quot;French paradox&quot; was introduced,
      in order to describe the epidemiological observation that the French suffer a relatively low
      incidence of coronary heart disease, despite having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats.
      The paradox was attributed to the moderate consumption of red wine by French. Even though
      many clinical studies have occurred since then, only few of them report the postprandial
      effect of wine, mainly focusing on the study of oxidative stress markers and endothelium
      dysfunction. Also, a limited number of publications refer to the postprandial wine effect
      upon platelet aggregation, which is an indicative marker for inflammation / thrombosis and
      atherosclerosis.

      The limited clinical evidence prompted us to investigate the postprandial effect of wine
      consumption upon platelet aggregation, inflammation and oxidation markers, by undertaking a
      clinical study of crossover design. The subjects randomly consumed 4ml of drink [Robola or
      Cabernet Sauvignon or 12.5% ethanol or water]/kg of individual, parallel with a standardized
      meal, which consisted of 30.8% carbohydrates, 12.0% proteins and 53.1% fat. The meal total
      energy was 787.2 kcal.
