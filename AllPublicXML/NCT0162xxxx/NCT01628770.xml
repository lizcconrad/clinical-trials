  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that both isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer), and oral iron
      preparation will be equally effective in correction of postpartum iron deficiency anemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron molecule iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer) have been introduced in the market, which can
      be given in intravenous infusion forms, in a relatively short period of time, in a single
      setting, after calculation of the required dose. This preparation has been used for treatment
      of anemia in patients with chronic renal disease, gastrointestinal disorders, anemia of
      malignancy and in gynecological disorders. It does not require a test dose to be given before
      total dose, nor does it require any premedication. It can be given in a dose of 20mg/kg. The
      drug has been licensed for use in Europe in 2009. It has been used for treatment of anemia in
      patients with chronic renal disease, inflammatory bowel disease and in anemia due to
      malignancies
