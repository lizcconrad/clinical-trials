  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this current prospective study is to assess the effects of a Therapeutic
      Riding exercise program conducted in patients suffering from neuromuscular disease. The
      exercise intervention aims at improving gross motor function, gross motor performance,
      balance, spasticity, posture and quality of life. Patients were randomized according to age,
      sex, mental ability and gross motor function. Furthermore, patients will be subdivided into
      categories of central nervous system (brain/ spinal cord) and peripheral (peripheral nerve or
      muscle) diseases. The exercise program duration will be 12 weeks, once a week with 30-40
      minutes sessions. Six measurements will be conducted: the Gross Motor Function Measure, the
      Gross Motor Performance Measure, the Quality of life Questionnaire for Children, the
      Pediatric Balance Scale, the dynamic plate in combination with x-ray for posture control, the
      Modified Ashworth Scale for spasticity and the Wisc 3 for mental ability. The results will be
      collected and evaluated using the statistical programme SPSS.
