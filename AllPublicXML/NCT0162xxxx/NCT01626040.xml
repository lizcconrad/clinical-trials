      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of current standard of care Polyethylene
      Gylcol powder (PEG-P)colonoscopy preparation on a patient's serum electrolytes, tolerance of
      the prep, and how well the bowel is cleansed. The primary aim is to determine the proportion
      of patients with clinically significant serum electrolyte abnormalities at the time of
      colonoscopy and how well the prep is tolerated. Secondary objectives include: 1) how well the
      bowel is cleansed with this preparation, and 2) to determine the most effective way to
      communicate instructions about the bowel preparation with the child and family.

      Design is prospective, descriptive observational study involving a single clinical encounter
      in the Endoscopy suite at CHOP Main at the time of colonoscopy. Patients prescribed the
      standard of care dosage for PEG-P by their primary gastroenterologist are considered for this
      study. Study procedures include collection of data from patients that are prescribed the
      PEG-P dose. In order to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and adherence to PEG-P bowel
      preparation, data collections include the following: review of medical records, tracking of
      communication from subjects/parents, blood draw, questionnaire and quality of prep will be
      assessed. Questionnaire results will be obtained at the initial and only visit. Patients will
      be given a questionnaire prior to colonoscopy to rate symptoms, ease of preparation and to
      rate the effectiveness of communication about the preparation. On the day of colonoscopy,
      prior to the procedure, patients will have an IV placed per standard procedure. At the time
      of IV placement, a basic metabolic panel and serum magnesium and phosphorus levels will be
      drawn through the IV for assessment of electrolyte abnormalities. Serum glucose will be
      captured from medical records as this is collected with standard of care. Patient/parents
      will grade the preparation tolerance filling out a questionnaire prior to colonoscopy. During
      colonoscopy, the endoscopist will grade the quality of preparation on a validated residual
      stool survey (Aronchick scale).
