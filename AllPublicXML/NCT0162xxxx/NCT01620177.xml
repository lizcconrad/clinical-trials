    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to expand understanding of the effects of cannabis on driving
      performance with and without the presence of low levels of alcohol.

      This project will involve the development a of a protocol and driving environment that is
      sensitive to the effects of cannabis on driving performance by building on prior driving
      situations used previously for testing the effects of alcohol on driving.

      Individuals will be recruited who are currently users of cannabis and alcohol to participate
      in this study. They will undergo a physical exam at screening. There will be six study visits
      where the subject will arrive at the Clinical Research Unit(University of Iowa Hospitals &amp;
      Clinics) the night before dosing. At each visit subjects will be receive one of the following
      six dosing regimens: placebo alcohol with placebo cannabis; placebo alcohol with low-dose
      cannabis, placebo alcohol with higher-dose of cannabis, low dose alcohol with placebo
      cannabis; low dose alcohol with low dose cannabis, low dose alcohol with higher-dose of
      cannabis. After dosing, participants will have provide saliva samples and blood drawn
      periodically to check cannabis levels and will complete a driving simulation. After
      completing the drive, additional saliva samples and blood draws will occur and participants
      will be monitored until it is safe to transport home.

    <time_frame>Through entire drive, 0.5-1.3 hr post cannabis administration.</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by standard deviation of lane position. Metrics of driving performance were modeled using the SAS GLM Select function to identify changes in driver performance. Numbers represents coefficients on the regression equation such that this increase would be expected for every unit increase. A unit for THC is 1 ng/ml and a unit for BAC is 0.01% BAC. In understanding the regression coefficients, for THC the units for the coefficient would be expressed as cm per (ng/ml of THC), and for BrAC the units for the coefficient would be expressed as cm per (0.01% BrAC). The overall regression equation would be represented as SDLP = Intercept + Cthc x THC + Cbrac x BrAC. The coefficients indicate the strength of the effect on driving performance with higher coefficients indicating larger effects relative to the concentrations. Coefficients of zero indicate no effect or interactive effect.</description>

        <title>Driving Performance</title>
        <description>Measured by standard deviation of lane position. Metrics of driving performance were modeled using the SAS GLM Select function to identify changes in driver performance. Numbers represents coefficients on the regression equation such that this increase would be expected for every unit increase. A unit for THC is 1 ng/ml and a unit for BAC is 0.01% BAC. In understanding the regression coefficients, for THC the units for the coefficient would be expressed as cm per (ng/ml of THC), and for BrAC the units for the coefficient would be expressed as cm per (0.01% BrAC). The overall regression equation would be represented as SDLP = Intercept + Cthc x THC + Cbrac x BrAC. The coefficients indicate the strength of the effect on driving performance with higher coefficients indicating larger effects relative to the concentrations. Coefficients of zero indicate no effect or interactive effect.</description>
        <time_frame>Through entire drive, 0.5-1.3 hr post cannabis administration.</time_frame>
        <population>One subject who was an extreme outlier across driving performance measures was excluded. Due to the variability in THC and BrAC levels across subjects and conditions, a regression model was used which combined all of the data.</population>
