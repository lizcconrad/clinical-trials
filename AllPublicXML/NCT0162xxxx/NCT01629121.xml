      The hypothesis was that the implementation of a Safe Kids East Central brain injury
      prevention program targeting children and caregivers admitted to the Georgia Health Sciences
      University Children's Medical Center is feasible and that short-term treatment effects of
      injury prevention education on the child or adolescent and the caregiver will increase
      bicycle helmet use.

      The overarching goal of this project is to reduce traumatic brain injury in children and
      adolescents by promoting bicycle helmet use via an inpatient educational program. The Safe
      Kids East Central injury prevention educational program was customized for hospitalized
      subjects and their caregivers. The investigators hypothesized that this program would
      increase bicycle helmet use.

    <description>The brain injury prevention education intervention included case scenarios as well as education about the benefits of bicycle helmet use. The intervention was designed to be sensitive to the age and educational level of the study participant and his or her parents. Educational materials were chosen to provide use of the five senses to enhance the learning experience. The intervention took place in the privacy of the patient's hospital room. The study was designed so as not to interfere with the hospital standard of care.
The proper way to fit the bicycle helmet was demonstrated.</description>
