  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogenous disease. Different patients have different presentations, course of
      disease and response to treatment.

      The investigators would like to study our population of more severe asthma and find out about
      their profile - demographic, clinical and inflammatory.

    <textblock>
      Asthma is a heterogeneous disorder presenting with many phenotypes. Most asthmatics have mild
      to moderate disease. However, 5-20% of asthmatics belong to the &quot;Difficult-to-treat&quot; or more
      severe group and they account for 50-80% of asthma health care costs. In a tertiary hospital
      like Singapore General Hospital, most of our asthmatics belong to the more severe group. They
      have more frequent healthcare visits, hospitalizations, medication use and higher risks of
      death.

      There is currently no local data on the phenotypic profile of our patients. Asthma phenotypes
      which have been identified include those related to triggers ( eg. drugs such as aspirin or
      NSAIDS, environmental allergen, occupational allergens or irritants, exercise) or clinical
      physiological phenotypes ( eg. severity-defined, exacerbation-prone, chronic airflow
      limitation, steroid-resistant, age -of -onset) or inflammatory phenotypes ( eg. eosinophilic,
      neutrophilic, pauci granulocytic, mixed). With better understanding of their phenotypes,
      treatment can then be individually tailored to improve their asthma control and reduce future
      risks.

      We aim to improve the understanding of this group of asthmatics such that better treatment
      approaches can be developed in the future. This is not a clinical trial. Its purpose is to
      gather information ranging from demographic data, medical history to responses to simple
      routine questions, to lung function, inflammation, allergy and blood testing results. The
      data are analyzed to improve our understanding of the clinical and inflammatory phenotypes (
      or profiles) in this group of patients.

          2. Treatment-resistant severe asthma patients who are partially or poorly controlled
