  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The U.S. food and beverage industry recently released a new front-of-package nutrition
      labeling system called Facts Up Front that will be used on thousands of food products. The
      purpose of this study was to test consumer understanding of the Facts Up Front nutrition
      labeling system compared to the Multiple Traffic Light system (Traffic Light). Facts Up Front
      displays grams/milligrams and % daily value information for various nutrients; Traffic Light
      uses an interpretive color-coded scheme to alert consumers to low, medium or high levels of
      certain nutrients. Participants in an Internet-based study were randomized to one of five
      front-of-package label conditions: 1) No Label; 2) Traffic Light; 3) Traffic Light plus
      information about protein and fiber (Traffic Light+); 4) Facts Up Front; or 5) Facts Up Front
      plus information about &quot;nutrients to encourage&quot; (Facts Up Front+). Total percentage correct
      quiz scores were generated reflecting participants' ability to compare two foods on nutrient
      levels, based on their labels, and to estimate amounts of saturated fat, sugar, sodium, fiber
      and protein in foods. 703 adult participants recruited through an online database in May 2011
      participated in this Internet-based study and data were analyzed in June 2011. The
      investigators hypothesized that the Traffic Light label groups would perform better than the
      Facts Up Front groups on all outcomes.

    <measure>Nutrient Comparison and Nutrient Level Estimation Accuracy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants took a nutrient level comparison quiz asking them to identify which of two products presented side-by-side in the same food category were higher or lower in different nutrients. Participants also viewed 8 individual products and estimated whether the product had low, medium or high amounts of saturated fat, sugar, sodium, fiber, and protein. The primary outcomes were total percentage correct on these quizzes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceptions of Health, Taste and Purchase Intent</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated how healthy they thought each individual product was, how good it would taste and their likelihood to buy the product for themselves and their children (answered only by those who reported having children) using a 9-point Likert scale. Each set of ratings was averaged across eight products.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Composite scores were created based on several items assessing ease of label interpretation and understanding, label complexity, and degree of label confusion.</description>

    <description>A label displaying calories, saturated fat, sodium, and total sugars per serving. Nutrient amounts were listed in grams/milligrams and % Daily Values (%DVs), which indicate whether a serving of food is high or low in a nutrient based on daily value recommendations for a 2,000 calorie diet, were included. This symbol was created based on the Facts Up Front symbol description provided by the Grocery Manufacturers Association and Food Marketing Institute, without the inclusion of nutrients to encourage.</description>
