    <textblock>
      Use of positron emission tomography (PET) in determination of functional tumour volume can
      provide usable information for radiotherapy to define the irradiated volume.

      To determine the best tumour volume measure method, the investigators have chosen as model
      the breast cancer which allows us to study a stationary or moving organ by the patient
      position and belonging to a primary surgery.

      The used methodology is based on lesion volume measure in preoperative time, obtained with
      PET, and on the measure of specimen volume by the anatomic laboratory after surgery.

      This study's main objective is to compare this two measure of tumour size and secondarily to
      compare TEP with or without respiratory gating.

      The PET-scan is achieved with FDG, under his French permission marketing, and acquire in 3
      times:

      A whole body acquisition in supine position, follow by a centered tumour acquisition with
      respiratory gating, then an acquisition in prone position to immobilise the lesion.

      This study is monocentric and descriptive. It provides to include 30 patients in 1 year.

      The use of positron emission tomography (PET) in determination of functional tumour volume
      may pose two major problems especially for the exact delineation of tumour contours:

        -  Respiratory movements, when the tumour is thoracic, may induce an overestimation

        -  The PET's low spatial resolution, linked to the emission of photons

      The usual method to define tumour contours result of three types of delineation usually used:
      the visual contouring, the segmentation based on an activity threshold fixed, and the
      segmentation with adaptive thresholding.
