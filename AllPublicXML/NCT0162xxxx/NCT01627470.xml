      The aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of continuous non-invasive AP monitoring
      (CNAP) compared to simultaneous IBP measurement in intensive care patients undergoing a
      transport in the ambulance car.

      Since CNAP finger blood pressure is calibrated to NBP level, a systematic bias between IBP
      and CNAP as described by a recent FDA meta analysis [ ] is expected. The most important
      factor of CNAP system performance is its ability to accurately track blood pressure changes.
      Thus, the purpose of this investigation is to show that the bias between CNAP and IBP falls
      within the expected range and that blood pressure alterations are detected instantaneously.

      The endpoints of the study are:

        -  The agreement of systolic, diastolic and mean CNAP and IBP readings determined on a
           beat-to-beat basis during:

        -  Takeover of the patient on the intensive care unit,

        -  Transport of the patient from the intensive care unit to the ambulance car

        -  Transport of the patient in the ambulance car

        -  The agreement of systolic, diastolic and mean CNAP and IBP blood pres-sure changes
           determined on a beat-to-beat basis during:

        -  Takeover of the patient on the intensive care unit,

        -  Transport of the patient from the intensive care unit to the ambulance car

        -  Transport of the patient in the ambulance car

      The beat-to-beat readings of CNAP and IBP will be automatically recorded electronically on a
      memory card in the transport monitor. CNAP data will additionally be recorded directly on the
      CNAP Monitor with a memory stick. Safety will be assessed by clinical observations as well as
      adverse events (AE) recording.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arterial pressure (AP) is one of the most important physiological variables. Particularly in
      emergency medicine, AP needs to be monitored repeatedly or even better, continuously. This is
      usually done using an oscillometric pressure device (NIBP). A number of studies emphasise the
      importance of continuous AP monitoring as more than 20% of all hypotensive episodes may be
      missed by NIBP and another 20% are detected with delay. Prolonged hypotension precedes 56% of
      perioperative cardiac arrests and is associated with a significant increase of the 1-year
      mortality rate, indicating that NBP monitoring especially in patients with cardiovascular
      diseases might be insufficient independent from the clinical setting. Recently, a monitor for
      continuous non-invasive AP monitoring (CNAPâ„¢ Monitor 500) was introduced. It was shown that
      during procedures with high risk of hypotension NIBP missed significant more hypotensive
      episodes than CNAP. At the moment we have no evidence of the performance of CNAP in the
      preclinical emergency medicine. The evaluation against the gold standard of invasive pressure
      measurement in this study will help us to evaluate the performance of CNAP in the preclinical
      setting.
