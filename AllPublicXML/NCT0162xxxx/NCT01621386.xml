      This study will explore the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess ventilatory
      defects that occur due to asthma, determine the sensitivity and specificity of MRI in
      response to drug treatment, and whether MRI can serve as a biomarker of treatment effects due
      to asthma therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria (ALL Patients)

          -  Patient is a male or female 18 to 65 years of age with clinical diagnosis of asthma
             for at least 1 year at the prestudy (screening) visit.

          -  For female patients of reproductive potential, a blood pregnancy test will be
             performed, and it must be negative before the patient can continue in this study. If
             sexually active, the patient must agree to use appropriate contraceptive measures for
             the duration of the study and for 2 weeks after Visit 5. Medically acceptable
             contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy), (2) approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills,
             patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm)
             used with a spermicide, or (4) an intrauterine device (IUD). Contraceptive measures
             such as Plan B™, sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable
             methods for routine use.

          -  Patient understands the study procedures and agrees to participate in the study by
             giving written informed consent (Consent must be given before any study procedures are
             performed)

          -  Patient is willing to comply with the study restrictions and adhere to the
             visit/protocol schedules.

          -  Patient is judged to be in good health (except for asthma) based on medical history,
             physical examination, vital sign measurements, and laboratory safety tests performed
             at the prestudy (screening) visit and/or prior to administration of the initial dose
             of study drug and has no evidence of cardiac, endocrine, or metabolic disease.

          -  Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≤ 39 kg/m2 at the prestudy screening (Visit 1).
             BMI is calculated by taking the patient's weight in kg and dividing by the patient's
             height in meters, squared. Patient's body must fit within the scanner sufficiently
             well to allow satisfactory imaging in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Patient is a current non-smoker or if patient has a history of smoking, has not smoked
             for at least 6 months and has a smoking history of no more than 5 pack-years (i.e., 1
             pack per day for 5 years). Patients who have discontinued smoking or the use of
             nicotine / nicotine containing products for at least approximately 3 months may be
             enrolled in the study at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Patient has been defined by the study site team as having allergic asthma.

          -  Patient is able to perform reproducible pulmonary function testing (i.e., the 2 best
             acceptable spirograms have FEV1 values that do not vary by more than 5% of the largest
             value or more than 100 mL, whichever is greater).

          -  Patient has no clinically significant abnormality on electrocardiogram (ECG) performed
             at the prestudy (screening) visit and/or prior to administration of the initial dose
             of study drug.

          -  Patient has no contraindication to MRI exam.

                  corticosteroid dose

        Note: near fatal asthma event in the past is part of the definition, but subjects will not
        be eligible for study if they fulfill this criterion within the past 5 years.

             hypertension, osteoporosis, as well as poorly controlled concomitant conditions that
             include obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and

             medication, could be immediately life threatening (e.g., arrhythmias, congenital heart
             disease), would pose a restriction on participation or successful completion of the
             study, or would pose an additional risk to administering montelukast to the patient.
