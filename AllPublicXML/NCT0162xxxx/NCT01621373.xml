    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to explore the optimal propofol dose in neonates receiving a single
      intravenous propofol bolus for endotracheal intubation during (semi-)elective INSURE
      (intubation-surfactant-extubation) procedure (preterm neonates) and (semi-)elective
      non-INSURE procedures (term-preterm neonates).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol
      (short acting anesthetic) in 50 neonates to whom the drug is administered as a intravenous
      bolus. This is part of routine clinical care in patients receiving (semi-) elective
      intubation. It's the aim to explore the most effective IV propofol dose for a successful
      INSURE (intubation, surfactant, extubation) procedure and for successful (semi-) elective
      intubation in non-INSURE procedures. We hereby aim to define the most optimal dose regimen
      for propofol in neonates.

      we will hereby use

        -  predefined scoring systems to evaluate sedation, relaxation and intubation conditions

        -  vital parameter monitoring

        -  pharmacokinetic analysis with blood samples

        -  brain monitoring with NIRS (Near infrared spectroscopy) derived cerebral oxygenation and
           aEEG (amplitude integrated EEG).

    <description>Using predefined scoring systems we will evaluate in how many patients successful intubation and extubation in INSURE-conditions was achieved. In non-INSURE conditions only successful intubation will be evaluated. Afterward we will explore the given dose of propofol in each stratum to reach this outcome measure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonates admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit who need short procedural
             sedation for (semi-) elective intubation will be considered for inclusion, after
             informed written consent of the parents.

          -  Patients can be included if they are hemodynamically stable and did not receive
             sedative or analgesic agents during the previous 24 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known propofol intolerance
