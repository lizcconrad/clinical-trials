      The main objective of this study is to estimate of the link (odds ratio) between the
      precariousness defined by the score SPICE (2 groups: precarious and insecure) and stage at
      diagnosis (2 groups: CAS: stages 1 or 2 the &quot;good prognosis &quot;versus the witnesses: stage 3 or
      4 bad prognosis).

      Our secondary objectives include:

        -  To study the link between cancer stage at diagnosis and diverse parameters describing
           living conditions

        -  To construct a new score for social fragility based on new data collected in this study,
           and to compare this score with the EPICES score

        -  To study patient quality of life at study baseline

        This study is a case-control study concerning the female population suffering from breast
        cancer in the Herault department of France. Only invasive cancers are taken into account.
        For each case, we will have at least 2 controls, matched according to age +- 2 years.
