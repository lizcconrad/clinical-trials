  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>ETDRS Letter Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the visual acuity measurement using this handheld internally illuminated ETDRS chart, and a standard back illuminated EDTRS chart. This will be done during the visual acuity test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ETDRS Letter Score Consistency</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>To use the score results to determine whether this new, handheld chart, called the RAM-ETDRS chart, is just as efficient as the standard ETDRS eye chart in measuring your vision. This will be done during your visual acuity exam.</description>
