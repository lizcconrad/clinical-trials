    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HbA1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. Least square (LS) means in HbA1c were calculated using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) based mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the change in HbA1c as the dependent variable and treatment, macroalbuminuria (MA) region, Baseline CKD Severity, week, treatment*week, baseline HbA1c (%), log baseline eGFR (within CKD severity), and participant was the random effect.

    <description>The daily mean of 8-point SMPG profile at Week 26 is presented. Participants were required to perform two 8-point SMPG profiles over a 1-week period at 5 separate times throughout the study. LS means were calculated using the MMRM model including the corresponding baseline value as a continuous covariate, as well as baseline HbA1c, MA-region, treatment, week, treatment*week, baseline CKD severity, and log baseline eGFR (within CKD severity).The two 8-point SMPG profiles were collected on two non-consecutive days (pre-meal and 2-hour postprandial SMPG x [morning, midday, and evening meals in one day] + bedtime + 5 hours after bedtime).</description>

Least square (LS) means in HbA1c were calculated using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) based mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the change in HbA1c as the dependent variable and treatment, macroalbuminuria (MA) region, Baseline CKD Severity, week, treatment*week, baseline HbA1c (%), log baseline eGFR (within CKD severity), and participant was the random effect.

        <title>Change From Baseline in 8-Point Self-Monitored Plasma Glucose (SMPG)</title>
        <description>The daily mean of 8-point SMPG profile at Week 26 is presented. Participants were required to perform two 8-point SMPG profiles over a 1-week period at 5 separate times throughout the study. LS means were calculated using the MMRM model including the corresponding baseline value as a continuous covariate, as well as baseline HbA1c, MA-region, treatment, week, treatment*week, baseline CKD severity, and log baseline eGFR (within CKD severity).The two 8-point SMPG profiles were collected on two non-consecutive days (pre-meal and 2-hour postprandial SMPG x [morning, midday, and evening meals in one day] + bedtime + 5 hours after bedtime).</description>
