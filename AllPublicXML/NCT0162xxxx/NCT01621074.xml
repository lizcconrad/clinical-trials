  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During endurance exercise in the heavy and severe intensity domains, the rate at which
      metabolites that have been associated with the fatigue process (e.g. Pi, ADP, H, and
      extracellular K) accumulate increases. possibly leading to exercise cessation. Sodium
      bicarbonate, as a nutritional supplement, has gained attention over the past decades, because
      it might delay of offset fatigue. To date, there is a controversial discussion about which
      delivery mode (amount and frequency) might be best in optimizing endurance performance. Since
      the high ion load consequent to multiple ingestions might increase plasma volume, and
      consequently decrease bicarbonate concentrations, single acute ingestion could be more
      beneficial. However, in multi-day competitions or tournaments it might be necessary to use
      the supplement on a daily basis. Here, the investigators aim at investigating the effects of
      single dose or multiple dose (on five consecutive days) administration of bicarbonate vs.
      placebo increases endurance performance and acid-base homeostasis in trained male endurance
      athletes.
