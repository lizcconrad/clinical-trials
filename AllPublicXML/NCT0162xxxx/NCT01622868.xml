      This randomized phase II trial studies how well whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic
      radiosurgery with or without lapatinib ditosylate works in treating patients with breast
      cancer that has too many of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
      on its cells and has spread to the brain. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill
      tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized radiation therapy
      that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor
      cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Lapatinib ditosylate may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known
      whether whole-brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery together with lapatinib
      ditosylate is an effective treatment for brain metastasis from breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if there is a signal for an increase in complete response (CR) rate in the
      measurable brain metastases at 12 weeks post radiation therapy (RT) (whole brain or
      stereotactic radiosurgery [SRS]) as determined by magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) scan of
      the brain, with the addition of lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) to whole-brain radiation
      therapy (WBRT)/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate CR rate of the measurable brain metastases at 4 weeks post RT (WBRT/SRS) as
      determined by MRI scan of the brain, with the addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to
      WBRT/SRS alone.

      II. To evaluate objective response rate of measurable brain metastases at 4 and 12 weeks post
      RT (WBRT/SRS) as determined by MRI scan of the brain, with the addition of lapatinib to
      WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.

      III. To evaluate targeted lesion-specific objective response rate (CR + partial response
      [PR]) at 4 and 12 weeks post WBRT/SRS.

      IV. To evaluate central nervous system (CNS) progressive disease outside the targeted
      measurable disease with addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.

      V. To evaluate targeted lesion-specific progression at 4 and 12 weeks post WBRT/SRS.

      VI. To evaluate treatment related adverse events when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared
      to WBRT/SRS alone.

      VII. To evaluate overall CNS complete response: disappearance of all CNS target lesions
      sustained for at least 4 weeks; with no new lesions, no use of corticosteroids, and patient
      is stable or improved clinically, when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS
      alone.

      VIII. To evaluate overall CNS progressive disease (within or outside targeted measurable
      disease) with addition of lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS alone.

      IX. To evaluate overall survival when adding lapatinib to WBRT/SRS compared to WBRT/SRS
      alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo WBRT 5 days a week for 3 weeks for a total of 15 treatments or SRS
      for 1 treatment.

      ARM B: Patients undergo WBRT or SRS as in Arm A. Patients also receive lapatinib ditosylate
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 12 weeks and then
      every 12 weeks thereafter.
