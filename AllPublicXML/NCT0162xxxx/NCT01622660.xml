  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine and Cisplatin are standard chemotherapy drugs used to treat advanced urothelial
      cancer. There is no standard chemotherapy for patients who cannot receive Cisplatin. However,
      most patients are treated with the chemotherapy drugs Gemcitabine and Carboplatin.

      In this study, the researchers hope to learn what effects, good and/or bad, the combination
      of Gemcitabine and Pazopanib has on urothelial cancer. Gemcitabine is given intravenously
      (through the veins) and works by killing rapidly dividing cells in the body, including cancer
      cells. Pazopanib is an oral chemotherapy and works by decreasing the blood supply to tumors
      which limits the tumor's source of oxygen and nutrients.

      The combination of Gemcitabine and Pazopanib is being tested in research studies such as this
      one. As of August 2011, more than 18 patients with various types of cancer have received
      treatment with Gemcitabine and Pazopanib. The main goal of this clinical research study is to
      learn if the study drugs Gemcitabine and Pazopanib can shrink or slow the growth of
      urothelial cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied. The physical state, changes
      in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings will help us decide if the combination of
      Gemcitabine and Pazopanib is safe and effective.

Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 Measurable lesions: lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter ≥ 10 mm by clinical exam or with spiral CT scan or MRI (no less than double the slice thickness and a minimum of 10mm). Malignant lymph nodes must be 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by spiral CT scan to be considered measurable.

             brief period of time (e.g., within approximately 15-20 minutes) to confirm the

Gemcitabine and Pazopanib: Patients will receive gemcitabine 1200 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 and day 8 and pazopanib 800 mg orally daily day 1 through day 21 (1 cycle = 21 days). Patients will receive 6 cycles of combination therapy (gemcitabine and pazopanib) unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients that achieve stable disease, a partial response, or a complete response after completion of 6 cycles, and who are not candidates for consolidation surgery, will be eligible to continue pazopanib monotherapy at the same dose and schedule until disease progression for a maximum of 18 additional cycles.</description>
