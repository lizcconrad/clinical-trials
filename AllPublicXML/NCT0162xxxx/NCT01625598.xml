  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that computer detection of the severity of diabetic retinopathy including
      the presence of clinically significant macular edema is not inferior to the detection using a
      dilated eye examination by a Board-certified ophthalmologist.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is a multicenter, observational study to compare the accuracy of the IDX-DR
      computer detection system to board certified ophthalmologists performing dilated eye
      examination at identifying between no or mild NPDR without clinically significant diabetic
      macular edema from more than mild NPDR with or without CSDME. Approximately 400-600 persons
      with diabetes will be recruited through 5 clinical centers. The ophthalmologist who examines
      the patient will evaluate and record the status of the eye based on his/her clinical
      examination. The study subjects will then have two fundus photographs taken of each eye. The
      photographic images will be transferred to a central Reading Center at the University of
      Pennsylvania and interpreted by professional graders. The Reading Center will then transfer
      the images to IDx-DR, the computer detection system. IDx-LLC, the Sponsor of this study, will
      have no access to the images. Data from the Reading Center interpretation will be considered
      the &quot;gold standard&quot;. The results of the clinical examination and IDX-DR will be compared
      against this gold standard as well as against each other.

    <measure>Sensitivity of detecting moderate non proliferative diabetic retinopathy or more severe DR and/or significant macular edema on a person-specific basis.</measure>
    <time_frame>Recruitment over 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>If the interval excludes differences of 10% or more (IDx worse than clinical examination), then the IDx system will be considered non-inferior to clinical examination by ophthalmologists. If IDx is non-inferior to clinical examination, a two-sided test of the null hypothesis that the difference in sensitivities is 0 will be conducted to determine if the IDX is superior to clinical examination. 24 McNemar's test for paired proportions will be used to test the difference in proportions.</description>
