  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2004, the investigators initiated a human Capsaicin inhalation experiment under an
      Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol approved by the FDA (IND 69,642) and the subject
      safety procedures instituted and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). As part of
      the study protocol, inhaled Capsaicin solutions were analyzed using high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC). The investigation employed safety procedures while conducting the
      human inhalation investigations. In addition, during our investigations we observed
      discrepancies between the predicted Capsaicin concentrations mixed by a registered pharmacist
      and the actual capsaicin concentrations determined by HPLC. The stability of Capsaicin
      solutions stored over a seven month period and refrigerated at 4degrees C and protected
      against ultraviolet light were examined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a research subject's death during an inhalation study using medications/drugs not
      approved for this route, the FDA prohibited human use of non-approved chemicals including
      capsaicin administered via inhalation.

      Capsaicin inhalation challenge tests (CICT) were performed on forty men of different ages
      utilizing pharmaceutical grade Capsaicin. Solutions were mixed by a registered pharmacist and
      Capsaicin doses, administered to subjects, were analyzed by high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC). Capsaicin solutions were stored in a refrigerator at 4 degrees C and
      shielded from ultraviolet light for 7 months. There was serial monitoring by spirometry and
      impulse oscillometry, electrocardiography, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen saturation
      measurements.

      There were no adverse reactions at any dose, including the highest capsaicin concentration.
      Serial spirometry and impulse oscillometry, electrocardiography, blood pressure, pulse and
      oxygen saturation measurements did not change. The actual amount of pharmaceutical-grade
      capsaicin measured was 85.5% of the concentrations estimated by the registered pharmacist at
      time of mixing. The difference was more for the lowest 0.49 uMol dose (28.1) compared to a
      2.2% lesser concentration for the 1000 uMol solution. Capsaicin concentrations fell after 3
      months of storage.

      Dilute capsaicin aerosol inhalation is relatively innocuous and CICT is safe. The actual
      amount of pharmaceutical-grade capsaicin inhaled by subjects is less than the estimate at
      mixing. Capsaicin loses potency after 3-months of protected storage. Inhalation studies
      involving non-approved drugs or chemicals/medications can be safely conducted when they
      follow the appropriate safety procedures such as described in this investigation.

    <time_frame>Baseline and &gt;5 coughs 2-minutes after each inhaled capsaicin dose</time_frame>
    <description>Single breaths of capsaicin were delivered in ascending order, with normal saline solution randomly interspersed to increase challenge blindness, until two (C2) and five (C5) or more coughs were reached. The different concentrations were delivered at 2 minute intervals. After each inhalation dose the following were performed: FEV1 measurement, administer of the symptom questionnaire and auscultation of the chest for wheezing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Repeatedly over 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Over a 1-week period, repeated telephone calls recorded responses to 6 questions. Subjects were asked post-inhalation symptoms of: (1) heavy or difficulty in breathing; (2) phlegm production: (3) runny or irritated nose; (4) throat irritation or burning: (5) feeling of a weight or tightness of the chest; and, (6) feeling of chest burning. Any subject reporting continued symptoms of category #4 (i.e., very severe) for two or more items, compared to the baseline was asked to return for more detailed evaluation.</description>
