      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects a new drug AT7519M has on chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because AT7519M has been shown to shrink tumours in animals, has
      been studied in a few people and seems promising, but it is not clear if it can offer better
      results than standard treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously documented CLL as defined by the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic
             Lymphocytic Leukemia guidelines [Hallek 2008(a)], that is recurrent or relapsed after
             previous therapy and that requires treatment.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2

          -  Measurable disease criteria to assess response. Patients must have at least ONE of:

        Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 10 x 10^9/L OR At least one pathologically enlarged lymph node
        (≥ 2 x 2 cm) by CT scan

          -  Previous Therapy Patients must have received at least one, and may have received up to
             three prior systemic treatment regimens (single agent or combination therapy), there
             is no limit on number of prior regimens.

        Systemic Therapy:

        Patients must have received at least one prior systemic treatment regimen (single agent or
        combination therapy). There is no limit on number of prior regimens.

        Patients must be ≥ 4 weeks since last dose of systemic therapy (including investigational).
        Exceptions to the 4-week interval since last treatment are possible if prior therapy is
        non-myelosuppressive or if any treatment-related myelosuppression has resolved.

        Rationale:

        Based on a review of recently published phase II trials of CDK inhibitors in relapsed and
        refractory CLL, there does not appear to be sufficient grounds to restrict the number of
        previous cycles of systemic chemotherapy. The IND193 investigators do not predict that this
        change will affect either the safety or efficacy outcomes of the study drug.

          -  Not permitted:

          -  Radioactive Monoclonal Antibody Therapy

          -  Prior treatment with AT7519M or another CDK inhibitor

          -  Previous allogeneic stem cell transplant (Note: autologous stem cell transplant is
             permitted)

        Radiation:

        Patients may have had radiation, provided a minimum of 21 days has elapsed prior to
        enrollment. (Exceptions may be made however, for low dose, palliative radiotherapy Patients
        must have recovered from any acute toxic effects from radiation prior to registration.

        Surgery:

        Previous surgery is permitted provided that wound healing has occurred and at least 14 days
        have elapsed if surgery was major.

          -  Laboratory Requirements: (must be done within 7 days prior to registration) Hematology
             = Absolute neutrophils (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L Platelets = ≥ 75 x 10^9/L (exception: if
             ITP secondary to CLL, allow 50 x 10^9/L) Chemistry = Creatinine clearance* ≥ 50 mL/min
             Creatine Phosphokinase = (CK or CPK) ≤ UNL Bilirubin = ≤ UNL AST and ALT = ≤ 2.5 x UNL
             Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium Within normal limits

          -  Patient consent must be obtained according to local Institutional and/or University
             Human Experimentation Committee requirements. It will be the responsibility of the
             local participating investigators to obtain the necessary local clearance, and to
             indicate in writing to the NCIC CTG Study Coordinator that such clearance has been
             obtained, before the trial can commence in that centre. Because of differing
             requirements, a standard consent form for the trial will not be provided but a sample
             form is provided as a separate attachment. A copy of the initial REB approval and
             approved consent form must be sent to the central office. The patient must sign the
             consent form prior to registration. Please note that the consent form for this study
             must contain a statement which gives permission for the NCIC CTG and monitoring
             agencies to review patient records.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance)
             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, response assessment, adverse events, and follow-up.

          -  In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working
             days of patient registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma
             skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, other in situ cancers or
             other invasive malignancies curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 5
             years.

          -  Patients with known CNS involvement by CLL. Tests to investigate CNS involvement are
             required only if clinically indicated (i.e. disease suspected on basis of symptoms or
             other findings).

          -  Patients with clinically suspected or proven progression to high grade lymphoma
             (Richter's transformation) or myelodysplasia.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity to the study drug or its components.

          -  The following are exclusions for enrolment on the study:

               1. Pregnant or lactating women. (N.B.: All women of childbearing potential must have
                  a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to registration).

               2. Men and women of childbearing potential who do not agree to use adequate
                  contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
                  study entry and for the duration of the study participation. (Should a woman
                  become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant, or should a man father a child, while
                  participating in this study, she/he should inform the treating physician
                  immediately.)

          -  Serious illness or medical condition which would not permit the patient to be managed
             according to the protocol, including, but not limited to:

               1. history of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder (e.g. uncontrolled
                  psychotic disorders) which would impair the ability to obtain consent or limit
                  compliance with study requirements;

               2. active uncontrolled or serious infection (viral, bacterial or fungal);

          -  Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions and/or symptomatic cardiac
             dysfunction as follows:

               1. Significant cardiac event (including heart failure or ischemia) within 3 months
                  of entry or any cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the investigator,
                  increases risk for ventricular arrhythmia

               2. Any family or personal history of ventricular arrhythmia, which was symptomatic
                  or required treatment (CTC grade 3). This includes: multifocal PVCs, bigeminy,
                  trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia)

               3. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 150 mmHg or higher or

               4. A previous history of drug induced QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval
                  equal to or greater than 500 msec) or other significant ECG abnormalities

               5. Congenital long QT syndrome

          -  Patients who are currently receiving treatment with agents with a known risk of
             Torsades de Pointes. (see http://torsades.org [list #1]). However, patients may be
             enrolled on study if treatment with such agents is stopped ≥ 7 days prior to first
             dose of AT7519M.

          -  Patients with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy (sensory and/or pain) &gt; grade 2.
