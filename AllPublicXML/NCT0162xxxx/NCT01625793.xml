  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study has been designed to identify behavioral and physiological mechanisms
      through which positive social connectivity (PCS) and negative social processes (NSP) interact
      with psychosocial stress to promote resilience in the context of illness. The investigators
      model inflammation (a central element of all disease states) through the use of treatment
      with interferon (IFN)-alpha, which provides a standardized regimen of chronic cytokine
      exposure known to produce profound behavioral disturbances, including depression, fatigue and
      sickness, in a high percentage of individuals. To objectively assess social processes, the
      current project will employ the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR), which periodically
      and unobtrusively records snippets of ambient sounds in people's momentary environments. To
      objectively assess behavioral and physiological responses to psychosocial stress the current
      project will employ the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), a standardized laboratory stressor
      known to reliably activate behavioral, neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses. These novel
      methodologies and model systems will be employed to test the hypotheses that (a) pre-existing
      affiliative and prosocial behavior will promote resilience in the context of chronic
      inflammation and that (b) —conversely—chronic inflammation will reduce affiliative and
      prosocial behavior via effects on stress reactivity, neuroendocrine function and sleep.
      Finally, it will explore (c) the potential mediating role of stress physiology. To test these
      hypotheses, 110 subjects with chronic hepatitis C virus infection will be randomized to
      receive treatment with pegylated IFN-alpha plus ribavirin or to postpone treatment for 6
      weeks: 55 subjects at University of Arizona and 55 subjects at Emory University. Prior to
      randomization and 6 weeks later all subjects will be evaluated with the EAR and sleep
      actigraphy in their home environments and will undergo TSST and 14 hour diurnal
      neuroendocrine and immune measurement.

    <description>Hepatitis C patients who are eligible to receive IFN-alpha treatment and enrolled in this study will be treated with pegylated IFN-alfa-2b or pegylated IFN-alfa-2a plus ribavirin at a dose of 800-1,400 mg/d as determined by the treating gastroenterologist. All medication administration is for purely clinical indications as dictated by treating physicians. Any and all diagnostic or treatment issues related to potential treatment with IFN-alpha will be conducted by treating clinicians. Subjects will be randomized to start their clinical (non-research) treatment following completion of baseline assessments or to delay the start of their clinical (non-research) treatment by 7 weeks.</description>
