  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study intends to investigate several aspects of the respiratory effects of
      intravenous sedation of patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for knee replacement surgery.
      The study will include assessment of PaCO2 during the intraoperative period. PaCO2 is
      expected to be elevated as a result of intravenous sedation and postural factors. Further,
      the study will investigate how application of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (N-CPAP) may impact PaCO2.

    <measure>Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) test to investigate the breathing effects on patients receiving CPAP treatment during spinal anesthesia for knee replacement.</measure>
    <time_frame>ABG will be collected five minutes after surgical skin incision and the second specimen will be collected exactly 30 minutes later.</time_frame>
    <description>The TEST patients will receive CPAP treatment immediately after the first ABG specimen is drawn. After collection of the second ABG specimen, the anesthesia team may elect to remove the N-CPAP mask or maintain it as deemed best. The CONTROL patients will not receive CPAP treatment.</description>
