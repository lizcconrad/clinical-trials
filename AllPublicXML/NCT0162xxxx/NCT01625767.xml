  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part study. Study 1 will compare Approach Avoidance Training (AAT) responses in
      smokers and nonsmokers in order to confirm that adolescent smokers experience cognitive bias
      towards tobacco-related stimuli.

    <description>For all AAT comparisons, the investigators will compare median scores (to minimize influence of outliers) for cigarette approach and cigarette avoid RTs. The difference between these values gives the smoking AAT-scores, which the investigators expect to not differ from zero in the non-smokers (or to show mild avoidance), while it is expect that smokers will be faster to approach than to avoid cigarettes. ANOVA models will be used to compare scores in smokers vs. nonsmokers. Regression analyses will be used to explore the relationships between impulsivity-related measures and AAT responses.</description>
