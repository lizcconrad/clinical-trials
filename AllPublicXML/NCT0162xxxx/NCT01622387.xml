  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During coronary bypass surgery, veins are taken from the leg and applied to the heart and
      aorta to 'bypass' narrowings in the coronary arteries. However using an artery in the chest,
      the internal mammary artery, means that the bypass lasts longer than using veins. The
      investigators recently showed that using an artery from the arm as a bypass vessel, the
      radial artery, also had less furring up than veins 5 years after surgery. Now the
      investigators would like to ask patients to come back for an angiogram 10 years following
      surgery.
