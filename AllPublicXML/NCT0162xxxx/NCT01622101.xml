      Background: Zantrex-3® is a popular dietary supplement for weight control, which consists of
      a combination of yerba mate, guarana, caffeine and damiana. The combination has previously
      been shown to decrease gastric emptying and its weight controlling effects may be related to
      increased satiety and thermogenesis.

      Objective: To investigate the effect of Zantrex-3® on energy expenditure, hemodynamic factors
      and subjective appetite sensations.

      Design: Twenty-three men (BMI: 23.9±3.2 kg/m2, mean±SD) participated in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The Zantrex-3® compound contained 365 mg
      xantines (caffeine and caffeine-like stimulants), yerba mate, guarana and damiana. The
      thermogenic effect was measured for 3 hours post-intake. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR)
      and appetite ratings were assessed every half hour.

    <measure>Acute 3-h changes from baseline in energy expenditure and respiratory quotient (RQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on 2 seperate test days in a crossover design. Each test day is seperated by &gt;7 days.respiratory measurements were of 3-h duration post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects underwent assessments of resting metabolic rate (RMR) and respiratory quotient (RQ) by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system (Oxycon Champion, Mijnhardt B.V, Bunnick, The Nederlands).
The respiratory measurements were of 3-h duration; from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Two baseline measurements (25 minutes) were performed between 9 a.m - 10 a.m. At 10 a.m the participants ingested one serving of the Zantrex-3® supplement or placebo and 25-minutes respiratory measurements were repeated 6 times over the next 3 hours (post-dose).</description>

    <measure>3-h acute change in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on 2 seperate test days in a crossover design. Each test day is seperated by &gt;7 days. Measurements were carried out at baseline and time 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate and blood pressure were measured using a digital blood pressure meter with an automati-cally inflating cuff of appropriate cuff size. The results were given as means of 2 to 3 consecutive measurements</description>

    <measure>Acute 3-h changes from baseline in subjective appetite sensations using visual analogue scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on 2 seperate test days in a crossover design. Each test day is seperated by &gt;7 days. On each test day appetite sensations are measured prior to the test compound (time 0) and 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes post intake</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of subjective appetite sensations (visual analogue scales (VAS)) at time 0 (baseline - prior to the test meal) and at time 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 minutes post intake.
Measured subjective appetite sensations of hunger, satiety, prospective consumption, fullness, composite appetite score and sensory desires to something sweet, salty, rich in fat, or meat/fish.</description>

    <measure>Acute 3-h changes from baseline in self-reported discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on 2 seperate test days in a crossover design. Each test day is seperated by &gt;7 days. On each test day the subjects were asked if they felt any physiological discomfort after ingesting the test compound</time_frame>

    <description>The present study was designed as a 2-arm randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Each treatment was separated by &gt;7 d washout period. Both treatments were administered as tablets. The Zantrex-3® compound contained yerba maté, caffeine, guarana, damiana, green tea, kola nut, schizonepeta, piper nigrum, ginseng, maca root, and cocoa nut. The content of xantines (caffeine and caffeine-like stimulants) accounted for 365 mg per serving (2 capsules) or 1095 mg (6 capsules) if given as a daily dose. The placebo supplement contained rice flower and could not be distinguished from the Zantrex-3® compound with regard to colour, taste, smell or ap-pearance.</description>
