    <textblock>
      This randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RO5469754 in healthy volunteers.
      Subjects will be randomized in cohorts to receive single ascending intravenous or
      subcutaneous doses of RO5469754 or placebo. In-clinic period will be from Day -1 to Day 4,
      with a safety follow-up of 15 weeks after dosing.
