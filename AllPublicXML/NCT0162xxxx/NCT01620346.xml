    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the advanced maternal age as a rationale for
      performing intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI).

      This prospective randomized study included couples undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm
      injection (ICSI) as a result of advanced maternal age (≥ 37 years old). Couples were randomly
      allocated to receive one of two sperm selection procedures (ICSI, n = 33; or IMSI, n = 33).
      The groups were compared with regard to fertilization rate, percentage of high-quality
      embryos, implantation, pregnancy and miscarriage rates.

    <description>This group was provided with conventional intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). This treatment is routinely used to treat infertility. Sperm selection in the ICSI group is analysed under a magnification of 400x using an inverted microscope.</description>

    <description>Intracytoplasmic morphologically selected sperm injection (IMSI) is an established modified ICSI procedure. Sperm selection in the IMSI group is examined at high magnification using an inverted microscope equipped with high-power differential interference contrast optics (DIC/Nomarski). The total calculated magnification is x6.600. The sperm cells exhibiting normally shaped nuclei and normal nuclear chromatin content are selected for injection.</description>

    <description>ICSI is routinely used to treat couples with infertility. Sperm selection in the ICSI group was analysed under a magnification of 400x using an inverted microscope. ICSI was performed in a micro-injection dish prepared with 4 µL droplets of buffered medium (Global® w/HEPES, LifeGlobal, Connecticut, USA) and covered with paraffin oil on a heated stage at 37.0 ± 0.5°C of an inverted microscope.</description>

    <description>IMSI is an established modified ICSI procedure that used an unstained real-time observation of spermatozoa under high-magnification. Sperm selection in the IMSI group is examined at high magnification using an inverted microscope equipped with high-power differential interference contrast optics (DIC/Nomarski). The total calculated magnification is x6.600. The sperm cells exhibiting normally shaped nuclei and normal nuclear chromatin content are selected for injection.</description>
