    <measure>Mean sleep latency</measure>

    <description>An objective assessment of sleepiness that measures the likelihood of falling asleep. The test consists of multiple naps performed on the day before study drug administration in period 1 and on the day of study drug administration in period 1. For each nap, sleep latency will be measured as the elapsed time from lights-out to the first epoch scored as sleep. Mean sleep latency is calculated for each day as the average of the sleep latencies from each nap on that day.</description>

The clinician will ask the guardian to assess the child's home behavior over the past week. The CGI-C ratings will be assessed using the following 7 categories and scoring assignments: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse</description>
