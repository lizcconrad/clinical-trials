      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of buffered local anesthesia
      injections to numb the gums and teeth during dental treatment. Adjusting the pH of lidocaine
      with sodium bicarbonate may reduce the pain of injection for both adults and children. In
      this study, the investigators will compare two local anesthetic preparations, a buffered
      anesthetic and the conventionally available anesthetic, for pain upon injection.

      Hypothesis: Anesthetic buffered to physiologic pH will result in a less painful injection
      compared to the acidic alternative used in most dental offices. This can be demonstrated by
      comparing two local anesthetic preparations, a buffered anesthetic and the conventionally
      available anesthetic, for pain upon injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local anesthesia is an essential procedure in the comprehensive treatment of pediatric
      patients. In the treatment of subjects with dental disease and infection, local anesthesia is
      commonly required when performing operative procedures. The use of local anesthesia serves
      two main purposes: (i) enables the patient to remain free of discomfort during the sometimes
      painful procedure and (ii) permits the practitioner to complete the procedure without fear of
      hurting the patient which might otherwise impede the practitioner's ability to provide
      comprehensive care. However, patients are often fearful of local anesthesia because
      traditional preparations of local anesthesia are acidic and can be painful. Thus, an
      important advance in the areas of subject management and pain control during operative
      procedures would be a preparation of local anesthesia that significantly reduced the pain
      upon injection. A 2010 Cochrane Review found that adjusting the pH of lidocaine with sodium
      bicarbonate reduced the pain of injection for both adults and children. In this study, we
      will compare two local anesthetic preparations, a buffered anesthetic and the conventionally
      available anesthetic, for pain upon injection.

      The study will test a local anesthetic buffering system, the Onset system, an FDA Class 1
      compounding device manufactured by Onpharma Inc. It is a simple and portable local anesthesia
      buffering system that compounds anesthetic solution and 8.4% sodium bicarbonate neutralizing
      additive solution in a precise manner that brings the anesthetic solution up to human
      physiologic pH. Commercially available local anesthetics have a low pH to allow for prolonged
      shelf life, and to keep the anesthetic molecules in solution. The combination of a buffering
      sodium bicarbonate agent and local anesthetic has been reported to result in pain-free
      injections for both adults and children. The neutralizing additive solution is a sterile,
      nonpyrogenic, solution of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in water. pH is adjusted with carbon
      dioxide. Sodium Bicarbonate Inj., 8.4% USP Neutralizing Additive Solution (NDC Code
      509-100-03) and Lidocaine w/ Epinephrine are compatible. Sodium bicarbonate is used in
      medicine and dentistry as regularly as saline, and pre-dates the FDA. It is commercially
      available and currently being used by health professionals in the U.S.A.

      The local anesthetic used in the study will be 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 ppm epinephrine,
      part of the amide family of local anesthetics. It has been widely used in dentistry and
      medicine and has long-standing proven records of safety.

    <measure>Participant Pain Experience After Administration of Local Anesthesia to Numb the Gums and Teeth During Dental Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after anesthetic injection</time_frame>
    <description>Two treatment visits were required for bilateral, mandibular dental operative restorations. At each visit, local anesthetic was delivered to the right or left side of the dentition using one of the two anesthetic types. The administering operator stepped out of the room after each injection was completed, and the participant was asked by a trained research assistant to record a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score. The VAS was used to assess pain sensitivity, and utilizes a 100mm horizontal line, with scores ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 100 (&quot;pain as bad as it can be&quot;).</description>

        <title>Participant Pain Experience After Administration of Local Anesthesia to Numb the Gums and Teeth During Dental Treatment</title>
        <description>Two treatment visits were required for bilateral, mandibular dental operative restorations. At each visit, local anesthetic was delivered to the right or left side of the dentition using one of the two anesthetic types. The administering operator stepped out of the room after each injection was completed, and the participant was asked by a trained research assistant to record a visual analog scale (VAS) pain score. The VAS was used to assess pain sensitivity, and utilizes a 100mm horizontal line, with scores ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 100 (&quot;pain as bad as it can be&quot;).</description>
        <time_frame>immediately after anesthetic injection</time_frame>
        <population>per protocol, in a crossover fashion, each participant received buffered lidocaine at one treatment visit and lidocaine at one treatment visit, in randomly assigned sequence.</population>

      <desc>Participants were contacted by telephone within 48 hours and asked standardized follow-up questions to determine if there were any adverse reactions: 1. Have you had any health problems since you left the dental clinic?, 2. Have you had any soreness in your mouth since you left the dental clinic?, 2.a. If yes, is the soreness at the injection site?</desc>
