  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a single center, open-label, randomized, single dose, in the fasted
      condition and 2-way crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, the safety and
      tolerability of levocetirizine oral solution 5 mg and cetirizine dry syrup 10 mg in Japanese
      healthy male subjects.

      Approximately 20 subjects will receive both treatments of levocetirizine oral solution 5 mg
      and cetirizine dry syrup 10 mg in the design. Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be
      collected and safety assessments will be performed following each dose.

      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the bioequivalence of levocetirizine in
      plasma, when given as levocetirizine oral solution 5 mg relative to cetirizine DS 10 mg in
      Japanese healthy male subjects.
