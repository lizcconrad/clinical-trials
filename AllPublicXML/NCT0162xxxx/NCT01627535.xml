  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies optical imaging in assessing activity during surgery in patients
      with brain tumors. New procedures, such as optical spectroscopy, may help doctors maximally
      remove brain tumors and minimize damage to normal brain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop the instrumentation to achieve real time processing and display of
      intraoperative 2-dimensional optical imaging and spectroscopy (i2DOS) maps in the operating
      arena.

      II. To examine the timing and spatial involvement of human cortex intraoperatively to
      different stimuli using i2DOS.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo i2DOS.

    <time_frame>Day 1 post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Optical reflectance images will be analyzed by pixel by-pixel subtraction of a control trial and a stimulation trial. This subtracted image will then be divided by the control image to normalize for differences between subjects and trials. These ratios thus represent proportional changes from baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine the timing and spatial involvement of human cortex intraoperatively to different stimuli using i2DOS. Stimulus parameters will be varied to investigate stimulus-response relationships. We will study areas of sensori-motor and language cortex using customary stimuli for evoked potentials (i.e. transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), tactile stimuli for exposed cortical dermatome representations, and language tasks for cortical language representations. Results will be correlated with intraoperative electrophysiological measures.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neurosurgical patient population in the City of Hope brain and spinal tumor
             neurosurgical programs that have been diagnosed with a brain tumor.

          -  Only lucid patients qualified to consent to neurosurgical procedure will be approached
             for participation in this study.

          -  We do intend to enroll subjects with potentially terminal brain tumors. Due to the
             potential benefit of intraoperative mapping, we are not planning to exclude these
             subjects.

          -  Patients with any type of brain tumor will be eligible for participation.

          -  All subjects must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There are no exclusion criteria except for individuals without a brain tumor and the
             location of the craniotomy. If the exposed area of brain is not compatible with
             peripheral stimuli or volitional activity the subject cannot be enrolled.

          -  Subjects, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study.
