    <textblock>
      This laboratory study is looking into mechanisms of radiation therapy resistance in samples
      from younger patients with rhabdomyosarcoma. Studying samples of tissue from patients with
      cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and
      identify biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat
      cancer

      Observational Study Model: Cohort Time Perspective: Retrospective Biospecimen Retention:
      Samples with DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study Population Description: Primary care
      clinic Sampling Method: Non-probability sample

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the molecular response/resistance signatures with radiotherapy and standard
      chemoradiation treatments using the xenograft model of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing
      Program (PPTP).

      II. Validate these novel pathways/biomarkers by their detection within clinically annotated
      patient tumor tissue samples and testing their associations with clinical response, local
      control rates, and overall survival rates.

      OUTLINE: Archived tissue samples of matched primary-relapsed and non-matched primary are
      analyzed for genomic DNA, DNA methylation profiles, RNA sequencing, differences between
      alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS), gene expression
      profiles, target-of-rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2 pathway intermediates, and paired
      box 3 (PAX3)/forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) translocation by microarray, immunohistochemical
      staining, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
