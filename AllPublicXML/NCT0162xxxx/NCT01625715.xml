  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate, compared to non-treatment, the impact of
      a titrated dose (1 mg once a day, then 1 mg twice a day and finally a full 2 mg twice a day)
      of ketotifen on the adverse event profile emerging from a rapid peanut desensitization
      protocol, in children with established peanut allergy.

    <textblock>
      The development of a safe oral peanut challenge procedure permits patients that do not have
      severe life threatening allergic reactions, to be safely desensitized with the ability to
      maintain peanut tolerance . The peanut desensitization procedure is however associated with
      unpleasant allergic side effects mainly gastrointestinal and cutaneous manifestations. The
      use of premedication drugs may lessen these side effects and facilitate the peanut
      desensitization procedure. Ketotifen is a fast acting, noncompetitive, H1-receptor blocker
      (antihistamine/inverse agonist) that also inhibits the release of mediators from mast cells
      involved in hypersensitivity reactions.

      The study will enroll 6 (4 in the peanut treatment group, 2 in the control group) children
      with a known history of peanut allergies. The treated subjects will be randomized in a 2:1
      ratio into either a pre-treatment group (final dose of 2 mg bid ketotifen) or a control
      group. All subjects will undergo a one-day peanut desensitization protocol designed to enable
      the subject to tolerate 50 mg of peanut flour (initial escalation phase). After the initial
      escalation day achieving up to 50 mg of peanut flour, the dosing build-up will occur every
      two weeks through 44 weeks. Subjects will ingest the 50mg and increased doses of peanut flour
      at home (every day for 2 weeks) between each dose escalation. The target dose is 8000 mg of
      peanut flour. A maintenance dose will be given for 4 weeks following the last (highest dose)
      visit.
