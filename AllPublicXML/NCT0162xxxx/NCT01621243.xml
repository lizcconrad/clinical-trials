    <textblock>
      People with primary metastatic pancreatic cancer will be treated with nab-paclitaxel and
      gemcitabine in combination with an investigational agent called necuparanib (M402). It is
      made from heparin, which is a well known blood thinner. Blood thinners have been shown in
      prior animal and human studies to have anti-cancer effects. Necuparanib has been
      re-engineered from heparin to have much lower blood thinning activity while keeping the
      anti-tumor activity. The investigators are testing whether necuparanib administered in
      combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine may be more effective than nab-paclitaxel and
      gemcitabine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A was an open-label, multiple ascending dose patient study of necuparanib given first as
      a single dose and then daily in combination with the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine regimen.
      It was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of necuparanib alone and in
      combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine and to recommend a necuparanib dose regimen
      for subsequent evaluation in Part B. Part B is a randomized, double-blind study investigating
      the antitumor activity of necuparanib in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
      compared with nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and placebo. In both Parts A and B, a treatment
      period consists of one 28-day cycle. The Study Patient and Investigator can decide to
      continue with additional 28-day cycles according to the patient's status at the end of each
      28-day cycle. Part A has completed enrollment and Part B is currently open.

      Part A - Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of necuparanib in combination with
           nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.

        -  To determine the dose of necuparanib to be carried forward into Part B.

      Part B - Primary Objective:

      To evaluate overall survival in patients treated with necuparanib + nab-paclitaxel +
      gemcitabine compared with placebo + nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine.

Dose escalation of necuparanib proceeded by cohort in a 3+3 design.
Part B: A fixed dose of necuparanib will be administered daily along with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine administration on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle.</description>
