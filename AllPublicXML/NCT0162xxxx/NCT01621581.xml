  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a chemical that may help protect and
      strengthen brain cells that produce dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical that affects brain
      function. People with Parkinson's disease (PD) have problems producing dopamine in the brain.
      Researchers want to see if gene transfer can help deliver GDNF into the area of the brain
      that is damaged by PD. The gene transferred in this study, called AAV2-GDNF, may help produce
      GDNF to protect the damaged brain cells.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of AAV2-GDNF gene transfer for advanced PD.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced PD that is not well controlled by
      medications.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be in the study for about 5 years. There will be 18 outpatient study
           visits and a 3-day stay in the hospital. There may also be overnight stays for followup
           visits.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples
           will be collected. Tests of PD symptoms and mood and memory will be given. Imaging
           studies will be used to find the right part of the brain to infuse the gene. The
           screening visit will take place up to 60 days before surgery.

        -  Participants will have a baseline visit about a month before the surgery. For 1 week
           before the baseline visit, participants will keep a diary on any motor problems. The
           visit will involve movement tests given before and after taking a regular dose of
           levodopa.

        -  Participants will have surgery to infuse AAV2-GDNF into the brain. The surgery will also
           include a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to collect cerebrospinal fluid. After surgery,
           participants will recover in the hospital for at least 2 days.

        -  Participants will have another lumbar puncture 6 and 18 months after surgery. This will
           be an outpatient visit.

        -  Participants will have regular followup visits after the surgery. These visits will
           include neurological tests and movement studies. Visits with a neurosurgeon will take
           place 1, 2, and 4 weeks after surgery. Additional visits will take place every 3 months
           for the first 3 years, and then at longer intervals for up to 5 years.

      Objective:

      While medications can temporarily alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson s disease (PD), they do
      not influence the degenerative process. Progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons
      (the pathological hallmark of PD) results in progressive neurologic dysfunction and death.
      Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was first identified based on its ability
      to promote the survival of embryonic DA neurons in vitro, and research has demonstrated
      beneficial effects of GDNF in animal models of PD. Preliminary clinical trials of GDNF
      infusions have yielded inconclusive results. Observed problems with tolerability and efficacy
      in these studies may have been related to the methods of delivery. Recent evidence indicates
      that gene transfer via direct delivery of viral vectors may represent a superior approach for
      the treatment of PD with GDNF.

      Study population:

      Twenty-four adult male and female subjects with advanced Parkinson s disease, who are
      candidates for surgical treatment for Parkinson s disease and who meet all Inclusion and
      Exclusion Criteria.

      Design:

      We propose a Phase 1 single-center, open-label, dose escalation, safety and tolerability
      study of adeno-associated virus, serotype 2 vector (AAV2) containing human GDNF complementary
      DNA. Bilateral catheters will be placed surgically through the skull and into the brain and
      the vector will be delivered by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) to both putamina (450
      microliters per hemisphere) of 24 patients with advanced PD. An additional 76 subjects will
      be allowed for screening failures. Four escalating dose levels will be evaluated in the
      following dose cohorts (6 patients per cohort): Cohort 1 = 9 x 10(10)vg, Cohort 2 = 3 x
      10(11)vg, Cohort 3 = 9 x 10(11)vg and Cohort 4 = 3 x 10(12)vg.

      Outcome measures:

      To assess the safety, tolerability, and potential clinical effects of CED of AAV2-GDNF in
      advanced PD patients, we will use defined clinical evaluations of PD (Unified Parkinson s
      Disease Rating Scale, Modified Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living scale, Hoehn and
      Yahr Staging, Lang and Fahn Dyskinesia Rating Scale, On-Off Patient Diary, Quality of Life,
      Modified Rankin Scale, Adverse Event Log and neurologic examinations), laboratory studies
      (hematologic, immunologic and chemistry), neuropsychological testing (Mattis Dementia Rating
      Scale, Beck Depression Inventory II and Parkinson Psychosis Questionnaire) and neuroimaging
      (magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography).
