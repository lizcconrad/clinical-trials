  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal of the investigators ongoing research is the development of a closed-loop
      system for insulin delivery, which can help people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) attain a tight
      glucose control avoiding the risk of hypoglycaemia. The main components of the system are a
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an insulin pump and a computer-based 'model-predictive
      algorithm', which computes the amount of insulin to be given by the insulin pump according to
      the CGM values. In the studies performed thus far the efficacy and safety of closed-loop
      glucose control was evaluated both overnight and over a prolonged period of time including
      the day-time in children and adolescents with T1D. The results showed that closed-loop
      improved control of blood glucose and prevented nocturnal hypoglycaemia, as compared to the
      conventional insulin pump therapy.

      The objective of the current study is to test the performance of closed-loop further, by
      evaluating the system during common non-compliant behaviours in the administration of meal
      insulin doses in adolescents with T1D. This will pave the way for a more comprehensive use of
      closed loop systems to control glucose levels in T1D under various &quot;real-life mimicking&quot;
      common circumstances. The present study adopts an open-label, randomised, 2 period cross-over
      design whereby closed-loop insulin therapy will be compared with the conventional insulin
      pump therapy in 12 adolescents with T1D.

      Participants aged 12 to 18 years will be randomised for two 24 hour studies in a clinical
      research facility, during which glucose levels will be controlled by either the
      computer-based closed-loop algorithm (intervention arm) or by conventional insulin pump
      therapy (control arm). On both occasions, participants will under-estimate and omit the
      meal-related insulin dose for the evening-meal and lunch, respectively. The study will take
      place at the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility (WTCRF), Cambridge with participants
      recruited from paediatric diabetes clinics in England.
