  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a study performed by the Harvard Shoulder Service, it has been documented that there is a
      significant incidence of neurologic complications of the Latarjet procedure for shoulder
      instability. 5 out of 52 patients had neurologic complaints post-operatively. 3 of these
      nerve palsies were transient, however 2 had not yet recovered fully at time of latest
      follow-up and returned to the operating room for exploration and neurolysis of the axillary
      nerve and brachial plexus.

      By using intra-operative neuromonitoring to determine exactly when there is a potential nerve
      injury during the procedure, the investigators will be able to modify what the investigators
      do at that step of the procedure, in order to decrease or possibly even eliminate the risk of
      neurologic injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the intra-operative events which put nerves at risk during
      the Latarjet procedure. By using neuromonitoring to determine exactly when there is a
      potential nerve injury during the procedure, the investigators will be able to modify what
      the investigators do at that step of the procedure, in order to decrease or possibly even
      eliminate the risk of neurologic injury. Modifications to our surgical technique in response
      to events observed on neuromonitoring would include repositioning the operative shoulder and
      upper extremity, and repositioning or removing retractors. The investigators believe this
      would lead to a significant decrease in the incidence of neurologic complications
      post-operatively. Since this operation is usually performed on young, active patients, the
      benefits of reducing or eliminating these complications would have a far-reaching impact both
      for the individual and for society. Above all, the investigators feel that this is an
      important patient safety initiative.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients of the two senior surgeons who will undergo the Latarjet procedure for
             shoulder instability will be considered for inclusion in the study.

          -  Our patients who have received prior approval from their insurance carrier to cover
             neuromonitoring during the surgical procedure will be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Relative contraindications to transcranial electrical stimulation include: history of
             seizures, significant brain trauma, cerebral edema with mass effect, recent CVA,
             intracerebral devices (e.g., shunts, aneurysmal clips), skull defect and cardiac
             pacemaker. Patients with there conditions will be included in the study.
