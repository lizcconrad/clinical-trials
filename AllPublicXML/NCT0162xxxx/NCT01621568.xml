      Background:

      - Sunitinib is drug that is approved for treating various types of cancers, including kidney
      cancers. However, it has not been approved to treat cancers of the thymus. Sunitinib works by
      blocking proteins that are responsible for cell division and growth. Some of these proteins
      can be found on thymus cancer cells. Researchers want to see if sunitinib can be used to
      treat advanced thymus cancer. It will be given to people who have had at least one earlier
      chemotherapy treatment containing platinum.

      Objectives:

      - To see if sunitinib is a safe and effective treatment for advanced thymus cancer that has
      not responded to earlier treatments.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced thymus cancer that has not
           responded to earlier treatments.

        -  At least one previous cancer treatment must have been chemotherapy treatment containing
           platinum.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and tumor biopsies will be used to check the
           severity of the cancer.

        -  Participants will take sunitinib tablets once a day, in the morning. They will take the
           tablets daily for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest with no sunitinib. This 6-week
           period is called a cycle.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

        -  Treatment cycles may be repeated as long as the tumor does not continue to grow and
           there are no severe side effects....

      BACKGROUND:

      Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for advanced unresectable thymoma and
      thymic carcinoma. However over 50% of these patients may fail initial therapy and therefore
      require second-line therapy. New therapeutic options are needed for patients who have disease
      progression on or after platinum-containing therapy. Results obtained from protocol 12-C-0118
      so far have shown impressive clinical activity of sunitinib in patients with recurrent thymic
      carcinoma with an objective response rate of 23% and disease control rate of 91% which is
      unprecedented for this histology. Treatment at a dose of 50 mg once daily for four weeks
      followed by 2 weeks off was poorly tolerated. Twenty five out of 41 patients needed dose
      reductions due to development of intolerable adverse events.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary objective:

      - To evaluate the objective response rate (PR+CR) for sunitinib in patients with relapsed or
      refractory thymoma or thymic carcinoma

      MAIN ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients with histologically confirmed thymoma (Group 1 only) or thymic carcinoma who
           have previously been treated with at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen
           with progressive disease prior to study entry

        -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria

        -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function

        -  No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of
           sunitinib

      DESIGN:

        -  In the first group (Group 1), sunitinib will be administered orally using a continuous
           schedule at 50 mg per day for 4 weeks with 2 weeks off to constitute a 6-week cycle
           (Schedule 4/2) until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects.

        -  In the second group (Group 2), sunitinib will be administered orally using a continuous
           schedule at 50 mg per day for 2 weeks with 1 week off to constitute a 3-week cycle
           (Schedule 2/1) until disease progression or development of intolerable side-effects.

        -  Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by CTCAE Version 4.0

        -  Tumor response assessments by RECIST 1.1 criteria will be performed every cycle for
           Group 1 and every other cycle for Group 2 (every 6 weeks) for patients receiving
           treatment for less than one year, and every two cycles for Group 1 and every four cycles

      for Group 2 (every 12 weeks) for patients who have been receiving treatment one year or
      longer.

      -Exploratory studies include evaluation of serum VEGFR2, PLGF, IL-4, IL-12, HGF, and b-FGF
      (Group 1 only); and circulating tumor cells, endothelial progenitors, and mature apoptotic
      endothelial cells (both groups). In Group 2, regulatory T cells (Tregs), exhausted CD8 T
      cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and Th1/Th2 T cell populations will also be
      evaluated. Where tumor samples are available, intra-tumoral immune infiltrate will be
      assessed (both groups).

        values are in the therapeutic range for a patient on low molecular weight heparin.

        3.1.10 The following groups of patients are eligible provided they have New York Heart
        Association Class II (NYHA) cardiac function on baseline ECHO/MUGA:

          -  those with a history of Class II heart failure who are asymptomatic on treatment

          -  those with prior anthracycline exposure

        become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
        inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must
        also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
        participation, and 4 months after completion of sunitinib administration.

        platelet-derived growth factors-alpha and -beta (PDGF-alpha,-beta), colony-stimulating
        factor 1 (CSF1), and the RET receptor for glial-derived neurotrophic factors.

        3.2.3 Patients with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to
        poor prognosis. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and
        whose brain disease has remained stable for 3 months without steroid therapy may be

        enrolled.

        3.2.4 Patients with evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, or any concurrent
        condition, which could compromise participation in the study, including, but not limited

        months or psychiatric illness/social situations which would jeopardize compliance with the
        protocol.

        3.2.5 History of a previous invasive malignancy within the last 5 years, except adequately
        treated non-melanoma skin cancer, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid or carcinoma in situ
        of the uterine cervix.

        3.2.6 Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
        nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered
        from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

        3.2.7 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

        3.2.8 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
        composition to sunitinib. Patients receiving any medications or substances that are strong
        inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. (A list of potent CYP3A4 inducers or
        inhibitors can be found in Section 5.2.) An exception will be made for patients who are on
        ritonavir-based highly active antiretroviral therapy, in which case the starting dose of
        sunitinib will be modified as indicated in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.2.12. Every effort should
        be made to switch patients taking such agents or substances to other medications. A
        comprehensive list of medications and substances known or with the potential to alter the
        pharmacokinetics of sunitinib through CYP3A4 is provided.

        3.2.9 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because sunitinib angiogenesis inhibitor
        with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
        but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the

        mother with sunitinib breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
        sunitinib.

        3.2.10 Patients who require therapeutic doses of Coumadin derivative anticoagulants such as
        warfarin are excluded. Low molecular weight heparin is permitted, provided the patient s
        PT/INR is less than or equal to 1.5. Coumadin doses of up to 2 mg daily are permitted for
        prophylaxis of thrombosis.

        3.2.11 Patients with a pre-existing thyroid abnormality who are unable to maintain thyroid
        function in the normal range with medication are ineligible.

        3.2.12 Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an
        inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical
        procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their ability
        to swallow and retain sunitinib tablets are excluded.

        3.2.13 Patients with QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval equal to or greater than
        500 msec) or other significant ECG abnormalities are excluded.

        3.2.14 Patients with poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or
        higher or diastolic blood pressure of 91 mmHg or higher) are ineligible.

        3.2.15 Patients who require use of therapeutic doses of coumarin derivative anticoagulants
        such as warfarin are excluded, although doses of up to 2 mg daily are permitted for
        prophylaxis of thrombosis. Note: Low molecular weight heparin is permitted provided the
        patient s PT INR is less than or equal to 1.5.

        3.2.16 Patients with HIV infection are eligible provided their CD4 count is greater than or
        equal to the institutional LLN ( greater than or equal to 334 cells/uL).
