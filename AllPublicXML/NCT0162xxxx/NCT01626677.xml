  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a long term follow-up study to investigate the safety and efficacy of CARTISTEM®,
      human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, in repair of cartilage injury or
      defects, compared with microfracture. Subjects who participated in and completed the Phase
      III trial (NCT01041001) will be tracked until the 60 month post-treatment timepoint.

      This long term follow-up study is performed to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of
      CARTISTEM®, human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells, in repair of cartilage
      injury or defects, compared with microfracture. Subjects, who were either administered
      CARTISTEM or treated with conventional microfracture in the primary phase III study
      (NCT01041001), will be further observed using various subjective knee assessments and MRI T2
      mapping until the 60 month post-treatment timepoint.
