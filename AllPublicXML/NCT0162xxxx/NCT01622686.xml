    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial seeks to test the effect of reformatted prescription drug
      container labels, compared to usual labels, on participants' understanding of their
      medications. The study will also assess the effect on self-efficacy and self-reported
      medication adherence. English and Spanish speaking patients are eligible, with a planned
      sample size of up to 500 adults.
