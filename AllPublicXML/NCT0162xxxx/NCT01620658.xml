    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present trial is to compare the radiation attenuation provided
      by XPF caps (0.5mm lead-equivalent and 0.3mm lead-equivalent) to the standard protection
      (fabric cap, basically no protection) as measured in % radiation attenuation) during 150 days
      of fluoroscopy guided cardiology interventions. The second objective is to compare the
      operator comfort (rated on a visual analog scale) of wearing the XPF protection caps compared
      to the standard fabric caps.

    <description>The null hypothesis is that the XPF 0.5mm lead-equivalent caps attenuation is equal to the XPF 0.3mm lead-equivalent and standard cap attenuations. The alternative hypothesis is that the XPF 0.5mm lead-equivalent cap attenuation is superior or inferior to the XPF 0.3mm lead-equivalent and standard cap attenuations. The groups will be compared separately and a pooled analysis, comparing XPF 0.5mm and 0.3mm combined vs. standard is also planned.</description>
