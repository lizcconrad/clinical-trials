      This study aims to compare the post-meal blood glucose values of two drugs in a &quot;real-worldâ€Ÿ
      setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label trial that aims to compare the glycemic excursion following
      food intake following post-meal injection of Glulisine (Apidra) insulin and Lispro (Humalog)
      insulin in a real-world setting. Children participating in the Florida Camp for Children and
      Youth with Diabetes will be randomized to receive either Glulisine or Apidra to cover
      carbohydrates after meals. The difference in blood glucose values will be analyzed before and
      2 hours after meals to see if there is a difference in post-prandial hyperglycemia between
      groups.

    <measure>The Difference Between Pre- and 120 Minute Post-prandial Blood Glucose Concentrations at Lunch.</measure>

    <description>Blood glucose concentrations were measured prior to and 90 minutes following lunch. Analysis was based on intention to treat. While missing data was imputed, it was known that this data was 'not missing at random' thus violating standard statistical assumptions with imputation. Therefore imputed data was not included in the final model.
The number of participants for analysis was based upon a convenience sample of individuals attending Florida Camp for Children and Youth with Diabetes at Camp Winona.</description>

          <title>The Difference Between Pre- and 120 Minute Post-prandial Blood Glucose Concentrations at Lunch.</title>
          <description>Blood glucose concentrations were measured prior to and 90 minutes following lunch. Analysis was based on intention to treat. While missing data was imputed, it was known that this data was 'not missing at random' thus violating standard statistical assumptions with imputation. Therefore imputed data was not included in the final model.
The number of participants for analysis was based upon a convenience sample of individuals attending Florida Camp for Children and Youth with Diabetes at Camp Winona.</description>
