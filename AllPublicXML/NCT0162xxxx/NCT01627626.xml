  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of 0.1% pilocarpine mouthwash on subjective
      dryness, minor salivary flow rates and unstimulated whole salivary flow rate in xerostomic
      patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in minor salivary flow rates at 60 minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>before and after using the mouthwash (baseline, immediately, 30 minutes, 60 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Minor salivary flow rates (from buccal, lower labial and palatal mucosa) were measured before and after using the mouthwash at predetermined times: baseline, immediately (0 min), and 30 and 60 minutes after. The Periotron 8000 device (Oraflow, New York, USA)was used to measure the flow rate (Âµl/cm2 per min) of saliva from the minor glands, in accordance with the method of Eliasson et al. (1996).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the severity of oral dryness at 60 minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after using mouthwash (baseline, immediately, 30 minutes, 60 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of oral dryness was measured on a numerical rating scale (NRS ; 0-10, where 0=no dry mouth and 10=the worst dry mouth imaginable) before and after using the mouthwash at predetermined times: baseline, immediately (0 min), and 30 and 60 minutes after.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the unstimulated whole salivary flow rates at 60 minutes</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and after using mouthwash (baseline, 60 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Unstimulated whole salivary flow rates (ml/min) were measured before and after using the mouthwash at predetermined times: baseline, and 60 minutes after. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected via the spitting method for 10 minutes while the subject was sitting in an upright position with the head slightly tilted forward and the eyes open after resting for 5 minutes. Subjects were instructed to minimize their orofacial movements during measurement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the severity of oral dryness, minor salivary flow rates, and the unstimulated whole saliva flow rate at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of oral dryness, minor salivary flow rates, and the unstimulated whole salivary flow rates were measured after using the prescribed mouthwash regularly (with 10 ml of the solution for 1 minute, three times per day) for 4 weeks.</description>
