    <textblock>
      This investigation will be conducted as an interventional intention-to-treat clinical study
      in a population of end stage heart failure patients who meet specific inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. The multi-center study will be prospective, dual-armed, non-blinded (open-label)
      and randomized, comparing a treatment group receiving the Jarvik 2000 LVAS with
      Post-Auricular Connector to an active control group treated with the PMA approved Thoratec
      HeartMateÂ® II LVAS for Destination Therapy.

      Study Success for Primary Endpoint A will be established if the proportion of subjects in the
      Treatment Group meeting the Subject Success Criteria A, is determined to be non-inferior to
      that of the Control Group (at two years) according to the pre-specified statistical analysis.

      Subject composite success requires the subject to achieve the Effectiveness Endpoint:

        1. Two year actuarial survival

        2. Freedom from procedures to repair, or replace the implanted device

        3. Freedom from stroke resulting in a Modified Rankin Score of &gt;3 at the two-year follow-up

      Study Success for Primary Endpoint B will be established if the proportion of subjects in the
      Treatment Group meeting the Subject Success Criteria B is determined to be superior to that
      of the Control Group (at three years) according to the pre-specified statistical analysis.

      Subject composite success requires the subject to achieve the Effectiveness Endpoint:

        1. Three year survival

        2. Freedom from the serious adverse event of drive cable or pump pocket infection

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cardiac transplantation ineligible.

          2. Late stage heart failure in NYHA Class IIIb or IV for at least 45 of past 60 days.

          3. Cardiac Index &lt; 2.2 L / min / m2

          4. LVEF = 25% or less

          5. Patients on Optimal Medical Management (OMM) as defined in Section 9.2 OR dependent on
             intra-aortic balloon counter-pulsation for 7 days OR other temporary (indicated for 30
             days use, or less) mechanical circulatory support for 7 days, OR supported with IV
             inotropes for 7 days and failing to respond.

          6. BSA &gt; 1.2 m2 and &lt; 2.5 m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of cardiac transplantation or left ventricular reduction procedure.

          2. Clinical conditions, other than heart failure, which could limit survival to less than
             three years.

          3. Cause of heart failure due to, or associated with, uncorrected thyroid disease,
             obstructive / restrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial disease, amyloidosis,
             dermatomyositis, or active myocarditis.

          4. Intolerance to anti-coagulation or anti-aggregation therapy required for

             Hemashield vascular graft. Patients with a known sensitivity to products of bovine
             origin should not be implanted.

          6. Chronic immunosuppression.
