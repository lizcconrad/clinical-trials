      The overall objectives were to investigate if characteristic dimensions for tissue and
      vessels determined from measured bioimpedance spectra would provide the same values as
      dimensions determined from MR images of the upper arm and verify that temporal variations of
      impedances could be converted to blood pressure.

      It is emphasized that measurements of pulse wave velocity was not a part of this trial, which
      implies that only uncalibrated blood pressures could be measured. The specific objectives
      were:

        1. To determine conductivities and permittivities in the spectral region from 1 KHz to 1
           MHz for persons with: (a) a normal distribution of fat and muscles, (b) exceptionally
           thick layers of subcutaneous fat, and (c) exceptionally thin layers of subcutaneous fat.
           Both sexes should be represented.

        2. To verify that temporal variations synchronous with the heartbeat could be measured on
           all three groups.

      Hypotheses:

      A. That experimentally in vivo determined electrical parameters for tissues would differ
      considerably from theoretical values and from values measured in vitro experiments.

      B. That the variations of the electrical parameters would exhibit little variation from
      person to person.

      C. Those simple experimental relations can be established for the electrical parameters by
      including a simple vascularization model.

      D. That it is possible to measure temporal variation of the impedance, which are synchronous
      with the heartbeat.

      E. That the measured values would facilitate the calculation of the differential blood
      pressure with accuracies better than 10 mmHg.

    <description>Measured on persons with: (a) a normal distribution of fat and muscles, (b) exceptionally thick layers of subcutaneous fat, and (c) exceptionally thin layers of subcutaneous fat.
