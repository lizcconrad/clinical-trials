  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known from the COMET-trial that patients who start Enbrel treatment early have a great
      chance of reaching clinical remission and radiographic nonprogression. It is still unclear,
      however, how many patients with early arthritis achieve remission and radiographic
      nonprogression under the conditions of routine rheumatologic care and the local
      recommendations of Enbrel treatment (pre-treatment of at least 2 DMARDs, one of them MTX).

      Therefore, no robust x-ray data are available to show/demonstrate

        -  the average extent of x-ray damage in routine patients on Enbrel outside clinical
           studies.

        -  if the outstanding effect on structural damage of Enbrel can be reproduced in routine
           practice.

        -  that the 'Silent Progressor' is an issue relevant not only in clinical trials, but also
           for day-to-day decision making.

        -  the optimal onset of Enbrel treatment in the course of the disease to prevent
           radiographic damage

        Only patients for whom the decision has already been made to initiate treatment with
        Enbrel速 can be enrolled in this observational trial. These patients must have a proven
        diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis or Psoriasis Arthritis

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject eligibility should be reviewed and documented by an appropriately qualified
             member of the investigator's study team before subjects are included in the study.

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the subject (or a legally acceptable representative) has been informed of all
             pertinent aspects of the study is a requirement for inclusion into this study.
