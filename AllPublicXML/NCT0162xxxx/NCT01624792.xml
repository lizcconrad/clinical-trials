    <textblock>
      Loss of muscle protein is generally a central component of weight loss in Chronic Obstructive
      Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. Gains in muscle mass are difficult to achieve in COPD
      unless specific metabolic abnormalities are targeted. The investigators recently observed
      that alterations in protein metabolism are present in normal weight COPD patients. Elevated
      levels of protein synthesis and breakdown rates were found in this COPD group indicating that
      alterations are already present before muscle wasting occurs. The investigators recently
      observed that in order to enhance protein anabolism, manipulation of the composition of
      proteins and amino acids in nutrition is required in normal-weight COPD. Intake of casein
      protein resulted into significant protein anabolism in these patients. The anabolic response
      to casein protein was even higher than after whey protein intake.

      A substantial number of COPD patients, underweight as well as normal weight to obese, is
      characterized by an increased inflammatory response. This group failed to respond to
      nutritional therapy. Previous experimental research and clinical studies in cachectic
      conditions (mostly malignancy) indicate that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are able to
      attenuate protein degradation by improving the anabolic response to feeding and by decreasing
      the acute phase response. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (in combination with docosahexaenoic
      acid (DHA)) has been shown to effectively inhibit weight loss in several disease states,
      however weight and muscle mass gain was not present or minimal.

      Until now, limited research has been done examining muscle protein metabolism and the
      response to EPA and DHA supplementation in patients with COPD.

      It is the investigator's hypothesis that supplementation of 2g/day EPA+DHA in COPD patients
      during 4 consecutive weeks will increase the muscle anabolic response to a high quality
      protein supplement as compared to a placebo, and supplementation of 3.5g/day EPA+DHA will
      increase the anabolic response even further. In the present study both the acute and chronic
      effects of EPA+DHA versus a placebo on muscle and whole body protein metabolism will be
      examined. The principal endpoint will be the extent of stimulation of net fractional muscle
      protein synthesis as this is the principal mechanism by which the effect of EPA+DHA on muscle
      anabolism can be measured. The endpoint will be assessed by isotope methodology which is
      thought to be the reference method.

      Specific aim 1: To test the hypothesis that supplementation of 3.5g EPA+DHA will increase the
      acute net fractional muscle protein synthesis more in COPD patients as compared to healthy
      controls in response to a high quality protein supplement.

      Specific aim 2: To test the hypothesis that 3.5g/day EPA+DHA for 4 consecutive weeks induces
      a higher increase in net fractional muscle protein synthesis in response to a high quality
      protein supplement as compared to 2g/day EPA+DHA in COPD patients.

      Therefore, to answer the specific aims in this study only the COPD subjects will undergo a
      4-week intervention period.
