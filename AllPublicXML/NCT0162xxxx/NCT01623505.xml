      Research Aims

      The aims of this research study are:

        1. To determine which of the following three smoking cessation medications is most
           effective in achieving cessation:

             -  Nicotine Patch

             -  Nicotine Patch + gum or inhaler

             -  Varenicline (Champix;

        2. To investigate how often participants experience neuropsychiatric symptoms over the
           course of their cessation attempt and to assess whether:

             -  They occur more often when taking one medication versus another

             -  They occur more often in those with or without psychiatric illnesses.

      Hypotheses to be Tested

      The hypotheses to be tested include the following:

        1. The CO-confirmed continuous abstinence rate from 5 weeks to 52 weeks following a target
           quit date will be significantly higher in smokers receiving long-term transdermal NRT in
           combination with other NRT products or those receiving varenicline compared to those
           receiving transdermal NRT alone.

        2. Some participants will experience neuropsychiatric symptoms during their cessation
           attempt, and those in the varenicline group will experience a greater incidence of
           neuropsychiatric symptoms than those in the groups receiving transdermal NRT alone or in
           combination with other NRT products. Patients with psychiatric illnesses will report
           higher levels of withdrawal symptoms than those without psychiatric illnesses.

      Participants will be recruited from the UOHI Smoking Cessation Clinic and via media
      advertisements. Following the baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of three groups:

        1. 10-week standard regimen of transdermal NRT (NRT);

        2. Long duration of transdermal NRT in combination with other NRT products (NRT+); or

        3. Varenicline (VR).

      Participants assigned to the &quot;NRT&quot; standard regimen group will follow a 10-week treatment of
      nicotine patches alone.

      Participants assigned to the &quot;NRT+&quot; long-duration group will follow the same regimen as the
      NRT group, but will not be limited to a fixed declining dose strategy, nor limited to a
      10-week duration (potential maximum dosage of 35mg/day and maximum treatment duration of up
      to 22 weeks). Participants will also be provided with other NRT products (i.e., gum or
      inhaler).

      Participants assigned to the &quot;VR&quot; group will start the medication on the day of the baseline
      assessment and set a target quit date any time within the 8 to 14 day period after baseline.
      Participants will receive a 12-week supply of varenicline with a possible extension of up to
      24 weeks.

      All participants will receive six 15-minute counselling sessions from a nurse-counsellor
      specializing in smoking cessation in accordance with nursing best-practice guidelines. These
      sessions occur at 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 weeks post target quit date. Counselling sessions will
      focus on practical counselling (problem solving and skills training) and social support.

      During the treatment phase, participants will complete questionnaires measuring withdrawal
      and neuropsychiatric symptoms at 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 weeks. These questionnaires will also be
      completed at 22 and 52 weeks after the target quit date.

Participants will be prescribed 0.5 mg once daily for 3 days, 0.5 mg twice daily for 4 days, and 1 mg twice daily for 11 weeks. Participants will be given the option of extending their treatment to a maximum of up to 24 weeks of varenicline.

    <description>Participants receiving this treatment will set a quit date within 2 weeks after baseline assessment and apply the patch on that day. This group will follow the same regimen as the &quot;standard patch treatment&quot;, but is not limited to a fixed dosing strategy. Participants will be advised on the titration of patch (increase or decrease in dosage) to ensure elimination of withdrawal symptoms (maximum dosage of 35mg/day, maximum treatment of up to 22 weeks). Participants will be provided with either gum or inhaler to manage cravings.

    <description>Participants receiving this treatment group (standard treatment)will set a target quit date within the 2 weeks after baseline assessment and start to apply the patch on that day. This treatment will consist of a 10-week supply of nicotine patches. The initial dosage will be determined from the average number of cigarettes smoked each day as per the manufacturer's recommendation. Participants smoking ≥ 20 cigarettes per day will be prescribed 21 mg/24 hours for 6 weeks, 14 mg/24 hours for 2 weeks, and 7 mg/24 hours for 2 weeks. Participants smoking 11 - 20 cigarettes per day will be prescribed 14 mg/24 hours for 6 weeks, and 7 mg/24 hours for 4 weeks.
All participants will receive six 15-minute counselling sessions from a nurse-counsellor specializing in smoking cessation.</description>
