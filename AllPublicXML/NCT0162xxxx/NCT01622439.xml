  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma will receive standard
      treatment with R-CHOP (rituximab,cyclosphosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednison)
      for 6 cycles, cycle length is 14 or 21 days. In addition, valproate is given three times
      daily day 1-3 in escalated doses. The rationale for adding valproate to standard treatment is
      invitro data indicating a sensitizing effect to chemotherapy, and an increase in CD
      20-expression.

      Patients are included in 3+3 cohorts with escalation of valproate dose, planned dos levels
      are 30, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140 mg/kg/day. A total of 20 patients will be treated at the MTD.

    <description>Valproate is given in escalating doses to establish maximum tolerable dose when given together with standard treatment in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; this is the phase I part of the study. When maximum tolerable dose is established, this dose will be given to remaining patients in the phase II part of the study.</description>
