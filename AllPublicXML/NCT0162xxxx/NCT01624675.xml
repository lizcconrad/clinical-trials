  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of risperidone compared with placebo in
      children and adolescents with irritability associated with autistic disorder.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the drug is assigned by chance), 8-week, double-blind (neither
      physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives), placebo-controlled
      (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a
      real effect in a clinical trial), parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at
      the same time), flexible-dose, multicenter study. It will be followed by a 48-week,
      flexible-dose, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) extension, to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone in children and adolescents with a diagnosis
      of autistic disorder (severe form of pervasive developmental disorder) who have associated
      irritability. The study consists of up to 2-week screening phase, an 8-week double-blind
      phase, a 48-week open-label phase, and a 1-week follow-up phase.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC-J Irritability subscale consists of 15 items. Each item scores range from 0 to 3: 0 = No problem, 1 = Mild aberrant behavior, 2 = Moderate aberrant behavior, and 3 = Severe aberrant behavior. Higher scores represent worse condition.</description>

    <description>The ABC-J consists of 58 items divided into 5 subscales: Irritability, Lethargy and Social withdrawal, Stereotypic behavior, Hyperactivity/Noncompliance, and Inappropriate speech. Each item scores range from 0 to 3: 0 = No problem, 1 = Mild aberrant behavior, 2 = Moderate aberrant behavior, and 3 = Severe aberrant behavior.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a patient. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill patients&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <description>The C-GAS rates the patient's general psychological and social functioning on scores ranging from 1 through 100. Lower scores (range 1-10) mean that the patient needs constant supervision; higher scores (range 91-100) mean that the patient has a superior functioning in all areas.</description>
