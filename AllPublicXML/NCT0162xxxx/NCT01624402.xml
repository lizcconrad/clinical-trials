  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults who are stroke survivors can experience many challenges, including depression,
      cognitive dysfunction, and physical disability. Family members and other caregivers may
      struggle with helping stroke survivors adjust to life after stroke. This research study
      involves testing a modified form of problem-solving therapy called Ecosystem Focused Therapy
      (EFT) to help treat depression in older adult stroke survivors. EFT teaches problem-solving
      skills to patients to help them cope with problems related to stroke and depression, alters
      their physical environment to accommodate new needs resulting from stroke, and helps the
      family or caregiver to assist in the patient's adaptation. In addition this study will
      compare EFT to an education intervention to see which is more effective in treating depressed
      stroke survivors.

      We propose to study the efficacy of &quot;Ecosystem Focused Therapy&quot; (EFT) in post-stroke
      depression (PSD), a disorder that afflicts a large number of stroke victims and increases
      mortality, cognitive impairment, and disability for years after stroke. EFT is a new,
      home-delivered intervention based on our integrative model of PSD, which originated from our
      clinical biology and treatment studies in late-life depression. It postulates two main paths
      to PSD. First, stroke and stroke-repair mechanisms contribute to metabolic changes mediating
      PSD. Second, a &quot;psychosocial storm&quot; stemming both from the patient's sudden disability and
      the change in the patient's needs and family life add a biological burden to this cascade of
      depressogenic events. EFT targets the &quot;psychosocial storm&quot; of PSD and focuses on the
      reciprocal interaction between the patient's abilities and the challenges of his/her
      &quot;ecosystem&quot; (family, specialized therapists). EFT follows a structured personalization
      approach based on the &quot;model of adaptive functioning&quot;, in which behavior is a function of the
      person's competence and the demands of the environment. Thus, EFT continuously &quot;calibrates
      the environment&quot; to the PSD patient's competence level and targets the PSD &quot;psychosocial
      storm&quot; through five integrated components: 1) It offers an action-oriented, &quot;new perspective&quot;
      about the patient's recovery. 2) It provides an &quot;adherence enhancement structure&quot;. 3) It
      offers a &quot;problem solving structure&quot; to the patient focusing on problems, valued by the
      patient, and pertinent to daily function. 4) It helps the family &quot;reengineer its goals,
      involvement, and plans&quot; to accommodate the patient's disability. 5) It &quot;coordinates care with
      specialized therapists&quot; with the goal to increase patient participation in rehabilitation and
      social activities.

    <description>Each session begins by assessing the subject's and his/her family's level of information in a given area and by identifying misconceptions, thus guiding the selection of educational material.
Comprehending illness-related information is a process contaminated by pessimism, denial, misconceptions, and stigma. The role of the ESD therapist is to impart valuable information, despite these complexities.
Conveying information is a process. The ESD therapist needs to be aware of where the subject and family are in each session and offer information for which they have readiness to accept.
ESD therapists do not engage in additional interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, problem solving therapy).</description>
