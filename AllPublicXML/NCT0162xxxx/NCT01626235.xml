      Study aims to assess patient-recorded outcomes of pain control medications prescribed in the
      ER after visits for specific painful injuries/illnesses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicenter, observational, prospective, out-of-hospital registry collecting clinical,
      satisfaction, quality of life, and healthcare resource utilization from subjects discharged
      after ED care for a specific acute pain syndrome with a clinician-determined analgesic
      regimen. Subjects are stratified by diagnosis and by regimen based on the treating
      clinician's judgment. The registry study is independent of ED care and clinician's
      decision-making.
