    <textblock>
      The CORRONA CERTAIN Sub-study of the Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America,
      Inc. is a Sub-study of the CORRONA Data Collection Program.

      The CERTAIN Sub-study is designed to systematically collect and document use patterns,
      effectiveness, comparative effectiveness and safety of biologic agents used in the management
      of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biologic therapies (including biologic medications like Enbrel, Humira, Remicade, Cimzia,
      Simponi, Actemra, Rituxan and Orencia) have changed the treatment of RA, but the differences
      in safety and/or effectiveness of each biologic therapy are not all known. We are doing this
      study in order to try to see if one or more of these treatments are better than the others.
      The use of databases like the CORRONA Organization database gives us information that helps
      us to understand why such drugs are used, reasons for starting or stopping drugs, for whom
      they are prescribed, and to monitor changes in patients' abilities to perform daily
      activities and gather information on family or social history.

      Blood tests: at each study blood is obtained to examine, lipid levels with direct ( non
      fasting) LDL, a high sensitivity CRP as well as toxicity monitoring labs including a complete
      blood count and a comprehensive panel. During the baseline visit DNA is collected upon
      consent - to allow future genetic and pharmacogenetic studies- and also serology markers and
      immunoglobulin levels. During the first three visits RNA serum and plasma for storage and
      future experiments are collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The CORRONA CERTAIN Sub-study is particularly focused on understanding the
             effectiveness and safety of biologic medications. Male and female patients, who

               1. are at least 18 years of age;

               2. have a documented diagnosis of RA by their treating rheumatologist;

               3. have at least moderate disease activity; and

               4. are initiating a biologic agent that has not be used for their treatment in the
                  past are eligible to participate.

                  Moderate disease activity is defined by a CDAI score greater than 10.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

                  Disease other than RA that do not meet the inclusion criteria
