      The primary objective of this randomized controlled non-inferiority trial is to determine
      whether or not Adaptive Disclosure (AD), a new combat-specific psychotherapy for Post
      Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), is as least as effective as Cognitive Processing Therapy,
      cognitive only version (CPT-C), in terms of its impact on deployment-related psychological
      health problems (specifically PTSD and depression) and functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many Marines and Sailors return from deployment with mental health problems related to their
      experiences. One such problem is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which involves
      symptoms such as persistent unwanted memories of traumatic events, avoidance of reminders of
      the events, excessive watchfulness, jumpiness and irritability. Current therapies for PTSD
      focus chiefly on fear related to life-threat and were developed chiefly on civilians. We
      developed and piloted tested a psychological treatment for PTSD specifically for service
      members who suffer not only life-threat, but also traumatic loss and inner conflicts from
      morally challenging experiences. This intervention, Adaptive Disclosure (AD) is an
      eight-session PTSD treatment that helps Marines to identify unhelpful beliefs about a
      traumatic event and find ways to move forward. Preliminary clinical data suggests that AD is
      acceptable to Marines, feasible to implement, and safe and that it reduces PTSD and
      depression. The primary objective of this randomized controlled non-inferiority trial is to
      determine whether or not AD is as least as effective as Cognitive Processing Therapy,
      cognitive only version (CPT-C), which is an empirically validated and commonly used PTSD
      treatment.

      We plan to recruit 266 Marines for this project. They will be randomly assigned to AD or
      CPT-C and followed during and after treatment. The groups will be compared on measures of
      mental health (particularly PTSD and depression), work-related functioning, trauma-related
      beliefs, coping and attitudes about mental health care.

    <description>Adaptive Disclosure (AD) is an eight-session fully manualized and piloted intervention designed specifically for Marines with PTSD stemming from a variety of traumatic deployment experiences. The approach combines imaginal exposure to activate trauma-related emotions and beliefs and cognitive and experiential techniques to modify maladaptive interpretations of the implication of various combat and operational experiences that contribute to symptoms and dysfunction.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive Processing Therapy, cognitive version only (CPT-C)</intervention_name>
    <description>Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a 12-session manualized therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder. The theory behind CPT conceptualizes PTSD as a disorder of &quot;non-recovery&quot; in which erroneous beliefs about the causes and consequences of traumatic events produce strong negative emotions and prevent accurate processing of the trauma memory and natural emotions emanating from the event. A significant contributor to the interruption of natural recovery process is the ongoing use of avoidance as a coping strategy. CPT incorporates trauma-specific cognitive techniques to help individuals with PTSD more accurately appraise these &quot;stuck points&quot; and progress toward recovery.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Current PTSD as diagnosed by the CAPS or subsyndromal PTSD (at least meeting criteria
             A and B) with distress and/or functional impairment as determined by the CAPS and
             review by study senior clinicians. Co-occurring disorders such as depression, anxiety,
             or treated substance abuse or dependence problems are permitted.

          -  Individuals expected to deploy two or more months from the time of referral and/or
             assessment are eligible. Anyone deploying sooner than that would be unable to complete
             the entire intervention and thus, are ineligible. Potential enrollees need not be
             presently deployable.

          -  Prospective enrollees must be willing to commit to 8 consecutive weekly sessions
             lasting up to 90 minutes in duration and to complete assessment materials.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious suicidality or homicidality that has required urgent or emergent evaluation or
             treatment within the past three months.

          -  A known, untreated substance abuse or dependence problem. Inclusion is possible if
             there is evidence that the individual has been afforded and is complying with
             treatment for the substance problem.

          -  Serious Axis I mental disorders (those that are normally incompatible with active
             military service), such as psychotic disorders or bipolar type I, are not eligible.

          -  Cognitive impairment that would interfere with one's ability to complete the
             intervention. If a potential participant performs below the mildly impaired range on
             WAIS-IV Digit Span or CVLT-2, the study neuropsychologist will review the case and
             make a clinical judgment based on review of testing and, in some cases, additional
             evaluation as to ability to participate.

          -  Concurrent enrollment in any cognitive-behavioral treatment, group therapy, or any
             other treatment that involves systematic disclosure of troubling deployment-related
             memories. Participants can continue current pharmacological treatment, marital
             counseling, or any supportive therapy.
