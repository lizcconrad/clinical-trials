    <textblock>
      In this Prestudy which will be followed by the multicentral GEx- main-trial, the feasibility
      of a new cardiac rehabilitation device (GEx system) is proved with coronary heart disease
      patients who participate in cardiac rehabilitation training exercise at the rehabilitation
      clinic (phase II) and subsequently at home (phase III). The GEx system consists of a
      easy-to-wear vest with integrated electrodes to measure electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration
      and activity, furthermore of a PDA to collect and store the monitored data and a cradle to
      charge the batteries. Several physiological parameters are extracted from thes measured vital
      signs like heart rate, breathing rate, ECG and activity. In this pretrial first the GEx
      sensor system is validated during guided exercise of the patients in the rehabilitation
      clinic (phase II). Subsequently at home (phase III) the practicability of the vest and
      sensors and possible technical problems in real- life use are proved. This means after
      moderate training like walking, cycling or running at home for 3 weeks patients will report
      the feasibility of usage. The ECG data and breathing- frequency data will be analyzed to see
      if data are recorded and transmitted well in regard to technical problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the rehabilitation process (phase II) of patients with coronary heart disease (CAD) 30
      patients are recruited and are made familiar with the new Guided Exercise (GEx) training
      system during exercise training; they are supervised and provided with training instructions
      by a medicine for 3 times a week 3 weeks long. At the beginning and at the end of the study
      the patient has to undergo several tests of the clinical routine such as a cardiopulmonary
      test (CPX), echocardiography and lactate measurement;additionally, this test will be
      registered by the system to obtain information about the detection of heart rate rise for
      example. Data will be analyzed for quality of heart rate measurement and data acquisition by
      the device.

      In a second step the GEx system is handed to these 30 patients when they leave in-patient
      cardiac rehabilitation (CR). The pre-trial serves to gather information about the
      practicability and technical problem during real-life use. Therefore at home these 30
      patients will continue with moderate endurance training like walking, cycling or running
      while wearing the GEx system three times a week for 3 weeks. After three weeks patients will
      come back to the clinic to undergo the end examination and to report the feasibility of
      usage. The ECG data and breathing frequency data will be analyzed to see if data are recorded
      and transmitted well in regard to technical problems.

      If accurate and safe data are received the following GEx- main- trial (ID 11-020) will
      investigate the GEx- system for CAD patients in regard to improvement of physical capacities
      obtained in long term adherence to home based rehabilitation programs (phase III) including
      feedback to patients compared to national standard rehabilitation.

    <description>The GEx system is evaluated during in-patient cardiac rehabilitation supervised by cardiologists in order to analyze data for quality of heart rate measurement and data acquisition by device. 30 Patients undergo moderate training exercise like walking, cycling or running three times a week three weeks long. In a second step practicability and technical problems are tested during continuation of the moderate training of the patient at home. The Evaluation is performed by CPX, lactate measurement, 2D-Echo, questionnaires and device data like heart rate and breathing rate.</description>
