  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant hyperthermia is a potentially fatal inherited disorder triggered by exposure to
      volatile anesthetic gases, most commonly recognized in children during anesthesia. Carbon
      filters have been used to scavenge various gases. A new carbon filter (Vapor Clean,
      Dynasthetics, LLC, Salt Lake City, Utah) with a 510(k) clearance specifically for scavenging
      anesthetic gases is being marketed, though the filter itself has never been studied in vivo.
      Bench studies conducted by the manufacturer of the product demonstrate it is extremely
      effective in reducing the volatile gas output from an anesthesia machine within 2 minutes.
      This pilot study will measure the effect on volatile gas concentration in non-malignant
      hyperthermia susceptible patients. Twelve (12) patients will undergo standard anesthetic
      induction using inhalational anesthetic (SevofluraneÂ®) and maintained on 3% for 30 minutes to
      attain steady state concentrations.1 At that time, a total intravenous anesthetic technique
      will be started and maintained throughout the case. Simultaneously a Vapor Clean filterset
      will be placed in the breathing circuit (inspiratory and expiratory limbs). Volatile gas
      concentration will be measured and recorded. This research will determine the feasibility of
      using this carbon filter to quickly reduce the breathing circuit gas concentration of
      volatile anesthetic in the clinical setting. This is fundamental in establishing this as a
      key life saving measure in eliminating the stimulus in a malignant hyperthermia event.

    <description>At regular intervals (2 minutes) after application of the filters, the concentration of the volatile anesthetic will be measured. Primary outcome value will be the time to reduce breathing circuit volatile anesthetic concentration to &lt;5ppm. If at 30 min the concentration is not &lt;5ppm, then collection will be stopped.</description>
