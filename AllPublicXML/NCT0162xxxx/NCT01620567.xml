    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is also a major risk factor for development of dementia later in life.
      Findings from the investigators studies suggest that the carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin
      may be important in cognitive function in the elderly. Avocados are a source of these
      carotenoids. The investigators study evaluates long-term avocado intervention as a treatment
      strategy for age-related cognitive impairment which could possibly prevent the onset of
      dementia. The investigators have also shown that lutein supplementation significantly
      improved verbal fluency scores in healthy older women. Based on these findings, the next
      logical step will be to investigate the ability of lutein and zeaxanthin contained in
      avocados to influence cognitive function in older adults. The investigators hypothesize that
      there will be a significant increase in cognitive function measures in older adults provided
      with meals containing 1 avocado/day at the end of 6 months, while no significant improvements
      will be observed in older adults given daily meals containing chickpeas and/or potatoes.

      The proposed study is designed as a randomized, placebo controlled trial that tests the
      effects of 6 month supplementation with 1 avocado/day on cognitive function in older adults.
      Secondary analyses will determine whether baseline macular pigment (lutein in retina which
      canbe measured non invasivley) density predicts relative effectiveness of the intervention on
      cognitive function. Secondary outcomes include plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and
      inflammation.

      The study is designed as a placebo controlled trial that tests the effects of 6 month
      supplementation with daily meals containing 1 avocado or isocaloric amounts of chickpeas
      and/or potatoes on cognitive function in older adults. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two groups. Secondary analyses will determine whether baseline macular pigment
      density (a non invasive measure of lutein and zeaxanthin in neural tissue) predicts relative
      effectiveness of the intervention on cognitive function. Secondary outcomes include plasma
      biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Participants will be recruited from
      community-dwelling men and women aged &gt;50 yr, and potential participants will be screened to
      meet cognitive and functional criteria. Participants will be pre-screened by telephone; those
      who appear to meet criteria will undergo further screening. The study will include baseline
      (0 month), 3 and 6 month visits for study procedures, and monthly telephone calls. Given that
      there is a visible difference between the two interventions (eggs, egg substitute), a blinded
      study is not possible.
