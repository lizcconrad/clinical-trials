    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the treatment effect of two treatment regimens of
      Cat-PAD vs placebo and to evaluates the treatment effect of Cat-PAD on symptoms, rescue
      medication usage and Quality of Life.

    <measure>Mean Combined Score in Cat-PAD Treatment Groups Compared With Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>52-54 weeks after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was the mean Combined Score (CS) during the Post Administration Collection Period 3 (52-54 weeks after randomisation) in the Cat-PAD treatment groups compared with the mean CS in the placebo group.
CS = Total Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Score (TRSS) (0-24/8) + Rescue Medication Score (RMS) (0-3). Eight symptoms are defined in the TRSS, 4 nasal symptoms: runny nose, sneezing; blocked nose, and itchy nose and 4 ocular symptoms: itchy eyes; watery eyes; red eyes, and sore eyes. Each symptom was rated in severity on a score of 0-3 (0=absent, 3=severe) and the TRSS was divided by the number of symptoms (8) to provide an average score per symptom of 0-3.
For RMS the score was allocated according Didier et al where RMS = 0 (no allergy rescue medication use per day) to RMS = 3 (at least one dose of systemic corticosteroid per day). The RMS score was not additive, and therefore the maximum RMS was 3 and the maximum CS was 6.</description>

    <description>Mean Total Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Score (TRSS) in Cat-PAD treatment groups compared with placebo.
Eight symptoms are defined in the TRSS, 4 nasal symptoms: runny nose, sneezing; blocked nose, and itchy nose and 4 ocular symptoms: itchy eyes; watery eyes; red eyes, and sore eyes. Each symptom was rated in severity on a score of 0-3 (0. absent; 1. mild, barely noticeable; 2. moderate, annoying/troublesome; 3. severe, very annoying/very troublesome), therefore TRSS could range from 0 to 24. Higher TRSS reflected more severe symptom scores. Symptoms were scored daily for a period of approximately 3 weeks. 52-54 weeks after randomisation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Daily TNSS in Cat-PAD Compared With Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>52-54 weeks after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS (Total nasal symptom score) was the sum of all the nasal symptom scores (runny nose; sneezing; blocked nose; itchy nose) and could range from 0 to 12. Higher TNSS reflected more severe symptoms.
Subjects rated the severity of each symptom over the last 24 hours as follows: 0. absent; 1. mild, barely noticeable; 2. moderate, annoying/troublesome; 3. severe, very annoying/very troublesome. Symptoms were scored daily for a period of approximately 3 weeks. 52-54 weeks after randomisation.</description>

    <measure>Mean Daily TOSS in Cat-PAD Compared to Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>52-54 weeks after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>Mean daily Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS) in Cat-PAD treatment groups compared to placebo groups
TOSS was the sum of all the ocular symptom scores (itchy eyes; watery eyes; red eyes; sore eyes) and could range from 0 to 12. Higher TOSS reflected more severe symptoms.
Subjects rated the severity of each symptom over the last 24 hours as follows: 0. absent; 1. mild, barely noticeable; 2. moderate, annoying/troublesome; 3. severe, very annoying/very troublesome. Symptoms were scored daily for a period of approximately 3 weeks. 52-54 weeks after randomisation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean RMS in Cat-PAD Compared With Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>52-54 weeks after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>Mean RMS (Rescue medication score) in Cat-PAD treatment groups compared with placebo groups.
The use of rhinoconjunctivitis rescue medications was recorded by the subject on a daily basis just before bedtime for approximately 21 days, 52-54 weeks after randomisation and was scored based on a previously published system as follows: 0 = no allergy rescue medication used per day; 0.5 = at least one dose of antihistamine eye drops used per day; 1 = at least one dose of oral antihistamine used per day; 2 = at least one dose of intranasal corticosteroid used per day; 3 = at least one dose of systemic corticosteroid used per day. The score was according to the highest level of rescue medication used and was not additive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean RQLQ Score in Cat-PAD Compared With Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>52-54 weeks after randomisation</time_frame>
    <description>The RQLQ (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire) was completed by subjects at the end of the study (52-54 weeks after randomisation).
The RQLQ is a validated method of assessing quality of life and has 28 questions in seven domains (activity limitation, sleep problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, non-nasal/eye symptoms, practical problems and emotional function). Subjects recalled how their rhinoconjunctivitis had been during the last week and responded to each question on a seven-point scale (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum impairment). The questions were equally weighted, and the RQLQ score was the mean of the 28 questions and could range from zero to six.</description>

    <measure>Number of Days With no Moderate or Severe TRSS Symptoms Without Rescue Medication Use</measure>
    <time_frame>52-54 week after randomisaiton</time_frame>
    <description>The number of well days, i.e., days with no moderately or severely annoying symptoms and with no rescue medication used was calculated for all subjects over a period of approximately 21 days, 52-54 weeks after randomisation.</description>

        <title>Mean Combined Score in Cat-PAD Treatment Groups Compared With Placebo</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint was the mean Combined Score (CS) during the Post Administration Collection Period 3 (52-54 weeks after randomisation) in the Cat-PAD treatment groups compared with the mean CS in the placebo group.
CS = Total Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptom Score (TRSS) (0-24/8) + Rescue Medication Score (RMS) (0-3). Eight symptoms are defined in the TRSS, 4 nasal symptoms: runny nose, sneezing; blocked nose, and itchy nose and 4 ocular symptoms: itchy eyes; watery eyes; red eyes, and sore eyes. Each symptom was rated in severity on a score of 0-3 (0=absent, 3=severe) and the TRSS was divided by the number of symptoms (8) to provide an average score per symptom of 0-3.
For RMS the score was allocated according Didier et al where RMS = 0 (no allergy rescue medication use per day) to RMS = 3 (at least one dose of systemic corticosteroid per day). The RMS score was not additive, and therefore the maximum RMS was 3 and the maximum CS was 6.</description>

        <title>Mean Daily TNSS in Cat-PAD Compared With Placebo</title>
        <description>TNSS (Total nasal symptom score) was the sum of all the nasal symptom scores (runny nose; sneezing; blocked nose; itchy nose) and could range from 0 to 12. Higher TNSS reflected more severe symptoms.
Subjects rated the severity of each symptom over the last 24 hours as follows: 0. absent; 1. mild, barely noticeable; 2. moderate, annoying/troublesome; 3. severe, very annoying/very troublesome. Symptoms were scored daily for a period of approximately 3 weeks. 52-54 weeks after randomisation.</description>

The use of rhinoconjunctivitis rescue medications was recorded by the subject on a daily basis just before bedtime for approximately 21 days, 52-54 weeks after randomisation and was scored based on a previously published system as follows: 0 = no allergy rescue medication used per day; 0.5 = at least one dose of antihistamine eye drops used per day; 1 = at least one dose of oral antihistamine used per day; 2 = at least one dose of intranasal corticosteroid used per day; 3 = at least one dose of systemic corticosteroid used per day. The score was according to the highest level of rescue medication used and was not additive.</description>

        <description>The RQLQ (Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire) was completed by subjects at the end of the study (52-54 weeks after randomisation).
The RQLQ is a validated method of assessing quality of life and has 28 questions in seven domains (activity limitation, sleep problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, non-nasal/eye symptoms, practical problems and emotional function). Subjects recalled how their rhinoconjunctivitis had been during the last week and responded to each question on a seven-point scale (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum impairment). The questions were equally weighted, and the RQLQ score was the mean of the 28 questions and could range from zero to six.</description>
