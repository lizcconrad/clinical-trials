    <measure>The Time-Weighted Summed Pain Intensity Difference Measured Using the 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale From 0 to 48 Hours After Trial Entry (VASSPID-48)</measure>
    <time_frame>0-48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain intensity is assessed at baseline (time &quot;0&quot;) and at the following time points after time 0: 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, and 48 hours.
The VAS summed pain intensity difference (VASSPID) is calculated as the sum of the pain intensity difference values at each follow-up time point (difference between the starting pain intensity and the pain intensity at the given assessment time) multiplied by the amount of time (in hours) since the prior assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>0-24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;.

The VAS summed pain intensity difference (VASSPID) is calculated as a time-weighted sum of the pain intensity difference values at each follow-up time point (difference between the starting pain intensity and the pain intensity at the given assessment time) multiplied by the amount of time (in hours) since the prior assessment.</description>

    <measure>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Over 0 to 4 Hours (TOTPAR-4).</measure>
    <time_frame>0-4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief was assessed with a 5-point categorical scale at all assessment timepoints after time 0. Subjects were asked &quot;How much relief have you had since your starting pain?&quot; with response choices of none=0, a little=1, some=2, a lot=3 and complete=4. Pain relief is assessed at the following points after time 0: 15, 30 &amp; 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3 &amp; 4 hours.
The Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) score for a given time interval is calculated as the sum of the pain relief scores at each follow-up time point (as recorded on the categorical pain relief scale) over that interval multiplied by the amount of time (in hours) since the prior assessment. Thus, individual scores covering a longer period were given more weight. The minimum theoretical score is 0 units, which represents no pain relief (0 on scale) at all points after time 0. The maximum theoretical score is 16 units, which represents complete pain relief (4 on scale) at all points after 0.</description>

Thus, individual scores covering a longer period were given more weight. The minimum theoretical score is 0 units, which represents no pain relief (0 on scale) at all points after time 0. The maximum theoretical score is 32 units, which represents complete pain relief (4 on scale) at all points after 0.</description>

        <title>The Time-Weighted Summed Pain Intensity Difference Measured Using the 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale From 0 to 48 Hours After Trial Entry (VASSPID-48)</title>
        <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain intensity is assessed at baseline (time “0”) and at the following time points after time 0: 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, and 48 hours.
The VAS summed pain intensity difference (VASSPID) is calculated as the sum of the pain intensity difference values at each follow-up time point (difference between the starting pain intensity and the pain intensity at the given assessment time) multiplied by the amount of time (in hours) since the prior assessment.</description>

        <description>The pain intensity is assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), which is a horizontal line 100 mm in length. Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain intensity is assessed at baseline (time “0”) and at the following time points after time 0: 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 hours.
The VAS summed pain intensity difference (VASSPID) is calculated as the sum of the pain intensity difference values at each follow-up time point (difference between the starting pain intensity and the pain intensity at the given assessment time) multiplied by the amount of time (in hours) since the prior assessment.</description>

Subjects mark the VAS with a single vertical line to indicate their current pain level, with 0 mm representing &quot;No Pain&quot; and 100 mm representing &quot;Worst Possible Pain&quot;. Pain intensity is assessed at baseline (time “0”) and at the following time points after time 0: 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 hours.
The VAS summed pain intensity difference (VASSPID) is calculated as the sum of the pain intensity difference values at each follow-up time point (difference between the starting pain intensity and the pain intensity at the given assessment time) multiplied by the amount of time (in hours) since the prior assessment.</description>

        <title>Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) Over 0 to 4 Hours (TOTPAR-4).</title>
        <description>Pain relief was assessed with a 5-point categorical scale at all assessment timepoints after time 0. Subjects were asked “How much relief have you had since your starting pain?” with response choices of none=0, a little=1, some=2, a lot=3 and complete=4. Pain relief is assessed at the following points after time 0: 15, 30 &amp; 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3 &amp; 4 hours.
The Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) score for a given time interval is calculated as the sum of the pain relief scores at each follow-up time point (as recorded on the categorical pain relief scale) over that interval multiplied by the amount of time (in hours) since the prior assessment. Thus, individual scores covering a longer period were given more weight. The minimum theoretical score is 0 units, which represents no pain relief (0 on scale) at all points after time 0. The maximum theoretical score is 16 units, which represents complete pain relief (4 on scale) at all points after 0.</description>

          <description>Pain relief was assessed with a 5-point categorical scale at all assessment timepoints after time 0. Subjects were asked “How much relief have you had since your starting pain?” with response choices of none=0, a little=1, some=2, a lot=3 and complete=4. Pain relief is assessed at the following points after time 0: 15, 30 &amp; 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 &amp; 8 hours.
The Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) score for a given time interval is calculated as the sum of the pain relief scores at each follow-up time point (as recorded on the categorical pain relief scale) over that interval multiplied by the amount of time (in hours) since the prior assessment. Thus, individual scores covering a longer period were given more weight. The minimum theoretical score is 0 units, which represents no pain relief (0 on scale) at all points after time 0. The maximum theoretical score is 32 units, which represents complete pain relief (4 on scale) at all points after 0.</description>
