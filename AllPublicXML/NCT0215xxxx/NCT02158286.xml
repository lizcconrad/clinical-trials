  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retention of the gastric tube after esophagectomy is a clinically important problem, and
      there is a need of a simple method to evaluate emptying rate from the gastric tube after
      esophagectomy. Scintigraphy is the golden standard of measuring emptying rate from the
      gastric tube. In non-operated patients, paracetamol clearance technique have been widely used
      for measuring gastric emptying rate. There is no validation however if paracetamol clearance
      technique can be used for measuring emptying rate of the gastric tube. The investigators aim
      of this pilot- study is to validate paracetamol clearance technique to scintigraphy for
      measuring emptying rate from the gastric tube and to evaluate if there is a correlation
      between symptoms of retention and quality of life with the emptying rate.

    <description>During one diagnostic measurement perform, simultaneously, scintigraphy and paracetamol clearance technique to measure emptying rate from the gastric tube. After the test the patient answer both a QOL questionnaire and symptom questionnaire.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluate if patient with symptoms of slow emptying rate from the gastric tube also have slow emptying rate measured with scintigraphy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will answer the questionaire EORTC QLQ OG25 for validation of upper gastrointestinal symptoms and the questionnaire EORTC QLQ C30 for validation of quality of life. Emptying rate from the gastric tube is measured with scintigraphy.</description>
