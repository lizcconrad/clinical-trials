      This study is designed as a population-based prospective, double blind cohort study. A
      prospective cohort of patients admitted to laparoscopic gastric banding due to morbid obesity

      STUDY GOALS

        -  To evaluate the morphine-sparing effect of paracetamol IV in obese patients undergoing
           bariatric surgery.

        -  To identify potential ability of paracetamol IV to attenuate or relief postoperative
           pain in obesity patient undergoing bariatric surgery

        -  To determine effectiveness of paracetamol IV to reduce postoperative complication rate.
