      This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic radiosurgery and metformin hydrochloride in
      treating patients with pancreatic cancer that may be removed (borderline-resectable) or not
      removed by surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Metformin hydrochloride, used for diabetes, may
      also kill cancer cells as demonstrated in laboratory studies. Giving stereotactic
      radiosurgery with metformin hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      This is an open label pilot, single-center, non-randomized trial is designed to evaluate the
      tolerability and preliminary activity of the combination of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT) with metformin for resectable and locally-advanced pancreatic/periampullary
      cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      The primary objectives of this study are to:

      1) To determine if the addition of metformin to SBRT adds minimal additional toxicity for
      patients with A). borderline-resectable or B). not surgically resectable pancreatic
      adenocarcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the clinical/pathological response and resectability rates associated with these
      regimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) daily or twice daily (BID) on days -11
      to -1. Patients then undergo stereotactic radiosurgery 5 days a week for 5 weeks and receive
      concurrent metformin hydrochloride* by mouth, two times a day for 5 weeks. Patients undergo
      laparotomy on week 6 (or weeks 5-7). ). Systemic therapy continues as soon as it is
      considered feasible by the treating physicians.

      *NOTE: Metformin hydrochloride should be stopped 2 days before laparotomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
