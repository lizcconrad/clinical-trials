  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) (blood levels)
      comparability of 2 different formulations of ustekinumab, 90 milligram per milliliter (mg/mL)
      liquid in vial (LIV) and 5 mg/mL LIV, following a single intravenous administration of 6
      milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) ustekinumab, diluted in saline, in healthy participants.

      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), randomized (study drug is assigned by chance), parallel (a clinical trial
      comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different treatments),
      open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) single-dose,
      inpatient/outpatient study in healthy participants. The study consists of following periods:
      Screening (within 28 days before study drug administration), inpatient period (Day 1 to 4)
      and outpatient period (up to Day 141). Eligible participants will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio to either 1 of 2 treatment groups (that is, Ustekinumab 90 mg/mL or Ustekinumab 5
      mg/mL) and will receive treatment on Day 1. The PK comparability of 2 different formulations
      of ustekinumab, diluted in saline, will be evaluated primarily. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant administered a medicinal (investigational or non investigational) product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that meets any of the following conditions: results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Terminal half-life (T1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>The T1/2 is the terminal half-life, that is, time required for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total systemic clearance (CL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 113</time_frame>

    <measure>Volume of distribution (Vz)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 113</time_frame>
    <description>The Vz is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired blood concentration of a drug.</description>
