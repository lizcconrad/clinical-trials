  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want investigate if high intensity training can increase daily functionality without
      causing muscle damage in patients Spinal and Bulbar Muscular Atrophy . We want to study if
      there is a difference in effect with supervised and unsupervised training. Furthermore we
      want to study if a supervised training program will motivate participants to continue
      training by the end of the program.

    <description>Primary outcome is changes from baseline in maximal oxygen consumption and maximal workload after a 8 week supervised training program followed by a 8 week non-supervised optional training period.
during and after 8 weeks of High Intensity Training on a cycle ergometer. The outcome is measured by an incremental test on a cycle ergometer.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, week 6, week 11, week 18.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes from baseline to end of training in muscle strength measured by handhold dynamometry, in 6 minute walk-test and in 5 time sit-to-stand test is secondary outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-rated muscle fatigue, muscle pain and activity level</measure>
    <time_frame>Every day in week 1-11</time_frame>
    <description>Self-rated muscle fatigue, muscle pain (VAS) and activity level is noted every day in diary in the two &quot;run-in&quot; weeks (baseline data) and thereafter every day in the 8 weeks training program. Changes from baseline is a secondary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Serum concentrations of Creatine Kinase (CK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, week 18.</time_frame>
    <description>Serum concentrations of Creatine Kinase (CK) as a measurement of muscle damage. Blood samples are taken at every test day wich is the same for patient group 1 and healthy controls.
In patient group 2 blood samples are taken at baseline, week 6, week 11 and week 18-</description>
