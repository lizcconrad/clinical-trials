    <textblock>
      The goal of the PRIORITI-MTF study is to help determine whether a new type of custom designed
      brace, called the IDEO â„¢ along with a physical therapy program, called Return to Run,
      improves physical function. This brace was developed for wounded warriors who wanted to
      return to an active lifestyle.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine the benefits (and cost-benefits) of an
      integrated orthotic and rehabilitation program that incorporates the Intrepid Dynamic
      Exoskeletal Orthosis (IDEO) and the Return to Run (RTR) physical therapy regimen, but
      designed for scalability in the broader military environment (i.e. beyond San Antonio
      Military Medical Center where the program was developed)
