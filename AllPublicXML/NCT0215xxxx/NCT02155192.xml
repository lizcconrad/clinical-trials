      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between genetic factors and response
      to treatment (guselkumab, ustekinumab, adalimumab, or etanercept) and psoriasis (scaly skin
      rash).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 0, exploratory (intended to be conducted early in Phase 1, involve limited
      human exposure, have no therapeutic intent and are not intended to examine clinical
      tolerability), multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study) and pharmacogenomics study in participants with psoriasis.
      Participants who were treated in study Phase 2 NCT01483599 (X-PLORE), Phase 3 NCT00267969
      (PHOENIX 1), Phase 3 NCT00307437 (PHOENIX 2) or Phase 3 NCT00454584 (ACCEPT), will be
      returning to their study site where a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample will be obtained for
      pharmacogenomics assessment. There will be no follow-up beyond the study site visit.

    <description>Participants with clinical response from previous studies will be evaluated for the association with genetic factors (for example, human leukocyte antigen [HLA], Cw6 allele). Clinical response in previous studies were evaluated by psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score: a widely used tool for the measurement of severity of psoriasis. This is a test of how bad a participant's psoriasis is. The scale combines redness, scaling, and thickness, as well as overall body involvement to determine the PASI score, scale ranges from 0 (best) to 72 (worst); and physician global assessment (PGA): The PGA is 6-point scale used in clinical trials of various diseases. In this the physician checks the state of the disease and gives them score from 0 (clear) to 5 (severe). Percentage of participants will be reported.</description>
