    <textblock>
      In this study a tooth that needs to be extracted will be replaced by an implant (artificial
      root) placed at the same appointment as the extraction. The investigators want to observe how
      the gums change shape with healing in two different scenarios:

        1. If the soft tissue around your tooth is thin, following extraction and implant placement
           an extra soft tissue graft (taken from your palate) in the area in order to increase the
           thickness of your gums after healing.

        2. If the soft tissue around your tooth is thick, the implant will be placed without a soft
           tissue graft.

      Previous studies have shown that both methods work and can give good results. In fact the two
      methods are used routinely but they have never been compared objectively to one another in
      the same research study.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate if there is any difference in terms of esthetic
      outcomes between these two treatment modalities after a crown has been placed on the implant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is 18 years or older.

          2. Ability to understand and provide informed consent before starting the study.

          3. Ability and willingness to comply with all study requirements.

          4. The patient, if of child-bearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test.

          5. Adequate oral hygiene to allow for implant therapy consistent with standards of care.
