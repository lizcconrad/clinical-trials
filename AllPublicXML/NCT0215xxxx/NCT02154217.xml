    <textblock>
      This is a data revision with a focus on 24 hour perfusion pressures of data from a previous
      randomized, double masked, multicenter clinical trial.

      The aim was to compare the effect of bimatoprost and the fixed combination of latanoprost and
      timolol (LTFC) on 24-hour mean intraocular pressure (IOP) after patients are switched from a
      nonfixed combination of latanoprost and timolol.

      The main findings of the original trial had been published on Ophthalmology [2007;114:
      2244-2251].

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients diagnosed as having POAG (primary open-angle glaucoma) or ocular hypertension and
        18 years or older who fulfilled the eligibility requirements detailed below and signed an
        informed consent at the screening visit were included.

        Two different groups of patients were potentially eligible:

          1. Those patients who were controlled (IOP&lt; 21 mmHg) on the nonfixed combination of
             latanoprost and timolol (twice daily or once daily morning administration) for at
             least 3 months prior to the baseline visit.

          2. Patients on monotherapy either with latanoprost or timolol who were eligible for dual
             therapy being not satisfactorily controlled (IOP &lt; 21 mmHg, or, as judged by the
             physician, target IOP was not reached).

        Pseudoexfoliation glaucomas and patients with diabetes were not excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All patients in whom beta-blockers were contraindicated were excluded. Ocular Condition.

          1. Closed/barely open anterior chamber angles (ACAs) or history of acute angle closure.
             The ACA was viewed by means of the Goldmann 1-mirror lens. Shaffer grading was used,
             and grades II, III, and IV were included. Grades 0 and I were excluded.

          2. Ocular surgery or argon laser trabeculoplasty within the last 3 months.

          3. Ocular inflammation/infection occurring within 3 months before the pretrial visit.

          4. Neovascular glaucomas.

          5. Hypersensitivity to benzalkonium chloride or to any other component of the trial drug
             solutions.

          6. Other abnormal ocular condition or symptom preventing the patient from entering the
             trial, according to the investigator's judgement.

          7. Patients on either bimatoprost or the LTFC.

          8. Patients who had undergone refractive surgery. General

          9. Inability to adhere to treatment/visit plan.

         10. Participation in any other clinical trial (i.e., requiring in- formed consent) within
             1 month before the prestudy visit. 11. Pregnancy, nursing, or, if applicable, nonuse
             of adequate contraception.

        12. Any drug known to affect IOP.
