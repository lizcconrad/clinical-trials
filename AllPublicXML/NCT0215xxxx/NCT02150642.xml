  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in examining 1) the basic organization of spinal and
      cortical circuitry for the control of movement and 2) the influence of injury of these
      circuits. To investigate the neuronal circuitry, the investigators use various types of
      mechanical or electrical stimulation of the limbs, transcranial magnetic stimulation of the
      cortex and galvanic vestibular stimulation in both uninjured human subjects and subjects with
      a neurological injury (such as spinal cord injury, or Parkinsons's disease).
