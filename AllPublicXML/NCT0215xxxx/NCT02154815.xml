  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess the psychological impact of pre-emptive kidney
      transplantation on patients' quality of life taking into account psychological adjustment
      (response shift), compared to patients who have experienced a short pre-transplant dialysis
      period of less than 36 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The following outcomes will also be compared between Patients with Pre-emptive
      Transplantation and Patients with Dialysis before Transplantation : a) changes in quality of
      life, subjective well-being, perceived anxiety and depressive disorders as well as perceived
      stress during follow-up taking into account psychological adjustment (response shift) ; b)
      The coping strategies (process of managing stressful circumstances) and post-traumatic growth
      (positive psychological change experienced as a result of the struggle with highly
      challenging life circumstances) ; c) The 2-year post transplantation graft survival and
      patient outcomes: evolution of the Graft Filtration Rate, the proteinuria level ; d) The
      Kidney Transplant Failure Score (KTFS, patent NÂ°0959043) at one year post transplantation ;
      e) The post-transplantation time to return to work and patients compliance to treatment.
