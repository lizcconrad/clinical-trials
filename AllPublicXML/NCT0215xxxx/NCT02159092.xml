    <textblock>
      Tobacco use kills more than 500,000 people in the United States each year. Although the use
      of cigarettes has declined, the use of other tobacco products has remained steady. Waterpipe
      smoking is a common form of tobacco smoking after cigarettes in the U.S. In fact, in 2007 the
      American Lung Association issued a policy alert to warn consumers about this first new
      tobacco trend of the 21st century (American Lung Association, 2007). Few studies have been
      conducted on waterpipe smoking to investigate its harmful effects. Furthermore, no known
      studies have evaluated treatments for smoking cessation in waterpipe smokers. This study aims
      to test the role of contingency management (CM) in promoting abstinence from waterpipe
      smoking for 5 weeks verified by salivary cotinine and to characterize self-reported nicotine
      withdrawal symptoms. Based on the alarming growth rate over a short period of time in
      waterpipe tobacco smoking, there is a critical need for clinical research to investigate
      treatment modalities targeting smoking cessation for waterpipe smokers. Given the evidence
      for the role of CM in promoting abstinence from many types of drug use, investigation of the
      utility of CM for waterpipe smoking cessation is important and timely. Although Nicotine
      Replacement Therapy is the mainstay treatment for treating nicotine dependence delivered
      through cigarettes, the intermittent use patterns that characterize waterpipe smoking suggest
      that CM may be more effective in promoting waterpipe smoking cessation. The evidence based
      knowledge generated in this study may assist in the translation of the treatment program into
      public health practice.

      Contingency Management (CM) has been used successfully to treat tobacco addiction. CM is a
      powerful drug abuse treatment modality for facilitating change in drug use behaviors. The
      utility of CM as a treatment for waterpipe smoking is logical, but needs to be evaluated as a
      tool in the treatment of waterpipe smoking. The primary objective of this research plan is to
      test the role of CM in promoting abstinence from waterpipe tobacco smoking. The specific aims
      of the research include: specific aim 1: Conduct a feasibility study to test if CM promotes
      abstinence from nicotine delivered through waterpipe; specific aim 2: Characterize
      self-reported nicotine withdrawal symptoms. A randomized clinical trial involving eligible
      participants who are randomly assigned with equal allocation to either Contingency Management
      (CM) or Fixed Rate Control (FRC) will be conducted. A 2-group (CM versus FRC) x 10 (repeated
      measures) mixed-model design will be used. Participants in this study will be followed for 5
      weeks during which smoking abstinence will be measured 10 times. Reinforcement in the form of
      monetary payment delivered contingent on the participant's salivary cotinine will be provided

    <description>Monetary incentive for the CM groups is contingent on a saliva cotinine reading that indicates smoking abstinence. Participants were assessed 10 times (Mondays/Thursdays) for abstinence from smoking waterpipe verified by saliva cotinine. The maximum monetary incentives this group can receive is $192.50. The CM groups followed an escalating schedule where: 1) the dollar amount of the incentive increases by $.50 as long as the participant is abstinent at each visit;; and 2) resets to the starting incentive ($14) if the participant was non-compliant at the previous visit, but is compliant at the current visit. Also, Participants were given $10 bonus for every three consecutive compliant visits.</description>
