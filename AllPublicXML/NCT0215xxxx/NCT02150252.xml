      -  Clinical trial; Ischemic stroke; Bu-Yang-Huan-Wu Tang （BYHWT）; Gait parameter; Quality
           of life Stroke is the third of ten causing death disease constantly, and it also is
           third of consuming healthy insurance budget. There is 17,000 peoples disable due to
           stroke every year in Taiwan. Although ischemic stroke patient may use t-PA intravenously
           treatment within 3 hrs after stroke onset in modern medicine, and no others method may
           effect to treat ischemic stroke patients, thus, the study about stroke is an important
           issue. Bu-Yang- Huan-Wu Tang (BYHWT) has been became a main stream for the treatment of
           stroke after Qing dynasty Wang Qing-Ren theory that is BYHWT may treat stroke due to
           pattern of qi stagnation and blood stasis in traditional Chinese medicine. A number of
           researches report that BYHWT can reduce blood viscosity, anti-inflammation, enhancing
           neuronal regeneration and angiogenesis, but above-mentioned about BYHWT limit in the
           level of animal study and the scientific evidence is insufficiency in human trial.
           Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of
           BYHWT treating ischemic stroke by using a strict clinical trial.

        -  We designed a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the
           therapeutic effect of BYHWT treating ischemic stroke. The study expects to finish the
           assessment of 120 patients with ischemic stroke in three years. The study divided into:
           1) control group, receive placebo-BYHWT 3.0 g TID every day for continuously 6 weeks
           except ordinary medical care; 2) treatment group, the method is identical control group,
           but receive BYHWY. The main outcome was according to the changes of gait parameter
           including Speed, Cadence, Strike length, Gait cycle and Double support; and secondary
           outcome including the changes of Functional independence measurement scores and Barthel
           index scores, Ten Meters Walk Test, Short Physical Performance Batter, Berg Balance Test
           and WHO quality of life-brief (Taiwan Brief).

        -  We predict the results of the present can provide scientific evidence to proof BYHWT can
           improve neurological deficit and also can improve quality of life in patients with
           ischemic stroke.
