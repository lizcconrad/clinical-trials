  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the impact of a new workplace-based mental health
      peer education program with standardized mental health literacy training on early
      intervention and support for healthcare employees with mental health issues. Participants are
      healthcare workers who volunteer to participate in one of the two twelve-hour group education
      programs. It is hypothesized that the customized &quot;Beyond Silence&quot; peer education program led
      by trained staff members with personal experience of mental ill-health will be more effective
      in reducing the stigma associated with help-seeking and help-outreach regarding mental
      ill-health in the workplace. The comparison group is a standardized mental health literacy
      training program that has been widely implemented in both Canada and around the world. Change
      in help-seeking/help-outreach behavior, mental health knowledge and beliefs of participants
      will be assessed at three-month intervals; before, after and three months following the
      educational intervention.

      The target sample of 200 employee participants will be recruited from two healthcare
      organizations. The Beyond Silence program is based on principles of contact-based education,
      and will include six 1.5-2 hour in-person sessions conducted every other week, interspersed
      with five online resource sessions. The Mental Health First Aid training is a standardized,
      12-hour evidence-based mental health literacy training program that has been implemented in a
      range of national and international settings. This program is typically offered over two full
      days.

    <description>Participants will be asked to report whether they accessed any services from a list of 10 health, workplace and community service options. Questions regarding service utilization are adapted from the 2012/2012 Canadian Community Health survey, in order to provide a population reference, plus several work-related services (eg. EAP, union) are added as an option. Participants may endorse more than one of the behaviors, and a summative score of the number of behaviors will be used to measure change in help-seeking.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report of personal contact with a co-worker about mental health problems (yes/no), and any contact over the past 6 months (yes/no). If contact did occur, participants will be asked whether they provided help to the co-worker, and if so, to identify the type of help from a list of 10 possible options. The list of &quot;outreach&quot; behaviors was based on Mental Health First Aid program evaluation (e.g. 'spent time listening to problem', 'recommend professional help'), with an adaptation to include a several work-specific options (e.g., 'recommend EAP', 'offered assistance with job duties'). Participants are invited to check all behaviors that apply (with an open-ended option), and scoring is based on one point per action, with a summative score used to track change. In addition to the behavior list, participants will be asked to rate their confidence in providing help on a 7 point Likert scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in degree of stigma towards co-workers with a mental illness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Mental Health Commission of Canada Opening Minds Scale for Healthcare Providers will be used; a 20-item questionnaire designed to evaluate the attitudes of healthcare providers towards people with mental illness. The tool has good internal consistency (α=.82), and satisfactory test-retest reliability (ICC=.66), with limited impact of social desirability.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in mental health literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post-intervention, 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Four vignettes of employees with workplace mental health issues will be used to assess awareness of issues and when/how to respond to these issues in the workplace. The vignettes are adapted for a healthcare workplace based on a review of vignettes reported in the literature, as well as analysis of key issues reported in the pilot phase of the study. Vignettes will incorporate differences in gender, nature and severity of illness, and a 7 point Likert scale from novice to expert will be used to track key dimensions of literacy, including perceived knowledge about the condition, what to say/do and what resources to access.</description>

    <description>The Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale-short form (ATSPPHS), a 10 question survey using a four point Likert-type scale response will be used to track beliefs and intent to seek professional help. It is a widely used scale with good internal consistency (α=.78), and criterion validity supported by links between scale scores and mental healthcare use.</description>

    <description>Pilot data from initial phases of the project and best practice principles in contact based education and adult learning theory informed curriculum design. The six in-person sessions use workplace-based vignettes to prompt reflection and discussion, build mental health literacy, reduce stigma, and promote communication and coping skill development. The virtual sessions use a secure online discussion board for participants to explore relevant online resources. All sessions will be co-led by trained peer educators; employees who have personally experienced mental ill health and recovery and are viewed as credible leaders within the organization. They will be recruited and trained to effectively teach the content, share personal experiences, and facilitate discussion.</description>

    <description>MHFA is a standardized, twelve-hour educational program designed to teach participants how to recognize the early warning signs of mental illness, how to provide initial help to someone in a mental health crisis, and how to support people who are developing mental health problems. It is an evidence-based approach that originated in Australia, but is being implemented across Canada, under the leadership of the Mental Health Commission of Canada. Leadership of the MHFA will be provided by an employee in each organization who has been trained through the 5-day national MHFA instructor training program. The instructor does not share any personal experiences regarding mental health issues.</description>
