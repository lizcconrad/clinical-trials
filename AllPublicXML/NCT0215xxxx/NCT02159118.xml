    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare use of a powered bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
      device (OnControl) to use of a standard manual bone marrow aspiration and biopsy device to
      obtain bone marrow biopsy specimens in children. The hypothesis is that use of the powered
      device will improve the quantity and quality of bone marrow biopsy specimens when compared to
      the manual device.
