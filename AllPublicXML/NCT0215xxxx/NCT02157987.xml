  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epistaxis are present in over 90 % of patients with Rendu - Osler . They involve no
      significant difference 2 sexes. They often appear in childhood and adolescence and are
      present in three-quarters of patients at the age of 20 years. These epistaxis increasing in
      frequency and volume to the age of 60 in 2/3 of patients. Epistaxis are spontaneous ,
      repetitive and recurring . They are highly variable in duration, intensity and frequency of
      occurrence . Some patients may have more than 40 monthly episodes with mean duration of 5
      minutes of bleeding and chronic anemia and can sometimes acute anemia with transfusions need
      to be source. These epistaxis stigmatize patients and inevitably affect their quality of life
      and social skills . The various proposed ( cauterization , intra- mucosal injections, laser
      selective hémostatses , embolization or surgical dermoplasties ) allow for some short-term
      remissions . Bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic use in the treatment of colorectal cancers . It
      is also used in ophthalmology intravitreal to reduce vascular proliferation in glaucoma
      retinopathy and certain corneal neovascularization. In 2009, Prithviraj reported the use of
      bevacizumab injection to treat pulmonary arteriovenous malformations in a patient with Rendu
      - Osler . The result is doubly interesting including a saving action on epistaxis which
      decrease in frequency and duration. This communication prompted the authors to focus more on
      this medication. The product has been used in local submucosal injection intranasal laser was
      coupled with satisfactory results objectified by a decrease in the number of epistaxis ,
      reducing blood transfusions and improved social lives. The use of local instillation
      bevacuzimab represents a way forward for the treatment of these epistaxis.
