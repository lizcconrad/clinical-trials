  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury(AKI) is a common and severe complication after the cardiac surgery.
      Postoperative AKI increases the in-hospital stay, intensive care unit(ICU) stay and
      postoperative mortality. Aortic surgery is the most risky surgery that causes the
      postoperative AKI, and the incidence of AKI after aortic surgery is about 50%.

      Statin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors and is
      used primarily to lower the level of plasma cholesterol. Apart from the antilipid effect,
      statin has pleiotropic effects include anti-inflammation, decrease of oxidative stress,
      recovery of endothelial cell injury and stabilization of thrombus.

      The pathology of AKI after aortic surgery include not only hypoperfusion of renal blood flow
      but also thromboembolism, inflammatory reaction after use of cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) and
      oxidative stress. Therefore, the incidence of AKI after aortic surgery can be expected to
      decrease after the perioperative use of statin because of the pleiotropic effects of it. The
      aim of this study is to examine the association between preoperative statin treatment and the
      incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury(AKI) in patients undergoing aortic surgery
