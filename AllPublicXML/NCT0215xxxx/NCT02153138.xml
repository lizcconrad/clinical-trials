      The investigators' hypothesis is that a plant-based diet may be beneficial if nutritional
      deficiencies will be corrected. The aims of the present proposal are to 1) study endothelial
      functions of subjects on well-defined vegetarian/vegan diets compared to age and sex matched
      omnivores (controls), and 2) study the differences in energy expenditure, body composition,
      overnight substrate utilization, blood work results, and levels of intracellular reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and of adhesion molecules on the different diets.

      The serious doubts about the nutritional adequacy of vegetarian diets in the past were
      essentially put to rest by recent studies that suggested that plant-based diets are healthy
      and associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases. Nevertheless, various nutritional
      deficiencies have been identified, and it has been shown that individuals who follow
      different types of vegetarian/vegan diets may not experience the same effects on their
      health.

      Working Hypothesis

        1. Vegetarian/vegan diets will promote protection against cardiovascular risk factors if
           supplemented with possibly deficient nutrients.

        2. There will a further protective effect and a greater number of differences between
           subjects following a vegetarian diet compared to those following a vegan diet.

        3. Higher energy expenditure and lower and different caloric intake will promote a
           favorable difference in body composition (lower body fat) via a different substrate
           utilization expressed in the measured respiratory quotient (RQ).

        4. Extra- and intracellular free radicals will be higher in subjects who adhere to
           vegetarian/vegan diets compared to omnivores.

      Aims of the study

        1. To study the effect of vegetarian/vegan diets on endothelial functions after correcting
           for modifying factors.

        2. To study the effect of the above-mentioned plant-based diets on carotid intima-media
           thickness.

        3. To study the differences in body composition, resting energy expenditure and over-night
           substrate utilization between the different diets.

        4. To study the intracellular ROS of subjects following different diets.

    <description>The endo peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) provides an index of endothelial function in two forms:
The reactive hyperemia index (RHI) is the post-to-preocclusion PAT signal ratio in the occluded side, normalized to the control side and further corrected for baseline vascular tone.
The logarithm RHI (LnRHI) is s similar index as RHI after natural log transformation with a matched cutoff. LnRHI provides better double-sided distribution than RHI and one that is closer to normal distribution</description>
