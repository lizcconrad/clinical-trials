  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, proof of concept, study in adults
      with poorly controlled moderate to severe asthma. The researchers believe that by using a
      local anesthetic to block a certain nerve in the ear, it will improve all aspects of asthma,
      such as decreasing the numbers of times patients have to use a rescue inhaler, and improving
      asthma treatment assessment questionnaire scores, with no bad changes to lung function and
      inflammation.

      The proposed four-week, double-blind, placebo controlled study is designed to test the
      hypothesis that topical auricular anesthesia of the vagus nerve decreases the need for the
      usage of rescue inhalers in moderate to severe asthma in adults.

      We anticipate that up to 50 patients will be enrolled in the trial. Particularly severe risks
      are not anticipated based on the prior investigational experience with this drug. This trial
      will be used to generate experience and data to support the design of a larger, crossover,
      comparator trial investigating the efficacy of antipyrine- benzocaine in reducing the need
      for rescue inhalers and hospital admissions in moderate to severe asthmatic adults.
