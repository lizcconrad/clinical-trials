      The primary aims of this randomized controlled trial are to evaluate efficacy potential of
      SPEEDI at enhancing reaching and play based problem solving compared to infants receiving
      usual care. The secondary aim is to assess the efficacy potential of SPEEDI to impact motor
      and cognitive development as assessed using commonly used clinical outcome measures. The
      exploratory aims are to assess the impact of SPEEDI on parent child interactions and feeding
      skills. The findings will provide crucial initial efficacy estimates to be used in a larger
      definitive clinical trial of SPEEDI.

    <measure>Early Problem Solving Indicator (EPSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention, 1 and 3 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Problem-solving behaviors were assessed using the Early Problem Solving Indicator (EPSI). The EPSI is the cognitive subtest of the Individual Growth and Development Indicators designed to measure infant and toddler play-based problem-solving through 36 months of age. It defines problem-solving as consisting of visual exploration, object manipulation and memory. The infant was video-recorded interacting with 3 standard toys: pop-up animals toy, 6 seriated, plastic cups, and a gum ball machine with 5 balls. Infants were given each toy for 2 minutes. The frequency of 4 mutually exclusive behaviors (look, explore, function, solution) were coded using definitions from the EPSI protocol. time. The total number of problem solving behaviors was calculated as a sum of look, explore, function, and solution for each infant at each visit and reported as the total EPSI frequency with a higher frequency reflecting more problem solving behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Early Feeding Skill Assessment (FES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End phase 1, End of intervention, 1 and 3 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Early Feeding Skills (EFS) was used to assess the infant's oral feeding skills during the video recorded feeding described above. The EFS is a 26-item observational tool that can be used from the start of oral feeding through the maturation of feeding skills. Each item can score 1-3 with one representing the least skill or high frequency of problem (an area of clinical concern), and three representing mature skill or absence of problem (area of strength). Subscales included were ability to maintain engagement in feeding, ability to organize oral-motor functioning, ability to coordinate swallowing, and ability to maintain physiological stability. The sum of all the items in a subscale divided by the number of items in the subscale gives the subscale score of 1-3. The sum of all subscales was used to create an EFS total score which could range from 2 to 12 with a higher score reflecting a better feeding performance.</description>

    <measure>Parent Child Early Relational Assessment (PCERA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, End phase 1, End of intervention, 1 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment (PCERA; Clark, 2010; Clark, 1999) was designed to assess mother-infant interaction. In this study PCERA was scored from a video of the feeding interaction. The PCERA is a 65-item observational rating scale (29 parental, 27 infant, and 8 dyadic), designed to assess the amount, duration, and intensity of interaction. Each item was rated on a 3-point ordinal scale with 1-2 indicating an area of concern, 3 indicating an area for some concern and 4- 5 indicating an area of strength. Eight subscales constructed from items of the PCERA have been theoretically derived and confirmed by factor analysis (Clark, 1999; Clark et al., 1997). For ease of analysis this scale was transformed to a -1 to +1 range. Scores were recorded as 1 or 2 = -1, 3= 0, 4 or 5 = 1. The total PCERA score is the mean of all the subscale mean scores and ranged -1 (highest risk of atypical interactions) to +1 (most positive interactions).</description>

    <measure>Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Bayley).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Bayley-III is a norm references standardized developmental assessment of Motor, Cognitive, and Language skills. Composite scores for each domain have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. A score of 85-115 is considered average. Higher composite scores represent higher or better performance on that subtest. The Bayley was administered at the final follow-up visit and 3 months after the intervention ended.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to End of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The TIMP is a standardized and norm references test of motor control and posture in infants 4 months of age and younger which is commonly used with infants starting at 34 weeks of post-menstrual age. Change in raw score from baseline to end of the intervention is reported. The TIMP raw score ranges from 0 to 142. A higher score represented greater performance in motor control and posture.</description>

        <title>Early Problem Solving Indicator (EPSI)</title>
        <description>Problem-solving behaviors were assessed using the Early Problem Solving Indicator (EPSI). The EPSI is the cognitive subtest of the Individual Growth and Development Indicators designed to measure infant and toddler play-based problem-solving through 36 months of age. It defines problem-solving as consisting of visual exploration, object manipulation and memory. The infant was video-recorded interacting with 3 standard toys: pop-up animals toy, 6 seriated, plastic cups, and a gum ball machine with 5 balls. Infants were given each toy for 2 minutes. The frequency of 4 mutually exclusive behaviors (look, explore, function, solution) were coded using definitions from the EPSI protocol. time. The total number of problem solving behaviors was calculated as a sum of look, explore, function, and solution for each infant at each visit and reported as the total EPSI frequency with a higher frequency reflecting more problem solving behaviors.</description>

        <title>Early Feeding Skill Assessment (FES)</title>
        <description>The Early Feeding Skills (EFS) was used to assess the infantâ€™s oral feeding skills during the video recorded feeding described above. The EFS is a 26-item observational tool that can be used from the start of oral feeding through the maturation of feeding skills. Each item can score 1-3 with one representing the least skill or high frequency of problem (an area of clinical concern), and three representing mature skill or absence of problem (area of strength). Subscales included were ability to maintain engagement in feeding, ability to organize oral-motor functioning, ability to coordinate swallowing, and ability to maintain physiological stability. The sum of all the items in a subscale divided by the number of items in the subscale gives the subscale score of 1-3. The sum of all subscales was used to create an EFS total score which could range from 2 to 12 with a higher score reflecting a better feeding performance.</description>

        <title>Parent Child Early Relational Assessment (PCERA)</title>
        <description>The Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment (PCERA; Clark, 2010; Clark, 1999) was designed to assess mother-infant interaction. In this study PCERA was scored from a video of the feeding interaction. The PCERA is a 65-item observational rating scale (29 parental, 27 infant, and 8 dyadic), designed to assess the amount, duration, and intensity of interaction. Each item was rated on a 3-point ordinal scale with 1-2 indicating an area of concern, 3 indicating an area for some concern and 4- 5 indicating an area of strength. Eight subscales constructed from items of the PCERA have been theoretically derived and confirmed by factor analysis (Clark, 1999; Clark et al., 1997). For ease of analysis this scale was transformed to a -1 to +1 range. Scores were recorded as 1 or 2 = -1, 3= 0, 4 or 5 = 1. The total PCERA score is the mean of all the subscale mean scores and ranged -1 (highest risk of atypical interactions) to +1 (most positive interactions).</description>
