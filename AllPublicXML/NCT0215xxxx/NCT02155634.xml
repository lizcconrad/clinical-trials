      The purpose of this study is to see how long lenalidomide therapy can maintain or improve the
      disease response obtained after induction therapy that does not include lenalidomide,
      pomalidomide or thalidomide; and consequently reduce worsening of disease and to evaluate the
      activity of lenalidomide. Patients will receive lenalidomide or be under observation. All
      patients will attend regular clinic visits to evaluate their disease and health. Patients
      will have the option to participate in additional biomarker correlative studies in addition
      to their participation in the main study.

             bone marrow ≥ 10% and/or presence of a biopsy-proven, plasmacytoma, (2) monoclonal
             protein in the serum and/or urine, and (3) at least one criteria of hypercalcemia,
             renal failure, anemia or bone disease.

          3. Measurable disease by protein electrophoresis analyses.

          4. All subjects must be treated with a minimum of 6 cycles (unless subject achieved a
             complete response prior to 6 cycles),and a maximum of 12 cycles of induction without
             lenalidomide (LEN), pomalidomide (POM) or thalidomide (THAL). Subject must have
             achieved at least stable disease (SD) as best overall response and maintained SD or
             better throughout the induction until screening. Subjects who plateau must have at
             least 2 cycles at best response prior to randomization.

          5. Subjects must have cytogenetic (e.g.:17 p deletion, and 4;14 translocation), β-2
             microglobulin and serum albumin (ISS Stage) results from their initial diagnosis

               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be
                  reviewed on a monthly basis) or agree to use, and be able to comply with,
                  effective contraception without interruption, 28 days prior to starting
                  investigational product (IP), during the study therapy (including dose
