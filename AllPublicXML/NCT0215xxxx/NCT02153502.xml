  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this 10-week study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of AVP 786 as an adjunctive therapy compared with placebo in patients with major depressive
      disorder (MDD) who have shown an inadequate response to standard antidepressant treatment. A
      secondary objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AVP-786 and
      potential correlations with pharmacodynamic effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that up to approximately 200 patients will participate in the study at
      approximately 30 enrolling centers in the US.

      Eligible patients for this study must have MDD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria, and have shown an inadequate response to
      standard antidepressant treatment.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of 10 weeks
      duration.

      Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible
      patients will be randomized into the study. Study medication will be administered orally
      twice a day (BID) (1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening, approximately 12
      hours apart) throughout the treatment period.
