        <title>Percentage of Participants Reported With Improvement on the PGI Scale for Remaining Tiredness in the Morning</title>
        <description>Remaining tiredness in the morning was defined as an experience of fatigue after complete or adequate sleep duration. PGI is a participant rated instrument to measure participant's change in overall status on a 7-point scale. Participants provide their response on a PGI questionnaire. Total score range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Percentage of participants with improvement rated as &quot;much better&quot; or &quot;a little better&quot; were reported. The data was assessed at Week 4, Week 52 and final visit (follow up visit up to Month 12).</description>
