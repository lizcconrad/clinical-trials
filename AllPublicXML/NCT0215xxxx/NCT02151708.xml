  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a disorder characterized by chronic or recurrent upper abdominal
      pain or discomfort in the absence of a specific structural cause.1 Several mechanisms have
      been suggested to underlie dyspeptic symptoms. In a barostat study by Tack et al.2, impaired
      gastric accommodation to a meal was found in 40% of patients with FD, and this abnormality
      was associated with early satiety. Delayed gastric emptying (GE) was also found in almost 40%
      of patients with FD, and was associated with the symptoms of postprandial fullness, vomiting
      and early satiety.3-5 Improving gastric accommodation and prokinetic effect seem to be an
      attractive physiological target in patients with FD. Motilitone (Dong-A ST, Yongin, Korea) is
      a new herbal drug that was launched in December 2011 in Korea for treating patients with FD.
      It has multiple mechanisms of action such as fundus relaxation, visceral analgesia and
      prokinetic effects.6 The current study aims to evaluate effects of motilitone on gastric
      emptying and accommodation after a meal in patients with FD using three-dimensional gastric
      volume measurements by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients are randomly allocated to
      receive either motilitone 90 mg daily, motilitone 180 mg daily or placebo in a double blinded
      manner. After 2 weeks of treatment, patients undergo gastric MRI. The primary endpoint is
      gastric emptying rate. The secondary endpoints are gastric accommodation and symptom
      improvement.
