  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bioresorbable polymer drug eluting stents (DES) are an indisputable improvement over
      first-generation DES with promising results on long-term adverse events. But the thicker
      polymer and/or strut may hinder its deliverability. Complex procedures challenge stent
      deliverability and stent delivery failure impacts clinical prognosis.

      This registry aimed to assess the immediate performance of the third-generation Synergy
      everolimus-eluting stent (sEES) and its 12-month clinical follow-up in an all-comer
      population.

      All consecutive patients treated with the SYNERGY stent at our institutions were
      prospectively included in the SWEET registry. Baseline and procedural characteristics were
      collected at index procedure. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 month and 1 year by
      clinic visit or follow-up call. The study end point was a composite of cardiac death (CD),
      myocardial infarction (MI) and target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 1 year.
