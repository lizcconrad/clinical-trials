    <textblock>
      Objectives: The primary objective is to test whether right prefrontal cortex low frequency 1
      Hz rTMS versus right prefrontal high frequency 10 Hz rTMS provides a significantly greater
      improvement in function as measured by IPF score and PTSD symptoms as measured with CAPS
      score. The secondary objectives include: one, testing which treatment provides a
      significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by change in QIDS score;
      two, testing whether depression impacts effectiveness of 1 Hz versus 10 Hz rTMS for PTSD
      symptoms; and three, testing which treatment is better tolerated as measured by participant
      drop out and side effect profiles.

      Research Design: Randomized single-blind (raters) prospective clinical trial testing the
      effectiveness 1 Hz rTMS versus 10 Hz rTMS in veterans with PTSD.

      Methodology: Veterans 18 to 50 years of age suffering from PTSD with and without depressive
      symptoms will be recruited from the community as well as from the mental health clinics at
      the James A. Haley Veterans Administration Hospital. Plan to enroll 50 in order to have an
      evaluable sample of approximately 20 in each group. Participants will be consented and
      undergo screening for safety and appropriateness to be in the trial. Those deemed eligible
      will be evaluated with clinical measures of function, PTSD, depression, pain, and
      neurobehavioral symptoms. Participants will be randomized in equal proportion (stratified by
      significant depression defined as MADRS greater than 19) to one of two active treatments:
      right prefrontal 1 Hz rTMS versus right prefrontal 10 Hz rTMS. Participants will undergo
      assessment for safety prior to each treatment. The treatments will be performed 5 days a week
      for 6 weeks with a 3-week taper consisting of 3 days per week, 2 days per week, and 1 day per
      week. Clinical evaluations will be performed at baseline, after every five treatments, at the
      end of the treatment, and at 1 and 3 months post treatment. CAPS and IPF scores will be used
      to determine if there is a significant difference between 1 Hz and 10 Hz right prefrontal
      rTMS for PTSD symptoms and function respectively. The QIDS scores will be used to test for a
      significant difference in change in depressive symptoms for both the participants with
      significant depressive symptoms and the entire group. The number of dropouts (related
      specifically to side effects and all cause) will be used along with side effect profiles to
      test for differences in tolerability of the two treatments.

    <measure>Change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 30 rTMS Treatments (approximately 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS-5 was developed at the National Center for PTSD, and has become the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessing PTSD in individuals over age 15. This structured interview is ideal for screening, differential diagnosis, confirmation of a PTSD diagnosis, or identifying Acute Stress Disorder. The CAPS consists of 30 interview questions that target DSM-5 criteria for PTSD. These items assess core PTSD symptoms and related issues: Re-experiencing Symptoms, Avoidance and Numbing Symptoms, Hyperarousal Symptoms, Trauma-Related Guilt, Dissociation, Subjective Distress, Functional Impairment, Onset, Duration, Symptom Severity, Symptom Improvement, Response Validity.</description>
