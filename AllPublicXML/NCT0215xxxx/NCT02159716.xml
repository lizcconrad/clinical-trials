      Phase I study to establish safety and feasibility of intravenously administered lentiviral
      transduced CART-meso cells administered with and without cyclophosphamide in a 3+3 dose
      escalation design in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer, serous epithelial ovarian
      cancer, or pleural mesothelioma. Dose: 1-3xE7 /mE2 (Cohort 1 and 2) and 1-3xE8 /mE2 (Cohort 3
      and 4 ) CAR+ T cells by intravenous route. In the event of 2 DLTs at each dose level, we will
      dose deescalate by 10-fold.

               -  Malignant pleural mesothelioma (histologically confirmed epithelial)

          -  Failure of at least one prior standard of care chemotherapy for advanced stage
             disease.

          -  Subjects must have measureable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria or modified
             RECIST criteria.

          -  Patients &gt; 18 years of age.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          -  Satisfactory organ and bone marrow function as defined by the following (of note, the
             minimal blood counts should be in the absence of transfusion or cytokine support):

             i. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/μl ii. Platelets &gt;75,000/μl iii. Hemoglobin &gt; 9
             g/dL iv. Bilirubin &lt; 2.0x the institutional normal upper limit unless secondary to
             bile duct obstruction by tumor v. Creatinine &lt; 1.5x the institutional normal upper
             limit vi. Albumin ≥2 vii. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 5x the institutional normal upper limit viii. Cardiac
             ejection fraction of &gt;55% as measured by resting echocardiogram, with no significant
             pericardial effusion.

          -  Blood coagulation parameters: PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is ≤
             1.5 and a PTT &lt; 1.2 time the upper limit of normal unless the patient is
             therapeutically anti-coagulated for history of cancer-related thrombosis and has
             stable coagulation parameters.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to provide written informed consent.

          -  Male and Female subjects of reproductive potential agree to use approved contraceptive
             methods (e.g. birth control pills, barrier device, intrauterine device, abstinence)
             and abstain from other methods of conception during the study and for 6 months

             investigational drugs different than those used in this protocol.

             cervical and bladder and prostate cancer with PSA level &lt; 1.0) are not
             excluded.CART-meso in mesothelin expressing cancers

          -  HIV, HCV, or HBV infections

          -  Active autoimmune disease (including but not limited to: systemic lupus
             erythromatosis, Sjogren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple
             sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, etc.) requiring immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Patients with ongoing or active infection.

          -  Planned concurrent treatment with systemic high dose corticosteroids. Patients may be
             on a stable low dose of steroids (&lt;10mg equivalent of prednisone) for chronic
             respiratory conditions.

          -  Patients requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.

          -  Prior therapy with gene modified cells.

          -  Previous experimental therapy with SS1 moiety, murine or chimeric antibodies (human
             and humanized antibodies are allowed).

          -  History of allergy to murine proteins

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to study product excipients (human serum
             albumin, DMSO, and Dextran 40)

          -  Any clinically significant pericardial effusion; CHF (NY Heart Association Grade
             II-IV) or cardiovascular condition that would preclude assessment of mesothelin
             induced pericarditis or that may worsen as a result of toxicities expected for this
             study. This determination will be made by a cardiologist.

          -  Any clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusion that cannot be drained with
             standard approaches. An indwelling drainage device placed prior to enrollment is
             acceptable.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women. Female study participants of reproductive potential
             must have a negative urine pregnancy test of enrollment. A serum pregnancy test will
