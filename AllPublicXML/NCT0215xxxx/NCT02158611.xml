      This project aims to provide more treatment options to suicide patients to further enhance
      the holistic medical services in Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. It focuses on high-risk
      cases, especially those whose suicidal behaviors are triggered by interpersonal/or emotional
      problems because psychological counseling or interpersonal growth groups of services have
      been shown to be beneficial to this population.
