  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I/II open label first in human single center clinical study, is to evaluate the safety
      and the efficacy of BonoFill as bone filler containing the patient own (autologous) adipose
      tissue derived cells (HATDCs) in reconstructing the Bone Void in the maxillofacial area
      approximately 6 month follow up after implantation in the following two clinical indications:

        1. Bone augmentation (e.g. sinus augmentation)

        2. Bone grafting after removal of cysts from jaws
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Primary endpoint: The implantation of BonoFill to the maxillary or mandible defect/void is
      safe under the following conditions: No chronic bone infection (Osteomyelitis); no
      significant changes in complete blood count (CBC) and in general health.

      Secondary endpoint: The implantation of BonoFill to the maxillary or mandible void is
      efficient under the following conditions: Following BonoFill implantation, the bone
      regeneration in the operated site was significantly accelerated. Also, the bone defects/voids
      were filled with a significant amount of bone tissue.
