  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of using intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence
      Imaging (CLI) of prostatectomy specimens to determine tumour margin status. The samples will
      be imaged using the LightPathTM Imaging System which consists of a light-tight box containing
      an ultra-sensitive lens and radiation-shielded camera. This study will measure the
      correlation between margin status of the WLE specimen and the metastatic status of dissected
      lymph nodes as determined by the LightPathTM Imaging System and by histopathology. This is a
      pilot study to assess feasibility before proceeding to a pivotal study to evaluate the
      benefits of the LightPathTM system in clinical practice.

      This study is a prospective, single-centre feasibility study to evaluate the use of
      intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI) of prostatectomy specimens to determine
      margin status.

      Subjects will receive an intravenous injection of 370 Mega Becquerel (MBq) of 18F-choline
      prior to routine, elective radical prostatectomy. The surgery will be performed according to
      standard-of-care. The resected prostatectomy specimens will be imaged using the LightPathTM
      Imaging System, consisting of a light-tight box containing an ultra-sensitive lens and
      Electron Multiplying Charged-Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera.

      This study will measure the agreement between margin status of the prostatectomy specimen as
      determined by CLI and by histopathology (reference method). This study will assess
      feasibility before proceeding to a pivotal study to evaluate the benefits of the LightPathTM
      Imaging System in clinical practice.
