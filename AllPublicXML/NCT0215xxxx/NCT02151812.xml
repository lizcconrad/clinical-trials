    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is determine the safety and performance of the Agent™
      Paclitaxel-Coated PTCA Balloon Catheter compared to the SeQuent® Please Paclitaxel-Releasing
      Coronary Balloon Catheter for the treatment of patients with narrowed previously-stented
      coronary arteries (in-stent restenosis).

      The performance will be determined at six months post-procedure by quantitative coronary
      angiography (QCA) to measure Late Lumen Loss (LLL) in the re-opened stented segment. QCA
      results will be assessed by an independent, blinded angiographic core lab.

      Study statistical hypothesis: The loss of in-stent luminal diameter at six months after
      treatment of the restenosed stent with the Agent™ study device is not larger than the
      respective LLL after treatment with the SeQuent® Please control devices, i.e. study device is
      non-inferior to the control device with respect to LLL.
