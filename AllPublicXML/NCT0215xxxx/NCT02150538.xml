      This study was designed to evaluate the potential benefits of treatment with biventricular
      device in patients with normal systolic function , indication for pacing and impaired
      atrio-ventricular conduction , by comparing the treatment with dual-chamber device . The REAL
      -CRT study is designed to test the hypothesis that, in patients with atrioventricular block
      of I degree and standard pacing indications , biventricular pacing is superior to single
      stimulation of the right ventricle (RV) with optimized algorithms for minimization of pacing
      , as assessed by echocardiography an endpoint defined in terms of maintenance over time of
      left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ) and left ventricular end-systolic volume ( LVESV )
      .

      Clinical data suggest that biventricular pacing is able to preserve the myocardial
      performance more effectively than the right ventricular pacing in patients with
      atrioventricular block and mild systolic dysfunction . In particular, some studies have shown
      that medical therapy in these patients could be responsible for an increase in the cumulative
      percentage of chronic pacing over the 40% threshold , the threshold associated with a higher
      incidence of atrial fibrillation and hospitalization for heart failure and ventricular
      arrhythmias . In addition , patients with pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction and
      indication for pacing standards have improved left ventricular systolic function , exercise
      capacity and quality of life as a result of biventricular pacing as compared with Right
      ventricular pacing . These results suggest that biventricular pacing is a feasible option for
      permanent pacing in patients who have normal systolic function of the left ventricle and that
      this can be altered from the adverse effects of conventional Right ventricular pacing on
      systolic function of the left ventricle . This reality has prompted physicians to assess the
      value and role of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT ) in patients with prolonged
      Atrio-Ventricular (AV) conduction . Note the deleterious effects of chronic stimulation of
      the right ventricle , the optimal pacing mode should always be considered in these patients
      at the time of implantation . This study was designed to evaluate the potential benefits of
      treatment with biventricular device in patients with normal systolic function , indication
      for pacing and impaired atrio-ventricular conduction, by comparing it with the treatment with
      dual chamber device
