      The study aims to investigate the effect a systematic telemedicine intervention, based on the
      tigth control principals, as a platform for disease monitoring among patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis.

      It is hypothesized that:

        -  A systematic telemedicine intervention targeted to tight control of disease activity
           among patients with RA will be equally effective as usual care (outpatient consultation
           by a rheumatologist).

        -  There will be no difference in the effect whether this telemedicine consultation is
           carried out by a rheumatologist or a rheumatology nurse.

        -  Patient satisfaction and the patient's general perception of involvement in their
           treatment will be increased for patients who receive the telemedicine intervention.

        -  All the effects will apply both in the short term (&lt; 6 months) and in the long term (&gt; 1
           year).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease affecting 0.5-1.0 % of the Danish population.
      Due to an expected growing population and a higher proportion of elderly the prevalence is
      likely to increase in the years to come.

      Untreated RA will lead to joint destruction disabling the patients, but in recent years both
      treatment and treatment strategies have been markedly improved. According to international
      guidelines early start of medical treatment, quick escalation of doses, and adjustment of the
      dose throughout the whole disease course when there are signs of disease activity, are
      considered important elements in the RA treatment strategy. Consequently, the success of this
      strategy implies the possibility of regular routine testing of all RA patients, which could
      become a challenge to the health care system causing substandard treatment to RA patients in
      the future. This calls for reorganization of the routine care of RA, i.e. in form of a
      telemedicine intervention.

      Telemedicine is considered to be the use of communication and information technologies to
      deliver clinical care where the individuals involved are not at the same location. No studies
      have yet investigated the effect of monitoring disease activity through a standardized
      telemedicine treatment strategy in patients with RA, and most of the evidence is derived from
      studies within chronic heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma, diabetes and
      hypertension. This evidence indicates, however, that telemedicine interventions seem to be
      effective, time saving and associated with a high degree of patient satisfaction.

      RA disease activity is measured using a composite score that includes both objective and
      subjective outcome parameters to measure present as well as past disease activity. These
      scores include: tender and swollen joint count together with the patient's global assessment,
      report of physical functioning, the measurement of an acute-phase reactant and serial
      radiographic assessment. The most commonly used instruments for measuring RA disease activity
      in daily clinical practice is the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria, the
      Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28).

      However, in a telemedicine intervention there is no direct physical contact between the
      patient and the health professionals, making traditional disease activity measures unfit for
      use, as they imply an assessment of tender and swollen joints carried out by a health
      professional. It has been suggested to let the patients examine their joints. Still, it has
      been shown that patients tend to overestimate the presence of swollen joints which impairs
      the identification of synovitis - and thereby disease activity and flare. Hence, telemedicine
      disease activity monitoring in RA may be best supported by validated measures based on other
      kinds of patient self-assessment, i.e. the newly developed &quot;Flare&quot; instrument.

      According to international recommendations from the European League Against Rheumatism
      (EULAR) patients should have access to nurse-led telephone services to enhance continuity of
      care and to provide ongoing support, but it still remains unclarified which of the
      occupational groups, doctors or nurses, is to carry out the routine telemedicine disease
      monitoring.

      The trend in RA treatment is towards patients taking a more active role in the treatment, and
      telemedicine could be a very workable solution. However, before decision is made of
      transforming tight control of disease activity among patients with RA into a telemedicine
      intervention the effectiveness of such intervention, both when executed by doctors and
      nurses, need to be investigated.

      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To test the effectiveness of a customized telemedicine intervention targeted to tight
           control of disease activity among patients with RA, compared with usual outpatient care
           in a pragmatic randomized controlled trail.

        2. To test if the effect differs depending on whether the telemedicine consultation is
           carried out by a rheumatologist or by a rheumatology nurse.

        3. To examine the patients perspective towards telemedicine tight control of disease
           activity in RA, and assess patient satisfaction and acceptability towards the
           intervention.

      Power calculation

      A decrease in DAS28 on 1.2 is regarded as a significant clinically improvement. A change in
      DAS28 on 0.6 is regarded as non-response . Thus, a change in the DAS28 score &gt;0.6 will be
      used as the cut-point for a change in the condition. The standard deviation in DAS28 is
      presumed to be 1.5. Hence, in order to detect a 1-sided statistically significant change
      between the three groups, with a statistical power on 80% (beta=0.20), a sample size of at
      least 98 patients in each group is required.

      Intervention

      A systematic review of the literature has been conducted in order to make sure that the
      telemedicine management is informed by evidence. Further, focus group interviews have been
      conducted both among patient groups and among health professionals, to ensure that the
      intervention is based on expert consensus.

      The software used in the telemedicine intervention will be based on the established generic
      Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) system, WestChronic, which was developed in 2004 for
      collection of PRO data for research purposes in clinical epidemiological studies. WestChronic
      supports dynamic dual mode data collection with web or paper forms as well as communication
      to the patient with personalized postal letters, e-mails, and text messages. All information
      regarding implementations, items and questionnaires, communication, users, and patients
      resides in tables in a Structured Query Language (SQL) database, and all administration of
      implementations, questionnaires, users, and patients is supported by the server software and
      carried out in browser-windows. The software interphase serves a dual purpose: a) to be a
      customized communication tool between the patients and the health professionals, and b) to
      serve as decision support for the health professionals through the incorporation of a
      validated disease self-assessment tool.

      Decision support, the Flare instrument

      The Flare instrument (FI) serves as decision support for assessing disease activity in RA
      during the telemedicine intervention.

      FI is a 12-item questionnaire where patients are asked to express their degree of agreement
      about different statements concerning disease activity on a 10-point likert scale. Six items
      concerns joint symptoms (tenderness, stiffness and pain) and six items is concerning general
      symptoms. When scoring FI it is possible to compute a FI total score (all 12 items) or a
      subscale for joint or general symptoms, respectively.

      The instrument is translated into Danish according to the International Quality of Life
      Asessment (IQULA) method. It is validated in a cross sectional study among 100 consecutive
      patients from the outpatient clinic at Department of Rheumatology, Aarhus University
      Hospital, using DAS28 as the gold standard (unpublished data).

      Execution

      After randomization patients will be allocated to one of the three treatment arms:
      Telemedicine, doctor (TD), Telemedicine, Nurse (TN) or control in week 0, 13, 26, 39 and 52.
      The telemedicine consultation will be based on a telephone consultation. The consultation
      will follow a predefined consultation checklist.

      Patients allocated to TD or TN, who has expressed a desire to complete questionnaires in
      webform, will receive a letter a week before the consultation to remind them that they must
      assess their disease activity through the software interphase, within the next couple of
      days. Patients, who have expressed a wish to fill in questionnaires in paper form, will
      receive the questionnaire a week before the consultation and asked to return it to
      WestChronic immediately after completion. A chasing procedure will be carried out in case of
      non-respondence. Two reminders will be send to the patients over a period of four weeks and
      continuous non-respondence will hereafter lead to exclusion from the study.

      During telephone consultation, updated clinical test results will be available through the
      electronic medical system. Acute consultations will be performed and registered in all three
      groups as needed.

      Statistics

      Comparisons between groups will be made with the Fisher exact test for dichotomous responses
      and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-dichotomous responses. Changes over time will be analyzed
      with McNemar's test for dichotomous responses and Wilcoxon signed rank sum test for
      non-dichotomous responses. Data will be reported as a mean (SD) for variables in which normal
      distribution is found; otherwise data will be reported as the median ((interquartile range
      (IQR)).

      Data will be analyzed using both &quot;intention to treat&quot; and per protocol. In case of missing
      data multiple imputations will be used.
