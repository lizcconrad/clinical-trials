  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine whether patients who have acute or early chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be treated effectively and safely with an
      interferon-sparing regimen that combines a new direct acting antiviral drug (sofosbuvir) with
      one of the standard treatments for chronic hepatitis C (ribavirin). In particular, this study
      will investigate whether treatment of acute or early chronic HCV can be shortened. The study
      will assess efficacy by looking at the proportion of people who clear the virus (have no
      virus detectable in their blood) at the end of treatment, and 1, 3 and 6 months after
      treatment.

      The hypothesis is that short course (6 weeks) dual therapy using sofosbuvir and RBV will
      result in successful virological eradication in the majority (≥80%) of subjects treated for
      recently acquired HCV.

      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and acceptability of an interferon-sparing strategy with
      sofosbuvir and ribavirin for the treatment of recently acquired HCV infection.

      An open label single arm multicentre study Treatment of participants: Sofosbuvir 400mg daily
      with weight based ribavirin (1000mg &lt;75 kg, 1200mg &gt;/= 75kg) Duration of treatment will be 6
      weeks for all subjects followed by 52 weeks of observational follow-up Total study duration =
      58 weeks Primary endpoint: SVR 12
