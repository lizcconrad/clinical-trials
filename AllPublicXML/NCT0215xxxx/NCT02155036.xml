  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research aims to examine whether regular aerobic exercise can preserve renal
      function, improve aerobic capacity, physical and psychosocial function, strength,
      cardiovascular function, general well-being and quality of life. Ultimately, the research
      aims to prove that exercise is a more cost-effective and a more efficient use or healthcare
      resources used in the treatment of patients with CKD. Exercise is a relatively cheap
      treatment option which is readily available and accessible for this patient population.
      establish if, compared with usual care, an exercise programme for pre-dialysis CKD patients;

        1. Preserves renal function.

        2. Improves aerobic capacity, physical and psychosocial function, strength, cardiovascular
           function, general well-being and quality of life.

    <description>The intervention will include 2 sessions of gym-based exercise per week, both of which will be supervised for 3 months, supervision will then decrease to once-weekly until 6 months, and then be through phone support for the remaining 6 months. Warm up and cool down of minimum of five minutes on stationary exercise cycle, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) ~11, followed by gentle stretching. Progressive resistance training (PRT) will use eight PRT machines training large muscle groups (e.g. bench press, latissimus pulldown, bicep curl, triceps pull down, leg press, knee extension, hamstring curl, calf raises). Intensity will be 80% of one repetition maximum (1RM), building up to 3 sets of 8 repetitions. 1RM will be re-assessed monthly, and program adjusted accordingly.</description>
