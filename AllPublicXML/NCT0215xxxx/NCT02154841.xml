  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that patients who have undergone major surgical procedures are vulnerable to
      the consequences of inadequate calorie or nutritional intake. Clinical studies have
      demonstrated that early post-operative feeding increases strength and healing of an
      intestinal anastomosis, reduces surgical site infection and length of hospital stay. The
      'Enhanced recovery programme', ERP, includes early post-operative nutrition as one of its key
      goals, however there is no guidance on the type of food that should be offered to patients in
      this programme. Anecdotally, many patients and healthcare professionals believe that there
      are differences in how food tastes to early post-operative patients. If there are changes in
      taste following surgery this will affect the food choices that patients make in the early
      post-operative period. No studies have addressed this question to date. In this study we hope
      to describe this affect and consider the significance of any changes on the background of
      current hospital food options.

      We hypothesise that food preference and tastes and desires are altered in the early post
      operative period and this affects what patients eat at this critical time.

      Nutrition is a vital component of good health and recovery from illness. It is particularly
      clear that patients with chronic diseases and those who have undergone major surgical
      procedures are vulnerable to the consequences of inadequate calorie or nutritional intake.
      Over the last decade, surgical practices have evolved to encourage patients to resume early
      enteral feeding in order to avoid post-operative under-nutrition. Inadequate nutrition has
      previously been shown to be associated with prolongation of the acute phase response and
      increased incidence of septic morbidity. More recently clinical studies have demonstrated
      that early post-operative feeding increases strength and healing of an intestinal
      anastomosis. Further to this there is also evidence of benefit to patients by reduction of
      surgical site infections and other complications. Along with the cost saving of a lower
      complication rate there are financial benefits from reduced mean length of hospital stay.

      Over the last 5 years the importance of non-surgical factors in patient recovery or the
      development of complications has been highlighted. This has resulted in the development and
      near universal adoption of the 'Enhanced recovery programme (ERP)'. The ERP is a
      multidisciplinary initiative aiming to improve the patients' journey by:

        -  Optimizing pre-operative health status

        -  Reducing postoperative complications and the surgical and physiological stress responses
           by changing traditional surgical methods

        -  Early mobility

        -  Early feeding Post-operative nutrition is a key component to the ERP approach, however,
           many units that run ERP have reported that encouraging early post operative patients to
           increase their oral intake is difficult. Our own experience is that dysgeusia
           (distortion of the sense of taste) is common in the postoperative group.

      At present there are no publications in the literature on how best to support the delivery of
      nutrition to this important group and there is no literature on food preferences in patients
      who have recently undergone surgery. To date there has not been any research on the subject
      of peri-operative taste changes outside of surgical fields that directly affect the sensory
      system of taste (Ear, nose and throat surgery). Although there have been some descriptive
      studies on calorie intake in the peri-operative period no studies have been performed to
      confirm the existence of post-operative taste changes or to describe them.

      In order to optimise recovery from surgery and as part of the ERP programme, patients should
      be provided with food choices that encourage greater intake. It is known that optimising
      early post-operative nutrition will contribute to early discharge and uncomplicated recovery
      and have knock on benefits for inpatient costs. In order to provide this it is vital that we
      consider the issue of presumed dysgeusia and its affect on food choices. In order to begin
      this process the following study is proposed. It is hoped that the results of this study will
      allow re-evaluation of hospital menus to optimise post-operative nutrition.

    <description>Patients that agree to participate will complete a questionnaire that asks them about their taste preferences. Recruits will be shown photos of various food stuffs and asked to choose their preferred meal. They will also be asked to put five sponge sticks (a single use item commonly used for mouth care) dipped in one of a five different liquids into their mouths and give their comments what each taste was and on how much they enjoyed it. These five liquids represent the four well-described tastes (sweet, sour, salty, bitter) and a more recently proposed taste, savoury. The intention of this part of the trial is to assess the patient's ability to detect alteration in pure taste and to identify if any of these tastes are preferred.</description>
