  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes are the primary cause of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer
      syndrome. Genetic testing identifies mutation carriers and enables them to manage their
      cancer risk (i.e. chemoprevention, risk-reducing surgery, or intensive surveillance).
      However, uptake of genetic testing among at-risk individuals is low, implying that
      information about the disease and genetic testing is not being communicated effectively among
      family members. Mutation carriers are distressed about disclosing test results, while their
      relatives do not understand the implications of a positive test result for their own health.
      Thus, interventions that support family communication about genetic risk, and address
      psychological distress of family members could contribute to more effective management of
      hereditary breast/ovarian cancer.

      The project aims to develop a family communication and decision-support intervention to 1)
      increase family communication about BRCA1/2 mutations; 2) reduce psychological distress
      associated with these mutations; and 3) increase informed decision-making regarding uptake of
      BRCA1/2 testing among at-risk family members. Focus groups with mutation carriers and at-risk
      relatives will inform the refinement of the intervention, as well as timing and mode of
      delivery. Two group, pre-post test study with a new sample of mutation carriers and family
      members will be used to test the feasibility, acceptability, and effect of the intervention.
