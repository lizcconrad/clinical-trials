  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in subjects with
      exercise-related knee pain/discomfort to determine the efficacy of a polyherbal capsule
      compared to placebo capsule in improving exercise capacity and overall parameters of joint
      health.

  <detailed_description>

      Subjects will come to the study site at Visit 1 for screening assessments (which will occur
      within 14 days before the start of the run-in period) and to answer questions associated with
      habitual diet, exercise capacity, and level of activity. Those subjects who meet initial
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will undergo a run-in period of at least 7 days at home to
      discontinue use of all concurrent dietary supplements. Subjects will then return to the study
      site at Visit 2 (Baseline; Day 0) for further assessments and those meeting all
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomly assigned to study
      product.

      Approximately 108 subjects (54 per treatment group) will be enrolled in the study. Subjects
      will be evaluated at Visit 3 (Day 14), Visit 4 (Day 45), Visit 5 (Day 60, phone call), and
      Visit 6 (Day 90). Exercise capacity (ie, 6-minute timed walk distance test) will be assessed,
      along with overall knee wellness and joint-related symptoms using WOMAC, PGA, Knee Pain
      Rating Scale, and rescue medication usage. Safety will be assessed by collecting adverse
      events (AEs) and clinical laboratory data.

             information of the study investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             depression requiring medication, chronic anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive
             disorder, or active eating disorders including anorexia nervosa or bulimia)

          -  subjects with a history of seizures in the last 5 years or dizziness when exercising

             distance test.
