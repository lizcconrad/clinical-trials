  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to obtain an assessment (efficacy, safety, and patient reported
      outcomes) of basal bolus insulin delivery with PaQ in insulin-using patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, post-market observational study to assess the efficacy,
      safety, and patient reported outcomes of insulin delivery with PaQ® in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are currently receiving basal/bolus insulin therapy with or
      without oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) for glycemic control. The patient's participation in
      the study is comprised of three phases: screening/baseline evaluation, transition to PaQ use
      and optimization, and PaQ treatment period. The use of these phases will allow an orderly
      transition to PaQ treatment as well as a reliable construct from which to interpret the final
      data.

    <intervention_name>PaQ® Insulin Delivery Device</intervention_name>
    <description>PaQ is a 3 day insulin delivery device. Utilizes U 100 rapid-acting insulin. Provides basal insulin at preset basal doses and bolus insulin (in 2 unit increments) with a push of a button.</description>

        Twenty five (25) individuals with T2DM who have an A1C of 7.0% to 11.0%, inclusive, at
        Screening (Visit 1) will be recruited at one investigative site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is at least 18 years of age

          -  Has a clinical diagnosis of T2DM, as determined by clinical history and medication
             usage

          -  Has an A1C ≥ 7.0% and ≤ 11.0%;

          -  Is treated with basal-bolus insulin therapy (at least 2 injections per day) with or
             without OADs, and/or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist for at least 3 months and
             has not had a change (addition or discontinuation of existing drug or change in dose)
             in their OADs for the last 8 weeks

          -  Determined by the investigator that insulin requirements to achieve glycemic targets
             can be met by the insulin capacity of the PaQ device
