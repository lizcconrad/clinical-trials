      UltraShape® Contour I V3 system is a non-invasive (not breaking the skin) focused ultrasound
      for body contouring purposesdesigned to selectively disrupt sub-dermal fat cells employing
      focused ultrasound. All other types of tissue, such as blood vessels, muscles and peripheral
      nerves, remain intact. There are no thermal effects. Fat-cell destruction is achieved by
      ultrasound-induced mechanical effects during a very short exposure time.

      VelaShape is a non-invasive device for Body Reshaping and Cellulite Treatment. VelaShape
      combines controlled infrared (IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies
      with mechanical manipulation.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial is the statistical difference in circumference reduction between Control (baseline measurement, Vist 2 / Day 0) and two points of follow-up measurement: 2 weeks (Visit 5 / Day 42) and 12 weeks (Visit 8 / Day 112) following the last Tx session. The following procedure will be used to compute the Circumference Difference primary endpoint:</description>
