      <desc>The study was crossover using 2 types of injection methods per participant, without a wash-out period between injection types. It was not possible to relate an adverse event (AE) to a specific injection method. Hence, per protocol, AEs were summarized for all participants who received at least 1 dose of golimumab, regardless of injection type.</desc>
