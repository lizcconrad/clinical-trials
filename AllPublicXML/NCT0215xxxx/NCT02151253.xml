    <description>Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is measure of subjective sleepiness. Tendency to fall asleep in 8 situations. Total varies from zero to 24. A ESS of 10 or less is considered normal. Change is calculated as value at baseline minus value at week 4.</description>

    <description>During double-blind treatment subjects took armodafinil for 4 weeks before crossing over to placebo for 4 weeks. Pill is taken once daily, before 8 am.
Armodafinil/placebo was initiated at a dose of 50 mg (1 tablet) and titrated to 150 mg after 1 week on the basis of the investigator's and patient's perception of efficacy and side-effects. After two weeks the medication could be increased to 250 mg or reduced back to 50 mg based on the investigator's and patient's perception of efficacy/side-effects. No increases in dosage were allowed after week 2. The dosage was decreased at a week 3 phone call if indicated on the basis of side-effects.</description>
