      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that Lotrafilcon B AIR OPTIX® AQUA sphere
      modified design lenses are noninferior to Lotrafilcon B AIR OPTIX® AQUA in overall lens fit
      by comparing the percent of subjects satisfying the &quot;no re-fit&quot; criteria in each treatment
      group.

    <description>With the contact lens on eye, the investigator assessed the lens fit immediately post-blink and following lower lid margin push-up with the lower lid using a 5-point scale, where -2 = Unacceptably tight (reduced movement, unacceptable), -1 = Acceptably tight (reduced movement, acceptable), 0 = Optimal fit / movement, +1 = Acceptably loose (excessive movement, acceptable), and +2 = Unacceptably loose (excessive movement, unacceptable). To meet the definition of &quot;no re-fit,&quot; an eye had to have an acceptable or optimal overall lens fit with the study lens, as well as be within 1 grade of the overall lens fit assessed with the habitual lens at baseline. Proportion of subjects is reported as a percentage.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must sign an Informed Consent Document;

          -  Myopic, wear AIR OPTIX® AQUA lenses in the range of -1.00 to -5.00 diopters (D) in
             both eyes, and willing to comply with the wearing schedule;

          -  Manifest cylinder less than or equal to 0.75 D;

          -  Able to achieve best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/25 (Snellen) or better in
             each eye at distance;

          -  Able to achieve distance visual acuity of at least 20/40 in each eye with habitual and
             study lenses;

          -  Wearing spherical AIR OPTIX® AQUA lenses in both eyes for at least 3 months (at least
             8 hours per day, at least 5 days per week), wearing the habitual lenses for a minimum
             of 4 hours prior to the baseline study visit, and achieving an acceptable or optimal
             fit at baseline visit with habitual lenses in both eyes;

          -  Other protocol-defined criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current soft contact lens wearer who regularly sleeps in lenses (1 or more nights per
             week);

          -  Any anterior segment infection, inflammation, disease, or abnormality that
             contraindicates contact lens wear within 6 months prior to enrollment;

          -  Any use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated including any use of topical ocular medications that would require
             instillation during contact lens wear;

          -  History of herpetic keratitis;

          -  History of corneal or refractive surgery or irregular cornea;

          -  A pathologically dry eye that precludes contact lens wear;

          -  Monocular (only one eye with functional vision);

          -  Monovision correction;

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the test articles or
             associated materials;

          -  Concurrent participation in a contact lens or contact lens care product clinical trial
             or within the previous 30 days;

          -  Eye injury or ocular or intra-ocular surgery within 6 months prior to enrollment;

          -  Any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator,
             preclude safe administration of the study lenses or affect the results of this study;

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
