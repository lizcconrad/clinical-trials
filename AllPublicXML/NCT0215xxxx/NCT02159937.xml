    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate in vitro the potential of peptides, to modify,
      phenotypically and functionally, the monocyte-derived dendritic cells of patients with
      metastatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DCs will be generated in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) which will
      be obtained from 30 ml of peripheral blood collected from each patient with metastatic cancer
      by venipuncture in heparin tubes.

      The cellular viability, the expression of maturation biomarkers and the presence of several
      cytokines will be evaluated by flow cytometric assays after the culture period of DCs exposed
      to the peptides.

      An interim analysis is programmed with the first 10 patients. If an effect is demonstrated
      the study will include an additional number of subjects sufficient to ensure adequate
      comparison with other commercially available peptides.
