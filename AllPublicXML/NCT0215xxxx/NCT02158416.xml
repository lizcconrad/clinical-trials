      The planned minimal risk study is a blinded study on consecutive transfusable platelet
      products. The aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of platelet components sampled
      prior to transfusion.

      The primary patient transfusion outcome in this study is the 1-hour corrected count increment
      (1 hr CCI), which is a widely accepted clinical outcome measure. Platelet products will be
      sampled for ThromboLUX testing before being sent from the blood bank to the treatment center.
      After receipt at the treatment center, the platelet products will be used as per regular
      clinical practice, and the outcome data from each patient will be collected. At the end of
      the study, TLX Scores will be compared to the transfusion outcomes to determine if a low TLX
      Score is associated with a poor transfusion outcome.

      During the course of the study, the TLX Score will not be known to the clinicians, or
      utilized in any way to decide if the platelet product should be transfused.
