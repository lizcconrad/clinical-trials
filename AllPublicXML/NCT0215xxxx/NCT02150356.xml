  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very few studies have evaluated the effect of aleurone-enriched grains on cardiovascular risk
      factors. Price et al.(2010) have shown that 4-week supplementation of aleurone-enriched
      products (27 g/day of aleurone) increased betaine concentration in plasma whereas reduced
      homocysteine and LDL-cholesterol levels. Interestingly, aleurone had no effect on total
      antioxidant status or endothelial function, whereas an improvement of C-reactive protein was
      observed (Price RK et al, 2012). It is not known whether consumption of more than 27g/day of
      aleurone-enriched products with higher ferulic acid biodisponibility and longer time of
      treatment could influence these parameters in individuals with metabolic syndrome.
      Noteworthy, no studies have investigated the effect of aleurone-enriched products on fasting
      and postprandial glycemic homeostasis and lipid metabolism. In addition, mechanisms by which
      aleurone may act in vivo are still unknown.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether 8 weeks supplementation with
      aleurone-enriched products may influence glucose and lipid metabolism, incretin hormones
      levels, satiety, inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial function in overweight/obese
      subjects with high cardiovascular risk.
