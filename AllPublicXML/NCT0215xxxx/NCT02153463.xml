  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tics are brief repetitive movements or vocalizations. Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (TS)
      is a disorder characterized by recurrent motor and vocal tics. Tourette syndrome and tic
      disorders affect up to 8% of children. Peak severity of tic disorders occurs between the ages
      of 8 to 12 years, therefore during childhood and adolescence the most significant impacts are
      felt. The quality of life of young people with tics is lower than their peers' and tic
      severity predicts lower quality of life. Studies have also shown negative social perception
      toward children with tics.

      Approximately 50% of patients with Tourette syndrome will have other diagnoses including
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder, anxiety and
      depression. Studies have shown improvements in ADHD with physical activity. ADHD and tic
      disorders are thought to involve the same areas of the brain; thus it is possible that tics
      might also improve with physical activity. However, no studies to date have examined this.
      The investigators predict that by implementing a motivational physical activity program, in
      conjunction with physical activity counseling, the investigators will be able to increase
      levels of physical activity in children with tics and Tourette syndrome, with a positive
      impact on tic severity.
