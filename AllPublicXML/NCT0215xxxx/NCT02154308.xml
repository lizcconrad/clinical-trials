  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of IL-YANG Inactivated
      Split Influenza Vaccine (IL-YANG FLU Vaccine Prefilled Syringe INJ.) administered as a single
      intramuscular injection.

      This is a multicenter, open-label study. Subjects who have provided written informed consent
      will undergo the protocol-specific assessments to determine their eligibility for the study.
      Subjects considered eligible will be assigned to an appropriate age stratum, and will be
      given a single dose of the study vaccine. For each age stratum, the first 142 subjects
      enrolled will be evaluated for both immunogenicity and safety, and the remaining subjects
      subsequently enrolled will be evaluated only for the safety of the study vaccine.

        1. Group A: healthy adults 18 to &lt; 65 years of age

        2. Group B: healthy adults ≥ 65 years of age

      The investigator will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the study vaccine throughout
      the study. The immunogenicity assessment will be performed at Visit 1 (pre-vaccination) and
      at the End-of-Study Visit. For safety measurements, subjects will be instructed to record any
      adverse events occurring after vaccination in the Patient Diary card.

      Subjects who are assigned for the both immunogenicity and safety assessment will have their
      blood sample drawn for antibody titer (immunogenicity) testing, and afterward, receive 0.5 mL
      of the study vaccine by intramuscular injection at deltoid muscle. Subjects will return to
      the clinic for follow-up visit 4 to 5 weeks after the vaccination, and undergo another blood
      sampling for antibody titer test. The long-term safety for up to 6 months after vaccination
      will be also evaluated. Subjects who are assigned for only safety assessments will not
      undergo blood sampling, but have the same visit schedule as those assigned for the both
      immunogenicity and safety assessments.
