      The HeartMate PHP is a catheter-based pump designed to provide partial left heart circulatory
      support. The study will assess the safety and performance of the HeartMate PHP in supporting
      patients who are hemodynamically unstable, or at risk of being hemodynamically unstable,
      while undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), such as coronary stent placement.

    <textblock>
      The HeartMate PHP (percutaneous heart pump) is a catheter-based axial flow pump designed to
      provide partial left ventricular circulatory support. The primary objective of this
      prospective, nonrandomized, multi-center, open-label trial is to assess the safety and
      performance of the HeartMate PHP in supporting patients who are hemodynamically unstable, or
      at risk of being hemodynamically unstable, while undergoing percutaneous coronary
      interventions (PCI).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Patient presents with a non-emergent need for complex PCI with:

               1. an ejection fraction of ≤35% requiring hemodynamic support during the procedure,
                  AND

               2. the heart team has determined that the patient is not an optimal surgical
                  candidate, OR the patient elects not to undergo surgery

          -  Written, signed, and dated informed consent
