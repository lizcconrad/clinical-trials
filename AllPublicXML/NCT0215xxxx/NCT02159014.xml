  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity improves physical and mental health and reduces the risk of heart
      disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, obesity and premature death from any cause. Unfortunately
      the majority of adults are not active enough to reap these benefits. People who are inactive
      and at high risk of stroke, heart disease, diabetes and dementia, and who may benefit from
      increased activity can be identified in primary care by combining standard risk tools. These
      high risk patients can be offered physical activity programmes that are designed to increase
      longterm adherence. Aerobic dance is an activity that combines physical, social and cognitive
      stimulation and allows easily adjusted intensity levels to meet individual needs. Engagement
      in an activity program also provides opportunities to offer advice on healthy nutrition and
      associated meal preparation skills. Information technology can be used to increase activity
      participation. Video materials can be produced to guide activity participation at home,
      thereby increasing overall activity participation. The investigators propose a feasibility
      study of a multimodal dance-based physical activity and nutrition intervention aimed at
      patients at high risk of stroke, heart disease, diabetes and dementia, in primary care
      settings.

      Regular physical activity improves physical and mental health and reduces the risk of heart
      disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, dementia, obesity and premature death from any cause
      (Department of Health &amp; Prevention., 2004). Unfortunately the majority of adults are not
      active enough to reap these benefits (Chaudhury &amp; Roth, 2006). Specific psychological
      techniques can be used to overcome the known barriers to increased activity. People who are
      inactive can be identified in primary care through the use of standard risk tools. Similarly,
      standard risk tools can identify people at high risk of stroke, heart disease and diabetes,
      and people at risk from dementia are identified by a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment.
      Combining these clinical indicators can identify people who are inactive and at highest risk
      who may therefore benefit most from activity interventions. These high risk patients can be
      offered physical activity programmes that are designed to increase longterm adherence.
      Aerobic dance is an activity that combines physical, social and cognitive stimulation and
      allows easily adjusted intensity levels to meet individual needs. Engagement in an activity
      program also provides opportunities to offer advice on healthy nutrition and associated meal
      preparation skills. Information technology can be used to increase activity participation.
      Video materials can be produced to guide activity participation at home, thereby increasing
      overall activity participation.

      TRIAL DESIGN The investigators plan a longitudinal study where participants will be followed
      up for a total of 24 weeks. Outcome measures will be collected at three time points that
      separates two phases. Phase 1 consists of the group based weekly intervention plus access to
      online material and Phase 2 consists of only access to the online material. The time points
      are: baseline (Time 0), 12 weeks post intervention (Time 1) and 24 weeks post intervention
      (Time 2). Outcomes measured at time 1 will be used to determine the effects of Phase 1
      immediately following participation, and measure at 24 weeks (Time 2) to determine the
      outcomes 12 weeks after the end of the group based intervention intervention and therefore
      the longer term effects with support from online material only. Participants will therefore
      serve as their own controls during Phase 2 for comparison with Phase 1. In other words the
      investigators will compare the results for each participant following Phase 1 with their
      results following Phase 2 to determine the effects of removing the group facilitation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients identified as Inactive/Moderately Inactive on the GPPAQ and at
             high risk due the presence of one or more of the following additional risk factors:

               -  20% or higher 10 year risk of stroke or heart attack by using QRISK2 for stroke
                  (Hippisley-Cox, Coupland, Vinogradova, et al, 2008).

               -  20% or higher 10-year risk of type 2 diabetes on the QDS measure (Hippisley-Cox,
                  Coupland, Robson, et al, 2009).

               -  Diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment from a memory clinic.

               -  Diagnosed transient ischaemic cardiac or cerebral event (stable ischaemic heart
                  disease, transient ischaemic attack).

          2. Aged 17 years or older.

          3. At low risk from serious adverse effects from increased physical activity as indicated
             by performance on the revised Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire
             (PAR-Q)(Thomas, Reading &amp; Shephard, 1992).

          4. Participants should have a suitable exercise space available at home for safe
             participation in the online component.

          5. Participants with access to the internet at home, and where it has been determined
             following a home visit by the research team that they can access the online material
             and safely participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Blood pressure above 160/100 mmHg.

          2. Body mass index over 40 kg/m2.

          3. Musculoskeletal or other medical problems preventing safe participation in regular
             moderate intensity exercise (65-77% of predicted maximum heart rate). This will
             include a resting tachycardia (heart rate above 100 bpm) and history of myocardial
             infarction, unstable angina or transient cerebral ischemia within the last month,
             severe osteoporosis, uncontrolled diabetes, febrile illness and destabilising
             arrythmias.

          4. Participants with modifiable exclusion criteria will be reconsidered after successful
             management. Patients will be referred for medical /cardiological review and management
             prior to commencing exercise if indicated by the PAR-Q and the intervention will be
             guided by the PARmed-X (Chisholm, Stewart &amp; Crooks, 1987).

          5. Participants taking medications affecting heart rate will need to be on a stable
             dosing regimen for 3 months prior to commencing in order to control for potential
             spurious results on fitness measures caused by these treatments.

          6. Participants who do not have the necessary space, internet connection or computer
             equipment to allow them to participate safely using the online material.
