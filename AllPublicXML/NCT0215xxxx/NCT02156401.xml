  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) with its two clinical manifestations deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
      and pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening disease that is associated with
      considerable morbidity and mortality. The incidence of VTE increases with age and it - as the
      third most common cardiovascular disease after ischemic heart disease and stroke - represents
      an important public health problem in industrialized countries with several aspects in need
      to be addressed.

      VTEval Project includes three long-term prospective observational studies to evaluate and
      improve VTE diagnostics and management, treatment and outcome. The aims of the project
      include a systematic assessment of VTE, i.e. disease status (symptoms, clinical and
      subclinical aspects) and risk profiles (classic, psychosocial and environmental factors),
      using a system-oriented approach. VTEval collects three large prospective cohorts of patients
      with suspected and incident VTE consisting of individuals with a clinical suspicion of acute
      PE, individuals with a clinical suspicion of acute DVT, and individuals with incidental
      diagnosis of VTE).

      The standardized and harmonized data acquisition of the study establishes a sustainable
      resource for comprehensive research on VTE, thus providing the basis for both short- and
      long-term analysis.
