  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at the effects of a protocolized music therapy intervention on state anxiety
      for patients with cancer undergoing simulation for radiation therapy. Simulation, which is an
      imaging and diagnostic procedure, has been identified as producing significantly high levels
      of anxiety in many cancer patients.
