  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few years, studies have shown that men with type 2 diabetes sometimes develop a
      condition called hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH). People with this condition produce
      little or no sex hormones. Obesity and metabolic syndrome are also associated with HH.
      Research suggests that insulin in the brain may benefit the glands that release these
      hormones. During this study, subjects will spray a small amount of insulin into their
      nose.This will increase insulin concentrations in the brain. The purpose of this study is to
      find out the effect of one dose of intranasal insulin on release of LH (a sex hormone) in
      obese diabetic men with HH.

      Studies over the last few years have clearly established that at least 25% of men with type 2
      diabetes have subnormal free testosterone (T) concentrations in association with
      inappropriately low leutinizing homromone (LH) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone)
      concentrations. These patients thus suffer from hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH). Obesity
      and metabolic syndrome are also associated with HH. Animal studies and in vitro data have
      shown that insulin action and insulin responsiveness in the brain are necessary for the
      maintenance of the functional integrity of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-gonadal axis. Insulin
      concentrations can be increased in the brain by delivering insulin intranasally with vianase
      device. The aim of this project is to study the effect of one dose of intranasal insulin on
      release of LH in obese diabetic men with HH. 15 obese men with type 2 diabetes and low free T
      along with normal LH concentrations will be recruited for the study. The study will be
      carried out at the clinical center of Texas Tech (Odessa campus). There will be two study
      visits, each comprising of blood tests every 15 minutes over 6 hours. 40 IU of intranasal
      insulin or saline will be given after a baseline period of blood sampling of 2 hours.
      Student's t-test will be used to compare the change in LH concentrations after intranasal
      saline or insulin.
