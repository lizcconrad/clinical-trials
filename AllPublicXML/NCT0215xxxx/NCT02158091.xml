  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a new drug called IPI-145 in combination with the standard
      drugs fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR), as a possible treatment for chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive IPI-145
      in combination with the standard drugs fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR).
      After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:

      Phase I

      The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs that can
      be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have
      CLL. Not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the
      study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled
      in the study prior and how well the dose was tolerated.

      Phase II:

      Patients treated with IPI-145 at the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) + fludarabine,
      cyclophosphamide, rituximab (FCR) with standard dosing.

    <description>Phase I-Dose escalation will occur using a standard 3-3 dose escalation beginning in dose level 1 with dose cohorts and escalation.
Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (except cycle 1, which is 35 days) during which time IPI-145 will be taken twice daily. The study begins with 1 week of IPI-145 monotherapy.
Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (iFCR) - FCR will subsequently be introduced after 1 week and administered at standard dosing for up to 6 cycles, with dose reductions permitted. IPI-145 will be continued through the course of chemotherapy and for up to 2 years maintenance after completing chemotherapy Phase II - 20 additional patients treated with IPI-145 at the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) + fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab (FCR) with standard dosing.</description>
