  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overdose with potential deadly outcome is a serious problem among opioid abusers, not least
      in Norway. The annual death toll from overdose is about 250, twice the annual death toll from
      traffic accidents. Those who inject heroin or other opioids are considered to have the
      highest risk for death from overdose. To save lives, immediate treatment with a Î¼-opioid
      antidote such as naloxone is required. Usually naloxone is injected into a muscle or a blood
      vessel. Administration of naloxone via the nose has been suggested as an alternative for use
      by emergency teams and possibly also bystanders. This is not only an easier way to give
      naloxone, but would also eliminate the risk for needle stick injuries and blood
      contamination. A pilot study in this hospital has shown no significant side effects or
      adverse reaction. While significant benefits are expected from developing an adequately
      formulated naloxone nasal spray for pre-hospital use, the risks to participants are minimal.
      Therefore this preclinical study in healthy volunteers will be undertaken.

    <description>A LCMSMS method for determination of Naloxone in serum was developed using acetonitrile protein precipitation. Naloxone D5 was used as internal standard and quantitative determination was done by using Sciex Analyst version 1.5. The method is fully validated by assessing linearity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity/selectivity, in process and storage stability, dilution integrity and assay ruggedness according to Dadgar (1995) and Shah (1991). The method was found linear, accurate and precise across the dynamic range of 0.05 to 45 ng/ml. Limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.05ng/ml with CV = 12.7% and inaccuracy &lt; 7.8% (n = 17). Quality Controls (QC) in middle (n=18) and upper (n=18) calibration range had CV &lt; 4.2% and inaccuracy &lt;8.2 %</description>
