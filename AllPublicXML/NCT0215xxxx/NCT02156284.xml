  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective was to compare the frequency and intensity of symptoms of fear in patients of
      preoperative cardiac surgery who received empathic behaviour from nurse or those who received
      no specific type of empathic behaviour. This is a randomized clinical trial. The sample
      consisted of 44 patients in preoperative of cardiac surgery, who were divided in two groups:
      empathic behaviour by nurses and without specific empathic behaviour. Fear was assessed at
      two time points: before and after the intervention. The instrument used was developed and
      validated, comprising 15 defining characteristics of the nursing diagnosis fear. The
      hypothesis is that the group who received empathic behaviour from nurse will reduce the
      anxiety.

      Primary outcome is fear. Fear was assessed by a nurse using of an instrument developed and
      validated previous, based on 15 defining characteristics described by North American Nursing
      Diagnosis Association for the nursing diagnosis fear: apprehension, increased tension,
      exciting, nervousness, verbalization of fear (expressed concern), increased pulse, nausea,
      vomiting, fatigue, abnormal respiratory rate, increased perspiration, dry mouth, fear of
      death (reported), crying and impaired bowel motility.

      Patients were evaluated for the presence and absence of these fear symptoms through scores: 0
      (no symptom) and 1 (presence of symptom). For analysis of the results was carried out the sum
      of the scores of each symptom, ranging from 0 to 15, with the higher the score, the greater
      was the fear symptoms presented by the patient.
