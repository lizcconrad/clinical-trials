  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a common inflammatory response to infection characterized by hypovolemia and
      vasodilation for which early administration of intravenous fluids has been suggested to
      improve outcomes. The ideal fluid balance following initial resuscitation is unclear. Septic
      patients treated in the intensive care unit commonly receive significant volumes of
      intravenous fluids with resultant positive fluid balance for up to a week after their initial
      resuscitation. Observational studies have associated fluid receipt and positive fluid balance
      in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock with increased mortality but are inherently
      limited by indication bias. In order to determine the optimal approach to fluid management
      following resuscitation in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, a randomized
      controlled trial is needed. The primary hypothesis of this study is that, compared to usual
      care, a conservative approach to fluid management after resuscitation in patients with sepsis
      and cardiopulmonary dysfunction will increase intensive care unit free days.
