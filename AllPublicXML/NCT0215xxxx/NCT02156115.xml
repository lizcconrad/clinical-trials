      Background:

      - Lymphatics are a type of vessel, similar to arteries and veins. Lymphatic disorders happen
      when these vessels don t work properly. Researchers want to look for a relationship between
      lymphatic disorders and variations of certain genes found in the lung, blood, and other
      places in the body.

      Objective:

      - To learn more about lymphatic disorders and evaluate how genetic factors affect lymphatic
      disorders.

      Eligibility:

        -  People ages 2 90 who have a lymphatic disorder or relatives of people with lymphatic
           disorders.

        -  Healthy volunteers 18 and older.

      Design:

        -  Participants may have 1 2 visits a year, or more as needed. The study is expected to
           last 5 years. Visits may last 1 5 days. Participants may have lab tests, medical
           history, and physical exam at each visit.

        -  Participants may have blood testing that includes genetics tests, and urine tests. They
           may have nose and throat cultures, saliva collection, and cheek swabs to collect
           samples.

        -  Participants may have a skin biopsy and have blood taken from an artery.

        -  Participants may have breathing tests and be studied while exercising.

        -  Participants may have an electrocardiogram. Electrodes will be placed on their chest,
           tracing heart rhythms. They may also have chest X-rays.

        -  Participants may have a bronchoscopy. A thin, flexible instrument will be passed through
           the nose or mouth, into the lung. A tissue sample will be taken.

        -  Participants who have lymphatic disease or have a relative with it may also have:

        -  CT scans. They will lie on a table and hold their breath while their chest is scanned.

        -  MRI. They will lie flat on a table that slides in and out of a scanner.

        -  ultrasound. A probe is rolled around outside the abdomen.

        -  removal of fluid around the lungs, chest, and abdomen.

      Disorders of lymphatic function are associated with multiple presentations, the most common
      of which is lymphedema, a chronic swelling of the extremities, due to impaired lymphatic
      drainage. It can cause disability and a predisposition to infection and chronic ulceration.
      Other lymphatic disorders present with visceral manifestations such as regional or systemic
      lymphangiomatosis, pulmonary and intestinal lymphangiectasia, protein-losing enteropathy,
      chylous ascites, and chylothorax. Abnormalities of smooth muscle cell proliferation are
      associated with lymphangiomatosis. Proliferation of a neoplastic cell, the LAM cell, which
      exhibits a smooth muscle cell phenotype, is associated with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
      Currently, treatment for many of these disorders is symptomatic and the prognosis is
      variable.

      The molecular mechanisms of lymphatic vasculogenesis are incompletely understood, but
      critical genes have been described, and mutations in these genes may lead to developmental
      abnormalities. There may be a genetic predisposition to lymphatic disorders, with a role for
      modifier genes in disease progression. The purpose of this study is to (a) define the natural
      history of lymphatic diseases, (b) characterize the clinical phenotypes, and (Copyright)
      elucidate their pathogenesis at the physiological, cellular and molecular levels. This
      protocol is part of a Trans-Institute basic, translational and clinical initiative in
      lymphatic disorders and will include participation of principal investigators across the NIH,
      as well as extramural investigators.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Patients 2 years of age or older with clinical or histological evidence for a
                  lymphatic abnormality; patients will in the vast majority of cases be referred
                  with the diagnosis of a lymphatic disorder.

               2. Patients 2 years of age or older with findings on physical examination consistent
                  with the diagnosis of a lymphatic abnormality.

               3. Relatives of patients with lymphatic disorders, 2 years of age or older.

               4. Healthy research volunteers 18 years of age or older as control subjects.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Patients who are less than 2 years of age. Research volunteers less than 18 years of
             age. Age greater than 90 years old.

          2. Advanced stage of any systemic illness.

             contraindication to the procedure; (3) allergy to topical anesthetic (e. g.,
             lidocaine); (4) current or recent respiratory infection (within the last 4 weeks); (5)

             if it is believed to increase risk; (3) are pregnant; (4) have had radiation to the

             unable to tolerate preparation for the procedure; (8) are unable to give consent; (9)
