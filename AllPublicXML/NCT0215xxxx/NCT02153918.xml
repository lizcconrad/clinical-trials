  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some men with prostate cancer have their prostate glands removed. The cancer can still come
      back. Researchers want to know if receiving a vaccine before prostate removal surgery can
      lead to less recurrence.

      Objective:

      - To see if a vaccine and booster shots given to men with prostate cancer before surgery
      changes the immune cells in the prostate gland.

      Eligibility:

      - Men age 18 and older who have prostate cancer that has not spread, and who want to have
      their prostate glands removed as treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened by their regular cancer care. They may have a small piece
           of prostate removed.

        -  Participants must practice effective birth control before and during the study treatment
           and for 1 month after the last vaccine booster.

        -  Participants will have a medical history, physical exam, and blood and liver tests. They
           will be asked about how they perform daily activities.

        -  Participants will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate. The
           scanner is a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table
           that slides in and out of the scanner.

        -  Participants will be injected with the vaccine, most likely in the leg. They will be
           injected with the vaccine booster 3 times over several weeks.

        -  At each booster visit, participants will have a medical history, physical exam, and
           blood and liver tests.

        -  Participants will have another MRI. Then they will have surgery to remove their
           prostate.

        -  Participants will have 2 follow-up visits during the year after surgery. They will have
           a medical history, physical exam, and blood test.

      Background

        -  Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is the most common cancer diagnosis in American males and
           follows lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer death.

        -  Vaccine strategies represent a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment for prostate
           cancer. One potential target for a prostate cancer vaccine is PSA, due to its restricted
           expression on prostate cancer and normal prostatic epithelial cells.

        -  A neoadjuvant approach may be of potential benefit providing prolonged protection via
           the patient s immune system against future recurrence.

        -  PROSTVAC is a vaccine that induces strong immune responses, has shown promising evidence
           of activity in a randomized phase II study (8.5 month improvement in median overall
           survival) and is currently in phase III clinical testing.

        -  This vaccine has been tested in locally recurrent prostate cancer with substantial
           inflammatory infiltrates within the prostate seen following subcutaneous and
           intraprostatic injection.

      Objectives

      -The primary objective is to evaluate the post vaccine immunologic CD4 and CD8 cell
      infiltrate response of a neoadjuvant vaccine strategy in prostatectomy specimens in patients
      who plan to undergo radical prostatectomy.

      Eligibility

        -  Patients must have biopsy proven prostate cancer and are surgical candidates for radical
           prostatectomy

        -  Must be of sufficient good health to be surgical candidates for radical prostatectomy
           and have elected radical prostatectomy for management of their prostate cancer

        -  Granulocyte count is greater than or equal to 1,500/mm3, Platelet is greater than or
           equal to 50,000/mm3, Hgb is greater than or equal to 8 g/dL, Bilirubin &lt; 1.5mg/dL, AST
           and ALT &lt; 2.5xULN, Creatinine is less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN

        -  Pre-intervention biopsy tissue must be available either from outside institution or
           repeat biopsy

      Design

        -  This study will utilize rV-PSA(L155)-TRICOM (PROSTVAC-V) as a priming vaccination
           followed by monthly boosting with rF-PSA (L155)-TRICOM (PROSTVAC-F) for 3 months.

        -  Patients will undergo radical prostatectomy after 4 months of treatment with
           PROSTVAC-V/F.

        -  The maximum accrual to the trial will be 27 patients.

          9. Patients must be willing to travel to the study site for follow-up visits.

         10. Patients must be greater or equal to18 years of age.

         11. All patients who have received prior vaccination with vaccinia virus (for smallpox

         12. Patients must understand and sign informed consent that explains the neoplastic nature
             of their disease, the procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the
             treatment, alternative treatments, potential risks and toxicities, and the voluntary

             and for up to one month after the last vaccination.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Prior splenectomy.

          2. The recombinant vaccinia vaccine should not be administered if the following apply
             toeither recipients or, for at least 3 weeks after vaccination, their close household

               -  Patients should have no evidence, as listed below, of being immunocompromised:
