  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological cancer and the 5th leading cause of cancer
      death in women. Most patients are typically diagnosed with advanced-stage disease.
      Platinum-paclitaxel regimen has been widely adopted as a standard first-line treatment for
      advanced ovarian cancer. Multiple collaborative randomised phase III trials evaluating the
      addition of a third chemotherapy agent, maintenance therapy or alternative taxanes failed to
      demonstrate significant improvements over a standard carboplatin/taxane doublet.

      Decitabine (DAC), one major DNA demethylating agent, has been approved for treatment of
      preleukemic hematological disease myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by the Food and Drug
      Administration. Past trials of these with high doses, i.e., the use of maximal tolerated
      dose, for patients with solid tumors showed a low therapeutic index, due to extreme
      toxicities that have probably confounded the ability to document the true clinical response.

      Low dose DNA demethylation agent decitabine (DAC) can resensitize the therapeutic indexes of
      resistent ovary cancer cells in vivo and in vitro.

      The investigators hypothesized that DAC-triggered epigenetic reprogramming of tumor cells and
      possible immune cells could induce pronounced long-dated clinical effect by
      chemosensitization- and immunopotentiation-driven maximal eradicating roles on the
      minimal/residual lesions in primary patients with poor prognosis.

      Given the poor prognosis and the currently existed therapeutic strategies, The investigators
      will perform a prospective, randomized, phase II to III, intergroup trial to compare
      carboplatin plus paclitaxel (TC) with the DAC-primed TC (DTC) regimen in previously untreated
      patients with stage II to IV ovarian cancer.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this trial was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of the first occurrence of any of the following events: appearance of any new lesions that could be measured or assessed clinically; or CA125 criteria of disease progression. For patients with measurable disease, clinical or radiographical tumour measurements had priority over CA125 levels, and progression during treatment could not be declared on the basis of CA125 alone.</description>

    <description>Overall survival (OS), defined as the time from random assignment to death as a result of any cause, response rate, and adverse events.response to treatment, toxicity, and quality of life.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate in DTC treated advanced ovary cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor measurements were made before each cycle by physical examination, before every third cycle by imaging methods in patients with measurable or evaluable disease, and after the last cycle. The same tumor assessment methods that were employed for baseline measurement were used for each repeat evaluation. Tumor response was graded according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>

    <measure>Toxicity in DTC treated advanced ovary cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events and toxicities were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NIC-CTC). Toxicities were recorded continuously; blood chemistry parameters were measured before each treatment cycle and weekly thereafter.Quality of life was assessed with the use of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OV28 questionnaires.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetics of lower-dose decitabine</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after the first and fifth dose of decitabine. Plasma samples were stored and processed and further analyzed utilizing liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.
Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) or area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) will be obtained from more than 10 patients treated at a decitabine dose level of 7mg/m2/d.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacodynamics of lower-dose decitabine</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the pharmacodynamics of decitabine and to establish its relationship to clinical PFS, before and after decitabine treatment, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and/or tumor samples will be harvested for measurement of the expression and methylation profile including genes such as MLH1, RASSF1A, HOXA10, and HOXA11 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and methylation-sensitive PCR analyses.</description>
