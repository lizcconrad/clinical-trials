    <textblock>
      A lot of data show that therapeutic education is beneficial for diabetic patients. In the
      French jails, there are very few programs of therapeutic education while this population is
      usually precarious with no access at care sector before the jail.

      The purpose of this study is to determinate if the therapeutic education of the diabetic
      patients is possible in the Paris jail &quot;La Santé&quot;.

    <textblock>
      The Paris jail &quot;La Santé&quot; welcomes 600 men who stay 5 month on average. Each year, there are
      between 30 to 40 diabetic patients. In the jail there's a sanitary unit who is a unit of
      internal medicine of Cochin hospital. This unit includes nurses, pharmacists and medical
      doctors.

      We propose to include in this study all diabetic patients (type 1 and 2) with the realization
      of a consultation of educational diagnosis, followed by the participation for every patient
      to 4 educational collective workshops therapeutic (knowledge of the disease, food, physical
      Activity and care of feet, the therapeutics)
