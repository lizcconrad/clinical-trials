      This study is designed to assess whether a live attenuated Influenza vaccine (LAIV) can
      induce a long-lasting immune memory by comparing the immunologic response to two doses of the
      OrniFlu® inactivated vaccine given to subjects previously primed with LAIV and subjects who
      did not received LAIV.

    <textblock>
      This is a an open-label study to evaluate immunogenic activity of the OrniFlu® inactivated
      influenza vaccine which will be given to healthy adult volunteers who participated in a
      double blind placebo-controlled study in protocol LAIV H5N2-01 at the Institute of Influenza
      in September-October 2012.
