  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is a common symptom encountered frequently by medical practitioners. The differential
      diagnosis for a patient with such a symptom is broad and time consuming, while immediate
      management for distressed patients is what is desired. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a relatively
      new technique that will help physicians more accurately diagnose and manage patients who
      present with dyspnea.

      Focused medical ultrasonography education is becoming integrated into many physician
      residency training programs. Recent studies indicate a possible relationship between focused
      ultrasonography training in medical school curricula and improved physical examination
      accuracy. Thus, a short-term training program in LUS during medical school will have a major
      impact on physicians to be comfortable in using this skill when dealing with distressed
      patients in their prospective residency training. It will reduce educational burdens for
      physician residency programs and improve overall physician competency.

      Simulation-based medical education (SBME) is ideally suited for offering effective training
      in a zero-risk environment. It enables trainees to gain knowledge and confidence in dealing
      with stressful clinical scenarios without exposing patients to any additional risk. SBME has
      also been shown to be a reliable tool for assessing learners' procedural skills and for
      teaching topics such as teamwork and communication.

      The investigators hypothesize that simulation-based training of medical students will enable
      them to more effectively evaluate patients with shortness of breath using LUS.

    <measure>Assess the pre and post-performance of medical students in using lung ultrasound (LUS) for patients with shortness of breath.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We designed the Thoracic Ultrasound Knowledge and Skills-Assessment Test (TUKSAT) which consists of questions about correctly identifying different organs using ultrasound (US) as well image acquisition skills as an objective measurement for students.
Study participants will receive simulation-based LUS training through a course provided by a physician experienced in LUS as two sessions at the first week of their medical clerkship. TUKSAT as a pre-evaluation measure will be given.
During the next 7 weeks, participants will be asked to see videos of LUS images where they will be asked to interpret the findings. A post-evaluation TUKSAT will then be given.</description>
