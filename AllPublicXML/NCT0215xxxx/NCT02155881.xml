      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Ciclesonide Nasal Spray
      200 microgram (mcg) once daily in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) in
      Russian participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ciclesonide. Ciclesonide is being tested to
      treat allergy symptoms in people who have SAR. This study will look at improvement of allergy
      symptoms in Russian participants who take ciclesonide nasal spray.

      The study will enroll approximately 80 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Ciclesonide nasal spray 200 mcg

        -  Placebo nasal spray (dummy inactive nasal spray) - this is a nasal spray that looks like
           the study drug but has no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take 2 actuations per nostril at the same time each day
      throughout the study, and will be asked to record the severity of their allergy symptoms
      twice a day in a diary.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Russia. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 5 weeks. Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic, and will be contacted
      by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline Over 2 Weeks in Participant-Reported Morning and Evening Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (TNSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 1 up to Week 2 (entire treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>The reflective TNSS is defined as the sum of the participant-rated reflective symptom scores for the 4 nasal symptoms of runny nose, itchy nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion over the past 12 hours. Each symptom was evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary, once in the morning (AM score) and after 12 hours in the evening (PM score) over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe (symptom hard to tolerate, interferes with daily activities/sleeping). TNSS score ranges from 0-12 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. The baseline value was defined as the average score over the Day -6 to Day 0. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average score recorded from Day 1 up to Day 14 minus the Baseline score.</description>

    <description>The reflective TOSS is defined as the sum of the participant-rated reflective symptom scores for 3 ocular symptoms of itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, and redness of eyes over the past 12 hours. Each symptom was evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary, once in the morning (AM score) and after 12 hours in the evening (PM score) over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe (symptom hard to tolerate, interferes with daily activities/sleeping). Reflective TOSS score ranges from 0-9 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and 9 representing severe symptoms. The baseline value was defined as the average score over the Day -6 to Day 0. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average score recorded from Day 1 up to Day 14 minus the Baseline score.</description>

    <description>The RQLQ is a 28-item, disease-specific quality of life questionnaire that measures the functional (physical, emotional, and social) problems troublesome to adults with allergies. The RQLQ has 28 questions in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotional). All 28 questions were evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a 7-point severity scale ranging from 0 to 6, where 0 = least severe to 6 = extremely severe. Overall total score was calculated by taking the mean of the response of all individual 28 questions. The baseline value was defined as the average score over the Day -6 to Day 0. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average score recorded from Day 1 up to Day 14 minus the Baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over 2 Weeks in Participant-Reported Morning and Evening Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (TNSS)</title>
        <description>The reflective TNSS is defined as the sum of the participant-rated reflective symptom scores for the 4 nasal symptoms of runny nose, itchy nose, sneezing, and nasal congestion over the past 12 hours. Each symptom was evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary, once in the morning (AM score) and after 12 hours in the evening (PM score) over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe (symptom hard to tolerate, interferes with daily activities/sleeping). TNSS score ranges from 0-12 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. The baseline value was defined as the average score over the Day -6 to Day 0. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average score recorded from Day 1 up to Day 14 minus the Baseline score.</description>

        <description>The reflective TOSS is defined as the sum of the participant-rated reflective symptom scores for 3 ocular symptoms of itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, and redness of eyes over the past 12 hours. Each symptom was evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary, once in the morning (AM score) and after 12 hours in the evening (PM score) over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe (symptom hard to tolerate, interferes with daily activities/sleeping). Reflective TOSS score ranges from 0-9 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and 9 representing severe symptoms. The baseline value was defined as the average score over the Day -6 to Day 0. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average score recorded from Day 1 up to Day 14 minus the Baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Over 2 Weeks in Participant-Reported Individual Morning and Evening Reflective Total Ocular Symptom Score</title>
        <description>The reflective TOSS is defined as the sum of the participant-rated reflective symptom scores for 3 ocular symptoms of itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, and redness of eyes over the past 12 hours. Each symptom was evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary, once in the morning (AM score) and after 12 hours in the evening (PM score) over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe (symptom hard to tolerate, interferes with daily activities/sleeping). Reflective TOSS score ranges from 0-9 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and 9 representing severe symptoms. The baseline value was defined as the average score over the Day -6 to Day 0. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average score recorded from Day 1 up to Day 14 minus the Baseline score.</description>

        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of double-blind study medication and who had 1 baseline and at least 1 post-baseline value. Missing data was imputed using LOCF.</population>

        <description>The RQLQ is a 28-item, disease-specific quality of life questionnaire that measures the functional (physical, emotional, and social) problems troublesome to adults with allergies. The RQLQ has 28 questions in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotional). All 28 questions were evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a 7-point severity scale ranging from 0 to 6, where 0 = least severe to 6 = extremely severe. Overall total score was calculated by taking the mean of the response of all individual 28 questions. The baseline value was defined as the average score over the Day -6 to Day 0. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average score recorded from Day 1 up to Day 14 minus the Baseline score.</description>

        <description>The RQLQ is a 28-item, disease-specific quality of life questionnaire that measures the functional (physical, emotional, and social) problems troublesome to adults with allergies. The RQLQ has 28 questions in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotional). All 28 questions were evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a 7-point severity scale ranging from 0 to 6, where 0 = least severe to 6 = extremely severe. Overall domain scores were calculated by taking the mean of the response of the relevant questions. The baseline value was defined as the average score over the Day -6 to Day 0. Change from Baseline was thus calculated as the 2-week average score recorded from Day 1 up to Day 14 minus the Baseline score.</description>
