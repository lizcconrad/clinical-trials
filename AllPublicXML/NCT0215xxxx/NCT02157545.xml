  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pyridostigmine is a medication that is used in certain heart rate and blood pressure
      conditions. This medication, as a side effect, is known to also cause changes in the junction
      between a nerve and muscle. The changes caused at the nerve muscle junction by pyridostigmine
      could alter the effect of muscle relaxants (a medication used during surgery and anesthesia).
      The investigators are conducting this study to see whether patients taking pyridostigmine are
      more or less sensitive to rocuronium (a muscle relaxing medication used during surgery).

    <measure>Dose of the muscle relaxant rocuronium that will lead to 50% decrease in the force of the evoked muscle contraction in patients taking pyridostigmine.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rocuronium used to produce muscle weakness or paralysis during surgery. Its potency is measured as ED50, the dose necessary to cause a 50% reduction in the force of evoked muscle contraction. We intend to determine this measure of potency (ED50 for rocuronium) in patients taking pyridostigmine and compare it with control subjects.</description>
