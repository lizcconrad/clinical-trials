      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of aclidinium bromide compared with placebo
      in improving dilatation of the airways (bronchodilation), symptoms of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep quality and physical activity after 3 weeks of treatment with
      aclidinium bromide 400 μg administered twice daily in patients with stable
      moderate-and-severe COPD.

    <description>Night-time and early-morning symptoms were recorded every morning using the Early-Morning Symptoms of COPD Instrument [EMSCI] and the Night-time Symptoms of COPD Instrument [NiSCI]. Scores ranged from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very severe symptoms). The questionnaires also evaluated nocturnal awakenings and limitation of early-morning activities (scores ranged from 0 [no limitation] to 4 [a very great deal]). Symptoms assessed over 24 weeks included change from baseline in the severity of night-time and early-morning cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and difficulty bringing up phlegm, overall night-time and early-morning symptom severity, number of nocturnal awakenings and limitation of early-morning activities due to COPD symptoms</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Average Rating of Overall Early Morning COPD Symptom Severity</title>
        <description>Night-time and early-morning symptoms were recorded every morning using the Early-Morning Symptoms of COPD Instrument [EMSCI] and the Night-time Symptoms of COPD Instrument [NiSCI]. Scores ranged from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very severe symptoms). The questionnaires also evaluated nocturnal awakenings and limitation of early-morning activities (scores ranged from 0 [no limitation] to 4 [a very great deal]). Symptoms assessed over 24 weeks included change from baseline in the severity of night-time and early-morning cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and difficulty bringing up phlegm, overall night-time and early-morning symptom severity, number of nocturnal awakenings and limitation of early-morning activities due to COPD symptoms</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Average Rating of Overall Night-time COPD Symptom Severity</title>
          <description>Night-time and early-morning symptoms were recorded every morning using the Early-Morning Symptoms of COPD Instrument [EMSCI] and the Night-time Symptoms of COPD Instrument [NiSCI]. Scores ranged from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very severe symptoms). The questionnaires also evaluated nocturnal awakenings and limitation of early-morning activities (scores ranged from 0 [no limitation] to 4 [a very great deal]). Symptoms assessed over 24 weeks included change from baseline in the severity of night-time and early-morning cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and difficulty bringing up phlegm, overall night-time and early-morning symptom severity, number of nocturnal awakenings and limitation of early-morning activities due to COPD symptoms</description>
