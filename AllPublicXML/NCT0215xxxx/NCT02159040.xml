    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to compare the overall response rate (inclusive of
      complete response, partial response and hematologic improvement) per IWG 2006 criteria in
      patients with higher risk MDS treated with azacitidine with or without deferasirox achieved
      over the course of one year. Hematologic improvement must be maintained for at least 8 weeks.
