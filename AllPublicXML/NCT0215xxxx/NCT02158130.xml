  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study seeks to better understand the role of body weight, energy expenditure,
      and energy intake as mechanisms of body weight gain during detraining following aerobic
      exercise. It is hypothesized that participants in the higher dose exercise group will have
      greater body weight gain compared to the lower exercise dose and control group from wk 24 to
      wk 76 follow-up.

      Eligibility criteria include having successfully completed the main E-Mechanic study, be
      willing to archive blood samples and not being currently enrolled in another study that may
      effect body, energy intake or energy expenditure. The investigators will measure body weight,
      waist/hip circumference, blood pressure, body composition, physical activity, questionnaire
      about appetite/food intake and physical fitness.
