      The purpose of the study was to provide medical follow-up to patients exposed to BGG492 for
      more than 28 days in study CBGG492A2207 (NCT 01147003) and/or CBGG492A2212 (NCT 01338805).
      Data from study CBGG492A2216 was used to support the clinical safety assessment of BGG492
      regarding the observance of uterine endometrial stromal tumors and adrenal cortical adenomas
      at least one year after the completion of BGG492 treatment.
