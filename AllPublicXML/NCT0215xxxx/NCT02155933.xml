  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormones are substances that are made by the body and are sent directly out into the
      bloodstream to increase or decrease the function of certain organs, glands, or other
      hormones. Testosterone is a hormone found in the blood of all girls, but some girls have too
      much testosterone in their blood. Too much testosterone in the blood can possibly lead to a
      problem called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). People with PCOS have abnormal menstrual
      periods, excess facial and body hair, and too much testosterone in their blood. On the other
      hand, some girls with too much testosterone in their blood do not develop PCOS. We do not
      know why some of these girls develop PCOS and why some do not. The purpose of this research
      study is to find out whether too much testosterone can cause problems with other hormones
      that can lead to the development of PCOS. This study may help us understand more about the
      causes of PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder marked by irregular ovulation and
      hyperandrogenism. Hyperandrogenemia during adolescence can be a forerunner of adult PCOS.
      However, the progression of hormonal abnormalities leading to PCOS are unclear. We will
      examine hormonal profiles (e.g., LH, FSH, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol) during
      pubertal maturation in adolescent girls with and without elevated plasma androgens. The
      working hypothesis is that, in pubertal girls without hyperandrogenemia, overnight rises of
      progesterone are associated with a reduction of LH frequency during the waking morning hours.
      However, in pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia, LH frequency will be higher than normal
      during both the day and night, despite similar or higher progesterone levels. The studies
      will involve frequent blood sampling over 18 hours. We will assess differences in hormone
      parameters between time blocks (1900-2300 h, 2300-0300 h, 0300-0700 h, 0700-1100 h) in
      individuals to evaluate day-night changes. We will compare such changes between those with
      hyperandrogenemia and those without hyperandrogenemia.
