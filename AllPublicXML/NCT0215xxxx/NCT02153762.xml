  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, as well as
      effectiveness, with regards to the order of application for Locoid Lipocream and Hylatopic
      Plus cream in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), which is a type of skin rash.Topical skin
      barrier repair therapies (BRT) that are plain moisturizing creams/lotions with added lipids
      (fats/oils), such as Hylatopic Plus cream, have emerged as an effective addition to the the
      treatment of atopic dermatitis. BRTs are often used along with topical steroids (medicated
      creams), such as Locoid lotion, on skin with AD, and as a monotherapy (single treatment) on
      both non-diseased and diseased skin. Since BRTs help to restore components of skin that are
      absent in skin with AD, it is believed that long-term BRT use may reduce further development
      of further AD. This is an open-label, single site study.
