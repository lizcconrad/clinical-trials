  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess neck and low back pain using Electrical Impedance
      Myography (EIM) in order to develop an algorithm to aid primary care providers (PCPs) in the
      diagnosis of neck/back pain. Secondary goals include the refinement of EIM technology and
      associated software of ease-of-use and interpretation by PCPs and staff.
