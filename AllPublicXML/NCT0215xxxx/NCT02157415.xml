    <textblock>
      It is the first clinical study aimed at assessing the safety and tolerability of UT-P as
      routine rinsing and bacterial decolonization solution device for urinary catheters. The study
      will be conducted in hospitalized adult patients who had an urethral or suprapubic catheter
      in place for longer than two consecutive weeks and who are able to provide written consent.

      This is an open-label prospective observational cohort study. No comparative control group is
      planned as no other preventing infection solution is commercially available at this time.

      The objective of this study is to assess the tolerability and safety of Uro-Tainer®
      Polihexadine 0.02% intended as routine rinsing and bacterial decolonization of urinary
      catheters in long-term catheterized patients. After each instillation patients will be
      assessed for vital signs, skin reactions and other symptoms suggesting intolerance or
      sensitivity and/or allergic reaction. In addition, pain will be assessed in the first 5
      patients and any other patients with sustained pain sensation in the bladder.

      Catheters will be rinsed by gravity feed with 100ml solution of UT-P 0.02% once a day for a
      maximum of 5 instillations. A minimum interval of 24 hours must be guaranteed for the
      enrolment of the first 5 patients and their first irrigation with the investigational
      product.
