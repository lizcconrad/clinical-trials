  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical and histologic outcomes for acellular
      dermal matrix and resorbable membranes to determine if either provides a significant
      therapeutic advantage.

      The control subjects will receive a bone graft in the extraction socket, plus an additional
      bone graft on the outside socket wall covered by a bioabsorbable membrane made of polylactic
      acid and a citric acid ester. The test subjects will receive same type and technique of bone
      graft with a the acellular dermal matrix membrane to cover the bone graft. The membrane the
      patients receive will be randomly assigned using a coin toss: heads will be assigned to the
      test group while tails will be assigned for controls. The objective is to determine if at 4
      months the width and height of the jaw bone and also the soft tissue thickness where the
      tooth was extracted has increased, decreased or remained the same. Also the amount of
      patients own newly formed bone will be determined by microscopic examination of a core of jaw
      bone that will be obtained from the site of implant placement immediately before the implant
      is placed (the implant is not considered part of the study).
