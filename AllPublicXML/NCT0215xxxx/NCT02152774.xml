  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the ocular hypotensive efficacy of Rho kinase Inhibitor (AR-12286 0.5% and 0.7%)
      ophthalmic solutions in patients diagnosed with chronic angle-closure glaucoma treated for 6
      months.

      Secondary Outcome

      Secondary objectives are:

        1. To evaluate the early effect of Rho kinase Inhibitor (AR-12286) in reducing intraocular
           pressure (IOP).

        2. To evaluate the long term effect of the drug on IOP.

        3. To determine if AR-12286 can be used as directed therapy for CACG, reducing or
           eliminating the structural blockage of the trabecular meshwork that leads to development
           of elevated IOP.

    <description>AR-12286 is a novel, potent Rho-kinase inhibitor developed by Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ. It has single-digit nanomolar inhibitory activity against Rho-kinase in enzymatic inhibition assays. Mechanism-of action studies in monkeys demonstrate that AR-12286 lowers IOP primarily by increasing aqueous humor outflow through the trabecular meshwork Rho-kinase AR-12286 is well tolerated and produces clinically and statistically significant ocular hypotensive efficacy in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma. It is well tolerated by most patients and the only side effect was ocular hyperemia in a minority of subjects. It is currently in phase II testing.</description>
