  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      gpASIT+TM product is based on highly purified allergen fragments obtained from grass pollen.
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to confirm the safety, clinical tolerability and
      immunogenicity of increasing doses of gpASIT+TM administered subcutaneously to patients with
      grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and to determine the maximal tolerated
      dose of gpASIT+TM .
