  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open thoracoabdominal esophagectomy (TAE) is the standard curative treatment modality for
      resectable esophageal cancer. TAE can be achieved by positioning the patient in the supine
      position for the abdominal part and in a left-lateral decubitus (LLD) position for the
      thoracic part, or by performing both parts in a left-screwed supine position (LSS). Aim of
      the present study is to compare peri- and postoperative outcome variables after TAE for
      esophageal cancer in the two positions.

      POETRI is designed as a single-center, randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms
      including patients with resectable esophageal cancer and type I cancers of the
      esophagogastric junction (AEG I). Exclusion criteria are inability to tolerate surgery or
      both types of positioning, inability to perform an intrathoracic anastomosis, non-malignant
      pathologies. The primary endpoint is operating time. Secondary endpoints are morbidity, lymph
      node yield, pulmonary function, pain control and wound healing assessed during a follow-up of
      3 months.

      POETRI is a single-center, randomized controlled trial to evaluate different positioning and
      thoracic access during radical open thoracoabdominal esophagectomy for patients with
      resectable esophageal cancer.

    <description>The patient is placed on a vacuum mattress in supine position for the abdominal part using a midline laparotomy. After completion of the abdominal part, the abdomen is closed and dressed in standard fashion and the patient is repositioned under full anesthesia is a left-lateral decubitus (LLD) position. After the thorax is sterile prepped and draped, a right dorso-lateral thoracotomy in the 4th to 6th intercostal space under preservation of body of the serratus muscle is performed.</description>

    <description>The patient is placed on a vacuum mattress and in a left-screwed supine position for the entire operative procedure. The pelvis and the lower extremities are placed at 0° rotation, whereas the torso is rotated leftwards to an angle of 45° (Fig. 1). The patient is prepped and draped from the shoulders to the inguinal region. A midline laparotomy is done for the abdominal part and the abdomen closed afterwards. For the thoracic part, the operating table is tilted about 30° to the left, and a right anterolateral thoracotomy is performed in the 4th to 6th intercostal space.</description>
