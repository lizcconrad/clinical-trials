      This study aims to investigate posture-mobility associations in the upper quadrant by means
      of smartphone measurements

      One purpose of this study is to measure the magnitude of the thoracic kyphosis, thoracic
      spine extension, and side-to-side differences in scapular protraction and elbow extension
      range of motion during the median nerve neurodynamic test through a smartphone (iPhone 4, app
      Compass, iOS 7.1.1), and to assess the intrarater agreement parameters.

      Another purpose is to assess associations between thoracic kyphosis, thoracic spine
      extension, scapular protraction and the resting length of the pectoralis minor muscle through
      smartphone, photographs and tape measurements.
