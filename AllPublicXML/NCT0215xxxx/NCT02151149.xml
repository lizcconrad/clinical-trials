      Study comparing two regimens of nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin combination in elderly subject
      (≥ 70 years old) with advanced NSCLC
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, randomized, open-label, multicenter study of continuous weekly versus
      weekly times three with one-week break nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin as
      first-line treatment in elderly subjects (≥ 70 years old) with advanced non small cell lung
      cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy for their advanced disease and are not
      candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy. The primary study endpoint is the
      percentage of subjects with either peripheral neuropathy or myelosuppression adverse events.
      Patients will continue treatment until they develop progressive disease, unacceptable
      side-effects or wish to withdraw from the study, according to local standard of care.
      Patients will have radiographic evaluations every 6 weeks while on treatment.

    <time_frame>Up to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>The peripheral neuropathy events will be identified from the clinical AE dataset using MedDRA. Myelosuppression will be assessed as an adverse event based on laboratory values. All AEs will be graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 (v4.0).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The type, frequency and severity of AEs and SAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any clinically significant change in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing condition should be considered an AE. TEAEs will be analyzed which are defined as any AE or SAE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of the study drug through 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Any serious AE with an onset date more than 28 days after the last dose of study drug that is assessed as related to study drug will be considered a TEAE. AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The severity of AEs will be graded based on NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0.</description>
