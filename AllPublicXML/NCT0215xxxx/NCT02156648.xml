    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the feasibility of collecting plasma samples for
      cardiac biomarker assessment, and to identify if there is an associations between the
      biomarkers, echocardiographic features and the cardiac PET scan results (in patients
      receiving radiation therapy). This is the first step in a research program that has an
      overall goal of being able to predict early-treatment induced cardiotoxicity in patients with
      breast cancer.

             disease

          3. Life expectancy less than 15 months

          4. Pregnant or lactating women

          5. Use of beta receptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, angiotensin converting
             enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor inhibitors at baseline.
