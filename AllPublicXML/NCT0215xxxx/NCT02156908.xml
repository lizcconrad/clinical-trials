  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will first test, in a pilot study, the effects of 3 days of D-serine (DSR)
      on auditory plasticity in a sensory based remediation (SBR) paradigm, and then do a
      small-scale double-blind study of DSR + SBR on auditory emotion recognition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will initially enroll 5 subjects in an open label, three session pilot in patients will
      receive three sessions of tone matching SBR.

      We will then enroll 20 individuals in a parallel group, double blind placebo controlled
      intervention. Subjects will be assigned to D-serine (60mg/kg) or placebo to be taken 1x each
      week during the SBR sessions. Subjects will receive study drug 30 minutes prior to session.

      Subjects will under go three sessions of tone matching SBR, followed by 3 sessions of emotion
      recognition SBR. In total subjects will have 6 treatment sessions, and as before, treatment
      days will be separated by 1 week. Electrophysiology will be conducted at baseline and after
      the third weekly SBR session, and social cognitive and safety measures will also be completed
      at baseline and final.

      Double blind SBR intervention: First three sessions will be similar to SBR for pilot, with
      base tones limited to 100-400 Hz (emotionally relevant range). This will be followed by three
      sessions in which subjects are trained on identifying emotionally relevant tones. Tones will
      be developed based on previous research (Kantrowitz 2011).

    <criteria>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  18 to 64 years old,

          -  IQ≥85 and

          -  estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) ≥60. All oral and depot antipsychotics
             (with the exception of clozapine) are allowable. Patients must be on their
             antipsychotic medication for 1 month and stable on dose of antipsychotic and
             adjunctive medications for 2 weeks prior to study entry.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  history of neurological visual or hearing impairment,

          -  active suicidal ideation on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS),

          -  current alcohol or drug abuse (&lt;1 month) or substance dependence (&lt;4 months). All
             women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the
             baseline visit. We require an IQ of ≥85 to ensure that subjects will have a capacity
             to learn. In our cross-sectional studies, we have observed an IQ≥85 in over 90% of
             candidates, suggesting that this is not an overly restrictive criterion.
