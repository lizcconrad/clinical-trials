  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraepidermal injection of nerve growth factor results in a non-inflammatory hyperalgesia
      for thermal and mechanical stimuli. This hyperalgesia is similar to the pathological ailments
      of patients with neuropathic pain. The mechanisms of the cognitive modulation of pain and
      hyperalgesia are not yet understood in this group of patients. The investigators plan to use
      NGF injection as a model of non-inflammatory neuropathic pain in healthy subjects to
      investigate the underlying neuronal mechanisms of this hyperalgesia using functional magnetic
      resonance imaging and resting state network analysis.

    <measure>Changes in activation of the pain processing and resting state networks</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to one week</time_frame>
    <description>Activation of the resting state network (using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a standard echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence) as well as acitvation of the pain processing network (using fMRI and a standard EPI sequence) in response to painful stimulation, will be measured before and after injection of NGF into the volar forearm of the participant.
Particants are measured 0-4 days before injection (baseline) and then again 4-7 days after injection (to measure changes due to NGF injection).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in pain intensity, unpleasentness and suffering ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to one week</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be applied by using impact stimulation to the side where NGF was injected as well as a control side. Pain and tolerance thresholds as well as 3 ratings of intensity/unpleasantness and suffering will be obtained immediately after stimulation.
This will take place before NGF injection (baseline, 0-4 days) and after NGF injection (4-7 days).
Ratings will be conducted on visual analog scale from 0 (no pain/unpleasantess/suffering) to 100 (worst pain/unpleasantness/suffering imaginable).</description>
