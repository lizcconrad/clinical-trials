    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study in a randomized, controlled, double-blinded format and will evaluate
      the ability of a local anesthetic, Ropivacaine, to decrease pain after gastric bypass
      surgery. The drug will be administered into the abdomen during a bariatric bypass surgery.
      After surgery, patients who received Ropivacaine will be compared to those without
      Ropivacaine to determine its effect on reducing pain, recovery of lung function, ability to
      walk, and quality of life during recovery.

    <description>The abdomen will be entered and trocars placed in the usual manner. Using a standard suction/irrigation device and tubing, 200mg of Ropivacaine (0.2% Ropivacaine in 100mL Normal Saline) will be instilled into the abdomen at the start of the case, prior to dissection as follows. Under direct visualization, 50mL (of the 100mL) will be infused over the esophageal hiatus. The remaining 50mL will be infused throughout the abdomen. The infusion line will then be flushed with 30mL of Normal Saline to ensure the entire treatment dose is delivered, and no Ropivacaine remains in the tubing. The remainder of the surgery will proceed as usual.</description>
