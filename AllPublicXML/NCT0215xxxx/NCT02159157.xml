  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to randomly assign breast cancer patients requiring and agreeing to
      chemotherapy into two groups. One group will be receive an exercise prescription aimed at
      increasing physical activity by a minimum of 10 MET (metabolic equivalent task) hours per
      week. The other group will not receive a exercise prescription but their activity will be
      recorded. The hypothesis is that participants that are most active will exhibit improved
      chemotherapy completion rates, improved fitness, less fatigue and lower levels of markers for
      inflammation in their blood.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single institution feasibility trial. The efficacy of an
      exercise intervention during chemotherapy for sedentary breast cancer patients will be
      tested. The investigators goal is to recruit 120 women and men. Assuming 20% attrition rate,
      96 will be randomized to two arms, comparing patients assigned to a physical activity program
      plus general health education materials versus patients assigned to receive standard general
      health education materials only. Study measures will be obtained before intervention, at 24
      weeks, and at the end of the intervention, approximately week 32.
