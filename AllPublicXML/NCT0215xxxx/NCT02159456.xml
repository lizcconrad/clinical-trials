      1. Nutritional support during critical illness is important to improve the clinical outcome
           of patients. Recently, the apply of early enteral nutrition is recommend in critically
           ill patients on basis of data that enteral nutrition can be helpful to prevent the
           hospital-acquired infections.

             -  However, in critically ill patients, the smooth progress of nutritional support is
                often hindered by gastrointestinal intolerance, underlying clinical condition, and
                temporal necessity of procedure or operation.

             -  Continuous feeding method, compared with intermittent feeding, is expected to
                reduce the risk of gastrointestinal intolerance, and improve the nutritional
                support, but this hypothesis is not supported by appropriate evidences.

        2. We will elucidate to compare the efficacy and safety of the continuous feeding method in
           critically ill patients, compared with the intermittent feeding method.

             -  Prospective, randomized controlled study

             -  Primary outcome: the achievement rate of target nutritional goal within 7 days
                after the start of enteral nutrition

             -  Secondary outcome: gastrointestinal tolerance, In-ICU/hospital mortality, frequency
                of hospital-acquired infection, ICU/hospital length-of-stay, duration of mechanical
                ventilation
