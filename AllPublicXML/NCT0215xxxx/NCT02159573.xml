      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate relapse activity, as measured by the
      proportion of participants relapsed at 12 months, in participants with relapsing-remitting
      multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who transition from Tysabri (BG00002) to Tecfidera (BG00012) in the
      real-world setting. The secondary objective is to further evaluate relapse activity, defined
      as annualized relapse rate (ARR), hospitalization and intravenous corticosteroid use, during
      the first year of Tecfidera treatment following transition from Tysabri treatment.

      The study period will consist of a single time point retrospective medical chart abstraction
      with no required study visits or procedures. Data collection for this study is expected to
      last up to approximately five months.

        Participants with a diagnosis of RRMS receiving at least 12 months of continuous treatment
        with Tysabri monotherapy prior to initiation of Tecfidera. Additionally, participants must
        have initiated treatment with Tecfidera at least 12 months prior to enrollment into the

             objectives of the study

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with a progressive form of multiple sclerosis (MS) (progressive-relapsing,
             primary progressive, secondary progressive)

          -  Received treatment with any of the following after discontinuation of Tysabri and
             before initiation of treatment with Tecfidera (i.e., during washout period):
             interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, teriflunomide, rituximab,
             alemtuzumab, ocrelizumab or any investigational compound for the treatment of RRMS

          -  Received BG00012, or other formulations of dimethyl fumarate, or Fumaderm® or
             compounded fumarates at any time prior to initiation of treatment with Tecfidera

          -  History of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) while on Tysabri or within
             6 months of discontinuing treatment with Tysabri
