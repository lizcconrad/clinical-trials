    <textblock>
      Gastric carcinoma (GC) is the second leading cause of cancer death throughout the world. In
      previous multi-center study, we have found that the prevalence of GDNF family receptor alpha
      1(GFRA1), serum response factor (SRF), and ZNF382 methylation alterations were inversely and
      coordinately associated with GC metastasis and the patients' overall survival throughout
      discovery and testing cohorts in China, Japan and Korea. The present cohort study is to
      investigate whether methylation of those genes can predict the metastasis and prognosis of
      GC.

      Background: Metastasis is the leading cause of death for gastric carcinoma (GC). Currently,
      GC prognosis is primarily determined based on the clinical data and pathological stages of
      patients at the time of diagnosis and treatment. However, successful management of GC
      patients is still hampered by lack of highly sensitive and specific biomarkers capable of
      predicting prognosis and likelihood of metastasis. GFRA1 hypomethylation along with SRF and
      ZNF382 hypermethylation were found to be potential synergistic biomarkers for the prediction
      of GC metastasis in our previous multi-center study. In addition, p16 and E-cadherin were
      also correlated with GC metastasis in Chinese cohort. To investigate the predictive value of
      those genes' methylation on metastasis potential in GC, we carried out the prospective cohort
      study.

      Methods: 198 early stage GC patients without lymph node or distal metastasis were included in
      the present study. Baseline information of E-cadherin, GFRA1, p16, SRF and ZNF382 methylation
      status of the GC from 191 cases was obtained by MethyLight. The follow-up examination was
      carried out in a double-blind study with a 6-month interval. The association between gene
      methylation and metastasis of GC was analyzed with SPSS16.0 software. All P-values were
      two-sided.

    <description>The hazard ratio, positive prediction value, and negative prediction value of metastasis/recurrence of gastric carcinomas are calculated according to the metastasis/recurrence frequences among patients with the different methylation status of each target gene CpG islands. These patients are classified into four groups for each gene: A) cases without methylation change; B) cases with the low-level of methylation change (33.3% of cases with methylation change); C) cases with the middle-level of methylation change (33.3% of cases with methylation change); D) cases with the high-level of methylation change (33.3% of cases with methylation change). Combination analysis will be carried out using Support Vector Classification model.</description>

    <description>The classification of patients is the same as the primary outcome measure. The log-rank test will be used to compare survival time between groups. Cox-proportional hazards models will be used to identify independent predictors of survival (month) with adjustment for relevant clinical covariates</description>

      Tissue specimens are surgically collected from inpatients with pN0M0-stage gastric carcinoma.
      Genomic DNA sample is extracted from tissues. Unmethylated cytosine residues in DNA are
      converted into uracil residues with bisulfite modification.

        198 early stage gastric carcinoma (GC) inpatients that underwent surgical treatment at
        Peking University Cancer Hospital &amp; Institute between 2002 and 2012 were enrolled in the
        cohort. All of the enrolled patients had been diagnosed pathologically by senior
        pathologists. The 2010 UICC-TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) system was used for the
        classification of GCs. All cases involved primary lesions without neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
        Genes methylation status of GC samples was analyzed with MethyLight combined with denatured
        high performance liquid chromatography. 191 eligible cases with gene-methylated or
        gene-methylated GC were enrolled into the cohort study.
