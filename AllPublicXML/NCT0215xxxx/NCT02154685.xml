  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking occurs in approximately 21% of the US population, is responsible for an annual
      mortality rate of approximately 438,000 citizens, and has an associated healthcare economic
      burden of $167 billion. Although pharmacotherapies have improved cessation outcome, the vast
      majority of individuals making quit attempts relapse within 5-10 days of cessation. The
      hypotheses to be examined in this study may have potentially important implications for
      smoking cessation treatment and will, therefore, target the single greatest addiction-related
      cause of morbidity and mortality.This study will investigate a novel behavioral strategy for
      altering important memory processes that underlie human smoking-related nicotine addiction.
      This strategy used in this study employs established cue exposure procedures to putatively
      update smoking-related memory with information that will suppress responding to smoking cues.
      The goal here is to alter existing nicotine-related memory directly rather than rely
      exclusively on the establishment of an inhibitory extinction process, via traditional cue
      exposure therapy, which is known to be vulnerable to spontaneous recovery, renewal and
      reinstatement. Positive findings would represent a significant advance in exposure-based
      therapy for addiction and could lead to a treatment that uniquely targets the problem of
      cue-elicited craving and reactivity, thereby addressing a major obstacle to successful
      smoking cessation.

      We propose to examine the effects of two sessions of retrieval-extinction (R-E) training in
      smokers who are making a quit attempt. Retrieval will be initiated by a brief (5-min.) video
      with smoking-related content and the extinction will consist of protracted (1 hr.) exposure
      to smoking cues. A control group receiving the same treatment except that the retrieval video
      will have nonsmoking/neutral content will serve to demonstrate that retrieval is a key
      feature of R-E training. Effects of training on smoking craving and cue reactivity will be
      assessed 1-day, 2-weeks and 4-weeks post-training, whereas training effects on indices of
      smoking behavior/cessation will be preliminarily assessed 2-weeks and 4-weeks post-training.
      It is expected that the R-E training will result in significant and enduring reductions in
      craving and reactivity to both novel and familiar smoking cues and have a favorable impact on
      smoking. Positive findings from this study could lead to a safe and effective behavioral
      intervention that will help smokers overcome the threat to cessation posed by cue-elicited
      craving and reactivity, and thereby reduce the burden levied against society by this most
      costly addiction. Additionally, this intervention could be modified to treat addiction to
      other substances.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual
             level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.

          -  Participants must meet DSM-IV criteria for current nicotine dependence and be a daily
             cigarette smoker of 10+ cigarettes/day for a minimum duration of three years.

          -  Participants must live within a 50-mile radius of the research facility and have
             reliable transportation.

          -  Participants must be willing to make a quit attempt beginning the night before the
             three consecutive daily laboratory sessions (i.e., two retrieval-extinction training
             sessions and the test session performed 24-hours after the second retrieval-extinction
             training session).

          -  Participants must be willing to (a) be overnight smoking abstinent (CO verified) prior
             to the baseline smoking cue reactivity assessment, and (b) make a cessation attempt
             and be smoking abstinent (CO verified) over the three day period that corresponds to
             the two retrieval-extinction training sessions and the test session performed 24-hours
             after the second retrieval-extinction training session.

          -  Participants must be willing to submit to a breathalyzer (alcohol) assessment and
             urine drug screen (for benzodiazepines, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana and
             opiates) and produce a negative test result on (a) the day of the baseline smoking cue
             reactivity assessment, and (b) each of the three consecutive days that correspond to
             the two retrieval-extinction training sessions and the test session performed 24-hours
             after the second retrieval-extinction training session.

          -  Participants must consent to random assignment to the R-E vs. NR-E conditions.

          -  Participants must not use smokeless tobacco.

          -  Participants must be willing to forego any other medication or behavioral treatment
             for smoking cessation during their enrollment in this study (with the exception of a
             referral, upon request, to the SC Quitline). Treatment referral will be provided at
             the end of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with current/active (untreated) psychotic disorder, current major
             depressive disorder (severe), bipolar affective disorder or a severe anxiety disorder
             as these conditions would likely interfere with their ability to fulfill the
             requirements for successful participation (e.g., provide accurate interview data,
             complete study assessments, attend scheduled laboratory visits, etc.).

          -  Participants meeting DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence (other than nicotine)
             within the past 60 days.

          -  Participants who are unwilling or unable to maintain abstinence from alcohol and other
             drugs of abuse (benzodiazepines, methamphetamine, cocaine, marijuana and opiates) in
             order to comply with Inclusion Criterion f above.

          -  Participants currently taking ß-blockers, anti-arrhythmic agents, psychostimulants or
             any other agents known to interfere with heart rate, skin conductance or blood
             pressure responses.

          -  Current use of any pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy for smoking cessation.

          -  Pregnant women (because pregnancy can influence responding during study procedures).
