  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 3 randomized open labeled trials will evaluate the 3 D navigable ultrasound (SonoWand)
      in improving the extent of resection in intra-axial brain tumors. All patients will undergo
      resective surgery. In the experimental arm, a navigable 3 D ultrasound will be used. In the
      standard arm, only navigation will be used. This study will help in assessing the usefulness
      sononavigation in improving radicality of resection in malignant gliomas and also to access
      the accuracy of SonoWand in predicting residue (histopathological correlation).

      Routine presurgical evaluation of all patients will be conducted. The preoperative use of
      steroids, antiepileptics and other medications would be as per standard procedure and would
      be documented. In addition detailed MRI evaluation will be performed (including contrast
      enhanced MRI study, diffusion MRI, perfusion MR, MR spectroscopy, dynamic-contrast-enhanced
      MRI for permeability studies, as well as functional MRI, and tractography if required) not
      more than 1 week prior to the date of surgery.

      Navigation specific MR sequences would be performed in all patients (both arms).

    <description>Initially a 2D acquisition will be performed and ultrasound parameters adjusted to obtain the best image resolution. Then anatomical landmarks will be identified if possible and the lesioncharacterized. Once the lesion is identified a rapid 3D-US acquisition will be performed. Tumor resection will proceed guided by the 3D US images using a trackable pointer to navigate. Repeat 3D US images will be obtained as many times as required during the surgery to update the information as tumor debulking proceeds. A final US will be obtained at the end of the procedure and after dural closure</description>

    <description>Routine microneurosurgical procedures would be adopted in all cases.Sonowand system will be used for navigation control arm as well as sononavigation experimental arm. Image registration (on the previously imported DICOM images) will be done on the system and after positioning, patient-toimage registration will be completed. The Registration accuracy will be documented.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All radiologically-suspected, previously untreated, supratentorial malignant gliomas
             being considered for debulking surgery.

          2. Adults (above 18 years)

          3. Eligible for surgical therapy (craniotomy not stereotactic biopsy )

          4. Resectability : A lesion would be considered &quot;resectable&quot; if the surgeons feel that
             all the radiologically imaged lesion can be removed (with reasonable certainty). Only
             deemed resectable lesions will be included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unfit for GA

          2. Unwilling for the study

          3. Unresectable lesion
