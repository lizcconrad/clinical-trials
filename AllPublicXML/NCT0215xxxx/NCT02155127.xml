  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 26 million individuals (13 percent) of the
      U.S. population, with a projected 70 percent increase by the year 2015 to over 40 million
      individuals. Impairments in physical function and mobility limitations have been reported in
      older Chronic Kidney Disease patients, however the consequences of impaired functioning on
      participation in daily life and quality of life have not been studied. Early identification
      and interventions to mitigate deterioration in physical function and mobility should lead to
      improved health and quality of life outcomes in older patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.
      Although older individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease have reduced survival expectancy,
      maintaining physical function and mobility may contribute to longer active life expectancy,
      and higher quality of life despite their diagnosis.
