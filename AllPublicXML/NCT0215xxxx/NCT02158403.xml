      The purpose of this study is to assess how often blood clots form in the FDA-approved
      HeartMateÂ® II (HM II) Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) and to identify risks related to
      clotting within the pump.

      PREVENT is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study that is designed (1) to assess
      the incidence of HM II pump thrombosis in the current era when recommended practices for
      clinical management are adopted, and (2) to identify the risk factors associated with pump
      thrombosis events. The recommended practices are focused on implantation technique,
      anticoagulation regimen, pump speed and blood pressure management. All consecutive patients
      receiving a HM II implant will be considered for this study.
