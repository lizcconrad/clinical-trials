    <textblock>
      - Hypothesis: Double dose rifampicin together with earlier monitoring of sputum conversion
      using vital staining reduces unfavorable outcome of Cat. 1 first-line TB treatment without
      excess serious toxicity, and allows early switch to specific treatment of MDR-TB without
      using Cat. 2 retreatment regimen

      - General study design: This open label, randomised clinical trial is intended as a pilot
      study on the efficacy and safety of high-dose rifampicin and feasibility and added value of
      auramine and/or FDA vital staining sputum smear after 2 weeks of intensive treatment phase.
      If this proof-of-concept study provides substantial indication of benefit without indication
      of excess toxicity, the data from the study will be used to design a larger scale,
      cluster-randomized study. The aim of this cluster randomised study would be to provide
      definite proof of the benefit of the intervention on adverse treatment outcomes and lack of
      excess toxicity associated with high dose rifampicin. In addition, the cluster-randomized
      study would provide a more precise assessment of the suppression and prevention of (acquired)
      resistance endpoints.

      An interim analysis is thus planned at the time the last recruited patient finishes
      treatment, i.e. about 9 months after the end of recruitment. It will focus on assessment of
      drug toxicity versus suggested benefits of the intervention. This analysis will be primarily
      performed for the go/no-go decision and design considerations for the cluster-randomized
      trial. The decision on proceeding to the cluster randomized study will be based on the
      absence of excess toxicity, a trend toward a reduction of unfavourable outcomes (excluding
      relapse), and possible favourable effects on initially present low-resistance mutations /
      mutations acquired during treatment. It will also allow to adapt the design of the larger
      study particularly regarding the algorithm for resistance screening, and whether or not
      treatment shortening could be justified with rapid initial conversion.

    <description>Following current WHO guidelines, an adverse treatment outcome is defined as any occurrence of the following:
Relapse: Cured previously from TB or completed treatment for TB and now having bacteriologically positive sputum for TB (at 12 months follow-up or at an earlier time point)
Default: The patient whose treatment was interrupted for â‰¥ 2 consecutive months.
Failure: Sputum positive for TB at 5 months or later during treatment. In line with current WHO recommendations, patients detected with MDR-TB or rifampicin resistance before this or another outcome applies and switched to the MDR-TB regimen will be excluded from the outcome analysis.18 Failure will also be declared if the regimen has to be changed for at least 2 drugs due to adverse events.
Death: All-cause mortality between case registration and end of TB treatment (related or not to TB or TB treatment)</description>
