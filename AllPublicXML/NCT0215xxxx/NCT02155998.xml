      This is a multicentre, non-interventional, prospective study to be carried out in
      representative medical institutions in order to get the information on administration of
      postoperative and post-radiation adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (including &quot;go&quot; / &quot;no
      go&quot; decision, regimens, dosages and duration) used in locally advanced prostate cancer
      patients with high and very high risk of recurrence in Russia.

      This is a multicentre, non-interventional, prospective study to be carried out in
      representative medical institutions in order to get the information on administration of
      postoperative and post-radiation adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (including &quot;go&quot; / &quot;no
      go&quot; decision, regimens, dosages and duration) used in locally advanced prostate cancer
      patients with high and very high risk of recurrence in Russia.

      No additional procedures besides those already used in the routine clinical practice will be
      applied to the patients. Treatment assignment will be done according to the current practice.

      It is planned to enrol 200 subjects in up to 30 sites in Russian Federation. The average
      number of patients per site is planned as 6 - 10; there are no restrictions on minimum and
      maximum number of subjects per site in this study.
