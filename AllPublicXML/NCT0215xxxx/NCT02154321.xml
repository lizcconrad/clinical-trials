      The purpose of this research is to assess and determine brain oscillations or &quot;brain
      signatures&quot; of adult participants with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
      relative to adult participants without ADHD using the technique electroencephalogram (EEG).
      Electroencephalogram is entirely non-invasive way of tracking brain activity.The main goal of
      this study is to establish biological factors for determining the diagnosis of Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

    <description>This study aims to recruit 100 adult participants: 50 of which are adults diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and 50 healthy controls. All participants will perform a total of two tasks while connected to electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors; the first task is a resting state task and after that a cognitive challenge task (attention control). Study activity is performed in a single visit which lasts two hours. Participants will also be asked to complete some behavioral questionnaires.</description>

    <description>The electroencephalogram assesses brain electrical activity through surface recording disks (electrodes) which are placed near the participants' head using a custom designed Lycra cap. The electrodes transmit the signals which are then amplified and stored on a computer. The procedure is entirely non-invasive. Once an accurate signal is assured, the signal derived from the electrode cap is then amplified, transmitted to a computer, and stored for later analysis. Each participant will undergo the electroencephalogram (EEG) procedure only once for the duration of 30-45 minutes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria for all:

          -  Right-handedness

        Inclusion Criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) group:

          -  Currently unmedicated adults with ADHD. To be given a full diagnosis of adult ADHD,
             the participant must have full Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
             (DSM-IV-R) criteria: (1) described a chronic course of ADHD symptomatology from
             childhood to adulthood, and (2) endorsed a moderate or sever level of impairment
             attributed to the ADHD symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria for all:

          -  Currently taking psychoative medications

          -  Any clinically significant neurological problem (e.g., tics, seizures, serious head
             injury)

          -  Alcohol or substance abuse (current or in the past 2 years)

          -  Any current Axis I psychiatric diagnosis (other than ADHD) as verified by clinical
             interview
