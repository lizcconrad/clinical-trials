      This trial is to determine the safest dose of a triple combination (chemokine modulatory
      regimen or CKM) of celecoxib, interferon alfa (IFN), and rintatolimod that can be given with
      a DC vaccine as treatment of peritoneal surface malignancies after standard of care surgery.

      The first phase of this study will determine the safest dose of IFN that can be given in
      combination with celecoxib and rintatolimod along with a DC vaccine. The doses of celecoxib
      (400 mg) and rintatolimod (200 mg) will be consistent while the dose of IFN will be increased
      (5, 10, or 20 MU/m2) as participants are enrolled to the trial. The high dose of IFN in
      combination with celecoxib and rintatolimod will be used for the next phase of the clinical
      trial. After surgery, participants will receive 2 cycles of the investigational treatment.

      The second phase of this study will test if the investigational treatment has any effects on
      peritoneal surface malignancies. The doses of the combination determined in the first phase
      will be used in this phase of the clinical trial. After surgery, participants will receive 2
      cycles of the investigational treatment, followed by standard chemotherapy as determined by
      their oncologist, and then 2 more cycles of the investigational treatment.

      This trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of autologous alpha-type-1 polarized
      dendritic cell (alpha-DC1) vaccines (patients' autologous alpha-DC1s loaded with autologous
      tumor material), combined with a systemic chemokine modulation regimen [CKM; intravenous
      rintatolimod (TLR3 ligand, a derivative of Poly-I:C) + intravenous interferon-alfa + oral
      celecoxib] as adjuvant therapy, after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), in patients with peritoneal surface malignancies (PSM),
      including but not limited to malignant peritoneal mesothelioma and peritoneal carcinomatosis
      (PC) of appendiceal and colorectal origin.

      All patients judged to have peritoneal surface malignancy and considered able to be
      cytoreduced to Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) Completeness of Cytoreduction (CC) score of 1 or
      less will undergo CRS + HIPEC. Postoperative immunotherapy will start at least 4 weeks after
      CRS + HIPEC.

      Immunotherapy regimen will include four cycles of intranodal (3M cells) and intradermal (3M
      cells) αDC1 vaccines. Each booster αDC1 vaccine dose (treatment cycles 2-4) will be followed
      by 4-days of systemic CKM, starting the day after vaccination (IFNα [dose-escalation: 5-20
      MU/m2], intravenous [IV], once a day for 4 days; rintatolimod [short-half-life TLR3 ligand]
      200 mg intravenous [IV], on Wednesday and Friday only of the CKM regimen; and celecoxib 200
      mg, orally, twice a day for 4 days). In order to avoid overlap between experimental
      immunotherapy and potential adjuvant chemotherapy (which can be clinically indicated as a
      part of standard care in the subset of patients), the experimental treatments will be
      interrupted after cycles 1 and 2, to allow adjuvant chemotherapy that is done for each
      patient's clinical care, and is not a part of this research study. Whenever clinically
      indicated as a part of standard care, adjuvant chemotherapy may start at least 5 days after
      completion of the 2nd cycle of immunotherapy (first booster vaccine plus the first CKM). The
      3rd cycle of immunotherapy may start at least 5 days after the completion of chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed peritoneal surface malignancies, including but
             not limited to malignant peritoneal mesothelioma and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC)
             from presumed appendiceal and colorectal primary tumors. Most patients will have
             received extensive prior treatments, due to the recurrent nature of PC. Prior
             therapies involve previous CRS, local and systemic chemotherapies. None of these prior
             treatments disqualifies the patient from receiving the protocol-mandated experimental
             treatment.

          -  Patients must be deemed able to undergo optimal cytoreductive surgery (CRS) defined as
             CC-score of 0 or 1 based on imaging.

        Cytoreduction is defined as the burden of residual disease nodules left at the end of
        surgery (CC-0: no visible disease; CC-1: residual tumor nodules ≤ 2.5 mm in size; CC-2:
        residual tumor nodules 2.5 mm - 2.5 cm in size; CC-3: residual tumor nodules &gt; 2.5 cm in
        size).

          -  Patients may be enrolled in the study regardless of prior chemotherapy regimens
