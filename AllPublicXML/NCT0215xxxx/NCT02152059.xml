      This study is being done to evaluate the good and bad effects of BIBF1120 in recurrent,
      platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patients and to see if BIBF1120 may or may not be
      more effective and better tolerated than standard therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Find out the proportion of patients with their small small cell lung cancer controlled
           for at least 90 days after treatment with BIBF1120

        -  Compare the response rate, survival and side effects of BIBF1120 in recurrent,
           platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patients

        -  Identify a group of patients who will benefit the most from BIBF1120 In this study,
           patients will receive BIBF1120 at 200 mg twice daily continuously. A cycle will be 21
           days. During treatment, the dose of BIBF1120 will be held or reduced to lower doses if
           patients do not tolerate it well or if the doctors are concerned about the side effects
           of BIBF1120 on individual patients.

      This study is being done to evaluate the effects of BIBF1120 in recurrent, platinum-sensitive
      small cell lung cancer patients.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To investigate the efficacy and safety of a novel VEGFR-2 and FGFR-1 targeting agent,
           BIBF1120, in previously treated, platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patients.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To correlate response to the apoptotic biomarkers, Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 and FDGR-1
           amplification.

        -  To correlate response with baseline FLT-PET SUV uptake and change in FLT-PET SUV uptake.

      All eligible patients will be treated with 200 mg bid of BIBF1120 daily and 21 days will be
      considered as one cycle

             patients with SCLC recurrence at least 3 months from the last dose of platinum-based
             chemotherapy. Definition of platinum-sensitive disease is patient with at least 3

          -  Histological diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (including Oat cell carcinoma, small
             cell neuroendocrine tumor). Patients with archival tumor samples will be collected for

             due harm, a fresh biopsy can be obtained.

          -  As progression-free survival (PFS) or PFS rate is the endpoint, all patients enrolled
             must have measurable (per RECIST 1.1 Criteria) radiological progression of disease on
             radiological investigations.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2

          -  Adequate hematological function defined as hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L, ANC &gt; 1500/uL and
             platelets &gt; 100, 000/uL.

          -  Adequate renal function defined as creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance &gt; 45
             mL/min (Cockcroft-Gault).

             women of childbearing potential.

          -  The absence of any significant psychiatric and medical condition that will potentially
             affect compliance to therapy or will be adversely affected by the experimental
             therapy.

             defined as those with no CNS symptoms, no concurrent significant edema on CT or MRI of
             the brain and no concurrent corticosteroid therapy will be eligible. Those with
             leptomeningeal disease will NEVER be eligible due to overall poor prognosis. Patients
             who have treated brain metastasis without concurrent corticosteroid and

             participating males) during the trial and for at least 3 months after end of active
             therapy. Patients who are pregnant and/or lactating are not eligible.
