  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the accuracy of the Senseonics
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (Senseonics CGM System) measurements when compared with
      reference standard measurements (YSI glucose analyzer). The investigation will also evaluate
      safety of the Senseonics CGM System usage, while in the clinic and during home use.

          2. Clinically confirmed diagnosis of diabetes mellitus for a duration of 1 year and uses
             insulin therapy for their diabetes management (including subjects on insulin pump
             therapy)

          3. Subject has signed an informed consent document and is willing to comply with protocol
             requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria will be excluded from this study:

          1. History of severe hypoglycemia in the last 6 months prior to study start, defined as
             hypoglycemia resulting in loss of consciousness or seizure

          2. Diabetic ketoacidosis in the past 6 months

          3. Any condition preventing or complicating the placement, operation or removal of the
             Sensor including upper extremity deformities or skin condition.

          4. Any medical condition or illness that in the judgment of the investigator might
             interfere with the procedures, results or compliance during the course of this
             investigation, or increase the risk of induced hypoglycemia or repeated blood testing
             including significantly impaired hepatic function and renal failure

          5. Known microvascular (diabetic) complications, including active proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy or macular edema, active non-proliferative retinopathy, diabetic
             nephropathy including active retinopathy

          6. Hematocrit &gt;50% or &lt;30%

          7. Females lactating or pregnant or intending to become pregnant during the course of the
             investigation
