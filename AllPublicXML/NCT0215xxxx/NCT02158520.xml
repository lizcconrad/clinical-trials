      This randomized phase II trial studies how well nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab or ipilimumab
      works as first-line therapy in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that cannot be
      removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as nab-paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Bevacizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by binding to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and by preventing
      the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Ipilimumab blocks a substance
      called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) on the surface of T cells and may
      help the immune system kill cancer cells. It is not yet known whether nab-paclitaxel and
      bevacizumab is more effective than ipilimumab in treating melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether the combination nab-paclitaxel and bevacizumab (AB) prolongs
      progression-free status relative to ipilimumab as a treatment in patients with unresectable
      stage IV melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the hazard of death among those randomized to AB then ipilimumab relative to
      those randomized to ipilimumab then AB as treatment in patients with unresectable stage IV
      melanoma.

      II. To assess whether tumor response rate (as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria 1.1) differs with respect to first (1st) treatment course.

      III. To estimate whether the tumor response rate differs with respect to second (2nd)
      treatment course for those who progressed during their first treatment course.

      IV. To further examine the safety profile of each of these regimens.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the pharmacokinetics of nab-paclitaxel when combined with bevacizumab therapy.

      II. To examine pharmacodynamic changes of blood-derived parameters (biomarkers) of
      angiogenesis and immunity as a function of therapy.

      III. To examine whether changes in serum biomarkers are also seen in the tumor.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15
      and nab-paclitaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients experiencing
      progressive disease may cross-over to Arm B within 2-4 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients experiencing progressive disease may cross-over to Arm A within 2-4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
