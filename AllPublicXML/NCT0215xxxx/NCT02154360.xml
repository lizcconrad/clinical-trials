  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, phase I study to determine the safety, PK characteristics
      and anti-inflammatory effects of the NK-R1 coadministered with ritonavir-containing
      antiretroviral therapy in individuals with well-controlled viral replication.

      Our hypothesis is that Aprepitant will be safe, well tolerated, and will have
      anti-inflammatory properties when administered concomitantly with the protease inhibitor
      ritonavir.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by Western
             blot at any time prior to study entry. HIV-1 culture, HIV-1 antigen, plasma HIV-1 RNA,
             or a second antibody test by a method other than ELISA is acceptable as an alternative
             confirmatory test.

          2. Antiretroviral treatment with a regimen that includes either atazanavir 300 mg daily
             with ritonavir 100 mg daily or darunavir/ritonavir on a combination of 800/100 mg
             daily for at least 6 months prior to enrollment.

          3. CD4+ cell count ≥ 350/mm3 for at least 6 months prior to enrollment and performed at
             any CLIA-certified laboratory.

          4. Plasma HIV-1 RNA below the limit of quantification of an ultrasensitive assay as
             measured by any standard assay (the Roche Amplicor, the UltraSensitive HIV-1 Monitor
             assay (Roche Molecular Systems), or Version 3 bDNA assay or other) for at least 6
             months prior to enrollment by any laboratory that is CLIA-certified (or its
             equivalent) for the assay.

          5. Laboratory values obtained within 30 days prior to study entry, as follows:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater or equal than 750/mm3

               -  Total bilirubin less or equal than 2.5 x ULN

               -  Albumin greater or equal than 3 g/dL

          6. Female subjects of reproductive potential must have a negative spot urine pregnancy
             test result (with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) performed at entry, prior to
             starting initial study treatment.

          7. All subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process while on study drug
             and for 30 days after stopping the medication.

             If participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, the female study
             subject must use at least one of the forms of contraception listed below while
             receiving the protocol-specified medication and for 30 days after stopping the
             medication.

               -  Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent

               -  Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide

               -  IUD

             surgical sterilization, (e.g. hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or salpingotomy)
             are eligible without requiring the use of contraception. Subject reported history is
             acceptable for documentation of sterilization, other contraceptive methods, menopause
             and a female's reproductive potential.

          8. Karnofsky performance score greater or equal than 80 within 30 days prior to study
             entry (Appendix I).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetes requiring treatment with oral hypoglycemics or insulin therapy.

          2. Pregnancy within 90 days prior to study entry.

          3. Use of inhibitors of metabolism by the cytochrome P450 3A4 with the exception of

          7. Use of any immunomodulator, HIV vaccines, or investigational therapy within 90 days
             prior to study entry. However, if the experimental agent has a short half life, as
             determined by the Principal Investigator, the required wash out period can be reduced
             to 30 days.

          8. Any vaccination within 30 days prior to study entry.

          9. Use of systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy within 90 days prior to study entry.

         10. History of allergy to aprepitant or its formulations.

         11. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would interfere with adherence to study requirements.

         12. History of chronic active hepatitis B or C infection or severe hepatic dysfunction
             (Child-Pugh score &gt; 9) regardless of etiology

         13. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until subject
             either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opinion of the
             investigator, for at least 14 days prior to study entry.

         14. Weight &lt; 40 kg or 88 lbs. within 90 days prior to study entry.
