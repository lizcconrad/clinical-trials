      This retrospective study will investigate clinician behavior in diagnosing patients with
      possible obstructive coronary artery disease who received a Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene
      Expression score - ASGES) result compared to patients who did not have the test performed
      (matched control patients).

      This retrospective study will investigate clinician behavior in diagnosing patients with
      possible obstructive coronary artery disease who received a Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene
      Expression score - ASGES) result compared to patients who did not have the test performed
      (matched control patients). The data collected will be from primary care practices and will
      also assess one to two year health outcomes (MACE, procedure complications). Furthermore, in
      these real world practice settings, the study will investigate the economic impact of Corus
      CAD (ASGES) usage at each practice using practice specific data, when available.

        This study is a retrospective chart review, in which only de-identified clinical data will
        be collected and analyzed. The main criterion for inclusion is the occurrence of chest pain
        (or anginal equivalent) in a subject without known significant CAD or a history of prior
        myocardial infarction, and the utilization of Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score -
        ASGES) for the Corus CAD Arm. Additionally, Corus CAD (ASGES) eligible subjects with
        similar chest pain (or angina equivalent) who did not undergo Corus CAD (ASGES) testing
        will be included as a control group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score - ASGES) arm:

          -  Symptoms suggestive of obstructive CAD, according to the opinion of the site clinician

          -  Age &gt;= 21 years

          -  Resulted Corus CAD (ASGES) test used during the evaluation and/or diagnosis of
             symptoms suggestive of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), preferably 1 year
             prior to data collection date.

        For Control arm:

          -  Symptoms suggestive of obstructive CAD, according to the opinion of the site clinician

          -  Eligible for Corus CAD (ASGES) (see exclusion criteria)

          -  Matched to Corus CAD (ASGES) patients by sex, age +/-2.5 years, and presenting
             symptoms

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of myocardial infarction (MI) or CAD prior to the index evaluation

          -  Presentation of high risk unstable angina for the index evaluation

          -  Concurrent systemic infection or inflammatory process

          -  Concurrent MI or acute coronary syndrome

          -  Known diabetes mellitus diagnosis or laboratory test results suggestive of a diagnosis
             of diabetes mellitus (e.g., HbA1C &gt;=6.5)

          -  Use of steroids, immunosuppressive agents, or chemotherapeutic agents, at time of
             chest pain presentation
