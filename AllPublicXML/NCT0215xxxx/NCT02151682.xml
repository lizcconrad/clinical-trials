  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tapentadol has already been studied in adults. This study is needed to find out if tapentadol
      works and is safe to use in children and adolescents with long-term pain.

      During the first 2 weeks of the study (Part 1), participants will be given either tapentadol
      or morphine prolonged-release tablets. Assignment will be done randomly (like tossing a
      coin). The participant and the caregiver will know which medication they are taking. The
      primary endpoint is based on data collected in Part 1 of this trial.

      If eligible and willing, participants from Part 1 can enter a 12 month follow-up period (Part
      2). In Part 2 of this trial participants will be treated with tapentadol prolonged release
      tablets or with the standard of care (observation arm).

    <measure>Binary variable &quot;responder&quot;.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 14 (End of Part 1)</time_frame>
    <description>A participant is defined as responder if both of the following criteria are met:
Completion of the 14-day Treatment Period (Part 1).
One of the following calculated from the scheduled pain assessments (&quot;pain right now&quot;) documented during the last 3 days of the Treatment Period:
Average pain less than 50 on a visual analog scale (VAS) for subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years; or less than 5 on the Faces Pain Scale-revised (FPS-R) for subjects aged 6 years to less than 12 years.
Average reduction from baseline of pain greater than and equal to 20 on a VAS for subjects aged 12 years to less than 18 years; or greater and equal to 2 on the FPS-R for subjects aged 6 years to less than 12 years.
The proportion of participants classified as responders will be assessed and compared between the treatment groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Constipation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1; Day 14 (End of Part 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Constipation will be assessed using the modified constipation assessment scale (CAS). This is an 8-item questionnaire where the observer will score constipation on a nominal scale (no problem, some problem or severe problem). The response to an item could also be scored as &quot;unable to assess&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Start of Part 1); Day 379 (End of Part 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability will be assessed by the number and type of adverse events and adverse drug reactions by treatment group during the different trial periods, on a participant and event level.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain intensity in the open-label, active-controlled treatment period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 14 (End of Part 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity will be assessed by scoring &quot;pain right now&quot; twice daily. &quot;Pain right now&quot; will be scored by every participant using the Visual Analog Score (VAS) as well as the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) at each time point in an electronic diary.
The pain intensity will first be documented using the VAS and directly thereafter the FPS-R. If required, pain intensity diary entry maybe assisted by the legal guardian or a health care provider.
The FPS-R is a self-reported 6 point scale ranging from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;very much pain&quot;. Facial representations are used to indicate how much the pain hurts.</description>

    <measure>Change in pain intensity in the tapentadol open-label extension period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15; Day 379 (End of Part 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity will be assessed by scoring &quot;pain right now&quot; twice daily. &quot;Pain right now&quot; will be scored by every participant using the Visual Analog Score (VAS) as well as the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) at each time point.
In this part of the trial the pain intensity will first be documented using the VAS and directly thereafter the FPS-R. If required, pain intensity diary entry maybe assisted by the legal guardian or a health care provider.
Pain intensity on the VAS will be scored by the participant on a paper based 100 mm VAS ranging from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot;.
The FPS-R is a self-reported 6 point scale ranging from &quot;no pain&quot; to &quot;very much pain&quot;. Facial representations are used to indicate how much the pain hurts.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1; Day 14 (End of Part1)</time_frame>
    <description>Tapentadol-O-glucuronide is a metabolite of tapentadol. Metabolites are sometimes referred to as &quot;breakdown products&quot;. The body alters the administered medication to a metabolite so that can be more easily or quickly removed from the body. Tapentadol-O-glucoronide concentrations will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Subjective opiate withdrawal scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 386</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant will be requested to score 15 items on the 16 item questionnaire for 7 days after discontinuation of treatment. Opiate withdrawal symptoms will be assessed using the subjective opiate withdrawal scale (SOWS) questionnaire. The participants rate their experience on specific questions on a 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 64. THe SOWS is designed to reflect common motoric, autonomic, musculoskeletal and psychic signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1; Day 379</time_frame>
    <description>In the event that more than 10% of participants discontinue in one of the 3 study medication treatment groups a survival analysis will be performed.
The discontinuation from study medication due to lack of efficacy and due to treatment emergent events will be analyzed for both the tapentadol prolonged release and morphine prolonged release treatment arms in part 1 of the trial, as well as for tapentadol prolonged release treatment in part 2 of the trial.</description>
