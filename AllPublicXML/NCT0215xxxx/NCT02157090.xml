  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent clinical studies showed, that a hydrocolloid patch is effective, well tolerated and
      comparable with aciclovir cream 5 % for the treatment of HSL lesions, while affording
      additional benefits of wound protection, discretion and relief of social embarrassment. The
      aim of the actual study was the clinical assessment of the effectiveness and safety of
      Hansaplast® SOS Herpes Patch (HPHP) in comparison to Compeed® Herpes Vesicle Patch (CHP) in
      treating HSL. Both products are CE-certificated and are available at the market for medical
      devices.
