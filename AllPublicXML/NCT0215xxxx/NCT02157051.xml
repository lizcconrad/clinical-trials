      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of multiantigen deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) plasmid-based vaccine in treating patients with human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)-negative stage III-IV breast cancer. Multiantigen DNA plasmid-based vaccine
      may target immunogenic proteins expressed in breast cancer stem cells which are the component
      of breast cancer that is resistant to chemotherapy and has the ability to spread. Vaccines
      made from DNA may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of intradermal administration of up to 3 escalating doses of
      STEMVAC (CD105/Yb-1/SOX2 CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine) in patients with
      HER2-negative advanced stage breast cancer.

      II. To determine the most immunogenic dose of STEMVAC in patients with HER2-negative advanced
      stage breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether a STEMVAC T helper 1 cells (Th1) polyepitope plasmid based vaccine
      elicits a persistent memory T cell response and whether immunity can be further
      enhanced/maintained by two additional STEMVAC vaccines (boosters) given 3 and 9 months after
      the priming regimen.

      II. To evaluate whether STEMVAC vaccination modulates T regulatory cells and myeloid-derived
      suppressor cells (MDSC).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive CD105/Yb-1/SOX2/CDH3/MDM2-polyepitope plasmid DNA vaccine with recombinant
      human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhuGM-CSF) intradermally (ID) every
      28 days for 3 months and booster vaccines at 6 and 12 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up twice yearly for 5 years.
