    <textblock>
      Despite its therapeutic effectiveness in Parkinson's disease (PD) the current deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) strategy could achieve an even better clinical result by adapting to
      patient's condition. As intracerebral activity analyzed by recording local field potentials
      (LFPs) from DBS electrodes correlates to PD symptoms, a new stimulation approach would be an
      &quot;intelligent&quot; adaptive DBS system able to change stimulation settings automatically to the
      patient's needs using LFPs as control variable.

    <textblock>
      Despite their proven efficacy in treating Parkinson's disease (PD), deep brain stimulation
      (DBS) systems could be further optimized to maximize treatment benefits. In particular,
      because current DBS strategies based on fixed stimulation settings leave the typical
      parkinsonian motor fluctuations and rapid symptom variations partly uncontrolled, research
      has focused on developing a novel adaptive DBS (aDBS) system able to adapt moment-by-moment
      to the patient's clinical condition. aDBS consists of a simple closed-loop model designed to
      measure and analyze a control variable reflecting the patient's clinical condition to change
      stimulation settings and send them to an &quot;intelligent&quot; implanted stimulator.

      Intracerebral activity analyzed by recording local field potentials (LFPs) from electrodes
      implanted for DBS in the past 15 years has helped in clarifying basal ganglia pathophysiology
      and its relation to PD symptoms. Many LFP studies have revealed unknown functions of basal
      ganglia in PD patients during the execution of motor, cognitive, and behavioral task showing
      the existence of a &quot;code&quot; in LFP oscillations corresponding to the of patient's clinical
      condition. LFP-clinical correlations should provide the rationale for developing and
      implementing new aDBS devices able to adapt stimulation parameters moment-by-moment to the
      individual patient's needs using LFPs as a control variable for feedback.
