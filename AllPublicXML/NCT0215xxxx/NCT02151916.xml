    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a combination of pre- and post-natal
      preventive and behavioral interventions is effective in preventing early childhood caries in
      Indigenous children.

      Early childhood caries (ECC) causes profound suffering, frequently requiring expensive
      treatment under a general anesthetic. It is associated with other chronic childhood
      conditions such as otitis media and nutritional disorders, and is the strongest predictor of
      poor oral health in adulthood. Despite ECC being entirely preventable, marked ECC disparities
      exist between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. If
      the burden of ECC and associated oral health inequalities experienced by Indigenous children
      in these nations are to be reduced, more needs to be done to ensure that appropriate
      preventive measures, together with support for maintaining optimal oral health, are provided
      to caregivers of such children in the early life stages. This will be an interventional
      study, with all participants receiving the intervention benefits. Pregnant Indigenous women
      residing in the three countries, their families and communities will be included. The
      intervention will be implemented from birth and continue for the first three years of a
      participating child's life. It will involve four components; dental care provided to the
      mother during pregnancy, fluoride varnish applications for the child, oral health
      anticipatory guidance and motivational interviewing. Following an Indigenous research
      framework and methodology, the intervention will be tailored at the individual- or
      family-level, with each caregiver or family progressing to the next level only when they are
      ready. Developing a culturally-appropriate ECC intervention that aims to improve child oral
      health, in full partnership with the Indigenous communities involved, will provide much
      needed evidence for policy makers to address the challenge of improved oral health and
      related outcomes for Indigenous children.

      The study seeks to determine whether the implementation of a culturally-appropriate early
      childhood caries intervention reduces dental disease burden and oral health inequalities
      among Indigenous children. The study is part of a tri-nation research project entitled
      &quot;Reducing disease burden and health inequalities arising from chronic dental disease among
      Indigenous children: an early childhood caries intervention&quot;, being simultaneously conducted
      in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It was created in response to a Request for
      Applications for the International Collaborative Indigenous Health Research Partnership
      (ICIHRP) grant - a funding initiative of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the
      Health Research Council of New Zealand and the National Health and Medical Research Council
      of Australia.

      The Baby Teeth Talk (BTT) Study, the Canadian arm of the project, is a community-based
      participatory research project being conducted in partnership with Aboriginal communities and
      organizations. BTT targets expectant mothers and their newborns, over a three-year
      intervention period. BTT has successfully recruited over 500 pregnant First Nations and Metis
      women living in urban and on-reserve communities in Ontario and Manitoba in the past two and
      a half years. This 5-year study promotes and offers good dental care during pregnancy and
      uses Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Anticipatory Guidance (AG) to counsel mothers on
      caring for their children's teeth. Presently, study participants have all given birth and
      fluoride varnish is being applied to their babies' teeth twice per year for 3 years by First
      Nations and non-First Nations community-based researchers associated with the project. At the
      same time, mothers continue to receive MI and AG in an effort to address the dietary and oral
      health concerns of their children. The goal of the study's multi-pronged approach is to
      intervene early enough in the child's life to prevent the onset of early childhood caries, or
      at least, reduce the rates of the disease to levels comparable to the general Canadian
      population so that fewer Indigenous children require dental treatment under general
      anesthesia.

      The investigators have currently started the clinical oral examinations of the 2-year-old
      participants to assess the effectiveness of the investigators pre- and post-natal preventive
      and behavioral interventions to prevent caries in young Indigenous children. This is the
      point when the investigators collect the primary outcome data for the investigators project.

    <description>Three fluoride varnish applications to the teeth of children and oral health anticipatory guidance and motivational interviewing for the caregiver when the child is aged 24, 30 and 36 months. Dental care also will be offered to the mothers/caregivers in the delayed intervention group when their children are aged 2 to 3 years old. Before the children are aged 2 years, standard dental care will be the comparator, which usually involves provision of dental care only if the participant is in pain.</description>

    <description>Dental care during pregnancy, or soon thereafter, will comprise of a screening oral examination, extractions, restorations, scaling and prophylaxis, if needed, and will take as many dental visits as required to achieve a non-diseased mouth. Fluoride varnish application to the teeth of children in the immediate intervention group will occur when children are aged 6 to 10 months (time of tooth eruption), 12 and 18 months, as well as at 24 months. Oral health anticipatory guidance and motivational interviewing for the caregivers/mothers in the immediate intervention group will occur during pregnancy and when the children are aged 6-10 months (time of tooth eruption), 12 and 18 months.</description>
