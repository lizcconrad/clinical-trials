      Phase III clinical study for the evaluation of clinic and cardiologic effects of isosorbide
      mononitrate from the incidence of events (angina episodes).

      This is an open, comparative, monocentric trial. The hypothesis, regarding the number of
      angina episodes, to be tested are:

        -  H0: μD = 0 ot H0: μAfter = μBefore

        -  HA: μD ≠ 0 ot HA: μBefore ≠ μAfter

      Phase III study, monocentric, open, with a single treatment arm in patients with stable
      angina to evaluates efficacy and safety. The study will be sponsored by pelo Laboratórios
      Baldacci. All patients who participate in the study shall sign two copies of the informed
      consent form. The inclusion of patients is expected to last until 12 months from the approval
      of the Ethics Committee and ANVISA.

      Follow up will last at least 2 weeks for each included patient. A total of 86 patients will
      be recruited for this study and all of them will initiate treatment with 20 mg monocordil
      tablets. After 2 consecutive weeks using the investigational product (+2 days), the patients
      will be evaluated again, particularly for the parameters under study, this is, quantity and
      severity of angina episodes and adverse events. The selected patients shall also be 18-80
      years old of both genders, with proved diagnosis of stable angina through clinical exams such
      as ECG, physical effort tests or similar. Patients will receive 20mg monocordil tablets
      (Baldacci Laboratories).

      The evaluations will take place in two opportunities: one at the visit of medical evaluation
      and recruitment in the study (along with the deliver of the study medication and a diary) and
      the second one after 2 weeks (+2 days) of use of 20mg monocordil tablets for medical
      evaluation and discharge of the study (return of the diary and medication accountability).
