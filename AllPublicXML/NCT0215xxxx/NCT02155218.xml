    <textblock>
      In Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography (CE-MRA) a contrast agent is injected
      into an arm vein using a programmable medical device called a power injector. Once the
      contrast has circulated to the blood vessel of interest they can be imaged with MRI and
      distinctly separated from surrounding non-vascular tissue.

      This project is designed to find the best way to administer the contrast agent during CE-MRA
      to produce the best images. The clinical availability of programmable power injectors
      facilitates the use of variable contrast rate and volume injection protocols that are based
      on patient specific parameters.

      CE-MRA is a valuable imaging tool for diagnosing abnormalities of the major blood vessels in
      the chest and abdomen. It is often used in conjunction with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
      examinations to evaluate the blood vessels of the heart and lung. CE-MRA is attractive
      because 1) it does not involve radiation, and 2) the contrast agents used are not toxic to
      the kidneys and can be used in patients who are at greater risk for kidney dysfunction
      following iodinated contrast agents.

      We plan to administer a small (1cc) test amount of contrast, taking pictures as the contrast
      passes through the blood vessels, and analyze the results. Using this information, we will
      administer an individually patient-tailored injection given in multiple phases (i.e., a
      &quot;multi-phasic&quot; injection) to maintain constant contrast concentration (and therefore constant
      signal intensity) throughout the scan. We believe this will reduce image blurring, and
      improve the sharpness and likely the diagnostic quality of CE-MRA.

      This project will build and validate a tool designed to optimize the use of magnetic
      resonance (MR) contrast agents for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA).
      As with most angiography methods, contrast agents selectively highlight a patient's arteries
      as compared to surrounding tissue. In CE-MRA the contrast agent is injected into an arm vein
      using a programmable injector and transported by the body's circulation to the arteries of
      interest, at which point a MR acquisition depicts the arteries distinctly from surrounding
      soft tissue.

      At present, the clinically accepted method of injecting the contrast agent is essentially the
      same for every patient, and has not been systematically evaluated or optimized. For most
      chest and abdominal CE-MRA studies contrast is injected over 5-15 seconds, and the resultant
      concentration of contrast agent in the arteries over the duration of the MR acquisition is
      not well known. What this concentration is and how it varies over time, however, has a large
      impact on the quality and clarity of the resulting images. This project is designed to
      optimize the concentration of contrast agent in the arteries during the MR scan by using the
      predictive results of a small &quot;test bolus&quot; injection to tailor the actual contrast injection
      for each individual patient such that concentration remains as high and as constant as
      possible during the time of MR acquisition. This will be accomplished by developing
      algorithms and software tools to tailor the optimal, patient-specific injection parameters.
      The method will be validated in a preliminary clinical study.

      We propose that we can predict what the contrast bolus will look like (i.e., its
      &quot;concentration vs. time&quot;) by first administering a small (1cc) test bolus, taking pictures as
      the contrast passes through the blood vessels, and analyzing the results. Using this
      information, we believe that an individually patient-tailored injection given in multiple
      phases (i.e., a &quot;multi-phasic&quot; injection) can create constant contrast concentration (and
      therefore constant signal intensity) throughout the scan, eliminating this source of image
      blurring, and improving the sharpness and likely the diagnostic quality of first-pass CE-MRA.
      Moreover, by tailoring the contrast to the duration of the scan, the contrast agent is used
      most efficiently and not wasted outside the acquisition duration, potentially recouping any
      contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) loss. It is important to note the results of this study are
      generalizable to CT Angiography (CTA) as well, where similar efficient use of the contrast
      will reduce cost and excessive patient exposure to iodinated contrast. We plan to compare an
      &quot;optimized&quot; multiphasic contrast administration to a standard single phase contrast
      administration.

    <time_frame>During the one-time contrast-enhanced cardiac MR exam lasting approximately 45 to 60 minutes, signal intensity will be evaluated continuously before, during and after administration of contrast.</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the performance of the bolus-tailoring method, measured signal intensity profiles will be evaluated using residual sum-of-squares (RSS) between targeted and measured responses. A smaller RSS indicates agreement with the targeted signal intensity profile. Additionally, full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) and start time (10% signal intensity increase over baseline) of the signal intensity profile will be measured and compared between the two groups. T-test will be used to test for significant differences between the two methods.</description>

This will be approximately 30-40 cc, depending on patient size.
