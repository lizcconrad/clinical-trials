  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Canadian Respiratory Research Network (CRRN) has recently been established to study the
      origins and evolution of airways disease in the population. The CRRN is funded by the
      Institute of Cardio-respiratory Health (ICRH), an institute of the CIHR. The Physiology
      platform will support the other CRRN platforms (biology, imaging, population health,
      knowledge transfer) by providing a comprehensive characterization of the nature and extent of
      physiological impairment of respiratory function in smokers at risk for airways disease and
      in those with early or mild airway obstruction. The planned studies of the physiology group
      (core sites located at Queen's University, University of British Columbia and McGill
      University) will initially focus on smoking-related lung injury in those at risk for COPD and
      in those meeting spirometric criteria for mild airway obstruction, with or without
      respiratory symptoms. The primary aim of this initial study is to identify and validate
      sensitive test(s) of peripheral airway dysfunction that may qualify as physiological
      biomarkers for use in future CRRN studies.

    <description>There is no single measurement of small airway function since this study is evaluating which measurements, among a list of conventional and experimental physiological parameters, best characterize the nature and extent of impairment of respiratory function in the smoking study groups and which of these parameters best predict clinical outcome (i.e., dyspnea, exercise capacity, ventilatory capacity, health status). Assessments will include: spirometry, closing volume, impulse oscillometry, frequency dependence of dynamic lung compliance, plethysmographic lung volumes and metronome-paced dynamic hyperinflation.</description>

        Subjects will include 30 participants from each of the following four subgroups: GOLD grade
        1A COPD, GOLD grade 1B COPD, symptomatic smokers who do not meet spirometric criteria for
        COPD, and age- and sex-matched healthy non-smoking controls. Subjects will be recruited
        from the Canadian Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) study cohort and, once that
        source has been exhausted, from each site's database of previous or potential research
        study participants. The CanCOLD Study cohort was recruited from the COLD Study sample,
        which was a random sample of adults ≥40 years of age who had pre- and post-bronchodilator
        spirometry performed in order to estimate the prevalence of COPD in Canada.

    <criteria>

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Stable patients with GOLD grade 1 mild COPD will be included in the study if they have: a
        post-bronchodilator FEV1≥80 %predicted and an FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.7 and &lt;LLN; ≥40 years of
        age; and a cigarette smoking history ≥10 pack-years or ≥10 years of exposure to other
        inhaled substances (i.e., second hand smoke and/or biomass). Symptomatic (category B)
        subjects will have a Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) total score ≤9, a modified Medical
        Research Council (MRC) dyspnea score ≥2, or a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score ≥10.
        Asymptomatic (category A) subjects will have a BDI&gt;9, modified MRC&lt;2 or CAT&lt;10, no history
        of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms, and no history of using respiratory
        medications. Symptomatic current or ex-smokers (&gt;10 pack-year history) who do not meet
        criteria for COPD (e.g., post-bronchodilator FEV1&lt;80%predicted and FEV1/FVC&lt;0.7, with both
        measurements also &lt;LLN) and who are on no respiratory medication will be included.
        Symptomatic will be defined as: BDI≤9, modified MRC≥2 or CAT&gt;10. Healthy, age- and
        sex-matched, non-smoking (&lt;2 pack-year history) participants with normal spirometry will be
        used for comparison purposes.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  presence of clinically significant comorbidities that could contribute to dyspnea or
             exercise limitation (i.e., unstable heart disease, a pulmonary disease other than
             COPD, uncontrolled diabetes, neuromuscular or orthopedic impairment);

          -  history/clinical evidence of asthma;

          -  contraindications to exercise testing;

          -  &lt;40 years of age;

          -  body mass index &lt;18.5 or &gt;=35 kg/m2.
