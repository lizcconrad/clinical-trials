  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see primarily if BYL719 is safe to be given to patients
      in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is an
      FDA-approved regimen to treat pancreatic cancer. Secondary goals will be to find out the
      effect on tumor of this new drug combination of BYL719, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. In
      the first part of the study, different doses of BYL719 will be tested. In the second part of
      the study, all patients will be started at the same dose of BYL719.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 months per participant</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which one or none of 6 patients experience a Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Complete Response plus Partial Response (CR+PR). CR: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival of patients who receive at least one dose of the study drug at MTD.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).</description>
