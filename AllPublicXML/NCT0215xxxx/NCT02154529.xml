             positive for malignant cells

          -  Taking any medication known to inhibit the CYP3A4 isozyme or any drugs that are CYP3A4
             inducers (including phenytoin), or any drugs associated with torsades de pointes or
             known to prolong the QTc(f) interval within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 of treatment on
             study. A stable regimen of antidepressants of the SSRI class is allowed

          -  Evidence of active heart disease within the 3 months prior to study entry; symptomatic
             coronary insufficiency or heart block; congestive heart failure; moderate or severe
