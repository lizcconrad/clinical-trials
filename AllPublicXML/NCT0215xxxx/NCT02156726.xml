  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) combination is currently accepted as the gold
      standard in treatment of younger and physically fit CLL patients. These excellent results,
      however, cannot be generally applied to the whole CLL population. This is because the median
      age at diagnosis of CLL lies between 65 and 72 years and patients older than 65 years in fact
      account up to 50%-75 % of the CLL population. Nevertheless, such population is considerably
      underrepresented in most of the large clinical trials in CLL/SLL. Therefore, it is not clear
      whether elderly/comorbid patients could profit from newer treatment approaches such as purine
      analog combinations or chemoimmunotherapy. Several publications demonstrated unacceptable
      toxicity of full-dose FC/FCR in elderly CLL patients. However, regimens using attenuated
      doses of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide showed promising efficacy and low toxicity.

      The objective of this observational study is to provide additional data to confirm the safety
      profile and efficacy of low dose FCR for CLL patients treated in clinical practice.

      Specific data of interest are: comorbid concitions, concomitant medication, CLL
      characteristics, prior treatment regimens, adverse events, reasons for discontinuation low
      dose FCR, overal response rates, complete response rate, progression-free survival, overall
      survival.

      This is an observational, non-interventional, medical record review study in CLL patients. A
      total of 200 patients with CLL who have been previously treated with low dose FCR will be
      eligible for the study.
