      This study is being done to try out questions from a large set of questions called the
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (PRO-CTCAE). The PRO-CTCAE is a set of questions which asks patients about their symptoms.
      This study will look at properties of these questions and will provide information about how
      these questions can be improved for research studies. PRO-CTCAE questions were developed
      under a contract from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to allow patients to self-report
      symptoms in future cancer clinical trials. Patients with cancer receiving treatment will
      complete a web-based questionnaire containing PRO-CTCAE questions and a paper booklet
      containing a commonly used questionnaire for assessing quality of life, functioning, and
      symptoms at two visits one to six weeks apart. Some patients will additionally complete
      web-based questionnaires containing PRO-CTCAE questions weekly for four to five weeks, while
      completing a daily questionnaire containing PRO-CTCAE questions using an automated telephone
      system. Lastly, a small number of patients will complete only a single visit in which a
      web-based, telephone-based, and paper-based questionnaire containing PRO-CTCAE items is
      completed in addition to a paper booklet containing a commonly used questionnaire for
      assessing quality of life, functioning, and symptoms. The primary hypothesis is that scores
      for PRO-CTCAE questions will differ between patients with high versus low general well-being
      as measured by your doctor using a scale called the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      Performance Score.
