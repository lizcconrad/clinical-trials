  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic disease of increasing prevalence, being currently considered a global
      epidemic, including children, adolescents, adults and the elderly of different nationalities
      and ethnicities, socioeconomic levels, education levels. Non-pharmacological therapeutic
      interventions, such as physical exercise and fitness healthy eating strategies seem to be
      increasingly studied and recommended for healthy weight loss. In addition, therapies that can
      complement the effect of exercise and diet for reducing body weight are considerate important
      strategies. Thus, experimental evidence shows that the use of laser therapy combined with
      exercise swimming was effective in controlling the lipid profile, reducing the mass of
      adipose tissue, suggesting increased metabolic activity and changes in lipid metabolism.

      To investigate the effect of the use of therapeutic laser when associated to exercise like
      response to new therapy for weight loss and decrease of dyslipidemias levels.

      Methods:

      During 20 weeks, each patients will receive 3 session of exercise with duration of 1 hour.
      Each session of exercise will composed of aerobic exercise and resistence exercise. After
      training session, each patient will receive application of phototherapy during 16 minutes.
      The protocol of phototherapy appplication is described in link &quot;interventions&quot;
