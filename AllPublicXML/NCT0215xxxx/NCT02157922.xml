  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is assessment of efficacy and safety of OligoG as a dry powder
      formulation, in adult subjects with cystic fibrosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate efficacy of inhaled OligoG measured by FEV1, and
      supported by secondary endpoints including Mucociliary Clearance, rheology,microbiology and
      Quality-of-Life.

      The secondary objectives are

        1. To demonstrate the safety and tolerability of inhaled OligoG as a dry powder for
           inhalation after multiple dose administration; and

        2. To evaluate patient compliance with treatment.

      The design will be randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, cross-over
      phase II study. Mucociliary and Cough clearance (MCC) will be an exploratory endpoint in a
      subset of 24 patients, and Lung Clearance Index (LCI) an exploratory endpoint in another
      subset of 20 or more patients.

          -  Aged 18 years or older

          -  Positive microbiological finding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in expectorated sputum or
             cough swab within 24 months prior to Screening

          -  FEV1 between 40%-100%

          -  At Screening no clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of significant pulmonary
             illness, other than CF

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential and sexually active male subjects must use
