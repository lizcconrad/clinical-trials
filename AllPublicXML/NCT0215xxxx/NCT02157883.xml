  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part study in patients with EGFRm+ non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose
      disease has progressed on an EGFRm TKI, who are refractory or resistant to standard therapy.
      Part A will assess the effect of multiple oral doses of itraconazole on the single dose
      pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of AZD9291. On completion of Part A, patients may continue to
      take AZD9291 tablets (Part B) following the collection of the 216 hour sample on Day 19 if
      they and the Investigator deem it appropriate, until such time as their disease progresses,
      the Investigator believes they are no longer deriving clinical benefit, or they stop taking
      AZD9291 for any other reason.

             months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and with LH and
             FSH levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution; documentation of

             drugs w/in 14 days of the first dose of study treatment; Major surgery (excluding
             placement of vascular access) within 4 weeks of the first dose; Radiotherapy with a
             limited field of radiation for palliation within 1 week of the first dose of study
             treatment, with the exception of patients receiving radiation to more than 30% of the
             bone marrow or with a wide field of radiation which must be completed within 4 weeks
             of the first dose of study treatment; Patients currently receiving (or unable to stop

          6. Any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled
             hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, which in the Investigator's opinion makes
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study or which would jeopardise
             compliance with the protocol, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C
             and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not
