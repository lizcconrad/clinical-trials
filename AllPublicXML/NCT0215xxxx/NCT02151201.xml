    <textblock>
      We evaluated the impact of viewing an educational video about influenza vaccination in
      pregnancy just prior to a routine prenatal visit on vaccination health beliefs and
      vaccination rate. We hypothesized that the video would positively impact both vaccination
      health beliefs and vaccination rate compared to a control video.

      We studied the impact of influenza in pregnancy video education that was developed by the CDC
      and currently available to the public on the internet. We looked to see if viewing the video
      just prior to a routine scheduled prenatal visit could positively influence health beliefs
      regarding vaccination and improve the rate of vaccination that day. Patients were randomized
      to view the intervention video or a control video of similar length about hand washing. Pre
      visit and post visit questionnaires were given about vaccination health beliefs. We also
      asked if the shot had been recommended by the physician. One month after the visit, we used a
      structured phone interview to gather additional information regarding why participants who
      had not been vaccinated made that choice.
