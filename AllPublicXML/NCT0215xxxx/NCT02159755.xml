      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of ibrutinib and palbociclib in
      treating patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma. Ibrutinib and palbociclib may
      stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Palbociclib may also help ibrutinib work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the
      drug.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of ibrutinib plus PD 0332991 (palbociclib) in patients with
      previously treated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and select the recommended phase 2 dose
      schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the toxicity profile of ibrutinib plus PD 0332991 (palbociclib). II. To
      estimate the overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rates.

      III. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS). IV. To estimate the response duration
      (RD).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the genomic profile of MCL cells pre-treatment and at relapse. II. To estimate
      the pharmacokinetic profile of ibrutinib when given concurrently with PD 0332991
      (palbociclib).

      III. To evaluate the level of cell-free tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) over time in
      conjunction with response to therapy.

      IV. To evaluate the presence of circulating MCL cells over time.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and palbociclib PO QD on
      days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
