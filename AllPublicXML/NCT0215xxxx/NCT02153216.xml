      This study is the Formative Phase of a larger study; once this phase is completed, enrollment
      into the randomized controlled trial (RCT Phase) will begin. The primary objective of the
      Formative Phase is to gain a better understanding of the context in which drinking alcohol
      among ART client in Vietnam occurs, in order to culturally tailor the intervention to be
      tested in the RCT Phase. Formative Phase activities will consist of up to 40 in-depth
      interviews with hazardous drinkers who are either: a) ART clients in one of the ART clinics
      in Thai Nguyen, or b) who are people who inject drugs (PWID) that are not recruited from the
      ART clinics (whom we will refer to as general population PWID).
