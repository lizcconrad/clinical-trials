  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults living in subsidized housing report poorer health. Their age and low income make
      it harder for them to use community services. Many older adults have heart disease and
      diabetes, which lead to frequent emergency calls and hospital admissions. To decrease the
      costs of treating heart disease and diabetes through emergency and hospitalization, improved
      screening and health education is needed. Our program will take place in communal areas
      within housing buildings of older adults and deliver a heart disease, diabetes, and falls
      risk check-up with health education. This is expected to improve the health of older adults
      leading to fewer emergency calls and hospital visits.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Canadian Diabetes Risk (CANRISK) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The CANRISK tool provides a 10-year risk of diabetes score and will be administered by the paramedic during the CHAP-EMS session.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after each assessment (up to one year)</time_frame>
    <description>Since the participants are invited to attend the intervention weekly, but are not required to attend, the number of assessments and time of assessments will vary. Multilevel analysis will be conducted that accounts for this variance in repeated measures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health perceptions, behaviours, and knowledge of resources</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A face-to-face survey will be administered to determine participant health perceptions, behaviours, and knowledge.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health Care Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Health Care Utilization will be assessed through administrative databases (e.g. hospital visits). Utilization by residents in the intervention apartment buildings will be compared to baseline and compared to the control apartment buildings.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in rate of EMS Calls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Rate EMS calls by residents in the intervention apartment buildings will be compared to baseline and compared to the control apartment buildings.</description>
