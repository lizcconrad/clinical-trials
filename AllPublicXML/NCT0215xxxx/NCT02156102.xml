      Background:

      - People with sickle cell disease and other blood disorders sometimes get chronic leg ulcers.
      These are wounds that develop on the skin and don t go away. Current treatments do not work
      very well, so researchers want to learn more about why the ulcers happen. They want to find
      out which bacteria may cause it, and if external factors play a role.

      Objective:

      - To study social and environmental factors of sickle cell disease and the causes of sickle
      cell disease leg ulcers.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 18 and older who have sickle cell disease or another red cell disorder, with or
      without an active leg ulcer.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a medical history and clinical evaluation. They will also have
           blood drawn.

        -  Participants will complete questionnaires about their life, health, environment, stress,
           and other topics.

        -  Participants may provide a small sample of hair.

        -  Participants will be asked to collect a small amount of saliva.

        -  Participants with leg ulcers will have their skin microbiome sampled. The microbiome is
           all of the microbes (bacteria and and/or fungi) and their genes in and on the body.
           Researchers will use swabs to collect skin samples. Photographs will be taken of the
           skin sample area.

        -  Some participants without leg ulcers also will have their skin microbiome sampled.

        -  Some participants who have their skin microbiome sampled will return for a second visit.
           At this visit, their microbiome will be resampled. It will take place more than 30 days
           after the first visit.

      Leg ulcers are a serious and debilitating complication of sickle cell disease (SCD). This
      study will explore microbial, genomic, and environmental (social and physical) factors, that
      may influence the onset and progression of leg ulcer formation and delayed healing in
      individuals living with SCD. There is variation in the incidence and duration of SCD leg
      ulcers. They are often very painful, resistant to treatment, and recurrent in nature. The
      etiology of SCD-associated leg ulcers is unclear, and we hypothesize that predisposition to
      developing leg ulcers is multifactorial. This multisite study is an exploratory study of the
      microbiome and environment of individuals living with sickle cell disease leg ulcers. The
      study s objective is to identify triggers that may be integral in leg ulcer onset and
      progression. The central goal of this study is to obtain an improved understanding of the
      participants clinical phenotype, leg ulcer microbiome and the psychosocial and environmental
      factors that may impact this complication. To achieve these goals, we will: (1) characterize
      the leg skin microbiome of SCD participants living with and without leg ulcers within the
      United States; (2) collect and analyze psychosocial and physical environmental data of
      individuals with SCD without leg ulcers and with leg ulcers; (3) examine the psychosocial
      impact of leg ulcers on individuals with SCD by conducting a qualitative phase to explore the
      individual experiences to understand the physical function, stigma, and self-esteem
      associated with those with active, recurrent, or single-occurrence presentations of leg
      ulcers; and (4) explore what factors influence psychological resilience, to examine the
      relationship of psychological resilience to the health outcomes of an adult population living
      with sickle cell disease in the U.S. This will afford participants the chance to expound upon
      existing questions and will provide us the opportunity to understand the complexity of
      participants experiences and quality of life.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Each subject must meet all of the following inclusion criteria during the screening process
        in order to participate in the study:

          -  All subjects must have a diagnosis of sickle cell disease (HbSS, HgSC, HbSB 0 or
             HBSB+)

          -  Be at least 18 years old.

          -  Provide written informed consent.
