      TITLE : A Multicenter, Prospective, Observational Trial on the Prognostic and Dynamic Change
      of CTC Enumeration in Advanced NSCLC with 1st or 2nd line chemotherapy and targeted therapy

      BACKGROUND : Circulating tumor cells (CTC) identification is a new field of research in
      oncology, and some studies have been conducted with success on breast and prostate cancer.
      Nearly 80% of lung cancers are diagnosed in an advanced stage (IIIB, and IV). CTC
      identification and monitoring these cells after treatment could help the clinicians to detect
      relapse or be a prognostic factor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To study the relationship between CTC count and clinical outcome of
      treatment (Overall response rate and Progression-free survival).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES :To study the relationship between CTC and overall survival.

      STUDY DESIGN : This is a prospective, observational study.

      Duration of the inclusions: 12months.

      SAMPLE SIZE : 1200 patients

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational non-intervention study evaluating the dynamic CTC count
      during the chemotherapy and targeted-therapy. Patients provide written informed consent and
      pass the screening. Peripheral blood will be drawn before and after the treatment.
      Relationship between CTC count and clinical outcome will be analysed. The time points of
      blood drawing are set as following: for patients receiving chemotherapy, once prior to 1st
      cycle of chemotherapy, once 3 days prior to 2nd cycle of chemotherapy, posterior to 3th cycle
      (or less than 4th cycle) of chemotherapy and once when progressive disease (PD); for patients
      receiving targeted-therapy, once prior to treatment, once 1 month after treatment, and once
      when PD. The clinical outcome of treatment will be ultimately obtained.
