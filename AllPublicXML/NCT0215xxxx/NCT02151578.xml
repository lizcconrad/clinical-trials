    <textblock>
      A well-implemented community-based program of early and appropriate treatment of
      fevers/malaria episodes and pneumonia,will improve child survival as measured by a reduction
      of the less than five mortality rate.

      An integrated approach of home and community management of malaria and pneumonia may increase
      the proportion of children receiving prompt treatment; improve child survival as measured by
      a reduction of the under five mortality rate. To test this hypothesis, a cluster randomised
      controlled trial will be performed, involving children less than 5 years of age, in Burkina
      Faso using a community-based supplying community health workers (CHWs), a core group of
      mothers (KOLs) with Coartem and cotrimoxazole specially packed in age-specific blisters
      containing a full course of treatment. The study will be carried out in 111 clusters of a
      rural district in Burkina Faso where malaria and pneumonia are two major mortality causes in
      under five mortality.
