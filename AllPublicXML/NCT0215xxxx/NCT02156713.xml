  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) is an intervention for unilateral cerebral palsy
      (CP). It is currently part of standard of care for children with unilateral CP, but is
      typically done one-on-one and with the child wearing a cast 24 hours a day during the
      duration of treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of an intensive
      group-based CIMT summer camp in which participants wear a removable cast on upper extremity
      function, occupational performance, and patient-specific goals. The investigators hypothesize
      that upper extremity skills and occupational performance will increase, and that patients
      will reach their individualized goals.

    <measure>Change in Canadian Occupational Performance Measure Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure asks parents to rate their child's level of occupational performance as well as how satisfied they are with it both before and after treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Parents and therapists identify appropriate goals for the child to achieve at the end of therapy. The therapist then identifies &quot;levels of attainment&quot; for each individual goal.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Manual Ability Classification System Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The Manual Ability Classification System is an observation-based measure of upper extremity function in individuals with cerebral palsy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pediatric Motor Activity Log Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>This caregiver questionnaire addresses how often and how well a child uses his or her affected extremity outside of the therapy setting.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5</time_frame>
    <description>This is an observation-based measure during which the therapist evaluates the quality of an individual's upper extremity movement with regard to dissociated movement, grasp, protective extension, and weight bearing.</description>
