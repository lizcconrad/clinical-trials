    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized trial to evaluate and compare the quantitative and
      qualitative characteristics of neointimal formation between high and low efficacy statin
      treatment after drug eluting stent (DES) implantation, in patients with homogeneous or
      heterogeneous neointimal pattern accessed by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The
      investigators postulate that high efficacy statin could have superior effect on modification
      of neointimal pattern, compared with lower efficacy statin. Our main hypothesis is that
      Atorvastatin 40mg, high efficacy statin might have superior effect on modification of
      neointimal pattern evaluated by serially followed OCT, compared with pravastatin 20mg in
      patients with DES implantation.
