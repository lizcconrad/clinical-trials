  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is one the challenge in the field of artificial reproductive
      technology (ART) while there is still no effective resolution of this disorder. In patents
      with DOR, the pregnancy rate is about only 2-4%. Eventually, patients with DOR turn to adapt
      children instead. In recent studies, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) supplement might play a
      role in reverse diminished ovarian reserve and improve the prognosis of ART. Cumulus cells,
      formed cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) with oocyte, play a important role in folliculogenesis,
      oocyte maturation, oocyte meiosis and ovulation. Growing evidences disclose there are
      crosstalks between oocyte and cumulus cells as paracrine regulations. Aberration the
      crosswalks between oocytes and cumulus cells would be associated with poor prognosis of
      folliculogenesis and further pregnancy outcomes. In patients under ovarian hyper-stimulation
      protocol, the assessment of cumulus cells might be reliable indicators of folliculogenesis,
      embryo development, pregnancy rate and pregnancy outcomes. These genes (indicators), such as
      Hyaluronan synthase（HAS2), Versican (VCAN), Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), Runt-related
      transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), Chromobox homolog 3 (CBX3),Tripartite motif-containing 28
      (TRIM28), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2)，BCL2-associated X protein (BAX). This study was assess the
      gene expressions of cumulus cells after the DHEAS supplement in patients with DOR under
      ovarian hyper stimulation protocol.

      This study was designed as a prospective case-control study to assess the gene expression of
      cumulus cells after DHEAS supplement. Patients with diminished ovarian reserve under ovarian
      hyper-stimulation protocol were evaluated at Kaoshiung Veteran General Hospital from January
      1, 2013 through October 31, 2013. Approval for the study was obtained from the hospital`s
      ethic committee, and informed consent was obtained from all patients (VGHKS13-CT11-17)
