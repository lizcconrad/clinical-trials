      A phase 2 open label trial to test a potential drug treatment for Rett syndrome, the leading
      known genetic cause of severe neurological impairment in girls. The drug, Copaxone (generic
      name - Glatiramer acetate) is medication FDA approved for the treatment of multiple
      sclerosis. Copaxone's high safety profile has been documented in large cohorts of patients
      for more than 12 years.

      Background/rationale for the study:

      In Rett syndrome brain cells aren't actually lost, instead poor maturation of connections
      between brain cells (synapses) prevents effective neurological functioning, and is the main
      morphological feature of the disease. The MeCP2 gene plays a major role in transcriptional
      regulation of other genes, one of which is the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic
      factor (BDNF).

      The disease progression and severity of symptoms is directly affected by the level of BDNF
      expression. An increase of BDNF levels (by genetic manipulations or pharmacological agents)
      leads to delayed onset of Rett syndrome-like symptoms in experimental models; rescued
      gait/mobility, improved quality of life and increased survival rates.

      Copaxone treatment by subcutaneous injection caused elevation of BDNF levels. Quantitative
      immunofluorescence assays showed about a twofold increase in neuronal expression of BDNF
      following Copaxone treatment.

      We expect that an increase in BDNF levels with Copaxone administration will stimulate
      communication between brain cells (synaptic maturation), which will lead to amelioration of
      symptoms (motor functions/gait, cognitive functions, breathing, encephalopathy and improve
      quality of life) for girls with Rett syndrome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients with genetically confirmed RTT

          -  Age: 10 or more years old. Selection of the age is based on the available evidence of
             the safety of GA in this group, and the relative homogeneity/stability of the
             phenotype, which is not expected to spontaneously change within a 6 month period at
             this age

          -  Ambulatory (with our without support)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prolonged Qtc (obtained within 30 days prior to enrolment)

          -  Presence of co morbid non-Rett related disease

          -  Presence of immunodeficiency requiring IVIG 3 months prior to enrollment

          -  Allergy/sensitivity to GA or mannitol

          -  Inability or unwillingness of legal guardians to give written informed consent
