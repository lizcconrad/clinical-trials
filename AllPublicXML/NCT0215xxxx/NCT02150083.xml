  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common condition that affects up to 35% of women. Many
      surgical procedures have been developed to treat SUI, and midurethral slings have gradually
      become the first line treatment. Voiding dysfunction, or inability for a patient to empty her
      bladder, immediately after surgery is common. A bladder test is often performed in the
      recovery area to see if the patient is able to empty her bladder. This typically consists of
      filling the bladder with 300 mL of saline through the foley catheter. The catheter is then
      removed and the patient is asked to void. The investigators then measure the voided volume
      and the residual left inside the bladder to determine if she is able to empty her bladder
      sufficiently or not. A successful voiding trial is defined as voiding 2/3 of the total volume
      in the bladder and having less than 100 mL left inside the bladder as residual. Our goal of
      this study was to evaluate efficiency and effectiveness of a retrograde postoperative voiding
      trial that is initiated in the operating room. Our hypothesis was that a retrograde
      postoperative voiding trial initiated in the operating room would be as effective as a
      standard retrograde postoperative voiding trial to predict postoperative voiding dysfunction
      while allowing for patients to spend less time in the recovery unit.

    <description>At completion of sling placement in the operating room, the bladder will be filled retrograde via a cystoscope with 300 mL sterile saline or water to inspect for bladder perforation. The cystoscope is removed and the foley catheter is NOT replaced for the duration of the surgery. The surgery is completed and the patient is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. Once she is able to ambulate, she will be instructed to void. The voided volume and residual volume will be recorded.</description>

The cystoscope is removed and the foley catheter is replaced for the duration of the surgery and when complete the patient is transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. Once she is able to ambulate, she will undergo a retrograde bladder fill with 300 mL of normal saline. The foley catheter will be removed and she will be instructed to void. The voided volume and residual volume will be recorded.</description>
