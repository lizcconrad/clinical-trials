  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hysterectomy is one of the most performed surgery in gynecologic surgery. Actually, 70 000
      hysterectomies are performed each year in France. Laparoscopic surgery is in progression. The
      percentage of hysterectomies performed laparoscopically is increasing. The advantage of
      laparoscopy include fewer infections, less operative pain, faster recovery time and shorter
      hospital stay. In France, the average of hospital stay after laparoscopic hysterectomy
      reduced to 3-4 days.

      The study hypothesis is that a shorter postoperative stay does not decrease the quality of
      life of the patients.

      This study will compare the evolution of quality of life (with a questionnaire concerning
      measuring health related quality of life the Euroqol EQ-5D) of patients discharged after 3
      days hospital stay to patients discharged the first day after a laparoscopic hysterectomy.
