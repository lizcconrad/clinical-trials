    <textblock>
      Compromised peripheral tissue oxygenation during surgery may lead to worse patient outcome,
      mainly due to post-operative infections or heart failure. Insufficient stroke volume and/or
      cardiac output due to hypovolemia or cardiac defects play a central role in causing poor
      peripheral tissue oxygenation. In order to assess stroke volume, there are numerous invasive
      and non-invasive methods available. Up to the present date it is unknown, if these methods
      may by used interchangeably in patients with severe cardiac defects like aortic stenosis.
