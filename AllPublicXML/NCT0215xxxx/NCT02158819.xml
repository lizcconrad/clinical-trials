  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose and primary objective of this study is to compare health economic outcomes
      between the use of a patient-matched cutting guide (Visionaire) versus the use of standard
      instrumentation in Total Knee Arthroplasty(TKA). Data will be collected pre-operatively,
      intra-operatively and post operatively up until and including the six week post-operative
      assessment. The secondary objectives of the study are to compare safety and early readmission
      rates between the two techniques. The study hypothesis is that there is no difference in the
      cost of the episode of care from hospital admission to discharge, including pre-operative
      radiology costs and cost of resources, with the Visonaire patient-matched cutting guide
      compared to standard instrumentation.

      This is a prospective, randomised pilot study comparing the health economic outcomes between
      TKA using standard instrumentation and TKA using a patient-matched cutting guide. The primary
      indication for this study is degenerative arthritis of the knee requiring unilateral primary
      total knee arthroplasty. Patients requiring TKA who are eligible and have consented to
      participate will be randomised to TKA with The Genesis II™ Total Knee Implant System or the
      Legion™ Primary Total Knee System using either Visionaire™ patient-matched cutting guides or
      standard instrumentation. The study will recruit for 1 year and patients will have a final
      follow up at the six week post-operative assessment.

      The primary objective of this study will evaluate the cost of the episode of care from
      hospital admission to discharge. This will include pre-operative costs, anesthetic costs,
      operative and theatre costs, costs of instruments and resources. The study will also measure
      length of stay as well as blood transfusion requirements. The secondary objectives of this
      study are to compare the safety and early readmission rates between the two techniques, by
      measuring the complication rates intra-operatively and post-operatively as well as the number
      of patients readmitted to hospital prior to the six week post-operative assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Degenerative arthritis of the knee requiring unilateral primary Total Knee
             Arthroplasty in subjects for whom the use of patient-matched cutting guides or
             standard instrumentation are, in the surgeon's opinion, clinically appropriate and
             acceptable forms of treatment;

          -  Patient is of legal age to consent and is skeletally mature;

          -  The patient is able to fully understand the purpose of the trial, and his/her role as
             a participant in the study

          -  The patient consents to his/her inclusion in the study after the nature, scope and
             possible consequences of the study have been explained in an understandable form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is known to have poor bone stock making a Total Knee Arthroplasty
