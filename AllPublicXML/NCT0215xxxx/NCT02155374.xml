      Objective: to determine which regimen results in best glycemic control and safety profile,
      expressed as glucose values within target range and occurrence of hypoglycemia. Secondary
      objective is to compare patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes and toxicity.

      Study design: Randomized open label cross-over study Study population: Patients ≥ 18 years,
      who developed glucocorticoid induced hyperglycemia requiring initiation or adjustment of
      antihyperglycemic agents in a previous chemotherapy cycle. Patient should have ≥2 cycles of
      chemotherapy scheduled, with 3-10 consecutive days of ≥12,5mg prednisone-equivalent
      glucocorticoid and a wash-out period of 4-38 days between each cycle.

      Intervention: subjects will be treated by insulin regimen A and B in random order during two
      consecutive cycles of chemotherapy. A) intermediate acting insulin 0.01 IU / mg
      prednisone-equivalent / kg body weight once daily subcutaneous B) Short-acting insulin
      according to sliding scale regimen, dose adjusted to current grade of hyperglycemia.

      Main study parameters: Difference in fraction of blood glucose measurements (BGM) within
      target range and occurrence of hypoglycemia.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Both study treatments are just a slight variation in regular care for
      glucocorticoid induced hyperglycemia. Glycemic control is likely to improve due to treatments
      and increased counselling. All subjects will receive both treatment regimens.

      The burden consists of 16-32 extra BGMs over 2 x 4-10 days, wearing the glucose sensor, 1
      venipuncture (if HbA1c and creatinin are not determined in routine laboratory within 3 months
      before start), and 1 randomization visit to the outpatient clinic. Potential risk is the
      occurrence of hypoglycemia, as is present in any insulin therapy. The investigators account
      for this risk by giving subjects dietary advice and education how to prevent, recognize and
      treat hypoglycemia.
