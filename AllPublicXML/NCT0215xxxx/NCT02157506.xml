  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose finding, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of continuous
      6-hour IV infusions of CXL-1427 in hospitalized patients with systolic heart failure which
      will first evaluate up to four ascending dose levels of CXL-1427 in up to four cohorts of 8
      patients each (the &quot;Dose Escalation&quot; cohorts). Subsequently, up to three of the initial dose
      levels of CXL-1427 may be assessed in the additional &quot;Expansion&quot; cohorts of up to
      approximately 16 patients to gain further confidence in the results at these dose levels. The
      CXL-1427 dose that will be evaluated in the first cohort will be 3µg/kg/min. The dose levels
      for the next three sequential Dose Escalation cohorts will be dependent on clinical safety
      and tolerability, as well as the results of the invasive hemodynamic measurements.

          -  Be ≥ 18 and ≤ 85 years of age;

          -  Have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%, as assessed by
             echocardiography, a multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan or magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) within 3 months prior to or during the current hospitalization;

          -  Be hospitalized with a primary heart failure or heart failure-related reason, e.g.,
             acute decompensation of heart failure, transplant evaluation, hemodynamic optimization
             prior to ambulatory inotropes or left ventricular assist device placement;

          -  Have an indwelling pulmonary artery (PA) catheter in place for assessment of central
             hemodynamic parameters; [Note: The indwelling catheter may already be in place for
             medically-indicated reasons, OR be placed for the primary purpose of monitoring the
             hemodynamic effects of the study drug. If the pulmonary artery catheter is to be
             placed for the sole purpose of monitoring the hemodynamic effect of the study drug,
             the patient must have a cardiac index (CI) ≤ 2.2L/min•m2 as measured by a non-invasive
             cardiac output monitor (NICaS device) ≤6 hours prior to placement of the catheter. In
             this setting, Exclusion Criteria 3 below also applies.]

          -  Have a Fick and/or thermodilution determination of cardiac index ≤2.5L/min•m2 at
             screening, i.e., ≤4 hours before the intended start of the study drug infusion; [Note:
             For determinations of CI using the thermodilution method, a mean of three consecutive
             values measured approximately 5 minutes apart, none of which differs from the mean
             value by more than 15%, should be used.]

          -  Have a screening and baseline PCWP (or PAD, if a PCWP waveform cannot be reliably
             obtained) of ≥20 mmHg if systolic blood pressure is ≥100mmHg OR ≥22mmHg if systolic
             blood pressure is between 95-99mmHg (inclusive);

             IV or oral vasoactive medications, including diuretics, for at least ~10 hours, i.e.,
             from 4 hours before performing baseline hemodynamic assessments until after the
             completion of the 6-hour study drug infusion;

          -  Have a body weight of at least 50kg (110 pounds), but not more than 125kg (275

             with the inpatient and outpatient study protocol requirements for the duration of the
             study (screening period, treatment period, and 30-day post-infusion follow-up period);
             and be willing to participate in the study, as documented by written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria- - In order to be eligible for study participation, a patient MUST NOT:

          -  Have a heart rate &lt;50 or &gt;110 beats per minute (bpm) at baseline;

          -  Have a screening OR baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) of &gt;150mmHg or &lt;100mmHg, if
             PCWP ≥ 20mmHg, but &lt;22mmHg OR &lt;95mmHg, if PCWP ≥ 22mmHg;

          -  Have tricuspid or pulmonary valve prosthesis or endocarditis, right heart mass, a
             history of pneumothorax or hemothorax, a bleeding diathesis that would preclude
             placement of a PAL, or a history of complications from previous pulmonary artery
             catheter placement, when a pulmonary artery catheter is to be placed solely for the
             purposes of monitoring the hemodynamic effects of the study drug; In this setting,
             patients with multiple intracardiac leads and/or left bundle branch block should have
             such elective pulmonary artery catheter placement performed under radiologic guidance
             by experienced personnel, e.g. in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. [Note: Other
             pertinent history, such as trauma, vascular injury or previous surgery should guide
             selection of the vessel for PAL placement.]

             cardiomyopathy, idiopathic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (as defined by any wall

             nitroprusside within 4 hours, or with levosimendan, amrinone or milrinone within 8
             hours, prior to performing baseline hemodynamic assessments, or have an anticipated
             need to be treated with any of these agents before the completion of the 6-hour study
             drug infusion;

          -  Be receiving concomitant parenteral therapy with any antiarrhythmic drugs (oral
             therapy is allowed);

          -  Be in atrial fibrillation/flutter with an uncontrolled rate (≥100bpm) at the time of
             randomization; [Note: Patients with a history of A-fib/flutter are eligible, if heart
             rate is controlled with a ventricular rate not exceeding 100bpm.]

          -  Have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) of 10 beats or more during any
             bedside monitoring within 2 hours prior to randomization, or have excessive premature
             ventricular contractions (PVCs) or complex multifocal ventricular ectopy exceeding 10

             after the completion of the study drug infusion;

          -  Have a history of sudden cardiac death/resuscitation or other appropriate ICD firing
             within the past 1 year. (Inappropriate ICD firings are not exclusionary);

          -  Be hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome or acute myocardial infarction during the
             previous 90 days prior to randomization;

          -  Have a history of a cerebral vascular accident (CVA or stroke) or of a transient
             ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months prior to randomization;

             the study drug infusion;

          -  Have persistent abnormal serum electrolytes at baseline, as defined by: a Na+
             concentration &lt;130 or &gt;145 mEq/L, or a K+ or Mg2+ concentration outside the normal
             range (according to the local laboratory); [Note: Any observed electrolyte
             abnormalities during screening or earlier should be corrected by electrolyte
             supplementation and within normal acceptable concentrations should be confirmed prior
             to dosing. Any serum electrolyte abnormalities with associated clinical instability
             within 8 hours before initiation of the study drug infusion is exclusionary.]

             30mL/min/1.73m2 according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
             equation] within 8 hours before initiation of the study drug infusion;
