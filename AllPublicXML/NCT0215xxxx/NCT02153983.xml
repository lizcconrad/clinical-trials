      Background:

      - Being overweight may cause low-level inflammation. This inflammation may cause some of the
      medical problems of obesity, like high blood sugar (diabetes) and heart disease. This study
      will test whether a medication called colchicine can improve metabolism in adults who are
      overweight but have not yet developed diabetes.

      Objectives:

      - To learn whether colchicine improves sugar regulation and metabolism.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy overweight adults18 to 100 years old.

      Design:

        -  Participants must fast before each visit, including the screening visit.

        -  Participants will be screened with blood tests,urine tests, medical history, and
           physical exam. They will have to drink sugar water, and have blood drawn to find out if
           they are healthy.

        -  For visit 1, participants will have a medical history and physical exam and answer
           questions. They will have blood taken with an intravenous (IV) line, give urine sample,
           and give 2 stool samples..

        -  Also, subjects will get sugar water through one IV. Blood will be drawn from the other.
           This measures sugar and insulin levels. During this, participants will lie in a bed and
           can watch TV.

        -  Participants will have a full-body X-ray, lying on a table while a camera passes over
           them. They will also have an abdominal CT scan, lying on a table that moves through a
           ring that takes pictures.

        -  Participants will have a small fat tissue sample taken from their abdomen. It is like
           getting a mini-liposuction.

        -  Participants will be given the study drug or placebo. They will take it twice daily for
           3 months.

        -  For visit 2, participants will have blood tests, urine tests, medical history, and
           physical exam.

        -  For visit 3, participants will repeat the tests in visit 1.

      Obesity affects one-third of the adult U.S. population and is a major risk factor for the
      development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Mouse models and human data
      suggest that obesity-induced chronic inflammation is one mechanism promoting
      obesity-associated comorbid conditions. In obesity, innate immunity is activated by
      circulating molecules such as fatty acids and cholesterol crystals bind to nucleotide-binding
      oligomerization (NOD)-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) receptors in
      adipocyte tissue macrophages (ATMs). This binding stimulates NLRP3 oligomerization,
      inflammasome formation, and proinflammatory cytokine activation. The resultant inflammatory
      cascade leads to insulin resistance and decreased pancreatic beta-cell reserve. It has been
      proposed that the suppression of this chronic low-level inflammatory state may impede the
      onset of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

      Recent studies have shown colchicine, a potent microtubule inhibitor commonly used for the
      treatment of gout and some rare inflammatory conditions, disrupts intracellular localization
      of NLRP3, thereby blocking inflammasome assembly. As there are limited medical therapies
      proven effective to improve obesity-related metabolic dysregulation, we propose to determine
      the efficacy of colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily in non-diabetic obese adults with metabolic
      syndrome. We will conduct a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial of
      colchicine in forty subjects. We will study changes in insulin resistance, beta-cell reserve,
      and systemic inflammation. Using adipose tissue obtained from biopsies, we will also study
      colchicine s local effects on inflammation and insulin resistance. Should results prove
      promising, this pilot study will allow determination of the sample size needed for an
      adequately powered study of the effects of colchicine in obese adults with metabolic
      syndrome.

      Seven patients with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes will be given open-label colchicine and
      followed as described above. We also plan to perform baseline evaluations on 40 subjects who
      are not eligible for the treatment protocol. This group will consist of non-obese adults,
      obese adults who are not insulin-resistant, and adults with diet-controlled type 2 diabetes.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED TO COLCHICINE or PLACEBO::

        Subjects will qualify for randomization to colchicine or placebo if they meet the following
        criteria:

          -  Good general health. In general subjects should take no medications. However,
             individuals taking medications for obesity-related co-morbid conditions, who have not
             had changes in dosage for more than 3 months, may be included, at the discretion of
             the principal investigator.

          -  Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m^2, but
             weight less than 450 lbs in order for subjects to undergo Dual-Energy X-ray
             Absorptiometry (DXA) scanning.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 to 100 years.

          -  Metabolic Syndrome

             --(Any 3 of the following 5):

               -  FPG greater than or equal to 100 mg/dl, or Impaired Glucose Tolerance (Glucose
                  greater than or equal to 140 mg/dl at 2 hours of OGTT)

               -  Triglycerides greater than or equal to 150 mg/dl, or on treatment

               -  Waist Circumference: Men greater than or equal to 40 in (greater than or equal to
                  102 cm); Women greater than or equal to 35 in (greater than or equal to 88 cm)

               -  Reduced HDL-C: Men &lt; 40 mg/dl; Women &lt; 50 mg/dl, or on treatment

               -  Hypertension: greater than or equal to 130 mmHg systolic, or greater than or
                  equal to 85 mmHg diastolic, or on treatment

          -  HOMA-IR greater than or equal to 2.6. Our goal is to enroll participants who have
             pre-existing insulin resistance.

          -  hsCRP greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/L. We aim to recruit participants with increased
             baseline level of inflammation. Individuals with hsCRP above 2.0 mg/L have been shown
             to have an increased risk for cardiovascular events.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED TO COLCHICINE OR PLACEBO:

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus, as determined by either having:

               -  Clear clinical diagnosis of diabetes, such as a patient in a hyperglycemic crisis
                  or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose greater than or
                  equal to 200 mg/dL

               -  Two of the following three:

                    -  Fasting plasma glucose greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL

                    -  Hemoglobin A1c greater than or equal to 6.5%

                    -  An oral glucose tolerance test glucose concentration of greater than or
                       equal to 200 mg/dL at 2 hours.

               -  One of the above three criteria (bi.-biii.) meeting the T2DM cutoff on two
                  different days. If only one of the above three criteria (bi.-biii.) meet the T2DM
                  threshold during the Screening Visit, that test will be repeated on another day
                  to determine if the subject has T2DM or not. As per ADA guidelines, The diagnosis
                  [of T2DM] is made on the basis of the confirmed test.Moreover, because HbA1c has
                  been shown to be higher in African Americans (AA) as compared to other races for
                  the same glycemia, non-diabetic AA may be unfairly excluded by their HbA1c alone.
                  Therefore, for AA subjects, if their 2 hour OGTT and fasting glucoses are in the
                  non-diabetic range, and the HbA1c is &lt; 7.0%, we will consider them non-diabetic.

          -  Presence of a significant active or chronic illness likely to limit life span and/or
             increase risk of intervention, including renal (GFR less than or equal to 60
             ml/min/1.73m2), cardiovascular, hepatic (other than obesity-related steatosis),
             gastrointestinal, immunologic, endocrinologic (e.g. Cushing syndrome), pulmonary
             (other than either asthma not requiring continuous medication or sleep apnea-related
             disorders), or other disorders at the discretion of the investigators.

          -  Recent use of colchicine or anorexiant medications in the last 3 months.

             condition that in the opinion of the investigators would impede competence,
             compliance, or participation in the study.

          -  Subjects who regularly use prescription medications unrelated to the complications of
             obesity, especially those known to affect enzymes involved in colchicine metabolism,

             on a case-by-case basis; depending on the medication, subjects who have continued to
             take prescription medication or have stopped taking an exclusionary medication for at
             least 3 months prior to study entry may be eligible .

          -  Participation in a formal weight loss program (e.g. Weight Watchers) or recent weight
             change of more than 3% of body weight in the past two months.
