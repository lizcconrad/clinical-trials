  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety and tolerability profile of
      escalating dose levels of ENV8058 (TAK-058) solution when administered as a single oral dose
      in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called ENV8058 (also known as TAK-058). ENV8058 is
      being tested to find a safe and well-tolerated dose and to assess how ENV8058 moves
      throughout the body. This study will look at side effects and lab results in people who took
      ENV8058. This study was designed as a randomized, sequential-panel, single rising dose study.

      The study population will consist of 6 Cohorts with 8 participants in each Cohort; with 6
      participants randomized to receive a single dose of ENV8058, and 2 participants to receive
      placebo. Participants in each Cohort will receive a single dose of study drug after a 10-hour
      fast. The starting dose is 15 mg followed by administrations of 30, 45, 15, 75 and 150 mg.

        -  ENV8058 (Tak-058): 5, 15, 30, 45, 75 or 150 mg oral solution

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive) - this oral solution looks like the study drug but has no
           active ingredient

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 14 days. Participants will make 2 visits to the clinic,
      including one 5-day period of confinement to the clinic. All participants will be contacted
      by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

             ms (females) or PR outside the range of 120 to 220 ms, confirmed with one repeat
             testing, at the Screening Visit or Check-in (Day -1) Visit.

         22. Has abnormal Screening or Check-in (Day -1) laboratory values that suggest a
             clinically significant underlying disease or participant with the following lab
             abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             &gt;1.5 the upper limits of normal.

         23. Has a risk of suicide according to the Investigator's clinical judgment (eg, per
             Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [CSSRS] or has made a suicide attempt in the
