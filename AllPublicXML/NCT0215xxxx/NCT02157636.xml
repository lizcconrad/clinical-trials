        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (aged ≥ 18 years)

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma that has
             progressed despite at least one line of standard therapy

          -  Must have measurable disease, defined by one or more of following: (i) a serum M
             protein &gt; 0.5 g/dl measured by serum protein electrophoresis; (ii) urinary M protein
             excretion &gt; 200 mg/24 hours; (iii) serum free light chain (FLC) measurement &gt; 10
             mg/dl, provided that the serum FLC ratio is abnormal

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2

          -  Adequate hematological, renal, hepatic, and coagulation laboratory assessments

          -  Written informed consent to participate in this study before the performance of any
             study-related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current infection with HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of CPI-0610, including any unresolved nausea, vomiting, or
             diarrhea that is CTCAE grade &gt;1

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of
             the following:

               -  Acute myocardial infarction or angina pectoris ≤ 6 months prior to starting study
                  drug

               -  Serum cardiac troponin (cTn) level ≥ 99% percentile of the upper reference limit

               -  QTcF &gt; 470 msec on the screening ECG

               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50%

          -  Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia (patients with rate-controlled atrial fibrillation are
             not excluded.)

          -  Any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition that
             could compromise participation in the study (e.g., clinically significant pulmonary
             disease, clinically significant neurological disorder, active or uncontrolled
             infection)

          -  Systemic anti-cancer treatment or radiotherapy less than 2 weeks before the first dose
             of CPI-0610

          -  Treatment with an investigational small molecule less than 2 weeks before the first
             dose of CPI-0610. In addition, the first dose of CPI-0610 should not occur before a
             period equal to or greater than 5 half-lives of the small molecule investigational
             agent has elapsed

          -  Treatment with a therapeutic antibody less than 4 weeks before the first dose of
             CPI-0610. A minimum 2-week period between the last treatment with a therapeutic
             antibody and the first dose of CPI-0610 may be permitted in patients with rapidly
             progressive myeloma, following discussion with the medical monitor

          -  Treatment with medications that are known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP450 enzymes

          -  Treatment with medications that are known to carry a risk of Torsades de Pointes

          -  Immunosuppressive treatment that cannot be discontinued both prior to study entry and
             for the duration of the study. Oral prednisone at a dose of 10 mg or less per day is
             allowed, as are other oral corticosteroids given at glucocorticoid-equivalent doses.
             Topical, nasal and inhaled corticosteroids are also allowed

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men with reproductive potential, if they are
             unwilling to use adequate contraception while on study therapy and for 3 months
             thereafter

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the study protocol
