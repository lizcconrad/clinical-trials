    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is an immune-abnormal, chronic, proliferative skin disease characterized by scaly,
      erythematous patches and papules. An epidemiological survey found Chinese prevalence showed
      an upward trend in recent years. The disease has great influence on patients'
      appearance,health and quality of life. Some Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) therapies have
      shown long lasting therapeutic effect on controlling psoriasis vulgaris and with minimal side
      effects.CHM can alleviate the symptoms effectively,and reduce the recurrence rate of
      diseases. PSORI-CM01（YXBCM01）granule is one kind of CHM which is observed effective and safe
      to treat stable stable plaque psoriasis with blood stasis syndrome in clinical practice.
