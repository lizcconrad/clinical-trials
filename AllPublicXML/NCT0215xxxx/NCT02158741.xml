    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this research is to examine and compare the effectiveness and costs of
      a community-based intervention to support self-management with usual primary care for older
      adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and multiple chronic conditions and their family
      caregivers. Once the study is complete, the investigators will be able to determine if there
      is any measurable difference in self-care management between usual care plus the intervention
      versus usual care alone.

      Research Goal

      To examine the comparative effectiveness and costs of a community-based intervention to
      support self-management with usual primary care for older adults with T2DM and Multiple
      Chronic Conditions and their family caregivers.

      Objectives

        1. To determine if a 6-month, IP, community-based intervention improve self-management
           compared with usual primary care services?

        2. To compare the effectiveness of the intervention on HRQoL, physical activity,
           nutritional status, depression, anxiety, diabetes parameters (blood glucose levels
           [HbA1c, hypoglycemic episodes]), diabetes-related complications, number of vascular
           events, social support number of falls, fall risk and medication safety with usual
           primary care services?

        3. To determine the effectiveness of the intervention on HRQoL of family caregivers
           compared with usual primary care?

        4. To assess whether or not the intervention improves clinical practice behaviours?

        5. To determine the 6-month costs of use of health services of the intervention compared
           with usual care, from a social perspective?

        6. To identify which subgroups of older adults with T2DM and MCC benefit most from the
           intervention?

        7. To determine the effectiveness of the intervention based on sex/gender and region?

        8. To determine the overall feasibility and acceptability of an IP community-based health
           promotion intervention and what can be identified as barriers and facilitators to
           implementation?

    <description>The SDSCA is a multidimensional measure of diabetes self-management with adequate internal and test-retest reliability, and evidence of validity and sensitivity to change. The revised SDSCA consists of items that assess the following aspects of the diabetes regimen: general and specific diet, exercise, blood-glucose testing, foot care, and smoking. Scores are calculated for each of these five regimen areas. This data is collected by the interventionists at each visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF12v2</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of study (6 months from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement is used to assess Health related quality of Life. This survey consists of 12 questions that measure functional health and well-being from the client's perspective. It provides scores for eight health domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health), and psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>CES-D-10</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and end of study (6 months from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D has been used in prior studies of older adults with mood disorders, and has a high degree of reliability, content, construct and criterion related validity, distinguishes between depressed and non-depressed people, and is a sensitive tool for measuring changes in depressive symptoms over time in psychiatric populations.</description>
