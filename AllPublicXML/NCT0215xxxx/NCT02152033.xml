      The purpose of this project is to develop and test a Home-based Continuing Care intervention
      that will help parents support the recovery of their Young Adult (YA) child who is leaving
      residential substance abuse treatment. The two phase pilot study will 1) interview 50 parents
      and 50 YAs recruited from residential treatment programs and from parent groups to inform the
      development of the intervention and 2) conduct a two-arm pilot study that will recruit a
      maximum of 20 parents and their young adult children into one of two conditions (Home-based
      Continuing Care [HCC] intervention group or Services as Usual [SAU] comparison group) with
      the main goal of determining whether conducting such an intervention is acceptable and
      sustainable, and to collect preliminary efficacy data. We hypothesize that pilot testing will
      indicate that: (a) HCC is acceptable and potentially sustainable; (b) conducting a randomized
      clinical trial is feasible, and (c) the magnitude of outcomes from HCC will be clinically
      meaningful.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several models of continuing care (CC) have been studied for adolescents and Young Adults
      (YAs) including online relapse prevention, brief telephone counseling and Assertive
      Continuing Care (ACC). Five sessions of in-person therapy or brief telephone counseling both
      have reduced relapse in youth completing treatment relative to a no CC condition, consistent
      with a growing body of research with adults supporting the efficacy of telephone-based CC
      (TCC). ACC has been thoroughly evaluated for adolescents. Some applications also have
      incorporated contingency management (CM) for engaging in activities including needed
      services; but ACC has not applied CM to biologically-verified abstinence -- an efficacious
      approach in adult CC. A significant drawback of ACC is that it is quite intensive, requiring
      extended clinician training and home visits. This increases the costs of the intervention and
      the difficulty of dissemination and implementation; therefore we plan to develop a less
      clinician-intensive continuing care model for YAs.

      The two phase pilot study will 1) interview 50 parents and 50 YAs recruited from residential
      substance abuse treatment programs and from parent groups to inform the development of the
      intervention and 2) conduct a two-arm pilot study that will recruit a maximum of 20 parents
      and their YA children into one of two conditions (Home-based Continuing Care [HCC]
      intervention group or Services as Usual [SAU] comparison group) with the main goal of
      determining whether conducting such an intervention is acceptable and sustainable, and to
      collect preliminary efficacy data. We hypothesize that pilot testing will indicate that: (a)
      HCC is acceptable and potentially sustainable; (b) conducting a randomized clinical trial is
      feasible, and (c) the magnitude of outcomes from HCC will be clinically meaningful.

    <description>All sessions will occur over the phone or Cisco WebEx meetings. Parents will participate in 5 individual sessions and 1 joint session with their child (45-50 min. each). Young Adults (YAs) will participate in 1-3 individual meetings (30- 45 min. each) and 1 joint session (45-50 min.). In addition, YAs will be contacted weekly for the first 8 weeks of HCC, then every other week for the remaining 24 weeks (20 calls total). He or she will be asked questions addressing risk and protective factors for relapse. Finally, parents will be trained to collect and test their child's urine sample and deliver incentives to the YA contingent upon biologically-verified abstinence and verified engagement in continuing service plan activities. Urine samples will be collected regularly over a 32 week period.</description>

    <description>Young Adults (YAs) will be told to follow the continuing service plan recommended by the residential treatment program. Parents will be told to support this and be sent information on continuing care developed by the Treatment Research Institute and the Partnership @ Drugfree.org (http://continuingcare.drugfree.org). We will provide no supplemental services during the study. We will train parents; however, on how to collect urine samples for research purposes only. They will not be trained on how to test the urine sample, only how to collect it and mail the sample to our staff for testing. We will offer separate 4 hour-workshops to parents and YAs after they have completed participation as an added study participation incentive for this group.</description>
