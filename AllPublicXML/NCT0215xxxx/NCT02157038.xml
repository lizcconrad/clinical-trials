  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating whether changes in the shape and size of bodily muscles and
      spinal cord anatomy can influence recovery rates following a motor vehicle collision (MVC).
      The objective is to demonstrate that the presence of muscle and spinal cord degeneration and
      associated muscle weakness is the consequence of a mild MVC-related injury involving the
      cervical spinal cord.

    <textblock>
      Whiplash is a condition that consists of patients that display varying degrees of pain and
      disability. Most patients should expect full-recovery within the first 2-3 months post
      injury. At the other end of the spectrum is a group of patients (~ 25%) who continue to have
      moderate-severe pain-related disability in the long-term. Reasons for this transition to
      chronicity are largely unknown. The situation would benefit if there were radiological
      findings of the disorder. However, clear and consistent findings of injured tissues on
      standard radiological exams remain elusive.

      As part of this study, the investigators will innovatively investigate measures to 1)
      quantify the temporal development of widespread muscle degeneration, 2) identify quantifiable
      markers of altered cervical spinal cord physiology, 3) quantify reductions in central
      activation and fatigue 4) evaluate potential genetic variants that may be associated with
      chronic pain after a MVC and 5) determine the mediational influence of psychosocial factors
      on recovery rates following whiplash injury, as a potential mechanism underlying the
      transition to chronic pain.
