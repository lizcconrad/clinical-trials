      in subjects with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 4 parallel treatment groups.
      Subjects will be screened for up to 28 days before study drug administration to ensure that
      all eligibility criteria are met. On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 dose groups
      of 15 subjects each (INCB047986 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, or placebo QD). Study drug will be self
      administered on Days 1 through 28. A follow-up telephone call to the subject to assess safety
      will occur at Day 42. A final safety and efficacy evaluation will be performed at the Day 58
      visit.
