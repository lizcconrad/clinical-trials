  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 3 month randomized intervention study is to investigate the additional
      effect of a physical activity telecoaching program on physical activity in patients with
      COPD, compared with usual care.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this 3 month, randomized (1:1 ratio), parallel-group, multicenter trial, patients in both
      groups (control and coaching) will receive information and guidance on the benefits
      associated with increased physical activity in COPD patients and their health status.
      Patients in both groups will use two PROactive monitors (ActiGraph® and DynaPort®) and a PDA
      to complete the PROactive questionnaire. In addition to above, the patients in the coaching
      group will receive daily coaching by a semiautomated system and coaching by the investigator
      during study visits.

    <description>The coaching program consists of a (1) Step counter used as a coaching activity monitor to collect number of steps walked by the patients and (2) the Linkcare System, a mobile phone or tablet PC placed in the patient's home to collect data from the step counter. The system will set a daily activity goal for the patient based on achieved activity levels which will be measured by the step counter. Patients will also receive feedback, motivational and educational messages and direct calls from the coaching team at each institution.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed

          -  Male and female patients ≥ 40 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of COPD (GOLD criteria: post bronchodilator FEV1/FVC&lt; 70%)

          -  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history equivalent to at least 10 pack years

          -  Patient should have at least 4 days of physical activity data recorded via PROactive
             monitors during 7 days prior to the baseline measurement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Orthopedic, neurological or other complaints that significantly impair normal
             biomechanical movement patterns, as judged by the investigator. Specifically if the
             patients' condition/ co-morbidities are such that physical activity cannot be
             increased, then they should not be enrolled

          -  Respiratory diseases other than COPD (e.g. asthma)

          -  Cognitive reading impairment and/or difficulties to manage electronic devices
             precluding interaction with the smartphone and PDA, as judged by the investigator

          -  Participating in or scheduled to start an outpatient rehabilitation program during the
             study. If the patient wishes to participate in pulmonary rehabilitation for any reason
             the patient can be enrolled in the study only at the end of rehabilitation
