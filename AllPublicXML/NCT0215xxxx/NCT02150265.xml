      Background: There is need for more effectiveness studies concerning treatment of emotional
      symptom problems indicating anxiety and depression in adolescents. SMART is the only
      treatment manual for combined emotional disorders developed in Norwegian.

      Purpose: To find the best individualized treatment for adolescents with emotional
      difficulties by: Finding criteria for the selection of appropriate patients for treatment
      with cognitive-behavior therapy program SMART in an outpatient population (14-18 years).
      Finding predictors of completion of treatment program SMART. Examining the effects of
      treatment with the SMART program at 6 months follow-up.

      Design: A randomized controlled study in six outpatient clinics in the north of Norway. N=
      160 referred adolescents (14-18 years) with score above 6 on the Emotional Problems scale of
      the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Two thirds are treated according to the
      SMART-manual immediately, while the waiting list control group is treated with SMART after
      six weeks.
