  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have increased rates of hepatic steatosis
      compared to weight similar women with regular menses. It is unclear if this is related to
      high testosterone or insulin resistance. The investigators will assess hepatic glucose
      release, rates of lipolysis and hepatic de novo lipogenesis in the fasted and postprandial
      state to determine if alterations in the processes contribute to hepatic steatosis. Subjects
      will be overweight, sedentary girls with or without PCOS who are not receiving medical
      therapy for insulin resistance, or PCOS.

  <detailed_description>

      Hepatic glucose release will be assessed with a stable isotope glycerol tracer, lipolysis
      with a glycerol tracer, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis with an acetate tracer. Data will be
      collected fasting and after a glucose challenge. The degree of hepatic steatosis and
      abdominal fat partitioning will be assessed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and total
      body composition with Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).
