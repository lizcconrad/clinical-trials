      The purpose of this survey is to assess the safety of freeze-dried live attenuated measles
      and rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8 strain/TO-336 strain) (freeze-dried live
      attenuated measles and rubella combined vaccine &quot;Takeda&quot;) in terms of the occurrence of
      unknown/known adverse drug reactions and factors that may influence the safety of vaccinees
      after the second vaccination.

      This survey was designed to assess the safety of freeze-dried live attenuated measles and
      rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8 strain/TO-336strain) (freeze-dried live attenuated
      measles and rubella combined vaccine &quot;Takeda&quot;) in terms of the occurrence of unknown/known
      adverse drug reactions and factors that may influence safety after the second vaccination.

      Freeze-dried live attenuated measles and rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8 strain/TO-336
      strain) is dissolved in 0.7 mL of accompanying reconstitution fluid (water for injection
      [Japanese Pharmacopoeia]), wherein a 0.5-mL portion is typically administered subcutaneously
      as a single dose.

      In addition, freeze-dried live attenuated measles and rubella combined vaccine (Schwarz FF-8
      strain/TO-336 strain) should be used in accordance with the &quot;Regulations for Vaccination&quot; and
      the &quot;Guidelines for Routine Vaccination.&quot;

    <description>Serious ADRs are defined as serious adverse events (SAE) which are in the investigator's opinion of causal relationship to the study treatment. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Frequency of adverse events and factors that may influence safety were not to be assessed as endpoints of this study and were registered as endpoints by mistake. Instead, ADRs were assessed as endpoint.</description>

    <description>ADRs are defined as adverse events (AEs) which are in the investigator's opinion of causal relationship to the study treatment. AE are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product reported from the first dose of study drug to the last dose of study drug.</description>
