      The purpose of this survey is to examine the safety and efficacy of long-term use (96 weeks)
      of leuprorelin acetate SR (slow release) 11.25 milligram (mg) for injection (Leuplin SR 11.25
      mg for Injection) in premenopausal breast cancer patients in daily medical practice, as well
      as to examine factors that can influence the safety and efficacy of treatment with
      leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg for injection (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg for Injection).

      This survey was designed to examine the safety and efficacy of long-term use (96 weeks) of
      leuprorelin acetate 3 months depot for injection (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg for Injection) in
      premenopausal breast cancer patients in daily medical practice, as well as to examine factors
      that can influence the safety and efficacy of treatment with leuprorelin acetate SR 11.25 mg
      for injection (Leuplin SR 11.25 mg for Injection).

      For adults, 11.25 mg of leuprorelin acetate is usually administered subcutaneously once every
      12 weeks. Prior to injection, the plunger rod of the syringe is pushed upward with the needle
      pointed upward, allowing the entire suspension fluid contained to be transferred to the
      powder. The powder is then fully suspended in the fluid while ensuring that bubbles are not
      generated.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse drug reactions are defined as adverse events (AE) which are in the investigator's opinion of causal relationship to the study treatment. AE are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product reported from the first dose of study drug to the last dose of study drug.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Reporting One or More Serious Adverse Drug Reactions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse drug reactions are defined as serious adverse events (SAE) which are in the investigator's opinion of causal relationship to the study treatment. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. The event occurred was breast cancer female</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Advanced or Recurrent Breast Cancer (Best Response)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24, 48,96</time_frame>
    <description>Best overall response for a participant is the best observed post-baseline disease response as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0 criteria. Objective response was defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined on 2 consecutive occasions greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 4 weeks apart, using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). CR: The disappearance of all target lesions and all non-target lesions, normalization of tumor marker level, and no new lesions. PR: Disappearance of all target lesions and persistence of &gt;= 1 non-target lesions and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, or, at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and no new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to documented disease progression or death on study (ie, death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study drug), whichever occurred first. Disease progression was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For patients who experienced no disease progression and did not die while on study, data were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate PFS.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Recurrence-free Survival Who Were Treated With the Drug as Adjuvant Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Recurrence-free survival was determined in participants who were treated with the drug as adjuvant therapy, and tabulated, based on the date recurrence is confirmed, the presence or absence of recurrence, continued survival or death, and the date of death.</description>

        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to documented disease progression or death on study (ie, death from any cause within 30 days of the last dose of study drug), whichever occurred first. Disease progression was at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. For patients who experienced no disease progression and did not die while on study, data were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate PFS.</description>
