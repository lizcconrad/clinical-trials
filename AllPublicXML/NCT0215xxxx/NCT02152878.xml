  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive brain stimulation therapies have been increasingly investigated in recent years
      as a treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly mood disorders. They are
      particularly appealing since many patients are either refractory or present side effects to
      standard pharmacological regimens. TDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation). a novel
      non- pharmacological brain stimulation technique, might help in overcoming some of these
      issues, since it has low cost, high portability and it is relatively easy to use. TDCS
      consists in applying a weak, direct current through two electrodes placed over the scalp; the
      anode and the cathode increasing and decreasing cortical excitability during and beyond the
      period of stimulation. It is also a safe technique with only mild adverse effects described.
      Previous studies, some of them from our group, have described that tDCS is an effective
      technique for major depression. However, the role of tDCS as a treatment for bipolar
      depression (BD) has been insufficiently investigated. Therefore, our aim is to address the
      antidepressant effects of tDCS in BD in a randomized, sham- controlled trial in a refractory
      sample.

      BD represents the greatest burden on patients with bipolar disorder, since the depressive
      episodes are the most frequent and also particularly associated with suicide 7. BD treatment
      is controversial, with some stricter guidelines recommending only lithium, lamotrigine and
      quetiapine as a first-treatment, whereas others allow the use of antidepressants (which can
      increase manic switch and should be used in association with mood stabilizers) and other
      anticonvulsants and antipsychotics 8. For refractory BD the available level I evidence is
      very scarce, with only seven studies exploring this issue hitherto 9. Therefore, the
      importance of this study proposal is justified considering the burden of the disease, the
      paucity of current therapeutic studies and the promising results presented for tDCS in
      unipolar disorder.

    <description>For active tDCS, we will place the anode and the cathode over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex areas, respectively (corresponding to F3 and F4 according to the EEG 10-20 system). We will use 5x5 cm electrodes and a 2mA current for 30 minutes per day. This montage is known as &quot;bifrontal&quot; setup and has been previously used in major depression trials</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  bipolar depressed (type I, II or not otherwise specified) participants with symptoms
             in spite of an adequate treatment course with mood stabilizers.

          -  the depressive episode has to be of at least moderate intensity (baseline HDRS&gt;=16)

          -  read and understand Portuguese

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  other neuropsychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia, substance dependence,
             dementias, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and so forth (although participants with
             anxiety disorders can be included whether the primary diagnosis is BDD);

          -  mixed states, defined as simultaneously presenting (hypo)manic symptoms with a Young
             Manic Rating Scale (YMRS) &gt; 8;

             equivalent).
