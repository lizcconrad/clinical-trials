      The specific aim of the study is to determine the false negative rate of the Metabiomics
      Colon Polyp and Colorectal Cancer Assay for Cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to conduct clinical research to investigate the association of
      the gut microbiome with colonic neoplasia. In this case several types of gut microbiome
      samples will be collected from patients undergoing colectomy for colonic adenocarcinoma;
      those samples will be tested by Metabiomics Colon Polyp and Colorectal Cancer Assay and the
      percentage of false negative (test returns a negative for cancer) results determined.
