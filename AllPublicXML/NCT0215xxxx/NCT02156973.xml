  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coming for a cardiac test can be a daunting experience. Despite providing written information
      sheets for patients, experience in the scanner demonstrates that many patients are
      ill-prepared when they attend for cardiac computed tomography (CT). Heart rate control is
      essential for high image quality, as this prolongs cardiac diastole (during which imaging
      occurs) and results in less motion blur, but this may be challenging to achieve in the
      context of an anxious patient. In such situations, additional radiation exposure is required
      to optimise the chances of diagnostic images. Thus, poor patient selection and preparation
      has been shown to increase the radiation burden to the patient, as well as to increase the
      rate of non-diagnostic scans, leading to patients needing additional, alternative testing.
      This can be distressing for patients and increases downstream costs for the hospital. Poor
      patient awareness is also known to increase the anxiety of attending for a test.

      Improved patient information and understanding has been shown to improve outcomes in a wide
      variety of hospital settings. Evidence from cardiac catheterisation angiography suggests that
      the use of alternative information formats can reduce patient anxiety and improve patient
      satisfaction, as well as improving their understanding of the technical requirements of a
      test. The latter may contribute to improved preparation - for example, patients who do not
      understand the requirements for cardiac CT, particularly the need for a slow heart rate, will
      often consume caffeine, stop their heart-slowing drugs, or even run or cycle to their
      appointment.

      We have agreed a collaboration with Plymouth University to create patient information videos
      for CT. These will utilise the expertise of media students (their department also runs a
      commercial arm, due to the quality of their output), in conjunction with the clinical
      requirements and patient participation groups, to create an accessible, engaging and
      informative film. We wish to evaluate the impact of this method of conveying information to
      patients on how well they are prepared to undergo testing.

      If this concept is successful, it may be of use to patients undergoing a huge range of tests
      or treatments across specialities. We therefore need to demonstrate the efficacy (or
      otherwise) of such an intervention.

    <description>Patients attending for CT coronary angiography all receive an information leaflet with their appointment letter, and a brief verbal description of the scan by the radiographer immediately before it is undertaken, as standard care. All patients attending will be offered the opportunity to complete a short questionnaire (until all patients are recruited - anticipated to be 4 weeks). The Speilberger State-Trait Anxiety Index has been abbreviated and validated for use in outpatient settings to gauge levels of pre-procedural anxiety. This will be undertaken on arrival and repeated immediately before the scan, to see if patients feel better prepared after the standard interaction with staff.</description>

    <description>The patient video will be introduced to Group Two once Group One has been completed. In addition to the information sheet these patients (again, for four weeks or until recruitment is complete) will be sent an internet hyperlink to its presence on YouTube (video-sharing website) and the Hospital website with their appointment letter. Patients who do not have internet access will be offered the opportunity to see the video in the preparation room while waiting for their scan. Questionnaires will be administered as before, again done twice to examine any late impact of the information on patient anxiety, and the patient will undergo their test.</description>

    <description>A six minute information film to address the common themes raised by patients. This will clearly show the scanner, discuss the use of beta-blockers and radiation, and explain the likely side effects of x-ray dye (which can be alarming if patients are not expecting them). In this way we hope patients will be better prepared for the scan.</description>
