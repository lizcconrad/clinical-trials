    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform face transplants on people who have suffered severe
      facial trauma with tissue and functional loss; and evaluate the acceptance and function of
      the transplanted tissue. The aim of the transplant is to provide patient a more normal
      appearance . Additionally we aim to restore functioning, movement, and sensation of their
      face including that of the lips, mouth, and eyes.

      This study is to perform facial transplants in patients with severe facial deformities or
      facial wounds from traumatic injuries. The transplant is to help reconstruct a person's
      damaged face. The aim of the transplant is to provide patient a more normal appearance .
      Additionally we aim to restore functioning, movement, and sensation of their face including
      that of the lips, mouth, and eyes.

      There are some procedures in plastic and reconstructive surgery that can repair the look of a
      patient's face, but often can't replace the movement and use of the face. Currently, patients
      with severe facial deformities would undergo several reconstructive surgeries with their own
      tissues, called autologous transplant. Conventional reconstruction method requires multiple
      surgeries in order to form and shape the transplanted tissue. Because this type of
      reconstruction is limited, it does not provide a reliable return in function, sensation, and
      appearance for the damaged parts of the face.

      This study uses a composite tissue allograft , or face transplant from a donor who is brain
      dead such as in heart, kidney and liver transplants. The damaged parts of the face could
      return movement as well. Transplanted patients are required to take lifelong
      immunosuppression drugs which have risks, which are still a consideration when deciding to
      choose this option for correcting severe facial deformities.

      We will conduct the surgery and prospectively follow the patient to monitor signs of
      rejection of the transplanted face. Additionally, patients will be constantly evaluated for
      clinical and functional outcomes and ensure that optimal results are achieved.
