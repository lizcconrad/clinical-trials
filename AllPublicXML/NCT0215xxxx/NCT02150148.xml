  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer survivorship has been claimed a national priority, with a call to develop effective
      interventions that can prevent, delay, or mitigate the adverse effects and comorbidities in
      this high risk population. Strong evidence exists that a healthful diet and regular physical
      activity can prevent many chronic diseases and improve physical function. More research
      however is needed to develop interventions that can produce long-term adherence to healthful
      lifestyle behaviors. This pilot study is based on the hypothesis that vegetable gardening
      interventions will be feasible and result in improvements in diet and exercise behaviors as
      well as improvements in physical functioning and well-being.

      The proposed feasibility study relies on the extant infra-structure of the Alabama
      Cooperative Extension Master Gardener Program. A total of 46 older (≥65 years) cancer
      survivors recently diagnosed with a loco-regionally staged cancer with a good prognosis
      (i.e., ≥ 80% 5-year survival) and with 2 or more physical function limitations will be
      recruited from select rural and urban counties in Alabama and randomized to 1-of-2 study
      arms: 1) an intervention group that receives a 1-year mentored vegetable gardening
      intervention that pairs cancer survivors with certified Master Gardeners, or 2) a usual care
      control group that is observed during the year, but receives the gardening supplies at study
      completion. Aims of this study are to: 1) explore the feasibility and acceptability of a
      mentored vegetable gardening intervention by assessing accrual, retention, adherence,
      fidelity, and possible adverse events, 2) obtain means and precision estimates, and explore
      between-arm differences on pre-post changes in physical function and secondary endpoints
      (e.g., quality of life, fruit &amp; vegetable intake, physical activity, etc.), and 3) to explore
      participant factors associated with program efficacy (e.g., gender, comorbidity).
