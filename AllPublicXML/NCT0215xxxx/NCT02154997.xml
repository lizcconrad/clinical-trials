  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy nutrition demands change and the pregnant woman needs to adjust her food
      intake and take into consideration the corrected daily recommendations for micro and macro
      nutrients. Pregnant woman tend to suffer from hyperemesis and this affects their food choice.

      Amongst pregnant women with Diabetes the glucose balance is extremely important during
      pregnancy. Glucose balance is a result of correct nutrition and an exact amount of insulin.
      This delicate balance requires from the pregnant women an ability to perform correct
      carbohydrate count.

      Hyperglycemia has already been proven to affect the fetus and the neonatal outcomes.
      Hypoglycemia may also have a negative effect but the main danger is immediate harm to the
      mother and therefore to the fetus. For those reasons glucose balance is crucial and demands
      delicate synchronization of nutrition and insulin therapy.
