  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with autism spectrum disorders often engage in problem behaviors such as
      self-injury, destruction, aggression, and stereotypy. Prior research has clearly shown that
      these problem behaviors may interfere with learning, daily functioning, and social
      participation. As such, engaging in problem behaviors has a negative impact on the health and
      quality of life of children with autism spectrum disorders and their families. One promising
      solution to reduce problem behaviors in this population is the Prevent-Teach-Reinforce (PTR)
      model, which relies on the evidence-based practices of positive behavior support. Although
      the use of PTR has been gaining considerably support in schools, the model has never been
      evaluated as part of a rigorous large-scale study using parents as interventionists. Thus,
      the purpose of the project is to conduct an assessment of the effectiveness of a home-based
      version of the PTR model in reducing problem behaviors in children with autism spectrum
      disorders and in improving families' quality of life. Our hypotheses are that implementing
      the PTR will (a) produce larger reductions in problem behaviors than participating in an
      individual parent training session, (b) increase engagement in prosocial behaviors, (c)
      decrease parental stress, and (c) improve the quality of life of the family. The results of
      the study will allow an examination of whether PTR is an effective and acceptable model to
      reduce problem behaviors at home in this population. Given that problem behaviors incur high
      societal costs when they persist into adolescence and adulthood, the study may potentially
      lead to large cost reductions in the treatment of difficulties associated with autism
      spectrum disorders. By reducing engagement in problem behaviors, the implementation of the
      model may also promote and facilitate the social participation as well as improve the quality
      of life and health of children with autism spectrum disorders and their families.
