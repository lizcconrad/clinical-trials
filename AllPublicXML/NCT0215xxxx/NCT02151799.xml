  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The data regarding the effects of aesthetic body contouring is insufficient. Poor results may
      related to preoperative psychological distress. Studies regarding eating disorder symptoms
      are lacking. Therefore studies using standardized and validated are needed. We decided to
      prospectively study quality of life, psychological distress, and eating disorder symptoms in
      body contouring (abdominoplasty or liposuction) patient populations. Used questionnaires are
      15D quality of life, Raitasalo's modification of the Beck Inventory, and the Eating Disorder
      Inventory. We hypothesize that aesthetic body contouring plastic surgery has notable quality
      of life effects.
