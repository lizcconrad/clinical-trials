    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if patients suffering from diabetic peripheral
      neuropathic pain treated with ranolazine will have a greater reduction in pain compared to
      placebo.

      Hypothesis: From the prior clinical observations, and analgesic efficacy in the preclinical
      animal model of neuropathic pain, the investigators hypothesize that subjects randomized to
      ranolazine will show a greater reduction in diabetic neuropathic pain compared to placebo.
