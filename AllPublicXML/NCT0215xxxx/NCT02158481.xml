    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to investigate the effects of dietary ingredients (polyphenols
      and carotenoids) on vascular function during acute glucose load. Each subject will receive 4
      weeks of intervention with test product or placebo product after a dietary restriction run-in
      period of 14 days. Subjects will be challenged with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
      immediately after the run-in phase and at the end of the intervention phase. During the OGTT,
      blood samples will be taken at regular intervals.

      The study will be conducted in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance.
