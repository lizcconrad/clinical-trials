  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose tissues, which include white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT),
      play an essential role in regulating whole-body energy homeostasis. Recent studies also
      reveal the presence of a subset of cells in WAT that could be induced by environmental or
      hormonal factors to become ''brown-like'' cells, and this ''beigeing'' process has been
      suggested to have strong antiobesity and antidiabetic benefits. More recently, same studies
      showed that cold stress stimulate the browning of subcutaneous white adipose. However, to the
      investigators knowledge, there are no direct data that clearly show that cold stress can
      promote the browning of subcutaneous white adipose.

      Individuals have cold exposure at 15C for 2 hr everyday for one week.Biopsy for subcutaneous
      white adipose was performed before and after one week cold exposure programme under local
      anesthesia. Measure the brown fat characteristics of biopsy samples. The expression levels of
      uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-r, peroxisome
      proliferator-activated receptor r coactivator 1 a (PGC1a) , growth factor receptor binding
      protein-10 (Grb10), PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) will be determined before and after cold
      stress programme from the biopsy samples. In addition, a combination of PET and computed
      tomography (CT) â€” with the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) as a tracer will
      be performed for brown adipose tissue before and after cold stress programme.
