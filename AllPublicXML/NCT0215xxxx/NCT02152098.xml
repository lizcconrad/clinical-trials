  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Firstly, the investigators aim to study the biochemical, structural and functional changes
      associated with acute muscle strain injury in the acute phase and during rehabilitation in
      vivo. Specific factors present after the injury and their effects on connective tissue cells
      will be examined in vitro.

      Secondly, the investigators will investigate individuals with chronic pain, scar tissue and
      inferior function after a previous muscle strain injury and test a specific rehabilitation
      program to alleviate pain and disabilities associated with the preceding muscle injury. The
      investigators have the following hypotheses:

        1. Humoral growth factors and pro-inflammatory macrophages released into the injured area
           post strain injury stimulate formation of connective tissue in vitro.

        2. Early onset of rehabilitation will be superior to a delayed start of rehabilitation for
           the healing process, in regards to structural improvement of tissue and better clinical
           function.

        3. Scar tissue following a muscle strain injury is characterized by disorganized structure
           of connective tissue.

        4. Mechanical loading in the form of heavy eccentric muscle activity for 12 weeks will lead
           to a local re-modeling of scar tissue, and result in improved function and reduced
           symptoms in patients with chronic pain and impaired function after a previous muscle
           injury.
