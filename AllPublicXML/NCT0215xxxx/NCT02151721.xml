  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Gefitinib is an orally active epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor
           (EGFR-TKI). However, 20-30% of patients with EGFR-activating mutations show intrinsic
           resistance to EGFR-TKI.

        -  EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with BIM (BCL2L11) deletion
           polymorphism show the impaired generation of BIM with the proapoptotic BH3 domain, as
           well as resistance to EGFR-TKI-induced apoptosis.

        -  Both BIM polymorphism (12.9%) and EGFR mutations (50% in lung adenocarcinoma) are more
           prevalent in the East Asian than in Caucasian populations. BIM is a BH3-only
           proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. BIM upregulation is required for
           apoptosis induction by EGFR-TKI in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

        -  Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [SAHA]) is a small-molecule inhibitor of
           histone deacetylase (HDAC) and induces cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and
           apoptosis in several tumor cells. HDAC inhibition can epigenetically restore BIM
           function and death sensitivity of EGFR-TKI in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC in whom
           resistance to EGFR-TKI is associated with a common BIM polymorphism. EGFR-TKI resistance
           due to the BIM polymorphism may be able to be circumvented in combination with HDAC
           inhibition of vorinostat with gefitinib in NSCLC.

      -  A cohort of three patients will be treated at each dose level for one cycle (28 days per
           cycle).

        -  Treatment will be continued if no DLTs are recorded, and three patients will be treated
           at the next higher dose level.

        -  If a patient of the cohort develops a DLT, however, another cohort of three patients
           will be treated for 1 cycle.

        -  If more DLTs do not develop, dose escalation continues.

        -  If more than one of three patients develop a DLT at any dose level, another cohort of
           three patients will be treated at the next lower dose level.

        -  If no DLTs are recorded in any of the cohorts, the number of patients per cohort will be
           increased from 3 to 6.

        -  Up to 12 patients will be enrolled at the MTD.

        -  Therefore, the phase II dose for this combined therapy will be defined as the highest
           dose level at which six patients were treated and less than three DLTs developed.
