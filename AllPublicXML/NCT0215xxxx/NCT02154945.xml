      Purpose:

      Primary: to prospectively measure Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) and macular thickness
      changes during pregnancy by Optical coherence tomography

      Secondary: The effect of pregnancy abnormalities on RNFL and macular thickness in
      participants who develop systemic or ocular complications during the study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several known ophthalmic physiologic changes in pregnancy:

        1. Refractive Change: progesterone-mediated changes in fluid content partially accounts for
           refractive change of lens and cornea; myopic shift of less than 1 D was observed in in
           15% of participating pregnant women

        2. Night vision decreased mainly with low serum vitamin A levels in pregnant women.

        3. Fall of the IOP in second half of pregnancy (about 10% drop)

        4. Corneal changes (increased thickness; decreased sensitivity) = contact lens intolerance

      The retina and optic nerve are considered part of central nervous system, the retina and
      choroid are highly vascularized. Due to changes in CSF and brain volume, vascular and fluid
      changes all over the pregnant woman's body we expect to find changes in RNFL and macular
      thickness during pregnancy.

    <measure>Retinal nerve fiber layer(RNFL) and Macular thickness by Optical coherence tomography(OCT) during pregnancy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The RNFL, measured in micrometers, will be followed up during the study. Every trimester (starting at the 1st trimester) an OCT will be performed measuring the thickness of the RNFL.
An OCT will be performed 3 months postpartum as a control.
The Macular thickness will be measured in the same manner.</description>

    <measure>Effect of systemic and ocular diseases on Retinal Fiber Layer and Macula during pregnancy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>If systemic or ocular diseases appear during the study, they will be followed up and observed for changes in retinal fiber layer thickness and macular thickness.</description>
