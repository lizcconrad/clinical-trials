  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence of prostate cancer in men with the
      BRCa2 gene mutation as an independent indicator for prostate cancer screening.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cohort screening study to prospectively identify the incidence of prostate cancer
      in a population of BRCA2 carriers. All men identified to have a BRCA2 mutation as part of the
      Yale Cancer Genetic Counseling Program will be approached and offered participation in the
      study via our program newsletter, BRCA listserv, Facebook page and a targeted mailing.

      Standard of care screening at the Yale Cancer Center for men with a normal prostate cancer
      risk consists of a PSA test and prostate physical examination beginning at age 50 years and
      if either is abnormal an MRI of the prostate followed by Fusion-targeted biopsy of the
      prostate is performed.

        Study participants will be identified because of their BRCA2 mutation that places them at
        increased risk for developing prostate cancer. Because this is a pre-selected high-risk
        population, and our goal is to establish the incidence of cancer and association of risk
        factors with developing disease, all men ≥30 years of age, able to give informed consent,
        and with at least a 5-10 year life expectancy will have PSA testing, prostate examination,
        Pelvic MRI, and Artemis fusion prostate biopsy.

        Men identified to have prostate cancer will be treated according to current standards of
        care. Treatment for prostate cancer at the Yale Cancer Center is largely based on clinical
        risk; options include, but are not limited to, active surveillance for appropriate men with
        low risk disease, treatment with curative intent for men with localized intermediate and
        high risk prostate cancer, and systemic therapy for men with metastatic disease.
