  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have metastatic cancer (cancer
      that has spread to other parts of the body).

      Cancer can be caused by abnormalities in genetic material (such as gene mutations). These
      genetic differences can be found by studying the tumor (molecular profiling). Information
      from molecular profiling can be used to choose treatment that may target the tumor. This is
      known as personalized medicine. Early studies have shown that molecular profiling has led to
      patients being treated with more specialized therapy than they would normally receive. At
      this time is it unknown whether molecular profiling and selection of treatment has different
      results than standard-of-care treatment.

      The goal of this research study is to compare the effects of treatment based on molecular
      profiling to those of the standard-of-care.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 1,362 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson
      and its regional care centers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, a sample of tumor tissue will be collected as part
      of a biopsy. The type of biopsy you receive will depend on the disease site. The study doctor
      will describe the procedure and its risks to you before the biopsy.

      If you have tumor tissue available from a procedure performed within the last year and you
      have received no anti-cancer therapy since that time, samples from this procedure may be able
      to be used for molecular profiling. In this case, you would not need to have a biopsy. The
      study doctor will discuss with you whether your leftover sample can be used.

      The tumor tissue will be sent to Foundation Medicine for molecular profiling. Then, the
      results will be used to determine if there is a genetic abnormality for which a targeted
      therapy is available. The planned time to get this information is 3 weeks, or possibly longer
      if needed. As with other cancer studies, this may take more time to determine. If you have
      previously untreated cancer your doctor may treat you with standard therapy, excluding
      targeted therapy. In this case, results of your molecular profiling will be used for further
      treatment if your disease gets worse.

      A) If there is no abnormality, your doctor will treat you according to what he/she thinks is
      in your best interest. The results of molecular profiling will be given to you at the time
      the results become available.

      B) If there is an abnormality and there is an FDA-approved drug for the tumor type, you will
      be offered that treatment. The results of molecular profiling will be given to you at the
      time the results become available.

      C) If there is an abnormality and there is no FDA-approved drug for the abnormality and the
      tumor type, you will then be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study
      groups.

      You will have an equal chance of being assigned to either group:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive a targeted therapy against the abnormality.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive a standard-of-care therapy.

      Neither you nor your study doctor will be able to choose to which group you are assigned. The
      results of molecular profiling will be given to you before you are randomly assigned to a
      treatment group. If at any point the disease appears to get worse, you will be able to cross
      over to the other study group and be assigned to that therapy.

      Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to look for genetic changes in your blood.

      All Patients:

      The therapy you will receive may consist of either a commercially available drug/therapy or a
      clinical study in which you will be asked to be enrolled. In either case, the disease will be
      followed as part of the standard of care (imaging scans, blood draws, biopsies, and so on).
      These procedures will not be performed as part of this study. However, their results and
      other entries in your medical record will be checked as part of this study to learn if the
      disease is getting worse, getting better, or staying the same.

      Length of Study:

      Your medical records and your health will continue to be reviewed from the time that you sign
      this consent until any time that the disease appears to get worse (unless you cross over to
      another study group).

             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Childbearing potential will be defined as women who have had
             menses within the past 12 months and who have not had a tubal ligation, hysterectomy,
             or bilateral oophorectomy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

         16. Male subjects must agree to use effective contraception or abstinence while on study
             and for 90 days after last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             molecular profiling.

          2. The patient has received chemotherapy, surgery, or radiotherapy (for therapeutic
             purposes) within 3 weeks of initiating study treatment (4 weeks for bevacizumab or
             investigational drugs) or the patient has not recovered (grade ≥2 from side effects of
             the previous therapy). Patients who receive palliative radiation therapy can be
             treated immediately after completion of radiation therapy.

          3. The patient has cardiac conditions as follows: uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt;
             160/100) despite optimal therapy, uncontrolled angina, ventricular arrhythmias,

             disease).

          7. The patient has refractory nausea and vomiting or chronic gastrointestinal diseases
             (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) or has had significant bowel resection that would
             preclude adequate absorption (for oral therapy only).

          8. The patient is unable to swallow capsules and/or has a surgical or anatomical
             condition that precludes swallowing and absorbing oral medication on an ongoing basis
             (for oral therapy only).

          9. Any other condition that would, in the investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures.
