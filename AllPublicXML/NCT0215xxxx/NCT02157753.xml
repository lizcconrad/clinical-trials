  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a tertiary hospital the Traumatology department at the Kantonsspital Aarau looks after
      about 500 fracture patients hospitalized with an age over 50 years a year. First, we were
      interested in the effective rate of osteoporotic fractures in this cohort. As to this
      objective we offered subsequent diagnostics in suspected patients. 2012 we introduced a
      diagnostic pathway for every patient over 50 years of age with a fracture, including dual
      energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), a questionnaire about risk factors concerning osteoporosis
      and risk of fracture, the WHO Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and a laboratory workup
      focusing on this topic. Considering all these information we sent a detailed therapy-plan to
      the responsible General practitioner.

      The main goal of this study is to verify the persistence and compliance of the osteoporosis
      therapy 12-15 months after fracture and to clarify any obstacles potentially impeding therapy
      (prejudice, adverse events, contraindication overlooked, financial problems etc.). The
      investigators use a postal questionnaire provided to the patient and the general
      practitioner. Data collection is undertaken by a study nurse, in addition phoning for missing
      data by phone-call. With the aim to ameliorate the implementation of treatment, patients and
      general practitioners will be provided with the specifically tailored information found to be
      missing.
