      Rationale Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways affecting persons of all
      ages and is recognized as one of the most common chronic diseases. Canada has one of the
      highest asthma prevalence rates in the world (8.5%, aged 12 and over) and it is a major cause
      of hospitalization. The cost of asthma varies dramatically across disease severity, and it is
      expected that these costs are greater when the condition is sub-optimally managed and
      controlled. Although a number of publications have been reported on the economic burden of
      asthma, there is a lack of information on the cost of asthma based on disease severity and
      level of disease control in Canada. The proposed study aims to i) estimate the annual
      indirect cost of asthma and ii) the impact of asthma on absenteeism, presenteeism and work
      productivity in Canada. This information is essential to further quantify the burden of
      asthma on patients and the healthcare system in the Canadian setting.

      Overall Objectives The overall objective of this study is to describe the impact of asthma on
      patients with moderate to severe asthma and to estimate the indirect costs of asthma care in
      asthmatic patients followed in tertiary clinics specialized in the field of asthma in Quebec,
      Canada.

      Study Design

      A prospective cohort study will be conducted to measure the indirect economical burden of
      asthma on patients. Patients will be selected and recruited from the BD-Asthma registry and
      followed prospectively for 1 year. Recruited patients will be asked to complete
      questionnaires at regular intervals for 1 year to measure indirect cost of disease, using the
      Valuation of lost productivity (VOLP) questionnaire.

      Data Collected For each patient, the following data will be collected

        -  Patient demographics

        -  Age

        -  Sex

        -  Income

        -  Level of education

        -  Smoking

        -  Disease management and Treatment utilization in the year prior to recruitment

        -  Physician visits and follow up

        -  Hospitalizations (number and total days)

        -  Emergency room visits

        -  Disease characteristics

        -  Asthma history

        -  Year of first diagnosis of asthma severity

        -  Asthma Control Questionnaire score

        -  Lung function measures

      Data Analysis Methods For each participant, the percentage of time missed from work over a
      year will be calculated. We will use the human capital approach to calculate the costs of
      asthma due to lost productivity, incorporating both absenteeism and presenteeism in the
      calculation of the productivity loss. We will calculate the number of work days in which the
      person was unable to attend the workplace, and the number of days and percentage of time lost
      during the days the person's work was affected by their asthma. The fraction of time lost
      from work in the past year will be multiplied by the average income in Quebec. Finally, this
      value will be multiplied by the coefficient generated by the VOLP, which reflects the
      relative value of the productivity loss. In addition, we will calculate the VOLP multiplier
      for each participant which, combined with the percentage of time missed from work, will
      create a measure of productivity loss adjusted for the relative importance and
      replace-ability of the participant's profession.

      Sample Size and Power

      One hundred subjects will be randomly selected from the BD-Asthma registry.

      Limitations

      The study population may not be representative of the general asthma population, as moderate
      to severe asthma will be over represented in these tertiary centers.

      Rationale Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways affecting persons of all
      ages and is recognized as one of the most common chronic diseases. With a continuously
      increasing prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality, asthma poses a tremendous
      clinical and economic burden on healthcare systems and on the society as a whole.

      According to a report published by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) in 2004 an
      estimated 300 million people in the world have asthma, and more than 2 million Canadians have
      asthma. Canada has one of the highest asthma prevalence rates in the world (8.5%, aged 12 and
      over) and it is a major cause of hospitalization.

      The direct and indirect costs associated with asthma are expected to rank among the highest
      for chronic diseases due to the high prevalence in conjunction with the significant
      healthcare utilization associated with the disease and the considerable restrictions asthma
      imposes on the physical, emotional, social, and professional lives of sufferers. The cost of
      asthma varies dramatically across disease severity, and it is expected that these costs are
      greater when the condition is sub-optimally managed and controlled. Although a number of
      publications have been reported on the economic burden of asthma, there is a lack of
      information on the cost of asthma based on disease severity and level of disease control in
      Canada. Moreover, no study has compared the annual cost of uncontrolled and &quot;well-controlled&quot;
      asthma patients. Although population-level direct costs have been previously reported through
      the use of administrative healthcare databases in various provinces, these databases cannot
      provide clinical data and are limited to subjects who have a public drug insurance plan.

      The proposed study aims to i) estimate the annual indirect cost of asthma and ii) the impact
      of asthma on absenteeism, presenteeism and work productivity in Canada. This information is
      essential to further quantify the burden of asthma on patients and the healthcare system in
      the Canadian setting.

      Overall Objectives The overall objective of this study is to describe the impact of asthma on
      patients with moderate to severe asthma and to estimate the indirect costs of asthma care in
      asthmatic patients followed in tertiary clinics specialized in the field of asthma in Quebec,
      Canada.

      Primary objectives

        -  To estimate the annual indirect costs of asthma in asthmatic patients followed in
           tertiary clinics specialized in the field of asthma in Quebec, Canada

        -  To estimate the annual indirect cost of asthma by asthma severity and control status
           (uncontrolled, partly controlled, well controlled) of asthmatic patients followed in
           tertiary clinics specialized in the field of asthma in Quebec, Canada

      Secondary objectives

      â€¢ To determine the impact of asthma on work productivity in asthmatic patients followed in
      tertiary clinics specialized in the field of asthma in Quebec, Canada.

      Study Design

      A prospective cohort study will be conducted to measure the indirect economical burden of
      asthma on patients. Patients will be selected and recruited from the BD-Asthma registry and

      questionnaires at regular intervals for 1 year to measure indirect cost of disease, using the
      Valuation of lost productivity (VOLP) questionnaire.

      Recruitment of patients All eligible patients from the BD-asthma will be invited to
      participate. Patients approached for participation will be provided verbal and written
      information on the project and, if the patient agrees to participate, they will be asked to
      sign the participation consent form. The forms will be collected by the research coordination
      centre (either at the clinic or the physicians' office or directly with the patient). All
      recruited eligible patients that have provided their consent will be included in this study.

      Source Population The population is defined as individuals diagnosed with asthma (ICD9 codes
      493.x).

    <description>Participants completed questionnaires within 2 weeks post-recruitment, 4, 8 and 12 months to measure indirect cost of disease, specifically related to productivity. The following questionnaires were used: WPAI helps to determine presenteeism, absenteeism, and total cost calculation (TCC) possible (number of days during the year of study), while VOLP is used to assess the impact of health conditions on lost productivity in monetary units (United states dollars). The following parameters were calculated: Cost of absenteeism due to asthma (CAA), cost of presenteeism due to asthma (CPA), cost of absenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CAA TCC), cost of presenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CPA TCC), and total indirect cost due to asthma (TICA).</description>

    <time_frame>BL and 12-month FUP</time_frame>
    <description>Costs of asthma are greater when the asthma is sub-optimally managed and controlled and varies depending on the par. asthma control. Asthma control was assessed using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and par. were asked to recall their experiences during the previous week and respond to the 6 specified questions on a 7-point Likert scale (0=well-controlled; 6=maximum impairment [poorly controlled]; a score of â‰¤0.75 indicates well controlled symptoms. The following parameters were presented: Cost of absenteeism due to asthma (CAA), cost of presenteeism due to asthma (CPA), cost of absenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CAA TCC), cost of presenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CPA TCC), and total indirect cost due to asthma (TICA). Only 59 par. were active workers. When stratified by asthma control and severity each stratum had a sample less than 59. Although results are presented. data may not be reliable due to the low number of par. in each stratum.</description>

    <time_frame>BL and 12-month FUP</time_frame>
    <description>Costs of asthma may vary depending on the participant's asthma severity. Asthma severity was based on the standard definitions for severity and ACQ scores: Mild (&lt;0.75), Moderate (&gt;0.75) and Severe (any ACQ score). The following parameters were presented: Cost of absenteeism due to asthma (CAA), cost of presenteeism due to asthma (CPA), cost of absenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CAA TCC), cost of presenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CPA TCC), and total indirect cost due to asthma (TICA).</description>

    <description>WPAI is a self-administered instrument to determine the degree to which asthma affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work in the last 7 days and yields 4 types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed/missed due to other reasons); Presenteeism (actual time worked); Work Productivity Loss (affected productivity while working); and Activity Impairment (affected regular activities). The following parameters were presented: Hours (Hrs) missed due to asthma (HMA), Hrs missed due to other reasons (HMO), and Hrs actually worked (HAW); all in the last 7 days.</description>

          <description>The Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) is a 7-item questionnaire designed to measure the adequacy of asthma control and the change in asthma control (spontaneous or as a result of treatment). The items score symptoms, FEV1% predicted and daily use of rescue bronchodilator. Each item is scored on a 7 point scale (0=no impairment, 6=maximum impairment). Each item is equally weighted and the total score is the mean of the items (0=totally controlled, 6 severely uncontrolled).</description>

        <title>Indirect Cost of Asthma Per Participant Per 3 Months at Baseline (BL) and 12-month Follow-up (FUP)</title>
        <description>Participants completed questionnaires within 2 weeks post-recruitment, 4, 8 and 12 months to measure indirect cost of disease, specifically related to productivity. The following questionnaires were used: WPAI helps to determine presenteeism, absenteeism, and total cost calculation (TCC) possible (number of days during the year of study), while VOLP is used to assess the impact of health conditions on lost productivity in monetary units (United states dollars). The following parameters were calculated: Cost of absenteeism due to asthma (CAA), cost of presenteeism due to asthma (CPA), cost of absenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CAA TCC), cost of presenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CPA TCC), and total indirect cost due to asthma (TICA).</description>

        <population>Source Population: all par. with asthma diagnosed by respirologist and followed at outpatient asthma clinic of the HSCM and registered in BD-Asthma/RESP. Only par. with available data in each category (represented by n=X in the category title) were analyzed. One third of par. selected were retired. Only 59 were active workers (52 at BL; 40 at FUP).</population>

        <title>Indirect Cost of Asthma by Level of Asthma Control Per Participant Per 3 Months at BL and 12-month FUP</title>
        <description>Costs of asthma are greater when the asthma is sub-optimally managed and controlled and varies depending on the par. asthma control. Asthma control was assessed using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and par. were asked to recall their experiences during the previous week and respond to the 6 specified questions on a 7-point Likert scale (0=well-controlled; 6=maximum impairment [poorly controlled]; a score of â‰¤0.75 indicates well controlled symptoms. The following parameters were presented: Cost of absenteeism due to asthma (CAA), cost of presenteeism due to asthma (CPA), cost of absenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CAA TCC), cost of presenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CPA TCC), and total indirect cost due to asthma (TICA). Only 59 par. were active workers. When stratified by asthma control and severity each stratum had a sample less than 59. Although results are presented. data may not be reliable due to the low number of par. in each stratum.</description>

        <title>Indirect Cost of Asthma by Level of Asthma Severity Per Participant Per 3 Months at BL and 12-month FUP</title>
        <description>Costs of asthma may vary depending on the participantâ€™s asthma severity. Asthma severity was based on the standard definitions for severity and ACQ scores: Mild (&lt;0.75), Moderate (&gt;0.75) and Severe (any ACQ score). The following parameters were presented: Cost of absenteeism due to asthma (CAA), cost of presenteeism due to asthma (CPA), cost of absenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CAA TCC), cost of presenteeism due to asthma in whom TCC was possible (CPA TCC), and total indirect cost due to asthma (TICA).</description>

        <population>Source Population. Only participants with available data in each category (represented by n=X in the category title) were analyzed. One third of the participants selected were retired. Only 59 participants were active workers. Therefore the stratification for asthma control and severity included very low numbers (52 at BL; 40 at FUP).</population>

        <description>WPAI is a self-administered instrument to determine the degree to which asthma affected work productivity while at work and affected activities outside of work in the last 7 days and yields 4 types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed/missed due to other reasons); Presenteeism (actual time worked); Work Productivity Loss (affected productivity while working); and Activity Impairment (affected regular activities). The following parameters were presented: Hours (Hrs) missed due to asthma (HMA), Hrs missed due to other reasons (HMO), and Hrs actually worked (HAW); all in the last 7 days.</description>
