  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostaglandin analogues eye drops are common and effective treatment for decreasing
      Intra-Ocular Pressure (IOP) in Glaucoma patients. A number of recently published case reports
      have documented periorbital fat atrophy following treatment by prostaglandin analogues. In
      this study the investigators want to use this side-effect of prostaglandin analogues for the
      treatment of orbital and periocular fat proliferation in inactive Thyroid eye disease (TED)
      patients, as a conservative substitute for surgical intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bimatoprost effect on soft tissue amount and exophthalmos in inactive TED patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To document the effect of bimatoprost treatment on the amount of soft tissue and exophthalmos in inactive TED patients. The following measurements will be performed pre, post and during treatment: orbital ultrasound (measuring the eyebrow fat, retro-orbicularis oculi fat and retrobulbar fat), Hertel exophthalmometry and Marginal Reflex Distance (MRD). The external appearance would be also documented by face picture.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the safety of bimatoprost treatment by estimating the probabilities of adverse outcomes. To estimate these probabilities we shall count the number of participants suffering from known side-effects of prostaglandin analogues such as increased eyelash growth and darkening of the periocular skin and iris; as well as any other side-effects observed during treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Bimatoprost effect reversibility after treatment cessation.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the reversibility of bimatoprost treatment on the amount of soft tissue and exophthalmos at the end of the treatment course and 3 months post cessation. We shall perform the same measurements as described in the Primary Outcome section.</description>
