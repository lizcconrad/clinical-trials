  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette craving usually occurs with unpleasant feelings, including stress. Progressive
      Muscle Relaxation (PMR) may reduce level of cigarette craving and/or withdrawal symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study reports on a study investigating the acute effects of a one-time application of
      progressive muscle relaxation on craving for cigarettes in smokers who were instructed to
      abstain from cigarettes for 3 hours.
