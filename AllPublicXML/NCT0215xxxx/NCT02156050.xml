    <textblock>
      Jaundice occurs in most newborn infants. Most jaundice is benign, but because of the
      potential toxicity of bilirubin, newborn infants must be monitored to identify those who
      might develop severe hyperbilirubinemia an, in rare cases, acute bilirubin encephalopathy or
      kernicterus. Jaundice is a commonly observed, usually harmless condition in newborn infants
      during the first week after birth. However, in some babies the amount of bilirubin pigment
      can increase to dangerous levels and require treatment. Treatment of jaundice in newborn
      infants is done by placing them under phototherapy, a process of exposing their skin to light
      of a specific wavelength band. Fluorescent tubes or halogen lamps have been used as light
      sources for phototherapy for many years. A light-emitting diode (LED) is a newer type of
      light source which is power efficient, has a longer life and is portable with low heat
      production. Several technologies and devices are developed around this LED and specially a
      compact system.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacity of LED phototherapy by comparing with
      conventional phototherapy (non-LED) and satisfaction of the parents and the professional
      staff about comfort of this new technology. The newborn infant is placed in a sleeper with
      the device B' bloo ® which maintains him in position (lap or dorsal) allowing to pass the
      blue light. This one is generated by the module LED and transmitted in the braid of optical
      fibers which takes place directly on the mattress of the cradle in which is placed the
      patient usually.

      The device is endowed with an hour counter to schedule the time of treatment. The energy
      illumination varies between 3 and 4 mW / cm ² for an average 3,6 mW / cm ².
