      To compare the different effect of conservative pharmacotherapy and Staged Percutaneous
      Coronary Intervention (SPCI) on significant non-culprit lesions in patients with ST-segment
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at presentation remains controversial

    <description>this group underwent second PCI procedure on the non-culprit vessels and reveived 100-120 IU/kg unfractionated heparin during PPCI, followed by 3 days administration of low molecular weight heparin or Fondaparinux sodium after procedure. Patients in the CP group and CR group after second PCI procedure were given conservative medicine such as Statins which were not contraindicated to the patients.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  age 18 to 75 with continuous ischemic chest pain for ≥ 30 minutes and ST-segment of
             electrocardiographic leads between V2 and V3 elevated ≥ 0.2 mV (or ≥ 0.1 mV in ≥ 2
             other continuous electrocardiographic leads), cardiac troponin I (cTn I) elevation of
             &gt; 0.05 ng/ml, coronary arteriography within 12 hours after the onset of symptoms
             indicating lesion in culprit vessel with thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI)
             flow grade 0 to 1, merely underwent PPCI. Additionally, coronary arteriography
             corroborates lesions in non-culprit vessel (Besides the culprit vessel, there are ≥
             70% stenoses in one or more coronary vessels in which diameters were ≥ 2 mm).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  left main coronary artery disease, cardiogenic shock, complete left bundle branch
             block (CLBBB) PPCI treated culprit and non-culprit vessels, PPCI failure patients with
             postsurgical haemodynamic instability or spontaneous ischemia, ≥ 70% stenoses of
             vessels remained during the hospitalization after staged PCI, history of PCI or
             Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG), history of chronic cardiac failure, bleeding
             diathesis, prior administration of thrombolytic therapy, known thrombopenia or
             leucopenia, sever liver and kidney dysfunction, active infection, immune system and
             connective tissue diseases, known contraindications to aspirin or heparin, life
             expectancy &lt; 1 year, had major procedure within 3 months, uncontrolled hypertension,
             ischemic stroke within 30 days, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial diseases including
             and arteriovenous malformation, extensive traumatic cerebral infarction within 6
             weeks, oral anticoagulant therapy, severe myocardial infarction related complications
             and perioperative death
