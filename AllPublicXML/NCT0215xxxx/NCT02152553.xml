  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have shown that patients with adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), a
      rare disorder, have doubled the expected mortality rate in Sweden despite Standard of Care
      glucocorticoid (GC) replacement. One % of the Swedish population are, however, receiving GCs
      for inflammatory diseases, but management is empirical and adjusted to underlying disease
      activity. The desired anti-inflammatory therapeutic effects cannot be differentiated from the
      adverse metabolic (osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes mellitus) and immunosuppressive side
      effects of GC. This frequently results in suboptimal GC therapy with adverse effects due to
      over-dosing or poor efficacy due to under-dosing. The primary aim is to identify a biomarker
      for the metabolic effects of GCs. Patients with Addison's disease completely lack endogenous
      GCs and can therefore be considered a human GC knock-out model. They can therefore be studied
      during near-physiological exposure and during GC starvation. This will uniquely allow a very
      clean biomarker identification model (using transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics).
      The secondary aim is to validate candidate biomarker(s) in a dose-response study using the
      same patient population. A biomarker of GC actions will make it possible to individualised
      therapy during pharmacological GC treatment. It would allow GC replacement to be monitored in
      Addison's disease and could become a specific diagnostic tool in patients with GC deficiency
      and excess (Cushings syndrome).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Protein profile changes between a state of GC starvation and near physiological GC exposure.</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes in proteome (g/dl or umol/l) during 24 hours under two different states of GC exposure.</time_frame>
    <description>Using mass spectrometry, protein profile changes in blood, urine and adipose tissue are going to be identified between four points of time during two states: morning and midnight during near physiological GC exposure (sampling 1 and 2), morning and midnight during GC starvation (sampling 3 and 4). Quantitative measurements of all proteins will be used in the bioinformatic analysis. The bioinformatics strategic consists of a stepwise approach based on random forest analysis. Key features in the analysis include finding candidate markers that are increased during normal GC exposure (sampling 1 and 2), reduced during GC starvation (sampling 3 and 4) and exclusion of factors with high variability within normal subjects. Putative biomarkers will go through two levels of internal cross-validation. The investigators would like that this part of the project is not going to be public.</description>
