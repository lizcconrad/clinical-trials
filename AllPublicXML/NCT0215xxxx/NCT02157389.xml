  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Placebo and nocebo responses have mainly been studied in healthy humans for pharmacological
      rather than psychological interventions. Moreover, only few studies examined patients or
      tested how previous experience and attitudes affect placebo and nocebo responses. On the
      psychological level expectancy and classical conditioning have been identified as two primary
      mechanisms. Both seem to be important with classical conditioning potentially having more
      long-term effects and expectancy being more important in nocebo effects. There is some
      initial evidence from the investigators own research that patients may be more prone to these
      effects and the investigators have also shown that placebo effects may last up to several
      years after treatment. The investigators therefore examine previous attitudes to
      pharmacological interventions for chronic pain in patients with chronic back pain and
      subdivide them into groups with high of low belief in the respective treatment modality. The
      investigators then apply a pharmacological placebo and study the interaction between the
      prevailing attitude (implicit and explicit) and the placebo effect with respect to pain
      perception but also to neurobiological mechanisms using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging. In addition to expectancy, conditioning of placebo will be examined and the
      long-term effects of the intervention will be determined.
