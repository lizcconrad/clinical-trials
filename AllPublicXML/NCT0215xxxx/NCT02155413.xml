  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pain service (APS) was introduced in 1990s at Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) as other
      countries. With accumulation of experience and clinical evidence, APS has been well
      established. A study conducted in 1997 suggested that monitoring, management protocol and
      nursing experience were mandatory to the safety for APS. Our recent study showed that pain
      relief of our post-operative patients using patient controlled analgesic with morphine was
      still not adequate. The results has driven us to continue the improvement of post-operative
      outcomes for our surgical patients. Tolerability and safety are always our concerns for
      patients using our APS. Therefore, the investigators aim to conduct this retrospective study
      in order to assess if the tolerability and safety of our present APS are adequate or not. The
      study results will help us to further improve our APS at QMH if necessary.

      Retrospective audit.

      Acute pain service records at Division of Pain Management, Department of Anaesthesiology,
      Queen Mary Hospital will be identified, validated and analysed.

      Data Collection

        1. Demographic data

        2. Type of operation

        3. Type of pain relief modality

        4. Pain score up to 72 hours postoperatively

        5. Types of operations and clinical variables

        6. Incidence of adverse events during APS care;

        7. Patients safety (ie respiratory depression)

      Data Analysis For summarising analysis, mean or median with standard deviation or
      interquartile range will be reported. Parametric and non-parametric comparative tests will be
      used for analysis between/among patients with various characteristics. Kaplan Meier survival
      analysis and log-rank test will be used for duration of APS use.
