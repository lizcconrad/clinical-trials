  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this long-term follow-up study was to evaluate the persistence of the cellular
      and the humoral immune response 4 years after the first dose of GSK Biologicals'
      investigational vaccine formulations containing HBsAg (used as a model antigen) and an
      adjuvant.

      Subjects in this long-term follow-up study were recruited among those subjects who completed
      the study 287615 (NCT00508833) and who were enrolled in specific groups. All subjects were
      vaccinated in the study 287615 (NCT00508833) according to a 0, 1, 10 month schedule. No new
      subjects were enrolled and no vaccine was administered in this long-term follow-up study.
      There was a single visit at Year 4 at which blood samples for immunogenicity assays were
      taken.
