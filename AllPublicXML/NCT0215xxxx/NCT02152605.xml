    <textblock>
      This study is a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel group,
      placebo-controlled study.

      The purpose of this study is to replicate the therapeutic benefit of UMEC/VI 62.5/25
      microgram (mcg) on health-related quality of life as reflected by St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores and symptoms as reflected by rescue medication use observed in
      the 6 month placebo controlled study (DB2113373). Lung function will be assessed as it
      provides an objective measure to support the subjective patient reported outcomes of SGRQ and
      rescue medication use. The study is intended to provide additional evidence to support the
      use of UMEC/VI for the maintenance treatment of COPD Approximately 496 subjects will be
      randomized from approximately 62 centers in order to ensure 422 subjects complete 12 weeks of
      treatment. Eligible subjects will be randomized to UMEC/VI 62.5/25mcg or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio. All treatments will be administered once-daily in the morning via a Dry Powder Inhaler
      (DPI).

      There will be a total of 5 clinic visits. The total duration of study participation will be
      approximately 15 weeks. All subjects will be provided with albuterol/salbutamol to use as
      needed for the relief of COPD symptoms throughout the run-in and double-blind treatment
      periods.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean St.George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a disease-specific questionnaire, self-completed by participants(par), used to evaluate the effect of UMEC/VI on health-related quality of life as compared to placebo in par with COPD. The scores range from 0 (minimum, best possible health status) to 100 (maximum, worst possible health status). The SGRQ contains 76 items grouped into three domains (symptoms, activity and impacts). Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of Baseline (scores recorded prior to dosing on Day 1) SGRQ total score, centre group, smoking status, Day, treatment(trt), Day by Baseline interaction and Day by trt interaction, where Day is nominal. Change from Baseline at a particular visit was calculated as the SGRQ total score at that visit minus Baseline. Change from Baseline in total score of -4 units or lower is considered as clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry on Days 28, 56 and 84. Baseline is defined as the assessment taken pre-dose on Treatment Day 1. Trough FEV1 is defined as the FEV1 value obtained 24 hours after the previous morning's dosing. Change from Baseline at a particular visit was calculated as the trough FEV1 at that visit minus Baseline. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of treatment, Baseline , smoking status, center group, day, and day by Baseline and day by treatment interactions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) in Mean Number of Puffs of Rescue Medication Per Day Used Over Weeks 1-12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 amd Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Albuterol/salbutamol(A/S) was used as rescue medication and was provided to participants to use on an as-needed basis for relief of COPD symptoms throughout treatment periods. The number of puffs of rescue medication (A/S) per day over the entire 12 week treatment period was recorded and analyzed. For rescue use, 'day' is referred as the period between one record of rescue use and the next. Total puffs of rescue for each day = number of salbutamol puffs + (2 x number of salbutamol nebules). Analysis performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of BL(mean number of total puffs over the duration from First Day; defined as Latest of [7 days before Visit 2 and day after Visit 1] to Last Day(defined as Day before Visit 2)), smoking status, centre group, four-week period, treatment and period by BL interaction. Change from BL used weeks 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12 as covariates in the model and the overall least squares mean change for weeks 1-12 is estimated.</description>

        <description>The SGRQ is a disease-specific questionnaire, self-completed by participants(par), used to evaluate the effect of UMEC/VI on health-related quality of life as compared to placebo in par with COPD. The scores range from 0 (minimum, best possible health status) to 100 (maximum, worst possible health status). The SGRQ contains 76 items grouped into three domains (symptoms, activity and impacts). Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of Baseline (scores recorded prior to dosing on Day 1) SGRQ total score, centre group, smoking status, Day, treatment(trt), Day by Baseline interaction and Day by trt interaction, where Day is nominal. Change from Baseline at a particular visit was calculated as the SGRQ total score at that visit minus Baseline. Change from Baseline in total score of -4 units or lower is considered as clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Mean Number of Puffs of Rescue Medication Per Day Used Over Weeks 1-12</title>
        <description>Albuterol/salbutamol(A/S) was used as rescue medication and was provided to participants to use on an as-needed basis for relief of COPD symptoms throughout treatment periods. The number of puffs of rescue medication (A/S) per day over the entire 12 week treatment period was recorded and analyzed. For rescue use, ‘day’ is referred as the period between one record of rescue use and the next. Total puffs of rescue for each day = number of salbutamol puffs + (2 x number of salbutamol nebules). Analysis performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of BL(mean number of total puffs over the duration from First Day; defined as Latest of [7 days before Visit 2 and day after Visit 1] to Last Day(defined as Day before Visit 2)), smoking status, centre group, four-week period, treatment and period by BL interaction. Change from BL used weeks 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12 as covariates in the model and the overall least squares mean change for weeks 1-12 is estimated.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline (BL) in Mean Number of Puffs of Rescue Medication Per Day Used Over Weeks 1-12</title>
          <description>Albuterol/salbutamol(A/S) was used as rescue medication and was provided to participants to use on an as-needed basis for relief of COPD symptoms throughout treatment periods. The number of puffs of rescue medication (A/S) per day over the entire 12 week treatment period was recorded and analyzed. For rescue use, ‘day’ is referred as the period between one record of rescue use and the next. Total puffs of rescue for each day = number of salbutamol puffs + (2 x number of salbutamol nebules). Analysis performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of BL(mean number of total puffs over the duration from First Day; defined as Latest of [7 days before Visit 2 and day after Visit 1] to Last Day(defined as Day before Visit 2)), smoking status, centre group, four-week period, treatment and period by BL interaction. Change from BL used weeks 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12 as covariates in the model and the overall least squares mean change for weeks 1-12 is estimated.</description>
