      Part 1, the pharmacokinetic (PK) phase, will expand upon the pilot study conducted at Naval
      Medical Research Laboratory (NAMRL) and has the goal of determining bioavailability and time
      to Cmax in a larger representative sample. Part 2, the efficacy phase, is to determine the
      efficacy of the aqueous spray solution via exposure to a nausea-inducing stimulus.

      Part 1: The pharmacokinetic (PK) phase Objective: To determine the bioavailability and amount
      of scopolamine absorbed after administration of 0.2 mg intranasal scopolamine at regular
      intervals across 8 hours post- dose.

      Hypothesis: Detectable levels of Intranasal scopolamine (INSCOP) will be present in subject
      plasma within 15 minutes post-dose; mean time to Cmax (maximum plasma concentration) will be
      less than 1.5 hr.

      Part 2: The Efficacy phase Objective: To determine the effectiveness, cognitive performance
      effects, and medication side-effect profile of 0.2 mg intranasal scopolamine spray as a
      motion sickness (MS) countermeasure.

      Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that the INSCOP spray will be more efficacious against
      MS than placebo, without statistically significant cognitive performance side-effects.
      Specifically, participants will tolerate significantly more provocative head tilts in the
      INSCOP condition than in the placebo condition.

    <time_frame>40 min</time_frame>
    <description>During rotation, efficacy is measured by the number of head movements subjects are able to make (12 per minute). While seated yaw-axis rotating, a pre-recorded computerized voice informed subjects to make paced head tilts of 30 ̊ to the right and left at a rate of 0.125 Hz (right, center, left, and back to center over 16 seconds).</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study enrolled subjects who were active-duty military or reserves on active duty status between the ages of 18 and 59 from the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base located in Dayton, Ohio. The last subjects completed in August 2015.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>For the Pharmacokinetics part, 21 subjects were screened, and 13 completed the pharmacokinetics portion. For Efficacy, 42 subjects were screened, and 23 completed, with one removed from efficacy tabulated results due to noncompliance with study protocol. All subjects randomized into treatment order with cross-over design.</pre_assignment_details>

A minimum of one week separated the two sessions. Each session was identical except for contents of intranasal spray. Baseline vitals, blood draw, and cognitive testing applied prior to dosage. Approximately 40 minutes post-dose, subjects experience mechanical rotation via Coriolis cross-coupling in a stairwise progression until subject reported either full minute of unabated stomach awareness, or the maximum rotation of 40 rpm obtained. Blood draws, vitals collection, cognitive testing and subjective fatigue collected for approximately three hours post-rotation.</description>

        <title>Efficacy: Number of Head Movements During Rotation</title>
        <description>During rotation, efficacy is measured by the number of head movements subjects are able to make (12 per minute). While seated yaw-axis rotating, a pre-recorded computerized voice informed subjects to make paced head tilts of 30 ̊ to the right and left at a rate of 0.125 Hz (right, center, left, and back to center over 16 seconds).</description>

            <description>Subjects received either one dose of 0.2 mg intranasal scopolamine (0.1 mg per nostril) or one dose of 0.2 mg placebo intranasal (0.1 mg per nostril) for two Efficacy sessions. Each session identical except for contents of intranasal spray. Baseline vitals, blood draw, and cognitive testing applied prior to dosage. Approximately 40 minutes post-dose, subjects experience mechanical rotation via Coriolis cross-coupling in a stairwise progression until subject reported either full minute of unabated stomach awareness, or the maximum rotation of 40 rpm obtained. Blood draws, vitals collection, cognitive testing and subjective fatigue collected for approximately three hours post-rotation. One week minimum separated the two Efficacy sessions.</description>
