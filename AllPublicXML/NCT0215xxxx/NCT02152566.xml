    <textblock>
      Respiratory insufficiencies during sleep can lead to reductions in the level of oxygen in the
      blood during the night, which has been shown to contribute to a range of morbidities.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the possibility that a nasal high flow therapy device
      may be able to treat respiratory insufficiencies, by stabilizing breathing and preventing
      reduction in blood oxygen.

      Heart failure patients will be screened at a heart failure clinic, and will be asked to
      undergo an overnight sleep study to determine is they exhibit respiratory insufficiencies
      during sleep. This sleep study may be completed in the sleep laboratory (attended
      polysomnography, PSG) or in-home (in-home polygraphy, PG). If they are diagnosed with
      respiratory insufficiencies, they will be asked to attend further overnight studies to see if
      treatment with nasal high flow therapy can be used to stabilize breathing.

If respiratory insufficiencies with Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) are detected, these patients will undergo an overnight in laboratory attended PSG on a nasal high flow therapy device to test the primary endpoint of this study. Patients without respiratory insufficiencies after the first PSG/PG will take no further part in the trial.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and Women aged ≥ 18 years

          -  Heart Failure from ischemic or non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy for ≥ 6 months

          -  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF ≤45% by echocardiography performed within
             3 months of the screening visit, or if not within 3 months, a justification provided
             by the cardiologist for why a repeat echocardiography is not required, for example,
             because the subject's condition has remained stable since their echocardiography). All
             echocardiography must be within a maximum of 1 year of the screening visit.

          -  New York Heart Association Class II or III after optimization of medical therapy
