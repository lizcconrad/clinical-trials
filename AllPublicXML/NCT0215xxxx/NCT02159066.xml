      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the anti-tumor activity of LGX818/MEK162 in
      combination with targeted agents after progression on LGX818/MEK162 combination therapy, as
      well as the safety and tolerability of the novel triple combinations.

      This study consists of two parts: in Part I/Run-In, patients naïve to selective BRAF and MEK
      inhibitors will be treated with the LGX818/MEK162 combination until disease progression (as
      defined per RECIST v1.1). Based on the genetic analysis of a tumor biopsy obtained at that
      time, patients will enter Part II of the study for tailored combination treatment in one of
      four arms of LGX818/MEK162 + either BKM120, BGJ398, INC280 or LEE011 Patients with BRAF
      mutant melanoma treated by LGX818/MEK162 combination in other studies can be enrolled
      directly in Part II of CLGX818X2109 after relapse.

      Dose-escalations in the combination arms for which no MTD has been established will be based
      on the recommendations of a Bayesian logistic regression model guided by an escalation with
      overdose control criterion
