  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Appropriate sedation is needed for medical diagnosis, treatment, and the safety for
           patients. In non-surgical approaches, benzodiazepines are broadly used for ideal sedated
           status for patients.

             -  However, especially in bronchoscope procedure, continuous monitoring of oxygen
                saturation is needed to prevent hypoxia due to respiratory distress induced by
                benzodiazepine.

             -  A alpha-2 agonist, dexmedetomidine, which has similar sedative effect, but has less
                adverse effect of respiratory distress compared to previous agents, was introduced.

        2. It is necessary to compare the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine with that of
           midazolam in ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA).

             -  Double blind randomized trial

             -  Primary outcome: The number and duration of desaturation, volume of sedative, any
                use of rescue midazolam, and Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) score (for efficacy), and
                hypertension, tachycardia, any need for mandible support or manual ventilation, and
                any need for intubation (for safety).
