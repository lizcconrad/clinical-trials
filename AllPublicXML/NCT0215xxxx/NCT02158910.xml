      The purpose of the study is for investigation and collection of Aricept safety information
      with a dose increase on Alzheimer's disease patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to systematically investigate domestic patients with
      Alzheimer's disease to figure out the safety under a situation of the use of Donepezil HCl
      23mg. Additionally, if the dose of Donepezil HCl increase, there is need to examine the
      safety of Donepezil HCl 23mg in depth for patients with Alzheimer's disease by comparing
      aspects of occurring adverse events by the type of Donepezil HCl increase.

    <measure>Safety and tolerability due to an increase of Aricept in patients with Alzheimer's disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The aspects of adverse events between those who have increased Aricept dosage from 5mg to 10mg and those who have increased Aricept dosage from 10mg to 23mg will be compared. The subjects will be observed at least more than 12 weeks after Aricept administration. The patients who have obtained safety information through a visit after Aricept administration at least once will be selected as the subjects who can be assessed under the status of use.</description>
