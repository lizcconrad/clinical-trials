  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to compare how people who are 45-75 years old respond to 3
      different versions of a program about screening tests for colorectal cancer. Researchers want
      to use this study as part of a long-term project to learn the best ways to communicate health
      information to patients.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in a roll of dice)
      to 1 of 3 study groups. Neither you nor the study staff will be able to choose which group
      you will be in:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will read a booklet about colorectal cancer screening tests.
           While reading the booklet, you will also listen to an audio CD that will narrate the
           booklet.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will watch a video with non-moving images about colorectal
           cancer screening tests on an iPad.

        -  If you are in Group 3, you will watch a video with animated images about colorectal
           cancer screening tests on an iPad.

      You will complete questionnaires before and after viewing the program that will contain
      questions about:

        -  Your age and what language you speak

        -  Your math and reading comprehension

        -  Your knowledge of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer screening

        -  Your thoughts about colorectal cancer screening

        -  Your opinions about this study, and

        -  How well you understand the booklet/video you view as part of this study

      It will take about 1 hour to complete all the questionnaires. In total, the study will take
      about 1 Â½ to 2 hours to complete. After you have completed the questionnaires, your
      participation in the study will be over.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 201 people will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 67 will be enrolled at MD
      Anderson.

    <description>The fixed effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) will utilize a factorial design with two factors: content presentation type (standard, animated, interactive) and numeracy status (high and low based on US population scores). Main dependent measures are gist and verbatim knowledge. Gist and verbatim knowledge scores (0-100) looked at separately as well as combined.</description>
