    <textblock>
      The risk of developing clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease is currently
      assessed by using integrated multifactorial prediction models based on the presence of
      non-modifiable risk factors, such as age, gender and a family history of early ischemic heart
      disease along with risk factors which are defined as conventional, such as arterial
      hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus.

      However, if the relationship between risk factors and ischemic heart disease clinical
      manifestations shows some limitations, the relation between risk factors and the coronary
      atherosclerosis process underlying most ischemic syndromes seems to be even weaker.

      In fact there is significant individual variability and the limits of such relationship are
      demonstrated by a non negligible number of subjects at the outliers of mean behaviour of the
      prediction model. At one outlier, in the presence of multiple risk factors, these subjects do
      not develop neither coronary events nor coronary atherosclerosis whereas, at the other,
      coronary events and disease occur in the absence of risk factors.This study aims at detecting
      new protection and susceptibility factors, thus enabling to formulate new etiopathogenetic
      hypotheses concerning coronary atherosclerosis and to identify new therapeutic targets.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Group A: subjects with total absence of coronary atherosclerosis and 3 or more risk
             factors (reported by the subject or documented at the MDCT)

          -  Group B: subjects with diffuse coronary atherosclerosis extended to more than 5 of the
             16 segments according to the American Heart Association classification and 0-1 risk
             factor (reported by the subject or documented at the MDCT) with the exclusion of
             patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus as single risk factor.

        Using the same criteria, two control populations will be selected, with a case:control 1:1
        ratio, consisting in:

          -  Group C: subjects with total absence of coronary atherosclerosis and 0-1 risk factor
             (reported by the subject or documented at the MDCT)

          -  Group D: subjects with diffuse coronary atherosclerosis extended to more than 5 of the
             16 segments according to the American Heart Association classification and 3 or more
             risk factors (reported by the subject or documented at the MDCT) with the exclusion of
             patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus as single risk factor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  common contraindications to MDCT (chronic renal failure with serum creatinine &gt; 2.0
             mg/dl, suspected pregnancy, arrhythmias, body mass index &gt; 40, allergy to iodized
             contrast agent).

          -  previous cardiovascular events (heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, unstable
             angina, chronic stable angina, previous percutaneous or surgery coronary
             revascularization) both clinically evident and found by conventional diagnostic
             methods previous performed.

          -  subjects which MDCT does not meet the quality control criteria defined below in the
             protocol.

          -  patients with previous documented or identified at the moment of MDCT such as dilated
             cardiomyopathy regardless of etiology, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, atrial
             fibrillation, myocarditis and inflammatory vascular disease.
