  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study. The goal of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad,
      taking erlotinib and ruxolitinib has on the patients and on lung cancer. Erlotinib and
      ruxolitinib are FDA approved for other indications, but the use of erlotinib and ruxolitinib
      together has not been studied before and is not FDA-approved.

    <description>All patients will receive erlotinib at 150mg orally daily along with doses of ruxolitinib orally twice daily. Patients in dose level 1 will receive erlotinib 150mg orally daily and ruxolitinib 10mg orally twice daily. In dose level 2, patients will receive erlotinib 150mg orally daily and ruxolitinib 15mg orally twice daily. In dose level 3, patients will receive erlotinib 150mg orally daily and ruxolitinib 20mg orally twice daily.</description>

    <description>Phase I The study will follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation trial design. Three to six patients will need to be enrolled at each dose level and assessed for DLT for 1 full cycle (21 days) before a dose escalation decision is made.
Phase II Once the MTD has been determined, patients will be enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the single-arm, two-stage, open-label study to determine efficacy of erlotinib and ruxolitinib. Patients will receive erlotinib and ruxolitinib at the MTD established in the phase I portion. The patient take their previous dose of erlotinib if it is less than 150mg daily.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic evidence of advanced (non-operable or metastatic) biopsy-proven stage IV or
             recurrent lung cancer reviewed at MSKCC.

          -  a documented somatic activating mutation in EGFR (including but not limited to Exon 19
             deletion or L858R)

          -  Radiographic progression during treatment with erlotinib. Prior chemotherapy regimens
             are permitted.

          -  Received erlotinib or other EGFR TK treatment for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Measurable (RECIST 1.1) indicator lesion not previously irradiated

          -  Must have undergone biopsy after development of acquired resistance to erlotinib
             (which is performed as standard of care) with adequate tissue to determine EGFR T790M
             and tumor histology. Slides from an outside institution may be used.

          -  KPS ≥ 70%

          -  Age&gt;18 years old

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function:

               -  AST, ALT, Alk phos ≤ 3.0 x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN

               -  Creatinine &lt;2.0 X upper limit of normal and/or a creatinine clearance ≥ 60ml/min

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,000 cells/mm³.

             study treatment after 1 week or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.

             infarction within 6 months from Day 1 of study drug administration, New York Heart
             Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, or symptomatic arrythmias
             requiring therapy,

          -  Chronic or current active infections requiring systemic antibiotics, antifungals or
             antiviral therapy.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus infection, or hepatitis B virus (HBV) viremia or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremia. Screening for the study does not require assessment
