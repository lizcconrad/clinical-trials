  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about asthma and how the environment affects asthma. Scientists know that air
      pollution (such as cigarette smoke and other particles in the air) can make asthma symptoms
      worse. This research is being done to study how the health of a person with asthma responds
      to an air cleaner. The investigator hypothesize that an air cleaner will improve the health
      of persons with asthma.

      The investigators seek to determine the effect of placing air cleaner devices in the homes of
      adults with asthma on their asthma health. To this end, the investigators aim to study 40
      adults with asthma that are 18-50 years of age and live in Baltimore. They will receive
      either true air cleaners or sham cleaners in a blinded, randomized manner for one month, and
      then, after a washout period, they will cross over and receive the other intervention (sham
      or true cleaner). All participants will have environmental monitoring (personal and in-home)
      to determine their particulate matter exposure, and be followed repeatedly during the 3 month
      study period for markers of asthma disease, including respiratory symptoms, medication and
      health care utilization, pulmonary function, airway hyperresponsiveness, systemic markers of
      inflammation, and bronchoscopic evidence of airway inflammation or epithelial cell
      dysfunction. Modifying factors or factors influencing susceptibility, such as diet and
      nutritional status, will also be explored.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma morbidity</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma morbidity will be assessed by reports of health-care utilization, need for pharmacotherapy, and respiratory symptoms at two distinct intervention periods, while receiving sham and true air cleaners. Changes in respiratory symptoms will be assessed by self-reports in symptoms questionnaires and diaries.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulmonary Function: Spirometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function will be assessed by spirometry. We will obtain values of FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio, and FEF25/75.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bronchoreactivity to Mannitol Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Bronchoreactivity will be defined according to the decrease in forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) following administration of mannitol.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarkers of inflammation and immune status</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Biomarkers indicating changes in individual inflammatory and immune status (e.g. cytokines, exhaled NO, hematologic cell counts, etc) in blood, urine, exhaled breath and samples from the upper and lower airways will be analyzed with respect to the change in pollution (e.g. particulate matter) that each participant is exposed to in each arm of the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intake and individual status of a variety of micro and macronutrients</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Effect modifiers, such as diet, nutritional factors, and measures of obesity will also be explored in these analyses.</description>

    <description>A High Efficiency Particulate Air Cleaner (HEPA) intervention will be placed in the participant's home for one month. During the last week of the month, health assessments will be conducted, including in-home health questionnaires, symptom-, diet-, and activity- diaries/recalls, blood, urine and exhaled breath testing, repeated measures of home hand-held lung function, and in-clinic pulmonary function testing with broncho-provocation. Participants will wear a light backpack with air monitoring devices during the last week in order to measure their exposures to pollutants. Finally, at the end of the month, participants will be asked to report to the Johns Hopkins outpatient endoscopy suite for bronchoscopy, during which nasal and lower airway sampling will occur under conscious sedation.</description>
