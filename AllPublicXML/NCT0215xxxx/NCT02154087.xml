    <measure>Determine Change From Baseline in Cell Numbers in Subjects With VLU Following the First Dose of HP802-247</measure>
    <time_frame>Wound fluid samples were to be collected one week after the initial dose of HP802-247.</time_frame>
    <description>The following mediators were to be measured for the chronic ulcer stage: IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN, MMP-2, and MMP-9, and the following for the resolving ulcer stage: PGE-2, Lipoxin, GM-CSF, TGFβ, IL-10, LL-37, Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO), and Arginase (ARG-1). Each of the soluble mediators were to be plotted versus measurement time point [i.e., (pre-study run-in visit (RV)1), baseline (RV3), study visit (SV)2, and SV3]) and by subjects' quartile of percent reduction (%) in target wound area at SV3 from baseline (RV3).</description>

        <title>Determine Change From Baseline in Cell Numbers in Subjects With VLU Following the First Dose of HP802-247</title>
        <description>The following mediators were to be measured for the chronic ulcer stage: IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN, MMP-2, and MMP-9, and the following for the resolving ulcer stage: PGE-2, Lipoxin, GM-CSF, TGFβ, IL-10, LL-37, Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase (IDO), and Arginase (ARG-1). Each of the soluble mediators were to be plotted versus measurement time point [i.e., (pre-study run-in visit (RV)1), baseline (RV3), study visit (SV)2, and SV3]) and by subjects’ quartile of percent reduction (%) in target wound area at SV3 from baseline (RV3).</description>
        <time_frame>Wound fluid samples were to be collected one week after the initial dose of HP802-247.</time_frame>
        <population>Due to the failure of HP802-247-09-029 to show superiority over its vehicle in study 802-247-09-029, this study was terminated after enrollment of one of the proposed 25 subjects. No data was collected.</population>
