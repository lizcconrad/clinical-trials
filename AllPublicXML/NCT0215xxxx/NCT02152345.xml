  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to ﬁnd out whether treatment to prevent kidney rejection
      with belatacept in presence of Thymoglobulin induction and withdrawal of steroids will result
      in less delayed graft function or &quot;sleepy kidney&quot; after transplant than that seen in patients
      who get tacrolimus as their main drug to prevent rejection instead of belatacept. The
      investigators will also look at whether patients who get belatacept have the same, lesser or
      more problems that those who get tacrolimus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New York Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYPH-CUMC) performs nearly
      250 renal transplants annually; of these approximately half are recipients of a variety of
      deceased donor kidneys, usually with cold ischemia time (CIT) &gt;24 hours leading to an
      approximate incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) of 50%. The main focus of this study
      will be to determine whether initial immunosuppression with belatacept with Thymoglobulin
      induction will result in lower incidence and/or more rapid disappearance of DGF than that
      observed in patients who receive tacrolimus based immunosuppression. NGAL determinations will
      bne made in the first months after transplantation to correlate with clinical DGF.

    <time_frame>Up to 3 months post-transplantation</time_frame>
    <description>To assess whether treatment with Thymoglobulin induction and belatacept based maintenance immunosuppression would reduce delayed graft function (DGF) rates among recipients of deceased donor renal transplants as measured by clinical findings and NGAL marker, as specified below and defined by others. This will be compared to the incidence of DGF in patients treated with a Tacrolimus based regimen.
Patients who require hemodialysis in the first 7 days after transplantation and/or patients whose serum creatinine decreases &lt;10% during 3 consecutive days after the transplant will be considered to have DGF in the absence of other confounding factors such as obstruction or infection. NGAL will be used as a verification marker of DGF.</description>
