      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of genetically modified T-cells
      after lymphodepleting chemotherapy in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or
      blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm that has returned after a period of improvement
      or has not responded to previous treatment. An immune cell is a type of blood cell that can
      recognize and kill abnormal cells in the body. The immune cell product will be made from
      patient or patient's donor (related or unrelated) blood cells. The immune cells are changed
      by inserting additional pieces of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (genetic material) into the
      cell to make it recognize and kill cancer cells. Placing a modified gene into white blood
      cells may help the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To examine the anti-tumor activity and safety of administering ex vivo
      expanded T cells that are genetically modified using a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral
      vector to express a co-stimulatory CD123-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as
      a truncated EGFR (CD123CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt+ T cells [CD123+ CAR T cells]) following
      lymphodepletion for patients with CD123+ relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      (arm 1), or CD123+ persistent or recurrent Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm
      (BPDCN) (arm 2). II. To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for both arms (AML and
      BPDCN). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess activity in the form of CD123+ CAR T cell
      persistence, 6 month progression free survival (PFS 6mo) rate, and 1 year overall survival
      (OS) rate, and describe the immunogenicity of CD123R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ T cells. TERTIARY
      OBJECTIVES: I. To assess impact on hematopoiesis, change from baseline in numbers of CD123+
      blood cells, CD123 expression on malignant cells and hematopoietic cells, and the clinical
      efficacy of EGFRt mediated CAR T cell ablation.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous or allogeneic (related or unrelated
      donor) CD123+ CAR T cells. Patients undergo a lymphodepleting regimen 3-10 days prior to
      CD123+ CAR T cell infusion as determined by the principal investigator and the protocol team.
      Patients receive either cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -4 and/or -3; fludarabine
      phosphate and cyclophosphamide IV on days -5 to -3; fludarabine phosphate IV on days -5 to -3
      and cyclophosphamide IV on days -4 and/or -3. Patients receive autologous or allogeneic
      CD123+ CAR T cells IV over 15 minutes on day 0. Patients with evidence of disease at &gt; 28
      days, continuing expression of the CD123 antigen, and not having experienced a dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) may receive a second infusion of CD123+ CAR T cells after 28 days. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, then every 2 days for up
      to 14 days, every week for 1 month, every month for 1 year and then yearly for 15 years.

          -  Neurological: research participant without clinically significant encephalopathy/new
             focal deficits

          -  Infectious diseases: no clinical evidence of uncontrolled active infectious process

        ALLOGENEIC DONOR CRITERIA FOR APHERESIS DONATION:

          -  Related donor selection will be conducted in accordance with City of Hope's Department
             of Hematology &amp; Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation criteria and, in the case of
             unrelated donor from a transplant center, will comply with the National Marrow Donor
             Program's (NMDP) donor selection standards; when a potentially eligible recipient of
             an unrelated donor product from an NMDP Center is identified, the recipient will
             complete an NMDP search transfer request to allow City of Hope (COH) NMDP staff to
             contact the NMDP Coordinating Center, who in turn, will contact the donor's prior
             Donor Center; the search will follow the NMDP Policy for subsequent donation requests;
             any form deemed appropriate and necessary by the NMDP, including the Subsequent
             Donation Request Form, Therapeutic T Cell Collection Prescription and Therapeutic Stem
             Cell Collection Prescription, will be submitted as required

          -  In the case of a related donor: The identified donor must be the original donor whose
             stem cells were used for the research participant's alloSCT

          -  For both related and unrelated donors: The donor's hepatitis B surface antigen must be
             negative and the hepatitis C antibody must be nonreactive; in the case of a positive
             hepatitis C antibody result, the hepatitic C virus (HCV) viral polymerase chain
             reaction (PCR) will have to be performed and the results should be negative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Research participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not
             limited to ongoing or active or poorly controlled infection, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, poorly controlled
             pulmonary disease or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance
             with study requirements

          -  Research participants who have tested human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, or
             have active hepatitis B or C infection based on testing performed within 4 weeks of
             enrollment

          -  Research participants with presence of other active malignancy. However, research
             participants with history of prior malignancy treated with curative intent and in
             complete remission are eligible

          -  Pregnant and lactating women are excluded from this study

        Study-Specific Exclusion

          -  Failure of research participant to understand the basic elements of the protocol
             and/or the risks/benefits of participating in this phase I study

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biological composition to cetuximab

          -  Dependence on corticosteroids:

               -  If the participant is undergoing leukapheresis: physiological replacement doses
                  of steroids are allowed - prednisone no more than 7.5 mg, hydrocortisone less
                  than 12 mg/m^2/day

                    -  However, all participants must be able to reduce steroid requirement to no
                       more than physiological replacement doses prior to start of lymphodepletion

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy

          -  Research participants will be excluded, who in the opinion of the investigator, may
             not be able to comply with the safety monitoring requirements of the study
