  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine the risk of atypical femoral shaft (thigh bone)
      fractures after long term fracture prevention therapy with a class of drugs called
      &quot;bisphosphonates&quot;, colloquially referred to as Alendronate, risedronate, Ibandronate, and
      Zoledronate.

      In addition, the study is designed to find out which patient is most likely to develop this
      potential life changing complication and why. Finally, the results of this study will help
      clinicians to better understand the reason and thus tailor patient specific treatmentsâ€¦i.e.,
      &quot;the right treatment for the right patient for right duration.&quot;
