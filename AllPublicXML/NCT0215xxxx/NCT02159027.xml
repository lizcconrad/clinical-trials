      Maraviroc is an antiretroviral medication that may help in improving mental function in HIV
      infected patients with mental problems by decreasing inflammatory tendencies. We will test
      this in a clinical trial of 42 HIV infected individuals with some mild to moderate mental
      problems who are already on HIV medications and doing well. We will add Maraviroc or a sugar
      pill to their HIV medications and see if mental function improves over 48 weeks. This study
      will be conducted at 2 sites in Hawaii and Puerto Rico.

      We hypothesize that maraviroc (MVC) will lead to improved cognition as assessed by
      improvement in neuropsychological (NP) performance. We hypothesize that MVC therapy leads to
      (1) decrease in HIV infection of monocytes (MO), particularly of CD16-expressing MO and (2)
      phenotypic and functional secretory changes suggestive of decrease in MO immune activation,
      and that these changes will lead to less HIV infected activated MO trafficking to the CNS,
      less CNS inflammation and neuronal damage, and ultimately improved cognition. We will test
      this in a 48 week trial in 42 HIV infected individuals on suppressive antiretroviral therapy
      (ART) with mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction. These individuals will be randomized to
      intensify their ART in double-blind fashion to MVC vs placebo. The primary endpoint will be
      change in NPZglobal. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)/magnetic resonance spectroscopic
      imaging (MRSI) will be conducted to assess potential alterations in inflammatory and neuronal
      brain chemicals.
