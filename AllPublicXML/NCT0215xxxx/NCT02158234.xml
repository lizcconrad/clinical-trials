  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves another course of radiation (called re-irradiation) to the participant's
      tumor. The type of radiation is called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The
      purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of different doses of SBRT
      given along with the chemotherapy drug, cisplatin. The researchers want to see which dose of
      radiation will work best in controlling the growth of head/neck cancer. The usual treatment
      for head/neck cancer that has grown is surgery and/or more radiation with various
      chemotherapy drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a relatively new radiation technique in which a
      few very high doses of radiation are delivered to small, well-defined tumors. It has been
      used effectively in other cancers like lung and liver. The goal is to deliver a radiation
      dose that is high enough to kill the cancer while limiting radiation to surrounding healthy
      organs. The daily dose of radiation is 2-3 times greater than conventional radiotherapy, but
      it is given for only 5 days over a 2 week period. Conventional radiotherapy is given over 6-7
      weeks. The chemotherapy drug, cisplatin is used as a radiation sensitizer and will be given
      before each of the 5 radiation treatments.

    <description>The traditional 3+3 dose escalation method will be utilized for this phase I study, with up to 3 sequential cohorts. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) radiation dose associated with a ≤ 33% probability of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). DLT is defined as any grade 4 or greater toxicity, per The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4 (CTCAE v4) that occurs within 3 months from the start of SBRT.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local Control Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Local control is defined as lack of progression as defined radiographically or pathologically proven within the SBRT treated area. This will be calculated via Kaplan-Meier method. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>
