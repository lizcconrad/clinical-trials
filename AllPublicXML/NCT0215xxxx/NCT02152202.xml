  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our main objective is to perform an explanatory, first stage proof of concept, randomized
      controlled trial to determine whether a semi-upright patient position versus a supine
      position while asleep in the postoperative period helps decrease the worsening of AHI in
      patients diagnosed with OSA and compare this to usual care (i.e. supine patient positioning
      while asleep).

      The investigators will evaluate whether a semi-upright position reduces: worsening of AHI (as
      measured with a portable PSG) on the second postoperative night (POD2); oxygen desaturation
      index (using a portable oxygen saturation monitor, oxygen desaturation defined as &gt;4% change
      below baseline lasting for 10 seconds); REM sleep related change in AHI at baseline and
      POD2.; major and minor perioperative complications on postoperative day POD1, POD2, at
      discharge and POD 30.; length of hospital stay and readmission within 30 days; and patient
      satisfaction score on POD30

      The proposed study is to determine whether patient positioning in supine or semi-sitting
      position can effectively control the worsening of OSA see in the postoperative period.

      The study patient will be randomized to semi-sitting position (45 degrees incline) group or
      supine (0 degrees incline) group. Patients will undergo a portable sleep study on the first
      or second postoperative night. They will also be monitored with wristwatch oximeter pre and
      postoperatively according to the study protocol. Patients will be managed according to the
      routine care determined by the health care team. There will be no change in the clinical
      management of patients.

    <measure>Comparison of worsening of severity of OSA using the Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as determined by a portable polysomnography study from baseline (preoperatively) to the second postoperative night.</measure>
    <time_frame>3days</time_frame>
    <description>The AHI is used as a surrogate outcome to establish the diagnosis of OSA (AHI&gt;5) and severity of OSA as per the guidelines from American Academy of Sleep Physicians (AASP).5 It is a continuous outcome and is measured by counting the number of apneas (complete cessation of airflow for more than 10 s) and hypopneas (airflow reduction more than 50%) despite continuing breathing efforts and thus differentiating from central events (absence of breathing efforts). The relationship of AHI to clinical outcomes of relevance has been well established in the literature.</description>

    <description>The oxygen desaturation index; REM sleep related change in AHI at baseline and POD2 and time spent in lateral position while asleep will be deciphered from the PSG data.</description>

          -  Known cervical, shoulder, spine abnormalities, and/or chronic pain predisposing to
