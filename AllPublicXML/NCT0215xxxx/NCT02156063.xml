      This is a randomised, double blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled study of subcutaneous
      NT100 in pregnant women with a history of unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Approximately
      150 participants will be randomised to receive subcutaneous NT100 or placebo. Participants
      will be screened for eligibility, and will begin attempts at spontaneous conception.
      Following randomization and initiation of study drug treatment, participants will visit the
      study site at specified intervals throughout the study for assessments and blood work.

      All participants will be monitored for adverse events. All participants who have received at
      least one dose of study drug will be followed for safety for a minimum of 4 weeks following
      the last dose of study drug. After delivery, pregnancy outcome information will be obtained.
