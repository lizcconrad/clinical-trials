  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to use a new research imaging technique, a kind of magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI), to measure important metabolic features of muscle, including
      mitochondrial function, in people with mitochondrial disease and in healthy individuals.
      (Mitochondria are tiny organelles that generate energy for the body.)

      It is hoped that this new strategy will help physicians to understand better the health
      problems of people with mitochondrial disease. Eventually, this could lead to better
      diagnostic and treatment approaches.

      There are two study-related visits.

      The first visit is a &quot;screening&quot; visit to ensure eligibility. This includes fasting blood
      tests. The second visit is an MRI scanning session. This also takes around 2 - 3 hours, with
      no more than 1.5 hours spent in the actual MRI machine. It may be possible to complete these
      two visits on the same day. Otherwise, the MRI session should occur within 3 months of the
      screening visit. In addition, an optional physical capacity visit will occur on the same day
      as the MRI session.
