  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, investigators will infuse donor bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells
      intravenously, as a treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis that has
      not responded to conventional therapies. The goals of this study are to test the safety and
      tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

      Mesenchymal stromal cells support the development of blood cells within the bone marrow. When
      isolated from a donor and infused into an animal or human, they have been demonstrated to
      travel to areas of inflammation, to alter immune responses, to decrease pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, and to promote tissue repair. Infusion of these cells does not lead to rejection.
      These properties lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be
      beneficial in treating inflammatory bowel disease.

      inflammatory bowel disease.

      Investigators will culture donated bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in a unique
      automated system, and infuse the cells in a fresh, replicating stage of growth. This study is
      to test the safety and tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
