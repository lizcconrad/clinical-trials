  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess, in real life, the efficacy and the eligibility for
      discharge of a local anesthetic, CLOROTEKAL®, used for spinal anesthesia in short outpatient
      surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, observational, prospective, multicentre, national study, conducted in
      France, from a representative sample of physician anesthetists.

      The efficacy and safety in real life of CLOROTEKAL® will be assessed in patients undergoing a
      short outpatient surgery under spinal anesthesia. Data will be collected by the physician
      during two visits (pre-anesthesia and per-postoperative consultation). Additional data
      regarding the patient's perception (safety, pain and satisfaction) will be collected using a
      self-questionnaire.

        Patients scheduled for surgery under spinal anesthesia of short duration will be informed
        about the study and will be asked to participate, from about day -14 (pre-anesthesia
        consultation) to 24h after the day of surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients seen in pre-anesthesia consultation for ambulatory surgery

          -  Patients for whom a spinal anesthesia using CLOROTEKAL® is planned

          -  Patients accepting and able to complete a satisfaction self-administered questionnaire

          -  Informed patients who accept the computer processing of their medical data and their
             right of access and correction

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with contra-indications to spinal anesthesia (eg decompensated cardiac
             insufficiency, hypovolemic shock….)

          -  Patients with contra-indications to chloroprocaine (hypersensitivity to the active
             substance, medicinal products of the para-aminobenzoic acid ester group, other
             ester-type local anaesthetics or to any of the excipients ; Intravenous regional
             anaesthesia (the anesthetic agent is introduced into the limb and allowed to set in
             while tourniquets retain the agent within the desired area), serious problems with
             cardiac conduction, severe anemia)

          -  Patients participating or having participated in the previous month in a clinical
             trial in anesthesiology
