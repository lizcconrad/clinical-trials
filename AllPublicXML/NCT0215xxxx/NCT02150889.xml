    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in how skeletal muscle processes fat and how this may affect
      insulin resistance. This is an important question since insulin resistance predates and
      predicts type 2 diabetes. The investigators are especially interested in learning about the
      effects of weight and training on insulin resistance. The investigators will study people
      before and after supervised aerobic or yoga training to identify differences in resting fat
      and sugar metabolism which may lead to differences in insulin resistance. The investigators
      will test these differences using stable isotopes, and the use of these stable isotopes is
      experimental.

      Overweight/Obese Group: Eight visits will be required at the University of Minnesota Clinical
      Research Unit. Four visits will be done before training (screen and 3 pre-training visits), 1
      visit during the training, and 3 post-training visits will be done. In between, the training
      will take about 16 weeks and will be a supervised treadmill program.

      Lean/Trained Group: Four visits will be required at the University of Minnesota Clinical
      Research Unit (screen and 3 study visits).

      Insulin resistance plays a critical role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), with
      skeletal muscle the largest site of insulin resistance in the human body. In sedentary
      humans, insulin resistance correlates with levels of intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and lipid
      metabolites that adversely affect skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. However, even modest
      endurance training has been shown to reduce insulin resistance while increasing skeletal
      muscle IMCL. Moreover, lean endurance trained participants have IMCL levels comparable to
      those of patients with T2DM, yet have significantly lower insulin resistance. These findings
      suggest that the physiological changes caused by training protect against lipid induced
      insulin resistance and that this protection is present even at rest, however our preliminary
      data suggest that training facilitates utilization of readily available fuel, with lipid
      preferentially used over glucose when available. We will test the overarching hypothesis that
      training increases resting skeletal muscle lipid metabolism, as measured by markers of IMCL
      lipolysis, accumulation of fatty acid metabolites and mitochondrial utilization of fatty
      acids.
