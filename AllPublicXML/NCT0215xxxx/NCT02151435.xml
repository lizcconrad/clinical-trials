  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal, fibrotic disorder of the lung.
      The estimated prevalence is 30-80/100,000 in the United States with incidence estimates
      clearly rising. A major challenge in the care of patients with IPF is determining prognosis.
      The natural history of IPF is usually one of inexorable decline in lung function, ultimately
      resulting in death from respiratory failure. However, longitudinal physiologic decline in IPF
      is heterogeneous and difficult to predict in individual patients. While some patients with
      IPF may remain stable for years, in others the disease may progress rapidly over a relatively
      short time. We hypothesize that peripheral blood biomarkers based on extracellular matrix and
      matrix-modifying molecules will improve prognostication in patients with IPF.

        The study population includes subjects with IPF identified via the University of Michigan
        Interstitial Lung Disease Clinical-Radiologic-Pathologic Conference. The investigators will
        only enroll subjects in whom an IPF diagnosis is firmly established.

             to be detrimental to you or that the PI deems makes you a poor candidate
