    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test an integrated cognitive-behavioral
      intervention for smoking and alcohol among heavy drinking smokers. The current pre-pilot
      phase will be used to refine this protocol for the subsequent randomized, controlled pilot
      phase. The current study phase has two parts: 1) an intake session and brief physical; 2) a
      12-week treatment phase in which participants receive varenicline (Chantix) and weekly,
      personalized counseling.

      The purpose of the proposed project is to develop and test a 12-week integrated
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for smoking and alcohol (SA) + varenicline
      (Chantix) among heavy drinking smokers (i.e., CBT for SA). The project involves two phases.
      In Phase 1, an open-label pre-pilot study of CBT for SA will be conducted with 10 heavy
      drinking smokers. The primary results of this phase will be used to refine the CBT for SA
      protocol. In Phase 2, a randomized, controlled pilot study will be conducted with 40 heavy
      drinking smokers comparing CBT for SA with standard smoking counseling (SC). All participants
      in the randomized pilot study will also receive varenicline (Chantix).

      Primary and Study Completion dates were changed 6/2016 to reflect an additional year added
      year to the study.

    <description>Cognitive-behavioral therapy for smoking and alcohol (CBT for SA) entails weekly counseling for 12-weeks. Sessions are focused on providing personalized, health feedback to motivate participants to make changes in smoking and drinking and teaching skills that will help them sustain changes in both behaviors. Skills target heavy drinking smokers' social environments and negative affect (i.e., anger, stress, anxiety, boredom). Participants in this condition will also receive 12 weeks of varenicline (Chantix).</description>
