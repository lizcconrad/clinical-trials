  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit patients submitted to bariatric surgery. Individuals will be
      supplemented with 6g/day of prebiotic or synbiotic or placebo (maltodextrin) for 15 days.
      Immunological, metabolic and anthropometric parameters will be assessed before and after the
      supplementation. Our hypothesis is that prebiotic or synbiotic supplementation modulate
      plasma concentrations of immunological and metabolic parameters and anthropometric measures
      of subjects undergoing gastric bypass Roux-Y.

      The study will recruit patients submitted to roux-en-y gastric bypass. Individuals that meet
      the inclusion criteria will be randomized by means of a computer program on three study
      groups: 1) Prebiotic group: Oral supplementation with 6g/day of prebiotic for 15 days. 2)
      Synbiotic group: Oral supplementation with 6g/day of synbiotic for 15 days. 3) Placebo group
      (control): Oral supplementation with 6g/day of placebo (maltodextrin) for 15 days. Will be
      assessed the effects of supplementation on the plasma cytokines, plasma lipopolysaccharide
      (bacterial endotoxin), plasma cellular fatty acid profile, metabolic parameters (lipid
      profile, glycemic status and insulin resistance) and nutritional status. Blood samples will
      be collected before the surgery and the supplementation will begin 30 days after surgery.
