  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background : Brain vulnerability is particularly marked in preterm neonates and has long-term
      consequences. Unlike lesions affecting other organs, those that affect the brain can
      currently not 'be repaired' by producing new cells. However, exeprience-driven brain
      plasticity allows the brain to reorganise its connections to compensate (at least partially)
      the effects of an injury.

      Purpose : To evaluate the influence of Primebrain stimulation programme administred by
      parents until 6 months post-term on motor and neurophysiological development of infants born
      &lt;32 weeks' gestation or with birth weight &lt;1500 g.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm and very low birth weight infants are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders,
      including cerebral palsy, sensory impairment and intellectual disability. Several early
      intervention approaches have been designed in the hope of optimising neurological development
      in this context. These programmes show high variety in the type of intervention, frequency of
      sessions and total duration of the intervention, as well as the duration of follow-up.
      Depending on studies, there is an inconstant benefit on cognitive and behavioural development
      in the first 2 years and preschool age. According to the most recent studies, it seems
      important that the intervention takes into account parental mental health, focuses on
      parent-child interactions and lasts sufficiently long.

      This prospective randomized-controlled clinical study has been designed to evaluate the
      effects of an additional parent-administed programme to the usual care in this developmental
      risk population,.

      The intervention is carried out at home by parents coached by physiotherapist from term-age
      to 6 months of corrected age. The monitoring and evaluation period for all infants
      participating in the study ends at 24 months of corrected age and includes clinical,
      neurodevelopmental, parental stress and neurophysiological assessments using high density
      electroencephalography and recording of event-related potentials at term age, 3, 6, 12 ,18
      and 24 months of corrected age (ActiveTwo, BioSemi).

    <description>' Stimulation ' Infants group will receive Primebrain stimulation whose items were selected according to a Delphi process and discussed at the European Academy of Childhood Disability (2013).
This sensorimotor stimulation programme is administered at home by parents (trained and monitored by a physical therapist), once a day between term-age and 6 months of corrected age.
In addition, these infants undergo systematic monitoring for preterm and infants born with low birth weight as organized in Belgium (&quot; INAMI convention &quot;).</description>
