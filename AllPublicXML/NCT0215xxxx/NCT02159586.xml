      The objective of this study is to determine if Gastric Electrical Stimulation may influence
      vagal outflow via vagal afferent fibers that terminate in the Central Nervous System.

      This study will evaluate male and female patients at least 18 years of age, with
      gastroparesis, who will or have already undergone the implantation of a GES device

      The study will be conducted at one center and approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled.

      Subjects undergoing the GES implantation will be enrolled before the implantation and may
      have a baseline visit. The visit procedures will be conducted at the discretion of the
      investigator dependent on the clinical condition of the patient at that time.

    <description>The objective of this study is to determine if GES may influence vagal outflow via vagal afferent fibers that terminate in the Central Nervous System (CNS).
The development of a method to record and analyze compound action potentials from the vagus nerve will enhance our knowledge of the mechanism of action of Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS) in the treatment of gastroparesis. In addition, noninvasive measures of vagus nerve excitability are an important initial step towards 1) improved stimulus parameter tuning protocols in new device recipients before direct nerve recording technology is available, 2) a method of monitoring the nerve response over extended periods of time to ensure optimal device settings for the duration of the implantation, and 3) the development of completely noninvasive VNS device option. Furthermore, the technique itself may be of value in other clinical settings in which it would be useful to evaluate the physiological integrity of the vagus nerve</description>
