  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized-controlled trial in which subjects will be randomized to
      receive either routine contraceptive counseling or peer mentoring plus routine contraceptive
      counseling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unintended adolescent pregnancy continues to be a significant public health problem in the
      United States. While the use of highly effective forms of birth control, such as the
      long-acting, reversible contraceptives (LARC) have been found to be more effective in
      decreasing pregnancy rates than non-LARC methods of birth control, knowledge and use of LARC
      has been shown to be low in this vulnerable population. We are interested in better
      understanding the influence peers may have on contraceptive decision making among
      adolescents. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a peer mentoring
      intervention on adolescent contraceptive decision making, specifically with regard to
      increasing long-acting, reversible contraceptive uptake. The main study intervention will
      consist of randomization to usual contraceptive counseling versus peer-mentoring plus usual
      contraceptive counseling. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires will be used to better
      understand peer influence on contraceptive decision making, and to assess the peer
      mentor-teen intervention interaction.

    <description>Peer mentoring will entail the peer mentor describing her positive experience with her LARC method. The participant will then have a chance to ask any experience related questions to the mentor. Any clinical inquiries or questions the mentor does not feel comfortable answering, she will defer to the contraceptive counselor/ physician who will be subsequently providing the routine counseling. The entire peer mentor encounter should not last more than 10 minutes.</description>
