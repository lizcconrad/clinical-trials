  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test two study drugs, one of which is temazepam (15mg) and
      one of which is a placebo (an inactive substance that looks just like the temazepam), to see
      if insomnia (trouble sleeping) can be reduced in patients with HIV infection. Placebos are
      given in research studies to try and make sure that subjects are responding to the effects of
      the study drug and not to other factors, like the attention they are receiving. If you decide
      to take part in this study, you will take 1 capsule of study drug every night approximately
      30 minutes before bedtime for approximately 12 weeks.

      This study is to test the study drug called temazepam for the treatment of insomnia (trouble
      sleeping) in patients with HIV infection. Temazepam has been approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of insomnia. However, because this study requires treatment for 12 weeks instead of
      the 7 to 10 days approved by the FDA, the use of temazepam is considered to be
      investigational in this study.

    <measure>Mean Change in the Insomnia Severity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to final study visit, approximately 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in the total score of the Insomnia Severity Index from Randomization to Final Study Visit after 12 weeks of double blind, placebo controlled dosing. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), is a 7-item questionnaire on a Likhert scale (0-4) assessing sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, satisfaction/distress over sleep problems, and daytime dysfunction. Responses to each item are summed to obtain a total score to determine the severity of insomnia. The total score can range from 0 to 28 with higher scores indicating greater insomnia severity.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in Piper Fatigue Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A multidimensional scale for measuring fatigue, whose validity and reliability have been established across many patient populations including cancer patients, HIV, pregnancy, and myocardial infarction. There are 22 questions, in 3 subscales that measure behavioral, affective meaning, sensory and cognitive/mood aspects of fatigue, each scored on an 11-point likhert scale with a score of 0-10, 0 indicating no fatigue and 10 indicating the most severe fatigue. The Piper Fatigue Scale can range from 0 to 220 with higher scores indicating greater fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety (HADS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A scale designed to detect states of anxiety and depression in the setting of an outpatient clinic, that consists of 2 sets: the HADS-A (Anxiety) and HADS-D (Depression). This is a series of 7 questions in each set (for a total of 14), assessed on a scale from 0-4, 0 being the response that indicates the least anxiety or depression, and 4 the most. Separate scores are calculated for anxiety and depression and a score (ranging from 0 to 21) is obtained for each subscale. The higher the score, the more severe the anxiety or depression.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in the Distress Thermometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A clinical tool that has been validated widely especially in cancer patients, to detect clinically significant emotional distress. This is a one-item scale that asks participants to rate their distress on scale from 0-100. Lower scores represent less distress and higher scores indicate greater distress.</description>

        <description>Mean change in the total score of the Insomnia Severity Index from Randomization to Final Study Visit after 12 weeks of double blind, placebo controlled dosing. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), is a 7-item questionnaire on a Likhert scale (0-4) assessing sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, satisfaction/distress over sleep problems, and daytime dysfunction. Responses to each item are summed to obtain a total score to determine the severity of insomnia. The total score can range from 0 to 28 with higher scores indicating greater insomnia severity.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety (HADS-A)</title>
        <description>A scale designed to detect states of anxiety and depression in the setting of an outpatient clinic, that consists of 2 sets: the HADS-A (Anxiety) and HADS-D (Depression). This is a series of 7 questions in each set (for a total of 14), assessed on a scale from 0-4, 0 being the response that indicates the least anxiety or depression, and 4 the most. Separate scores are calculated for anxiety and depression and a score (ranging from 0 to 21) is obtained for each subscale. The higher the score, the more severe the anxiety or depression.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression (HADS-D)</title>
        <description>A scale designed to detect states of anxiety and depression in the setting of an outpatient clinic, that consists of 2 sets: the HADS-A (Anxiety) and HADS-D (Depression). This is a series of 7 questions in each set (for a total of 14), assessed on a scale from 0-4, 0 being the response that indicates the least anxiety or depression, and 4 the most. Separate scores are calculated for anxiety and depression and a score (ranging from 0 to 21) is obtained for each subscale. The higher the score, the more severe the anxiety or depression.</description>
