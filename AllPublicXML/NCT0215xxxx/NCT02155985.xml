  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since people started taking HIV medications, illness from AIDS has decreased, but other
      serious diseases like heart disease, cancer, and kidney, and liver disease have increased.
      HIV causes inflammation (irritation) inside the body that cannot be felt but can be measured
      by blood. Inflammation can lead to diseases that have become some of the leading causes of
      death in people with HIV. HIV therapy can partially lower levels of inflammation measured in
      blood, however, levels of inflammation in people who have HIV may remain high compared with
      people not infected with HIV.

      Aspirin is a drug that is commonly used for pain relief but is also approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for preventing heart attacks and stroke in those who are at
      increased risk for heart attack and stroke. Aspirin also is used (but is not approved by the
      FDA) to decrease the risk of some cancers in people who are at increased risk. Aspirin is
      thought to decrease risk of heart attack and stroke because it blocks the activation of
      platelets and prevents blood clots from clogging narrowed blood vessels, a disease called
      atherosclerosis. It is unknown how aspirin might decrease the chance of developing cancer in
      some people at higher risk, but aspirin has been shown to modulate (or change) the immune
      system. In HIV-infected people who have been taking antiretroviral therapy and have an
      undetectable HIV viral load it was recently shown that low-dose aspirin 81 mg (baby aspirin),
      given for one week, lowers platelet activation and reduces blood markers of inflammation
      which may improve the function of the immune system.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether aspirin improves inflammation and immune
      activation when compared to a placebo (inactive medication like a dummy pill) and to
      determine if 12 weeks of aspirin 300 mg and aspirin 100 mg is safe for HIV-infected persons
      on antiretroviral therapy. Additionally, it studied whether a higher dose and longer duration
      of aspirin provides further anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating benefit. This was done
      using blood and urine tests that measure inflammation and also with a test that uses
      ultrasound to measure the flow of blood in your arm, called flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD)
      of the brachial artery (BART). This is a painless test that bounces sound waves off of a
      blood vessel in your arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase II prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 3-arm clinical
      trial to study whether aspirin improves inflammation and immune activation. At study entry,
      participants were randomized between the three study arms: aspirin 300 mg, aspirin 100 mg and
      placebo. The study treatment duration was 12 weeks, followed by a 4 week washout period. The
      study duration was 16 weeks.

      The study clinic visits included pre-entry (within 7 days prior to entry), entry, on
      treatment visits at weeks 2, 11 and 12, and final study visit at the end of the wash-out
      period at week 16. The samples for the primary and secondary outcomes were collected at
      pre-entry, entry, and weeks 2, 11 and 12. The evaluations of safety (clinical assessment for
      signs and symptoms, diagnoses, laboratory tests) were done at entry and weeks 2, 11, 12 and
      16.

      The co-primary objectives used pair-wise comparisons to assess the effects of 300 mg and 100
      mg of daily aspirin for 12 weeks on plasma sCD14 levels.

        If the female volunteer is not of reproductive potential (women who are menopausal, defined
        as not having had a menses for at least 12 months with an FSH of greater than 40 IU/L, or
        if FSH testing is not available, have had amenorrhea for 24 consecutive months, or women
        who have undergone surgical sterilization, (eg, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal

        <title>Change in sCD14 From Baseline to Week 11/12</title>
        <description>Baseline is defined as the average of the Pre-Entry and Entry values. Week 11/12 is defined as the average of the Week 11 and Week 12 values. All values were log10 transformed prior to calculating change and conducting analyses. Values obtained within 6 days after the influenza vaccination were excluded.
Absolute change was calculated as the value at week 11/12 minus the value at baseline. Mean changes were exponentiated to be back on the untransformed scale and corresponds to a mean fold change. Differences between arms are expressed as the percent difference between mean fold changes.</description>

        <description>Baseline is defined as the average of the Pre-Entry and Entry values. Week 11/12 is defined as the average of the Week 11 and Week 12 values. All values were log10 transformed prior to calculating change and conducting analyses. Values obtained within 6 days after the influenza vaccination were excluded.
Absolute change was calculated as the value at week 11/12 minus the value at baseline. Mean changes were exponentiated to be back on the untransformed scale and corresponds to a mean fold change.</description>

        <title>Change in IL-6 From Baseline to Week 11/12</title>
        <description>Baseline is defined as the average of the Pre-Entry and Entry values. Week 11/12 is defined as the average of the Week 11 and Week 12 values. All values were log10 transformed prior to calculating change and conducting analyses. Values obtained within 6 days after the influenza vaccination were excluded.
Absolute change was calculated as the value at week 11/12 minus the value at baseline. Mean changes were exponentiated to be back on the untransformed scale and corresponds to a mean fold change.</description>
