      The intervention provide services to children with Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) who
      are in foster care and to their birth parents to prepare the families for reunification. The
      evaluation follows a randomized design. The pretest will assess the procedures and
      instruments for collecting data on child, youth, and family functioning. Ultimately, after
      the pretest is complete, the data collected through the evaluation will provide information
      on the extent to which the intervention achieved its goal of improving parenting skills and
      enhancing readiness for reunification among the families who received the services.
