  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a single center, prospective and self-controlled trial. We'd like to explore a new
      method by changing position to reduce gastric missing areas in Capsule Endoscopy(CE)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:Capsule endoscopy is widely used to observe small intestine.While it may miss
      important areas in stomachï¼Œespecially in fundus.So far,physicians have no methods to observe
      stomach without no-missing areas by capsule endoscopy.

      Objective:To explore a new method to reduce the areas missed by CE.

      Methods:Subjects were prospectively enrolled.Every subjects will undergo 2 capsule
      endoscopies and 1 gastroscope.First capsule endoscopy,every subject have a better gastric
      preparation before swallowing CE and change position during the procedure.Second capsule
      endoscopy,every subject have a conventional CE. And then, every subject have a gastroscope.

      Measurements:The primary measurements included safety, gastric preparation, visualization of
      gastric mucosa and rate of lesion detection.

    <description>Gastric preparation included the degree of cleanliness and distention.Cleanliness was evaluated by 3 grades: good (the fluid was transparent and &lt;5% of gastric mucosa was obscured by stomach contents), moderate (the fluid was a little opaque or 5% to 10% of gastric mucosa was obscured by stomach contents) and poor (the fluid was opaque or &gt;10% of gastric mucosa was obscured by stomach contents). Distention was evaluated by 3 grades: good (existence of a small amount of gastric folds), moderate (existence of significant amount of gastric folds and gastric cavity was smaller than expected) and poor (gastric cavity was not inflated).</description>

    <description>Gastroscope is the golden standard in diagnosing gastric diseases.we defined rate of lesion detection as the lesions detected by CE compared to gastroscope.</description>
