  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintenance of body's skeletal muscle is key to a healthy older age. However, as we age we
      lose on average 1-2% of our muscle each year. In order to slow this loss we need to
      understand fully the mechanisms regulating muscle mass with ageing. In this project we aim to
      determine these mechanisms using a new novel technique of 'heavy' water ingestion, which will
      allow us to measure multiple aspects of skeletal muscle mass control during normal everyday
      activities in young and old individuals over a period of 6 weeks. We will also determine the
      influence of resistance exercise training during this period in offsetting declines in muscle
      with ageing using this method
