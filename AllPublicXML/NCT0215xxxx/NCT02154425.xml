  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess whether there is transfer of Certolizumab
      Pegol (CZP) into breast milk of lactating mothers who are receiving an established dosing
      regimen of CZP by evaluating the concentration of CZP in mature breast milk, and to calculate
      the daily infant dose of maternal CZP.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will only include women who are receiving treatment with Certolizumab Pegol (CZP)
      for an approved indication in accordance with their treating physician, although this study
      is non-interventional regarding treatment with CZP, it is considered interventional due to
      the collection of breast milk from the lactating mothers.

    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be taken from breast milk of lactating mothers on an established dosing regimen of CZP on Day 0 of the Sampling Period, just prior to next scheduled dose of CZP, and on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 (pre-dose if Q2W dosing), relative to CZP administration on Day 0. In addition, in mothers on a CZP Q4W dosing regimen, the concentration of CZP in breast milk will also be evaluated on or about Day 28 (i.e., prior to and on the same day of the next scheduled administration of CZP).
Included are mothers who decided to continue on, or to start treatment with, Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) for an approved indication with their treating physician prior to participation into this study. The mother is responsible for procuring her own supply of commercial CZP. The CZP dose and administration schedule will be as per the locally approved label.</description>
