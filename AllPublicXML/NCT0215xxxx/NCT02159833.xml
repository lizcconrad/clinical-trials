  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct low-dose intranasal allergen challenges on
      children/adolescents with a diagnosis of food allergy to egg/cow's milk/soya/wheat/peanut.
      The data will be used to determine the safety and potential utility of intranasal food
      challenges in the diagnosis of food allergy.

    <description>The physiological response to food (egg/cow's milk/soya/wheat/peanut) protein when administered into the human nasal airway in food-allergic children with the corresponding food allergy. This will be assessed objectively (using acoustic rhinometry and peak nasal inspiratory flow) as well as subjectively (using a validated Symptom Scoring questionnaire).</description>

    <description>The intranasal threshold to food (egg/cow's milk/soya/wheat/peanut) protein to elicit a local physiological response in food-allergic children (with the corresponding food allergy), as defined by objective assessment described above.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 6 - 17 years old

          -  Physician-diagnosis of food allergy on the basis of:

               -  Positive oral food challenge to the causative food (conducted under medical
                  supervision) within the last 12 months; OR

               -  History of convincing clinical reaction to the causative food within the last 12

                  or skin prick test (SPT) 8mm or above to the causative food allergen within past
                  12 months

          -  Written informed consent from parent/guardian, with assent from children aged 8 years
             and above wherever possible. Participants aged over 16 years will need to provide
             their owned informed consent.
