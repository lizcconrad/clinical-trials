             prior to the start of study drug

          5. Male subjects and WOCBP must agree to use double barrier contraceptive measures or
             avoid intercourse during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug

             are eligible, provided that the drain or stent has been in place for at least 10 days
             prior to the first dose of Tivantinib, and the subject's liver function has stabilized
             as defined by 2 measurements at least 5 days apart that put the subject in the same

         11. Any other investigational drug/medical device within 3 weeks prior to the first dose

         12. Substance abuse or medical, psychological, or social conditions that, in the opinion
