    <textblock>
      This is a randomised control trial comparing two different prosthetic designs used in total
      knee arthroplasty. Participants were randomised to receive either of the two prostheses and
      then were followed up of a period of 7 years, looking at pain, range of motion and impact on
      quality of life. The literature and joint registry of Australia shows that one of the
      prosthesis may be inferior to the other. Our research team hypothesised that this was not the
      case and that previous elicited differences were related to other factors.
