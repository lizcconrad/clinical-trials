      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term use of granular
      capsule formulation of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (Lotriga Granular Capsules) in
      patients with hyperlipidemia in daily medical practice

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This special drug use surveillance on long-term use of granular capsule formulation of
      omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (Lotriga Granular Capsules) was designed to investigate the
      frequency of adverse events in patients with hyperlipidemia The usual adult dosage is 2 g of
      omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters administered orally once daily after meals. However, the
      dosage can be increased up to twice daily (at a dose of 2 g) depending on the patient's
      triglyceride level.
