  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some medications are known to cause kidney damage because the person is allergic to the
      medication while others cause direct damage to the kidney because they are toxic at certain
      concentrations. Risk factors for developing kidney damage have been identified for some
      medications but not for all. Patients who are exposed to these important medications and
      develop problems with their kidneys may have some genetic risk. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the genetic risk factors for drug induced kidney injury. A better understanding
      of the role of genetics for the development of kidney injury from medications will allow us
      to better select medications, improve effectiveness of treatment and minimize harm.

    <description>We will perform a GWAS to examine the association of common genetic variants with the development of DIRI. For assessing association between a common SNP and the risk of DIRI, association tests will be undertaken to compare genotype frequencies between cases and controls. We will use logistic regression models under the assumption of an additive genetic model and incorporate potential confounders and covariates. Dominant, recessive models will also be checked through alternative coding of the genotype for SNPs approaching significance.</description>

        This is a prospective observational cohort study of patients who have developed DIRI.
        Patients will be identified through two main approaches;

          1. Recall and review of medical records of patients who were suspected to have DIRI

          2. Concurrent identification of patient under active treatment.

        Patients who developed DIRI in their previous care provided will be identified through a
        review of kidney biopsy logs or nephrology consults previously made.
