  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus, partly
      consecutive to upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a consequence of
      retinal ischemia leads. Aflibercept has been approved by FDA and European medicine agency for
      treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration, another retinal disease
      characterized by choroidal new vessels.

      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of Aflibercept
      intravitreal injections compared to panretinal photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy.
