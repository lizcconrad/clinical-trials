  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to treat field cancerization ( pre-skin cancers) in a manner that will
      reduce the future pre-skin cancers and non-melanoma skin cancers in patients with significant
      photodamage.

      This is 3 year prospective, randomized, controlled comparison of a single treatment with
      carbon dioxide laser resurfacing vs. carbon dioxide resurfacing plus autologous epidermal
      skin graft from a non sun exposed site vs. control.

      Thirty subjects will receive treatment with each of the modalities.

      The primary measures of efficacy are (a) count of the number of actinic keratosis and non
      melanoma skin cancers, (b) blinded evaluation of severity from standard digital photographs
      taken before and after the treatments, and (c) change in histology before and after
      treatment. Safety measures include (a) pain, (b) scarring, (c) wound healing, (d) and
      infection
