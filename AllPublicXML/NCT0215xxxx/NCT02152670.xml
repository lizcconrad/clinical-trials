  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) have been used with great success in
      demonstrating specific abnormalities in several facets of dopaminergic system function in
      human populations (Narendran and Martinez 2009). Among the first, most consistent, and
      broadly replicated of such findings in drug‐ (including cocaine) dependent individuals has
      been the reduction in subcortical (striatal) D2/3 receptors as imaged, most commonly, by the
      reversible, non‐selective, D2/3 receptor antagonist radiotracer, [11C]raclopride. Certain
      dissociations on D2/3 availability by radioligand ([11C]raclopride vs. [11C]PHNO) and by
      brain region (striatum vs. SN; terminal vs. somatodendritic, respectively) are poorly
      understood in relationship to prior antagonist tracer results. In the current study the
      investigators will use pharmacological interventions (AMPT and methylphenidate) with both
      antagonist and agonist radiotracers to experimentally reconcile these discordant findings and
      clarify potential mechanistic inter‐relationships.
