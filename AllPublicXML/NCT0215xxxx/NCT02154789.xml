  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital myxoid cysts arise from degeneration in the connective tissue of the digit joint,
      usually the last joint of the finger or toe, often due to underlying joint arthritis. They
      may connect with the joint. Pressure from the cyst can result in deformity of the digit's
      nail and trauma to the cyst results in leakage of the fluid, representing a potential source
      of entry for infection. Cysts can be tender and interfere with the digit's function. A
      variety of treatments are available, from simple extrusion which is rarely successful, to
      more destructive cryotherapy, infra-red coagulation and formal excision under local
      anaesthetic. These latter three approaches can result in considerable scarring. Sclerosant
      injection of polidocanol in one small non-randomised trial has been reported to be a well
      tolerated efficacious treatment with minimal scarring and long-term resolution. Following a
      pilot study, the investigators aim to trial this treatment to assess efficacy in a larger
      population.
