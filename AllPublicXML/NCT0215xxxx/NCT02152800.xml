        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women between 20 to 80 years of age.

          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of HZ as evidenced by a unilateral dermatomal rash.

          -  Patients with zoster-related rash (rash severity is greater than or equal to mild).

          -  Patients are able to be enrolled into the study 72 hours from appearance of rash (for
             example, lesions or vesicles).

          -  Patients provided written informed consent.

          -  Patients who are able to complete all study visits per protocol.

          -  Men and premenopausal women must agree to practice a barrier method of birth control
             or the use of a spermicide for one month after the last dose of study drug (oral
             contraceptives are not permitted). Subject should be withdrew from the study if
             contraceptions are faild.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients with multidermatomal or disseminated HZ (greater than 20 lesions beyond the
             dermatomes adjacent to the primarily involved dermatome).

          -  Patients with HZ ophthalmicus, defined as cutaneous lesions in the dermatome
             associated with the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve

          -  Patients with history of impaired renal function, (e.g., calculated creatinine
             clearance less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m2)

          -  Patients are taking narcotic analgesic routinely for a chronic pain condition

          -  Patients are taking tricyclic antidepressants

          -  Patients who received systemic antivirals with activity against VZV within the past 30
             days, or a topical antiviral to treat their current HZ

          -  Patients with immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting from:

        disease (e.g., HIV) corticosteroid use (except intermittent or topical/inhaled
        beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent &lt; 800 mcg/day), or other
        immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy (cancer chemotherapy or organ transplantation )

          -  Patients with any other condition (e.g., extensive psoriasis, chronic pain syndrome,
             cognitive impairment) that, in the opinion of the site investigator, might interfere
             with the evaluations required by the study

          -  Patients who are not ambulatory (bed-ridden or homebound); hospitalized patients may
             be enrolled if they are ambulatory and able to complete the study requirements

          -  Patients with history of allergy to valacyclovir hydrochloride and acetaminophen

          -  Patients are unlikely to adhere to protocol follow-up
