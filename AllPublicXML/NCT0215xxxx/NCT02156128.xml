  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine if repetitive computerized cognitive training improves
      working memory in patients who are on sick leave due to complex symptom disorders (chronic
      pain, chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression and or sleep disorders), and whether effects of
      cognitive control training transfer to other tasks.

    <description>Participants in a 3,5 week vocational rehabilitation program (containing cognitive therapy and physical exercise) are instructed to use a computer-based working memory training program (named CogMed) each weekday (5 days a week) for 5 weeks. Each training session consists of 8 different tasks and lasts 40-50 minutes.</description>
