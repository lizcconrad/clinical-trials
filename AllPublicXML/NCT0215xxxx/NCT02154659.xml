    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease is increasing worldwide. The causes of reflux symptoms are
      not found exactly. especially, the postprandial reflux symptoms are more common than the all
      day reflux symptoms. One of the causes of reflux symptoms is the relaxation of the lower
      sphincter of the esophagus. But, the sphincter relaxation also occur in normal people. But,
      there is a difference in postprandial reflux pattens between the patients and the normal
      people. So, in this study, we want to compare the difference of reflux pattern between the
      patients who have postprandial reflux symptoms and normal people though the 24hr pH
      monitoring.
