  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Endostatin (ES) participate angiogenesis after
      cerebral ischemia. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) also play a crucial role
      in neovascularization and tissue repair after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The investigators
      sought to compare the expression of VEGF and ES in serum and the circulating EPCs in patients
      after AIS with that of healthy control subjects. The investigators obtained peripheral blood
      and serum samples from study subjects. EPCs in blood samples from AIS patients and healthy
      controls were quantified by flow cytometry 1 day, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days after AIS. VEGF
      and ES were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay at the same time points. The
      relation between them and the relation of them to prognosis of such patients with acute
      ischemic stroke were assessed.

        The patient group comprised twenty male and ten female. Their age ranged from 45 to 74
        years. Locations of infarct, as evidenced by radiologic and neurologic symptoms or signs,
        included the territories of the middle cerebral artery (9 cases), the posterior cerebral
        artery (8 cases) the anterior cerebral artery (6 cases), vertebrobasilar area (5 cases),
        and watershed area (2 cases with cortical and subcortical low densities crossing typical
        vascular territories).
