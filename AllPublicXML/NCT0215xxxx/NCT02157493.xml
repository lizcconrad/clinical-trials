    <textblock>
      This study will use a randomized controlled design to evaluate whether a youth
      entrepreneurship/life-skills intervention for reservation-based American Indian adolescents
      (ages 13-15) improves psychosocial, behavioral health, educational, and economic outcomes
      from baseline for up to 3 years follow-up as compared to a recreational sports league control
      condition.

      Intervention activities will be held over a 3 night/4 day residential camp and 6 weekend
      workshops during the academic year. The control condition will consist of a recreational
      sports league held on 3 Saturdays, also during the academic year.

    <description>The Arrowhead Business Group (ABG) Curriculum is a 22-session youth entrepreneurship/life-skills intervention delivered by trained American Indian paraprofessionals from the community to mixed-gender groups of approximately 25 youth. The intervention is delivered over a 3 night/4 day camp along with weekend workshops once a month for 6 months during the academic year. Depending on the time of enrollment, subjects will receive follow-up assessments at 6-month intervals for up to 36-months post-intervention. (Subjects in this cohort will also receive the activities associated with the control condition.)</description>
