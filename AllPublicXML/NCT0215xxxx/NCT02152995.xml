    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trametinib works in increasing tumoral iodine
      incorporation in patients with thyroid cancer that has come back or spread to another place
      in the body. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and may help make treatment with iodine I-131 more effective.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of trametinib on enhancing radioiodine (RAI) activity by
      determining the proportion of patients alive at 6 months without disease progression by
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v 1.1) criteria following
      treatment with RAI in co-administration with trametinib. (Cohort A) II. To evaluate the
      effect of trametinib on enhancing RAI activity by determining the objective response rate
      (ORR) at 6 months following treatment with radioiodine (RAI) in co-administration with
      trametinib. (Cohort A) III. To determine the proportion of patients following trametinib
      therapy with increased tumoral iodine incorporation as quantified by iodine iodine-124
      (I-124) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) lesional dosimetry.
      (Cohort B)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients following trametinib therapy with increased
      tumoral iodine incorporation as quantified with I-124 PET/CT lesional dosimetry. (Cohort A)
      II. To evaluate the safety/tolerability of trametinib with or without RAI. (Cohort A) III. To
      evaluate changes in thyroglobulin levels in patients treated with RAI. (Cohort A) IV. To
      explore potential correlations between genomic alterations present in the tumor and/or
      tumoral pharmacodynamic changes induced by trametinib to clinical outcomes. (Cohort A) V. To
      evaluate the effect of trametinib on enhancing RAI activity by determining the ORR at 6
      months following treatment with RAI in co-administration with trametinib. (Cohort B) VI. To
      evaluate the effect of trametinib on enhancing RAI activity by determining the proportion of
      patients alive at 6 months without disease progression by RECIST v 1.1 criteria following
      treatment with RAI in co-administration with trametinib. (Cohort B) VII. To evaluate the
      safety/tolerability of trametinib with or without RAI. (Cohort B) VIII. To evaluate changes
      in thyroglobulin levels in patients treated with RAI. (Cohort B) IX. To explore potential
      correlations between genomic alterations present in the tumor and/or tumoral pharmacodynamic
      changes induced by trametinib to clinical outcomes. (Cohort B) X. Preliminary evaluation of
      best objective response (BOR) rate for patients treated with trametinib alone. (Cohort C) XI.
      Preliminary evaluation of the proportion of patients following treatment with trametinib
      alive at 6 months without disease progression by RECIST v 1.1 criteria. (Cohort C) XII. To
      evaluate the safety/tolerability of trametinib. (Cohort C) XIII. To evaluate changes in
      thyroglobulin levels in patients treated with trametinib. (Cohort C) XIV. To explore
      potential correlations between genomic alterations present in the tumor and/or tumoral
      pharmacodynamic changes induced by trametinib to clinical outcomes. (Cohort C) XV. To explore
      the impact of continued trametinib upon RAI avidity and efficacy. (Cohort C)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo iodine I-124 PET/CT on day 5 of week 1. Beginning day 6, patients receive
      trametinib orally (PO) daily for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo second iodine I-124 PET/CT on week 5. If I-124 PET/CT
      shows enough iodine absorption, patients may receive iodine I-131 PO and continue receiving
      trametinib for another 2 days. If I-124 shows that the thyroid is not absorbing iodine,
      patients may continue trametinib at the doctor's discretion and do not receive iodine I-131.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

                  this protocol; (previous treatment with radiation for any indication is allowed

                  compromise patient safety on this protocol)

               -  No chemotherapy or targeted therapy (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is allowed

          -  All prior treatment-related toxicities must be Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
             Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v 4.0) grade =&lt; 1 (except alopecia); grade 2 prior treatment

             institutional ULN

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 mg/dL OR calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault formula)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation; women of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior study registration; should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this
             study, she should inform the treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled
             on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for
             the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of trametinib
             administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients must agree to undergo two separate biopsies of a malignant lesion; biopsies
             do not need to be done if one of the following apply:

               -  If either the site investigator or person performing the biopsy judges that no
                  tumor is accessible for biopsy or that biopsy poses too great of a risk to the
                  patient (if the only tumor accessible for biopsy is also the only lesion that can
                  be used for RECIST v1.1 response evaluation, then the patient may be exempt from
                  biopsy after discussion with the MSK principal investigator)

               -  The goal will be to have a minimum of 6 patients from Cohort A and 3 patients
                  from Cohort B attempt to have one or both of these research biopsies done (for a
                  total of 9 patients total); accrual may be limited only to subjects for whom
                  tumor is accessible for biopsy and attempt at biopsy is considered safe if
                  continued enrollment of those who are not candidates for biopsy make it
                  impossible to reach the accrual goals for research biopsies described above
                  (e.g., if 19 [of 25] patients are accrued to Cohort A without any biopsies having
                  been obtained within the cohort, then all further subjects who are registered to
                  that cohort must qualify for attempted research biopsy in order to be enrolled
                  into the study [i.e., subjects who would have been excluded from having biopsies
                  done due to the above reasons would be excluded from participating in the study;
                  these conditions also apply to Cohort B])

          -  Availability of archival tumor tissue from the thyroid cancer primary or metastasis (a
             tissue block or a minimum of 30 unstained slides would be required; patients with less
             archival tissue available may still be eligible for the study after discussion with
             the MSK principal investigator)

          -  COHORT A: Confirmation in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
             certified laboratory that one of the patient's thyroid tumors (primary tumor,
             recurrent tumor, or metastasis) has an neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene
             homolog (NRAS) or Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) or Harvey rat
             sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (HRAS) mutation at G12, G13, or Q61; this group of
             patients will also be referred to as &quot;RAS MUT&quot;

          -  COHORT A: Patients must have progressive disease, defined as the presence of new or
             growing lesion(s) on radiologic imaging within 14 months of study enrollment and/or
