  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research in the last fifteen years suggests that anxious individuals selectively attend
      towards threatening information. Attention modification interventions for internalizing
      adults have been developed to target cognition at this basic level; these programs have
      demonstrated initial efficacy in attention bias and anxiety symptom reduction. To date, there
      have been minimal published studies of attention modification in youths with clinical levels
      of anxiety.

      This study is a large randomized efficacy-effectiveness trial (N = 498) to test the benefit
      of this low-cost, computerized attention modification intervention (Cognitive Bias
      Modification (CBM) computer application) for anxiety disorders and symptomatology in youth
      ages 12 to 17. This trial conducted will compare three intervention arms, all of which
      include underlying treatment as usual (TAU). The investigators directly test the level of
      clinical support (&quot;scaffolding&quot;) needed to adequately deliver self-administered CBM to
      anxious youth, a finding that will be key to preparing for future deployment-focused trials.
      The investigators will compare an attention control version of the CBM program (Arm 1) to two
      active versions of the CBM intervention that have varying levels of patient clinical support:
      a self-administered CBM program that participants download and install on their home
      computers (Self-Administered CBM-only; Arm 2), and the same CBM program paired with an
      adherence promotion (AP) component delivered via brief telephone calls from study &quot;coaches,&quot;
      including as needed, brief motivational enhancement and/or technical assistance
      (Self-Administered CBM+AP; Arm 3).

      The investigators expect that youth receiving CBM and CBM+AP will have improvement in anxiety
      symptoms and functioning. The investigators will also complete a cost-effectiveness analysis
      to examine potential costs offset by this intervention.

    <measure>Clinical effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month follow up (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that CBM can be successfully delivered in this health-care setting, and that active CBM will demonstrate clinical effectiveness.
Hypothesis 1a: The combined active CBM conditions will lead to greater rates of remission for anxiety diagnoses and to greater improvement on secondary indices of symptoms, diagnoses, and functioning, compared to the control condition (Arms 2 + 3 vs. Arm 1). Hypothesis 1b: CBM+AP will result in greater rates of remission for anxiety diagnoses (primary outcome) and greater improvement in secondary clinical indices, compared to CBM-only (Arm 3 vs. Arm 2).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Overall, we expect that active CBM will be cost-effective from the healthcare organization perspective, including patient direct and indirect costs.
Hypothesis 2a: Incremental cost-per-unit of anxiety-free-days (AFDs) and health-related quality of life (QALYS) will be lower for active CBM (Arm 2 + Arm 3), relative to the control condition (Arm 1) due to improvements in anxiety symptomology.
Hypothesis 2b: Cost-per-unit of improved AFDs and QALYS will be lower in CBM-only (Arms 2) relative to CBM+AP (Arm 3). Although we expect both active CBM arms to improve anxiety, we expect that CBM+AP (Arm 3) will be considerably more costly due to increased labor costs of AP phone coaching, while producing only a moderate incremental clinical benefit beyond the effects of CBM only (Arm 2)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploration of moderators associated with CBM effects</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will focus on moderators that may influence future dissemination, including whether CBM is robust to variation in youth clinical severity (e.g., baseline Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), severity of cognitive biases), comorbidity (e.g., depression), and demographics (e.g., gender, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity). Our large sample allows for substantial variability on these characteristics.</description>

    <measure>Exploration of mediators associated with CBM effects</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine whether change in attentional bias mediates CBM effects and leads to improved anxiety, as posited by information-processing theories underlying the intervention.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploration of process variables associated with CBM effects</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will examine youth adherence to CBM, benchmarked against lab-based delivery of similar interventions (i.e., acceptable error rates) - this will include testing whether the CBM+AP condition results in higher participant engagement and compliance (e.g., high completion rates, low error rates) compared to conditions without AP (Arm 3 vs. Arms 1 + 2) and assessment of whether these process variables are associated with outcomes.</description>

    <description>3.c.14.5. Arm 1: Attention Control Condition. The minimally effective attention-control group procedure is identical to the active CBM procedure except that during the presentation of the trials where a disgusted face is present, the probe will appear with equal frequency (50-50) in the position of disgusted or neutral face. Thus, the balanced (random) presentation of the probe in this condition is not designed to explicitly train attention away from threat and toward neutral stimuli, in contrast to the active versions of CBM in Arms 2 and 3.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>3.c.14.6. Arm 2: Self-Administered CBM Only. Youth assigned to this arm will receive the self-administered active CBM intervention. As described above in detail, in the 80% of CBM trials where a neutral and disgust face are both presented, the probe always replaces the neutral face. Thus, participants are trained to disengage their attention from threat. These youth do not receive Adherence Promotion telephone calls.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Arm 3: Self-administered CBM + Adherence Promotion</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>3.c.14.7. Arm 3: Self-Administered CBM + Adherence Promotion. Youth assigned to this arm will receive both the self-administered active CBM intervention and the telephone coach calls to deliver the Adherence Promotion (AP) procedures. AP procedures are intended to compensate for the important nonspecific 'scaffolding' provided by research staff when CBM has been traditionally delivered in laboratories. This includes technical assistance with use of the program, support/encouragement, motivational enhancement, and brainstorming solutions to barriers to regular sessions. The addition of AP to the 3rd arm of this trial attempts to recreate much of this nonspecific, yet likely important, support of in-person interventions, which we hypothesize will lead to greater participant adherence to the program and therefore better clinical outcomes.</description>
