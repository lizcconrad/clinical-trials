  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether endurance exercise of either high or
      moderate intensity can reverse structural and functional changes of the heart in patients
      with diastolic heart failure, and to investigate which type of exercise is best in terms of
      aerobe capacity and quality of life.

      The investigators expect that high intensity endurance exercise is superior to moderate
      intensity endurance exercise.

      This study is a prospective randomized controlled intervention study comparing two active
      arms. Eligible patients are being sampled consecutively by cardiologists, and randomized to
      either high or moderate intensity endurance exercise. Endpoints are measured at baseline, 4
      weeks and 7 months. The intervention is considered safe, and the study has been approved by
      the Regional Ethics Committee (REK-midt).

      This project has been financially supported by the Norwegian ExtraFoundation for Health and
      Rehabilitation through EXTRA funds.
