  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pancreatic cancer often suffer from pain. Because of such a pain, their quality
      of life have seriously deteriorated. There have been a few studies that showed an effect for
      pain control by hyperthermia (heating the patient's body). However, there are several
      limitations in conventional hyperthermia. In this study, the investigators tried to show the
      effect of &quot;Oncothermia&quot; which is more selective to malignant tissue than conventional
      hyperthermia for pain control, increasing quality of life, and anti-tumor treatment.
