    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect on the soft tissue that is in contact with a dental
      implant with a modified surface of the neck (the part of the implant that is above the bone
      and in contact with the soft gum tissue).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled, randomised clinical pilot study with parallel groups and
      blinded subject.

      The design has been chosen to obtain data to base a sample size calculation for future
      studies on by comparing the degree of mucosal inflammation of the mucosa in conjunction with
      the modified surface of the top of the test implant and the machined surface on the top of
      the control implant.
