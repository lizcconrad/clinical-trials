  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence from bio-gerontology research from our laboratory and others have showed that
      short-term fasting/starvation (STS) can improve the efficacy of chemotherapy by protecting
      normal cells and tissues and potentially sensitizing malignant cells to chemo drugs.
      Furthermore, STS improves risk factors associated with aging and age-related disease in
      rodent models. Prolonged fasting, however, is difficult to implement and may not be feasible
      or safe in humans. We have developed a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) that was well accepted in
      a pilot human trial. The objective of the study is to ascertain the impact of the
      fasting-mimicking diet given to adult subjects for 5 days a month for 3 consecutive months.
      The investigators hypothesize that the specially designed dietary regimen can reduce the risk
      factors for metabolic syndrome and biomarkers associated with aging and age-related diseases.

      The Phase I part of the study is designed as a randomized cross-over trial, including two
      arms: a Control arm and a multi-cycle special 5-day dietary regimen (Diet, 3 cycles) arm.
      After 3 cycles, the Control and Diet groups are crossed over such that the Control group will
      under-go dieting and the Diet group will return to normal diet. Participants will be
      monitored for body weight and physiological changes, as well as the adherence to the dietary
      intervention.

      The Phase II part of the study is an expansion of the Phase I to ascertain the impact of the
      dietary intervention on risk factors for metabolic syndrome and biomarkers associated with
      aging and age-related diseases.

      Statistical methods: Paired samples t-test and Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare
      between Control and Diet groups as well as pre- and post-diet values.

    <description>Participants will be provided with a 5-day supply of fasting-mimicking diet, including energy bars, soups, drink packets and dietary supplements. Participants will diet for 3 cycles. Each one-month cycle consists of 5 days of dieting with a calorie intake estimated at 600-1200 calories per day. The rest of the month participants will eat normally. After 3 cycles, participants will be examined again after consuming their normal diet after 2-3 months.</description>
