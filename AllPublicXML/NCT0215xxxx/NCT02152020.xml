      The objective of this study is to find out if acupuncture can improve the management of pain
      in cancer patients when used as part of a treatment plan that includes conventional pain
      medications. The investigators will enroll 36 cancer patients at Abramson Cancer Center and
      Penn Cancer Network sites. Participants will be enrolled in either the Conventional Pain
      Management group or Integrative Pain Management group.
