        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 75 years of age or older

          2. Echocardiographic or hemodynamic based evidence of calcific (senile) aortic stenosis
             with one of the following: aortic valve EOA &lt;1.0 cm2 or 0.6 cm2/m2 , mean aortic valve
             gradient &gt;40 mmHg or peak aortic valve velocity &gt;4 m/sec

          3. Symptomatology due to aortic stenosis resulting in a New York Heart Association (NYHA)

          4. Aortic valve annular diameter ≥ 21 and ≤23mm measured by MSCT

          5. An STS score ≥10; or Logistic EuroScore I ≥ 15; or a determination by one
             cardiovascular surgeon and one cardiologist that the co-morbidities not captured by
             the STS or EuroScore expected to increase the operative mortality risk to &gt; 15%.

          6. Geographically available, willing to comply with follow up and able to provide written
             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Congenital unicuspid or bicuspid aortic valve, or noncalcified aortic valve; or valve
             eccentricity (calcific or otherwise) that in the opinion of the investigator could
             compromise procedural success.
