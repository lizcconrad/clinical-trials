    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will collect tissue from patients undergoing trabeculectomy
      for primary open-angle glaucoma treatment. This tissue would normally be discarded. These
      trabecular meshwork (TM) cells can be cultured and used experimentally to better understand
      the mechanisms of glaucoma. These TM biopsies will be cultured on the same day as the
      trabeculectomy using established techniques.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of new glaucoma medications to reduce TM cellular pathologies associated with the disease glaucoma.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TM cell biopsy samples from patients with glaucoma will be harvested and cultured in a laboratory setting to grow primary human TM cells. These cells will be used to test different medications, looking at the medications ability to reduce cellular pathologies commonly seen in TM tissue of patients with glaucoma. Pathologies include myocilin aggregation, and cell death. This will help researchers to determine the most effective compounds in treating glaucoma.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cultured TM cell toxicity caused by new glaucoma medications</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cultured primary TM cells treated with various new medications synthesized to treat cellular pathologies associated with glaucoma, will also be analyzed to look at toxicity caused by the treatments themselves. THis will help to determine the safety of these new medications prior to being administered to patients.</description>

      The ophthalmologist will collect samples from the tissue that is removed during patients eye
      surgery that would otherwise be discarded or thrown away. Researchers will collect the sample
      and grow in the laboratory conditions. These cells will then be studied for further research
      on glaucoma.
