        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (aged ≥ 18 years)

          -  Phase 2 Part: Patients with confirmed diagnosis of MF who meet all of the following
             criteria: (a) DIPSS of intermediate-1 or higher, (b) Platelet count: ≥ 75 (monotherapy
             arm) or ≥ 100 (combination arm), (c) ANC ≥ 1.0, (d) Palpable spleen ≥ 5cm, (e)
             Peripheral blood blast count &lt;10%, (f) At least 2 symptoms measurable using the MFSAF
             v4.0, (g) Monotherapy Arm patients: Previously treated with a JAK inhibitor and be
             intolerant, resistant, refractory or lost response to the JAK inhibitor, (h)
             Combination Arm patients: Be on a stable dose of Ruxolitinib

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2.

          -  Adequate hematological, renal, hepatic, and coagulation laboratory assessments

             not excluded.)

          -  Any other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concomitant medical condition that
             could compromise participation in the study (e.g., clinically significant pulmonary
             disease, clinically significant neurological disorder, active or uncontrolled
             infection)

          -  Systemic anti-cancer treatment with a small molecule therapeutic (other than
             Ruxolitinib for the Combination arm) other than hydroxyurea less than 2 weeks before
             the first dose of CPI-0610

          -  Administration of a therapeutic antibody less than 4 weeks before the first dose of
             CPI-0610. A minimum 2-week period between the last treatment with a therapeutic
             antibody and the first dose of CPI-0610 may be permitted in patients with rapidly
             progressive disease, following discussion with the medical monitor

          -  Treatment with an investigational small molecule less than 2 weeks before the first
             dose of CPI-0610. In addition, the first dose of CPI-0610 should not occur before a
             period equal to or greater than 5 half-lives of the small molecule investigational
             agent has elapsed

          -  Treatment with medications that are known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of
             CYP450 enzymes

          -  Treatment with medications that are known to carry a risk of Torsades de Pointes

          -  Immunosuppressive treatment that cannot be discontinued both prior to study entry and
             for the duration of the study. Oral prednisone at a dose of 10 mg or less per day is
             allowed, as are other oral corticosteroids given at glucocorticoid-equivalent doses.
             Topical, nasal and inhaled corticosteroids are also allowed

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men with reproductive potential, if they are
