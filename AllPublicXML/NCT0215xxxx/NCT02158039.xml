  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic tumors of the pancreas are fluid-filled growths. They are often treated by surgical
      removal. A safe and effective non-surgical treatment is desirable. Ethanol (alcohol)
      injection may treat cysts by killing the lining cells of the cyst, and is an accepted
      treatment for cysts of other organs. In this study, participants with pancreatic cysts
      underwent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided ethanol injection of pancreatic cysts. This was
      a pilot study to assess safety and efficacy.

      The hypotheses of this study were 1) complications of EUS guided ethanol injection requiring
      hospitalization will occur in &lt;10% of subjects, and 2) EUS guided ethanol injection, with
      retreatment as necessary, will ablate at least 50% of pancreatic cysts.

      EUS is performed via the mouth under sedation. After a needle is placed into the pancreas
      cyst under EUS guidance, an ethanol solution is placed into the cyst via the needle. The
      ethanol solution is withdrawn and new ethanol injected, and this process is continued for 5
      minutes, repeatedly washing the cyst with the ethanol solution.

      After this treatment, usual clinical follow-up is obtained including assessments of the cyst
      by CT or MRI scans. If a cyst of significant size persists, additional EUS-guided ethanol
      injections of the cyst were offered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a pancreatic cystic lesion, &gt; 1 cm in maximum diameter

          2. Treatment of the cystic lesion is desired due to symptoms or concern for subsequent
             malignancy

          3. Age &gt; or = 18 years

          4. Able to give informed consent

          5. Surgical treatment has been considered, and a surgical consultation offered to the
             patient, but:

               1. Subject's cyst does not meet consensus criteria for surgical resection, or

               2. Subject is deemed a poor operative candidate, or

               3. Ethanol ablation would allow a subtotal rather than total pancreatectomy, or

               4. Subject has decided not to undergo surgical treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known or suspected pregnancy, or nursing

          2. History of pancreatitis within past 3 months

          3. Main pancreatic duct is dilated to &gt; 4mm in neck, body, or tail

          4. Cyst is known to communicate with the pancreatic duct

          5. Cyst has a primarily microcystic architecture on EUS

          6. Cyst is immediately adjacent to the main pancreatic duct on EUS

          7. Cyst has a connection to the main pancreatic duct seen during EUS

          8. During initial cyst aspiration, more fluid is recovered than expected (suggesting
             communication to the main pancreatic duct)

          9. Pancreatic cytology has demonstrated cancer

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited in the Mayo Clinic Pancreas Clinic or the Mayo Clinic Interventional Endoscopy Unit in Rochester, Minnesota between April 2004 and August 2014.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Thirty-three subjects were enrolled, of whom 23 underwent study procedures and were considered accrued. Of the remaining 10, one withdrew and the other nine were excluded for a variety of per-protocol reasons including cysts found to communicate with pancreatic duct. Study was closed when an interim analysis showed low efficacy.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>EUS-guided lavage of a pancreatic cyst with ethanol solution. The ethanol solution was diluted to 80% using normal saline. Final solution also contained 1% lidocaine except in patients allergic to local anesthetics.
