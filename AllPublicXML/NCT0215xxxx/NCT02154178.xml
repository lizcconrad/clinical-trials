  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that the use of biomarkers of invasive fungal infections would
      increase the percentage of early discontinuation of empirical antifungal therapy and thus
      reduce the duration of treatment in ICU patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The duration of empirical/preemptive anti fungal treatment will be based in the intervention
      group on biomarker results.

      Biomarkers of fungal disease will performed before starting anti fungal treatment and at day
      4.
