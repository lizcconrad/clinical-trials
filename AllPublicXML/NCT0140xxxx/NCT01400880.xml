    <textblock>
      The specific goal of the proposed research is to develop a reliable, non-invasive fetal and
      maternal heart rate and contraction monitor that is unaffected by obesity and requires less
      nursing intervention than the tocodynamometer and Doppler ultrasound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of obstetric deliveries in the US undergo electronic monitoring and continuous
      uterine activity and fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is the standard of care. Typically,
      external transducers are employed, the reliability of which depends on their proper
      positioning, which may be disturbed by patient or fetal movement. The tocodynamometer (strain
      gauge, toco for short) provides frequency and timing of contractions, but requires
      transmission of tension from the uterus to the sensor. Fetal heart rate is acquired with an
      external Doppler ultrasound transducer. The reliability of this monitor depends on the
      ability to obtain a window to the fetal heart.

      In some patients, particularly the obese, the toco and ultrasound may fail to monitor
      consistently. In others both transducers require frequent repositioning by the nursing staff,
      and the Doppler may erroneously report maternal heart rate instead of fetal.

      The alternative uterine activity monitor is an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC), which
      is placed through the cervical os in the adequately dilated patient with ruptured membranes.
      While this monitor usually provides a more reliable signal than the toco, as well as
      quantitative information regarding intrauterine pressure, it is invasive and there is an
      increased risk of infection. The alternative FHR monitor is via fetal scalp electrode (FSE),
      which is applied transvaginally to the fetal presenting part, also requiring adequate
      cervical dilation and ruptured membranes. While the FSE usually provides a more reliable
      signal, it is similarly invasive and increases risk of infection.
