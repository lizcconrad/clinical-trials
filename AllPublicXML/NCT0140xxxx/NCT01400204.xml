      The aim of the study is to compare hangover effects of MDMA users versus those who used other
      drugs, or alcohol only at New Year's Eve. The week after New Years Eve, every day
      participants complete a questionnaire about the presence and severity of potential hangover
      symptoms. At day 1, demographics and alcohol and drug use at New Years Eve were recorded. On
      day 7, the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) is completed to asses last weeks mood. After 4
      weeks, after a drug-free week, the BSI is completed again to serve as a reference.
