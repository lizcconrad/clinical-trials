    <measure>To investigate repeated-dose pharmacokinetics of itraconazole and its active metabolite hydroxyl itraconazole in pediatric cancer patients</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Itraconazole administration 1) Oral for prophylaxis: 2mg/kg/dose,q12hr 2) IV for empirical therapy : After more than 2 days of oral prophylaxis, patients with persistent neutropenic fever / Induction : 5 mg/kg/dose, q12hr X 4 doses / Maintenance : 5 mg/kg/dose,q24hr
Sampling 1) During oral : prior to the 5th dose 2) During IV : prior to the every induction and 1-5th maintenance doses, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24hr after the 3rd IV maintenance
Analysis of drug concentrations : Plasma concentrations of itraconazole and hydroxyl-itraconazole are measured using HPLC.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess empirical antifungal efficacy and safety in pediatric cancer patients</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy evaluation : Treatment is considered successful if all five of the following criteria are met : treatment of baseline fungal infection, absence of breakthrough fungal infection, survival for 7 days after completion, resolution of fever (&lt;38°C for 48hrs) in neutropenia, and no premature discontinuation because of drug related toxicity or lack of efficacy.
Safety evaluation : Laboratory are performed at the time of enrollment, twice weekly during therapy, and 1 week after the end of therapy. Drug-related toxicity was graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (v4.0).</description>

          3. Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study.

          4. Pregnant or nursing women.

          5. Psychiatric disorder that would preclude compliance.
