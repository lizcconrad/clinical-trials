  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to establish a clear causal link between testosterone and threat perception
      and behavioral responses to threat. Namely, the study focuses whether high levels of
      testosterone will cause an individual to exhibit increased physiological responses to threat
      (e.g., increased blood pressure, heart rate, and endocrine responses) and a decreased
      behavioral response (e.g., ignoring the threat, avoiding the threat, and postponing dealing
      with the threat). The threat in this study is a social threat involving public speaking, and
      is an outgrowth of previous research on the avoidance of health threats.

      Participants in the study will receive either a single dose of 10g 1% testosterone topical
      gel or placebo the day prior to participating in the study. The day of the study,
      participants will provide saliva samples throughout the study to track testosterone and
      cortisol levels. Participants will be asked to complete the Trier Social Stressor Task, which
      includes having to give a 5 minute speech to a panel of judges. Participants will be given
      the opportunity to postpone giving their speech to an unspecified date. The study will focus
      on two types of responses to the threat of public speaking: behavioral and physiological. The
      behavior of interest will be participants desire to postpone dealing with the threat (it is
      hypothesized that those in the testosterone administration group will have an increased
      desire to postpone). The physiological responses include increased levels of cortisol and
      increased cardiovascular tone (it is hypothesized that the testosterone administration group
      will show an increased physiological response compared to the placebo group).
