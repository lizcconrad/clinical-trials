  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation
      (tDCS) on the pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. The investigators hypothesize
      that there will be a decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when compared to sham
      stimulation. Before, during and after stimulation, the investigators will measure and assess
      changes intracranial blood flow with transcranial ultrasound.

    <description>Determine whether anodal transcranial direct current stimulation in conjunction with transcranial ultrasound (applied in a diagnostic mode) is effective in reducing pain in subjects with chronic osteoarthritis pain, as measured by changes in the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain. VAS will be measured immediately before the tDCS stimulation sessions, and immediately after the tDCS stimulation sessions for the subject's duration in the trial. VAS will also be measured at baseline, and at three follow-up sessions after tDCS stimulation (up to 2 months after tDCS stimulation)</description>

    <description>To investigate whether stimulation with active anodal tDCS with ultrasound (applied in a diagnostic mode) alters the phenomenon of central sensitization, as indexed by cutaneous allodynia and hyperalgesia, measured by the pain perception threshold as compared with sham tDCS. Pain measurements will be measured immediately before the tDCS stimulation sessions, and immediately after for the subject's duration in the trial. Pain measurements will also be measured at baseline, and at three follow-up sessions after tDCS stimulation (up to 2 months after tDCS stimulation)</description>

    <description>To investigate hemodynamic changes in the brain that may occur due to tDCS as measured by transcranial ultrasound. Blood flow measured by TUS will be measured immediately before during and after the tDCS stimulation sessions, for the subject's duration in the trial. Blood flow measured by TUS will also be measured at baseline, and at three follow-up sessions after tDCS stimulation (up to 2 months after tDCS stimulation)</description>

    <description>Subjects will be randomized to undergo either 5 sessions of active tDCS stimulation, or 5 sessions of sham tDCS stimulation. For both active and sham stimulation, we will use electrodes of 35cm^2 and an intensity of 2mA. The anodal electrode will be placed over the primary motor cortex contralateral to the most painful side, and the cathodal electrode will be placed over the contralateral supraorbital area. Active stimulation will last for 20 minutes, while sham stimulation will only last for 30 seconds, mimicking the sensations during active stimulation.</description>
