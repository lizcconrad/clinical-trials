  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-stage study will examine the effects of a 5 day course of atomoxetine (placebo, 40,
      60 or 80 mg/day; Strattera) (a selective NE transporter (NET) inhibitor) on alcohol-elicited
      craving and sensitivity to alcohol. The novelty of this study is that of atomoxetine and the
      fact that it targets NET, neither of which has heretofore been examined in the context of
      alcohol dependence. It is hopeful that this pilot study, of 86 total individuals, will
      provide the PI with sufficient preliminary data to submit a subsequent R01 application to
      study atomoxetine and the involvement of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms within the
      NET gene on alcohol-related phenotypes in alcohol dependent and non-dependent populations.
      The long-term objective of this research is to develop more efficacious treatment
      interventions for alcohol abuse and dependence.

      Hypothesis 1: It is hypothesized that subjects who receive 40, 60 or 80 mg/day of atomoxetine
      for 5 days will demonstrate significantly less alcohol-elicited craving than subjects who
      receive a placebo.

      Hypothesis 2: It is hypothesized that subjects who receive 40, 60 or 80 mg/day of atomoxetine
      for 5 days will be less sensitive to the acute effects of alcohol (subjective intoxication)
      than subjects who receive a placebo.

        Inclusion Criterion:

          1. Males and females age 21 to 35, as verified upon the presentation of a valid driver's
             license;

          2. Must drink alcohol at least twice a week and have a minimum of 3 drinks per occasion
             (2 for women);

          3. Must score 8 or higher on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Babor
             et al., 1992). The AUDIT is a screening instrument used to identify persons whose
             alcohol consumption is characterized by moderate to heavy drinking;

          4. No history of alcohol treatment or desire for treatment;

          5. Not currently take medications that are contraindicated for concurrent use with
             alcohol;

          6. Female subjects must not be pregnant, as indicated by a pregnancy test that will be
             conducted immediately prior dispensing of medication.

        Exclusion Criterion:

        Subjects who have hypertension, tachycardia, cardiovascular disease, hepatic or renal
        impairment, pregnant or who are currently using MAO inhibitors, Albuterol or other pressor
        agents will be excluded from this study.
