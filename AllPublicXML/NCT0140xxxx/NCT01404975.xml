  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trans-apical aortic valve replacement is a new treatment for severe aortic stenosis. It is
      offered to elderly patients with medical problems that would markedly increase the risk of
      conventional cardiac surgery. The rate of delirium (acute confusional state) after surgery in
      these patients may exceed 50%. Estimated hospital costs associated with delirium at Toronto
      General Hospital last year exceeded $1-million CAD. Pain after surgery and the use of opioids
      (morphine type of pain-relief drugs) are known to increase the risk of delirium. The
      investigators plan to minimize the use of opioids and improve pain management by replacing
      the standard intravenous opioid-based pain management with the paravertebral nerve block
      using only the local anesthetic. These two management strategies will be compared with
      respect to the rate of delirium, duration of hospital stay, and the overall costs.

      Hypothesis: Paravertebral analgesia with LA decreases the incidence of delirium after
      trans-apical AVR when compared to standard systemic opioid-based analgesia.

      A prospective, randomized, controlled, multicentre study (Toronto General Hospital and
      Sunnybrook Health Science Centre, Toronto, Canada.) The investigators are planning to replace
      the standard intravenous opioid analgesia with a continuous paravertebral block using local
      anesthetic after trans-apical aortic valve replacement.

      Anesthesia management will be standardized to minimize any impact that anesthetic type may
      have on neurological outcomes.

      Metrics to evaluate outcomes: Assessment of delirium will be performed utilizing the CAM-ICU
      preoperatively (baseline) and postoperatively every 12 hours or as needed according to the
      patient's condition during the first 7 postoperative days or until discharge.

      The CAM recognizes both, hyperactive and hypoactive, forms of delirium. It includes four-step
      algorithm and assesses 1) an acute onset of changes or fluctuations in the course of mental
      status, 2) inattention, 3) disorganized thinking and 4) an altered level of consciousness.
      The patient is determined to be delirious (CAM positive) if he/she manifests both features 1
      and 2, plus either feature 3 or 4.

      Primary screening for delirium will be performed by the nursing staff. Diagnose of delirium
      will be confirmed by the psychiatry consult. Assessment of Sedation and Pain: Standardized
      according to institutional guidelines.

      Cost Calculations: The total cost (summation of direct-variable, direct-fixed, and overhead
      costs) for each patient will be determined for both study groups.

    <description>Patients randomized to receive PVB will have a continuous thoracic paravertebral block using local anesthetic after trans-apical aortic valve replacement. The patient will be placed in lateral decubitus position and under aseptic conditions the skin entry points will be 2.5-3cm from the spinal processes of the vertebra at a level of the proposed surgical incision. A 17G Touhy needle will be inserted perpendicular to the skin until the transverse process is contacted. After negative aspiration test an initial bolus of 8ml of plain ropivacaine 0.5% will be administered. This will be followed by a continuous infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine at 10 mL/hr. For break through pain additional doses of ropivacaine will be administered as required.</description>
