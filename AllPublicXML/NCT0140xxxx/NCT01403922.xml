  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part study. Part 1 will determine determine if administration of TC-5214 has an
      effect on sitting blood pressure in patients with chronic hypertension.

      Part 2 will determine any possible interactions between TC-5214 and Anti-Hypertensive
      Medications (Calcium Channel Blockers, Beta Blockers, and ACE Inhibitors).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

          -  Male or female patients with chronic, stable hypertension treated for at least 1 month
             before screening with a calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or an ACE inhibitor,
             either as the only anti-hypertensive medication or concurrently with a diuretic. The
             patients should have no change in their current anti hypertensive treatment for at
             least 1 month before dosing

          -  Patients in Part 1 should have an SBP of ≤140 mmHg at screening and ≤160 mmHg at Visit
             1a and pre-dose on Day 1

          -  Patients in Part 2 should have an SBP of ≤160 mmHg at screening Visit 1 and pre dose
             on Day 1. Systolic blood pressure and DBP should not vary by more than 8 mmHg and 5
             mmHg, respectively, in the pre-dose period (screening, Visit 1a, and pre-dose on Day
             1)

          -  Age 18 to 65 years (inclusive)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other than having chronic hypertension, the history of any clinically significant
             medical, neurologic, or psychiatric disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator and/or the Sponsor, may either put the patient at risk because of
             participation in the study or influence the results, or the patient's ability to
             participate in the study. Patients with dyslipidaemia (diet controlled or treated with
             a statin) and/or metabolic syndrome (diet controlled or treated with metformin) may be
             entered into the study

          -  Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of the investigational product

          -  Patients with a pre-treatment SBP (if known) of &gt;180 mmHg or a history of accelerated
             or malignant hypertension based on grade III (hypertensive haemorrhages and/or cotton
             wool spots) or grade IV (hypertensive papilloedema) retinopathy at any time

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal (including irritable bowel disease), hepatic,
             or renal disease (creatinine clearance of ≤50 mL/minute calculated using the Cockcroft
             Gault equation) or any other condition known to interfere with the ADME of the
             investigational product.

          -  Patients with a history of surgery on the gastrointestinal tract (not including
             appendectomy or cholecystectomy) should also be excluded

          -  Any significant ECG abnormality including QTcF prolongation (&gt;450 ms) or significant
             arrhythmias, or junctional rhythms
