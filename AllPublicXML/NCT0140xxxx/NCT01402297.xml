    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of inhaled apocynin on ROS (reactive oxygen
      species) and NOS (reactive nitrogen species) synthesis in 13 COPD patients. Effects of
      nebulized apocynin (0.5 mg/ml, 6 ml) were assessed in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) after
      30, 60 and 120 minutes.

      Apocynin reduced hydrogen peroxide concentration in exhaled breath condensate 60 and 120
      minutes after apocynin nebulization comparing to placebo (0.43 μM vs. 0.59 μM and 0.41 μM vs.
      0.58 μM respectively, p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, apocynin caused decrease of NO2- concentration
      30, 60 and 120 minutes after apocynin inhalation (3.9 μM vs. 4.5 μM, 3.8 μM vs. 4.5 μM and
      3.7 μM vs. 4,4 μM respectively, p&lt;0.05) comparing to placebo, but did not cause any
      significant changes in concentration of NO3- in any timepoint (p&gt;0.05). No influence of
      apocynin on safety parameters, and no adverse effects has been observed.
