  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most people in Sweden with mild to moderate depression are treated in primary care, but
      follow-up is unstructured, and we know little about whether structured, follow-up would
      affect the prognosis for depression and working life. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effectiveness of regular, structured, patient-centered visits on mild to
      moderate depression.

    <description>All patients who agree to participate in the study are diagnosed by their GP with a diagnostic assessment instrument called PRIME-MD. Participants in the intervention group visit their GPs at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks. At each visit, participants complete MADRS-s for the assessment of depression severity and discuss the results with their GP in a patient-centered consultation. We have chosen to use the MADRS/MADRS-S depression rating scale in this study because it is a easy to use standard instrument especially suitable for measuring change in depressive symptoms.
The control group receives treatment as usual (no intervention).</description>
