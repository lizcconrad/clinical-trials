  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temsirolimus is a drug that is being studied to possibly treat kidney cancer. It works by
      starving the cancer of nutrients, by cutting off the blood supply, which is hoping to shrink
      the cancer. This study will look at the experimental use of temsirolimus, 12 weeks prior to
      the surgical removal of the entire kidney or a portion of the kidney that is involved by the
      tumor.

      This study will also find out whether or not there are certain biological factors that show
      up in patients during their treatment with this drug. This will be able to predict how their
      disease will respond to the therapy (biomarkers), and this will possibly allow anti-cancer
      therapies to be developed in the future to tailor to a patient's needs.
