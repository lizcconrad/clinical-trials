  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although endoscopic colonic polypectomy has been an established procedure for two decades,
      the risk of bleeding is still higher after resecting of pedunculated polyps, because of the
      presence of a large artery in the stalk. Several preventive methods such as detachable snare
      and adrenaline injection have been proposed in the management of postpolypectomy bleeding in
      large colonic polyps. For prophylactic clip, there was no prospective randomized study
      assessing the efficacy in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding for the large
      pedunculated polyps. So we designed a prospective, randomized study to compares the efficacy
      of application of prophylactic clip and detachable snare in the prevention of postpolypectomy
      bleeding in large polyps. Application of prophylactic clip will be as effective and safe
      method as detachable snare in the prevention of postpolypectomy bleeding for the large
      pedunculated colonic polyps.
