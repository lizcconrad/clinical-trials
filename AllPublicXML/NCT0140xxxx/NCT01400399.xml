  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the cosmetic outcome and examine factors contributing to cosmetic
      outcome in women treated with lumpectomy or bilateral breast reduction mammoplasty/mastopexy
      (BRM) followed by hypofractionated whole breast irradiation. Breast conservation is now an
      established method of treatment for early breast cancer. Because breast conservation is
      essentially a cosmetic alternative to mastectomy, quality of life, cosmetic outcome and tumor
      control are all important considerations during comprehensive treatment planning. Irradiation
      schemes have been demonstrated to be efficacious and with excellent short term cosmetic
      outcomes. However, their interaction with currently evolving surgical techniques needs to be
      examined in order to maintain optimal local control while preserving cosmetic outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer outcomes and cosmesis may differ by race. Limited but controversial data
      suggests that African-American women have worse cosmetic outcomes with hypofractionated
      irradiation than with conventional breast conservation. A growing body of data also suggests
      that African-American women have diminished oncologic outcomes when compared to Caucasian
      women in the United States. Further evaluation is needed to better understand the reason for
      these discrepancies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or invasive ductal, medullary, papillary, colloid
             (mucinous) lobular or tubular histologies.

          -  American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) DCIS or Stage T1- T2, N0 histologically
             confirmed invasive carcinoma of the breast treated with partial mastectomy with
             axillary evaluation as appropriate, axillary node dissection or sentinel node biopsy
             (SLN). Patients with DCIS with or without SLN or axillary node dissection are
             eligible. Patients greater than 70 years old, with stage 1 disease who are
             estrogen/progesterone receptor positive (ER/PR+), with or without SLN or axillary node
             dissection are also eligible.

          -  Partial mastectomy with or without reconstruction consisting of local tissue
             rearrangement and/or reduction mammoplasty (ipsilateral and bilateral). Patients who
             have undergone surgery and/or chemotherapy prior to treatment with radiation therapy
             are still eligible for enrollment and all evaluations and photographs will begin prior
             to radiation. Retrospective Placement of at least 3 surgical clips in the lumpectomy
             cavity is strongly encouraged. Retrospective data may be collected on women who have
             completed their entire course of treatment as long as they are formally consented.

          -  Unifocal breast cancer which may be encompassed by excision of a single portion of
             breast tissue.

          -  Negative inked histologic margins of partial mastectomy or re-excision specimen to be
             confirmed prior to radiation. Positive margins are unacceptable. Every effort should
             be made by the surgeon to obtain negative margins with the initial excision.

          -  Negative post-partial mastectomy mammography (if malignancy associated
             micro-calcifications were initially present.)

          -  Tamoxifen or Arimidex therapy is allowed. If chemotherapy is administered prior to
             radiation (but following surgery), then a minimum of two weeks must elapse prior to
             the start of radiation therapy.

          -  The patient must be 50 years of age or older.

          -  Signed study-specific informed consent form prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients enrolled on another clinical trial involving any treatment which may affect
             the cosmesis of the bilateral breasts. This would include the taking of medications,
             vitamin supplements, variation in radiation or surgery or topical application to the
             breast.

          -  Patients who are node positive.

          -  Patients with distant metastases.

          -  Palpable or radiographically suspicious contralateral axillary, supraclavicular,
             infraclavicular or internal mammary nodes, unless there is histologic confirmation
             that these nodes are negative for tumor.

          -  Any previously treated contralateral breast carcinoma or synchronous ipsilateral
             breast carcinoma.

          -  Prior non-hormonal therapy or radiation therapy for the current breast cancer; prior
             chemotherapy if administered less than two weeks from the start of therapy.

          -  Patients with Paget's disease of the nipple.

          -  Patients with prior breast reconstructive surgery including breast mastopexy or breast
             augmentation.

          -  Patients with skin involvement, regardless of tumor size.

          -  Patients with collagenous diseases, specifically systemic lupus erythematosis,
             scleroderma or dermatomyositis.

          -  Patients with severe peripheral vascular disease or coronary artery disease (ex.
             Previous acute myocardial infarction requiring stents or coronary artery bypass graft
             within past two years; prior bypass graft of any type etc.)

          -  Patients with co-existing medical conditions with life expectancy less than 5 years.

          -  Patients with psychiatric disorders that would preclude obtaining informed consent.

          -  Other malignancy except non-melanomatous skin cancer less than 5 years prior to
             participation in this study; the disease free interval from any prior carcinoma must
             be continuous.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.
