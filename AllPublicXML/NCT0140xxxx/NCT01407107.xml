  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether topical nitroglycerin in addition to
      5-flourouracil and radiation therapy are effective in the treatment of operable rectal
      cancer.

      This is an open label, non-randomized, multi-cohort, dose escalation trial to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, feasibility and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topical nitroglycerin
      in addition to 5-flourouracil and radiation therapy for neo-adjuvant treatment of, T3-T4 or
      clinically node positive, operable rectal cancer.

      Patients that would otherwise be eligible for concurrent neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with
      continuous infusion 5-FU, for locally advanced operable rectal cancer, will be assigned to 4
      sequential cohorts of 4 different dose levels of nitro glycerin patches (0.2; 0.4; 0.6 and
      0.8mg/hr). Each cohort will consist of 3 patients. All patients will receive radiation
      therapy, 45-50 Gy in 25-28 fractions to the pelvis along with continuous infusion 5-FU
      225mg/M2 for the duration of the radiation therapy. The radiation therapy will be planned and
      delivered as per institutional standard of care for the Dallas VAMC radiation oncology
      department.
