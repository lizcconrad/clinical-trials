  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was aimed at testing the hypothesis that supplementing a meal with dark chocolate,
      which holds potent antioxidant properties, might attenuate the postprandial increase in the
      hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG, clinical equivalent of portal pressure) in patients
      with cirrhosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies showed that the intrahepatic circulation in cirrhosis is not able to adapt
      to sudden increases in blood flow, such as that occurring after a meal, due to endothelial
      dysfunction. This leads to a brisk increase in portal pressure (estimated by the HVPG). This
      method is therefore useful to assess the efficacy of compounds potentially ameliorating
      intrahepatic endothelial dysfunction. Dark chocolate, which contains a high proportion of
      cocoa flavonoids such as cathechin and epicatechin- powerful antioxidants, increases NO
      availability in the systemic circulation and improves systemic endothelial function. We
      hypothesised that the antioxidant properties of dark chocolate could be beneficial in
      patients with cirrhosis, since they might improve intrahepatic endothelial dysfunction.
      Consequently, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether a dark chocolate-containing test
      meal may attenuate the post-prandial increase in HVPG in patients with cirrhosis and portal
      hypertension.

      HVPG was measured at baseline and 30 minutes after the administration of a test meal
      supplemented by either dark or white chocolate. Portal vein blood flow and hepatic artery
      blood flow were measured by Doppler ultrasound. Catechins and NOx were determined for both
      timepoints.
