  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elastic MCT is a widely recognized and the consensus-approved treatment for chronic venous
      insufficiency (CVI).Efficacy evidence level is often insufficient (grade B or C), or based on
      studies carried prior to CEAP classification (2004). Item C3 of this classification relates
      to patients suffering from chronic venous disease and permanent oedema. Literature mentions
      only one study in which volume reduction in venous-induced oedema was primary endpoint.
      Indeed, 240 patients showed a 46.7 ± 8.2 ml reduction (SEM) after 12 weeks with a Class 2
      compression sock (15-20 mm Hg at ankle). Volume is an accurate and reproducible quantitative
      measure considered nowadays as being gold standard when objectifying oedema variation. It is
      therefore particularly relevant in a C3-patient trial (CEAP classification).

      The main objective of the current study is to evaluate the clinical effect of Progressiv' MCT
      on volume reduction in permanent CVI-oedema after 3 months of treatment.
