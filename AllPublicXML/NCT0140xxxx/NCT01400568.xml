  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is planned to assess the suitability of a low dose Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
      inhalation as a challenge model. As LPS effects are based on a different mode of action, this
      challenge model will provide the possibility to test a wider spectrum of potential drugs in
      the future. Provided that the LPS response is reproducible, it is planned to test whether a
      single high dose of inhaled steroid can serve as a positive control in the LPS model. Another
      major aim of the study is to test a variety of novel tools for the non-invasive assessment of
      airway inflammation induced by LPS challenge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, airway inflammation will be induced by LPS inhalation. In case a neutrophilic
      airway inflammation can be safely induced by inhaled LPS, the LPS challenge will be repeated.
      If neutrophil airway inflammation after LPS challenge is reproducible LPS challenge will be
      repeated after pre-treatment with a single high dose of inhaled fluticasone propionate.

      To determine airway inflammation, the subjects' exhaled breath will be analyzed by different
      techniques, and blood samples as well as induced sputum will be collected.
