  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if individuals with HIV-infection, particularly those
      with increased belly fat, have abnormalities in the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis.
      Renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone are hormones that regulate salt and water balance in the
      body, and they may also have effects on sugar metabolism and cardiovascular health. There is
      some evidence that individuals with HIV-associated abdominal fat accumulation may have
      increased aldosterone, which may contribute to abnormalities in sugar metabolism and
      increased cardiovascular disease seen in HIV. The purpose of this study is the measure renin,
      angiotensin, and aldosterone activity, as well as other hormonal axes, in people with and
      without HIV infection, and with and without increased belly fat. The investigators
      hypothesize that aldosterone will be increased in HIV-infected individuals compared to those
      without HIV-infection, and that aldosterone will be further increased in HIV-infected
      individuals with increased abdominal fat compared to those without abdominal fat
      accumulation.
