      The investigators propose a prospective single arm pilot cohort study of 100 youth (ages
      15-25) to evaluate the feasibility of this project. A convenience sample of subjects will be
      enrolled on a voluntary basis from those who come to the day care center located in Nyanza, a
      district of the Southern province, in Rwanda.

      The investigators propose a prospective single arm pilot cohort study of 100 youth (ages
      15-25) to evaluate the feasibility of this project. A convenience sample of subjects will be
      enrolled on a voluntary basis from those who come to the day care center located in Nyanza, a
      district of the Southern province, in Rwanda. UYISENGA N'MANZI identified 400 youths in
      Nyanza region, organized in 4 groups, each of them between 160 to 100 youths. Many of those
      orphans go to school in any school in the country. This situation will be taken into account
      for the calendar of activities and for organization of the regular interviews and
      evaluations.

      Random selection of the participant will be ensured by choosing study subjects from a list
      and attributing them an arbitrary number. The random selection will be weighted by the size
      of the household group across the 4 groups in the Nyanza region. Selection will also be in
      proportion of sex and age groups. In this manner 100 youth will be picked with 20 &quot;backup&quot; to
      account for refusals and drop-outs. Those selected youth will be asked to participate to the
      pilot study and will fill the consent form under the guidance of an external observer (not
      one of the service providers of the project to avoid consent obtained by social pressure).

      Once enrolled, the subjects will be followed during 1 year with serial evaluations at
      baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.
