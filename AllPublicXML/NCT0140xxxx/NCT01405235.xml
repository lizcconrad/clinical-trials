  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current planning for studies involving patients with recurrent, persistent, or metastasized
      cervical cancer must take into consideration that up to 75% of all patients are assumed to
      have already been treated with cisplatin in conjunction with radiation therapy. It seems
      questionable to continue to treat patients with cisplatin when cancer has recurred. Thus, it
      is important to seek alternative active combinations. The studies GOG 169 and 179
      demonstrated that a combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin was superior to a cisplatin
      monotherapy with respect to therapeutic response and progression-free survival, as was a
      combination of topotecan and cisplatin with respect to therapeutic response, progression-free
      survival, and total survival. To achieve further improvement in total survival and to answer
      questions regarding the value of using a platinum-free combination, we propose that a study
      should be conducted to compare the efficacy of a platinum-free combination of paclitaxel and
      topotecan to a combination of cisplatin and topotecan.

      Design: This will be a prospective, randomized, multicenter, non-blinded phase III A study.

      Dosages: Arm A Paclitaxel 70 mg/m2/d i.v. on Days 1, 8, and 15 in combination with Topotecan
      1.75 mg/m2/d i.v. on Days 1, 8, and 15, q 28 d Arm B Topotecan 0.75 mg/m2/d i.v. on Days 1- 3
      in combination with Cisplatin 50 mg/m2 i.v. on Day 1, q 21 d Duration of Therapy: Each
      patient will participate in the study until a maximum of six cycles have been completed, or
      until there is evidence of disease progression, or until toxicity prevents further therapy.
      Patients with continued response or stable disease may continue to participate in the study
      for an additional 3 cycles beyond the original 6 cycles with consent of the Study Director,
      but this must be documented in the CRF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed recurrent, persistent, or metastasized
             squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, for
             which a curative treatment by operation and/or radiation therapy is not possible.

          -  Patients must have been previously treated with cisplatin in the context of
             radiochemotherapy.

          -  All patients must present with measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as a
             minimum of one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension
             (longest dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must measure ≥ 20 mm when measured by
             conventional techniques, including palpation, x-ray, CT, and MRI, or ≥ 10 mm when
             measured by spiral CT. Patients must have at least one &quot;target lesion&quot; that can be
             used to evaluate response according to RECIST criteria during this study.

          -  When a biopsy is performed, it should be performed on this lesion. A lesion outside of
             the irradiated area should ideally be selected as the &quot;target lesion&quot; on patients who
             have tumors both inside and outside a previously irradiated area. A previously
             irradiated lesion may only be considered as a &quot;target lesion&quot; if, after the radiation
             therapy had been completed, this lesion objectively led to a diagnosis of recurrence,
             or progress specific to this lesion was observed.

          -  Patients must display the following:

               -  Sufficient hematologic function: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.

               -  500/μl; granulocytes &gt; 3,000/μl; thrombocytes ≥ 100,000/μl.

               -  Sufficient renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl. In patients with a serum
                  A prospective, randomized phase III study to compare the effects of Paclitaxel
                  and Topotecan to those of Cisplatin and Topotecan for treatment of patients with
                  recurrent or persistent cervical cancer Page 24 Study Protocol Version 1.1 dated
                  09/25/2006 creatinine of &gt; 1.2 mg/dl, the results of a 24-hour creatinine
                  clearance must yield a level &gt; 50 cm3/min for eligibility.

               -  Sufficient liver function: bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of
                  normal, GOT, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 3 times the institutional upper limit of
                  normal.

               -  Patients must display an ECOG performance status of 0-2 (Karnofsky &gt; 60%).

               -  Patients must have recovered from the aftereffects of any surgery, radiation
                  therapy, or chemotherapy. A minimum of six weeks must have passed since the last
                  administration of chemotherapy, and at least three weeks must have passed since
                  the last treatment with radiation alone.

               -  Patients must have signed an official consent document which also authorizes the
                  release of personal health information. Patients unable to give their consent
                  independently may not participate in the study.

               -  Patients must fulfill all the requirements defined in Section 8.1, including
                  completion of a baseline quality of life questionnaire, prior to their inclusion
                  in the study.

               -  Patients must be free of clinically significant infection.

               -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with bilateral hydronephrosis which cannot be alleviated by ureteral stents
             or percutaneous drainage. Patients with a serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dl but &lt; 1.5 mg/dl
             and a 24-hour creatinine clearance result of &lt; 50 cm3/min. Patients with a serum
             creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dl. A prospective, randomized phase III study to compare the
             effects of Paclitaxel and Topotecan to those of Cisplatin and Topotecan for treatment
             of patients with recurrent or persistent cervical cancer Study Protocol Version 1.1
             dated 09/25/2006 Page 25

               -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy, unless the chemotherapy was
                  administered with concomitant radiation therapy.

               -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.

               -  Patients with craniospinal metastases.

               -  Patients with a concomitant malignant disease, with the exception of nonmelanoma
                  skin cancer.

               -  Patients with a previous invasive malignant disease (other than nonmelanoma skin
                  cancer) showing evidence of this disease within the last 5 years, or for whom the
                  therapy to be administered during this study is contraindicated due to previous
                  treatment received for this malignant disease.

               -  Patients who are participating in another clinical study at the same time or who
                  will have done so up to 30 days before the planned end of this study.
