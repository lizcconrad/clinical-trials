      This study aims to determine the safety and utility of using 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) in
      removing brain tumors during surgery. When ALA is provided at an increased concentration,
      protoporphorin concentration in the malignant cell increases and renders the cell fluorescent
      under long ultraviolet light. This study looks at using oral ALA to help identify the tumor
      cells intraoperatively and facilitate complete resection.

      Oral ALA will be given prior to image-guided microsurgical resection of the tumor. Following
      tumor resection under light microscopy, the tumor bed will be illuminated and any residual
      fluorescent tissue in cavity will be surgically removed leading to a more complete resection
      of tumor. Pathologic confirmation of tumor type will be made by neuropathology.
      Photosensitizer concentration in malignant and normal tissue will be estimated by
      fluorescence microscopy.

          -  Confirmation of Glial Tumor

          -  Gross total resection is the aim of surgery

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             or have a parent or guardian with the ability to understand and the willingness to
             sign a written informed consent.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements
