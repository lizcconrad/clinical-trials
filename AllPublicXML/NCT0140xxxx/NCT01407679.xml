    <textblock>
      To evaluate the therapeutic effect of oral alitretinoin (Toctino®) in the treatment of CLE
      with respect to proportion of responders based on the Revised Cutaneous Lupus Disease Area
      and Severity Index (RCLASI) activity score for skin lesions at baseline and after 24 weeks of
      treatment or at the latest assessment for patients who withdrew prematurely. Response is
      defined as a reduction of 50% in the total RCLASI compared to the baseline value (&quot;RCLASI
      50&quot;).
