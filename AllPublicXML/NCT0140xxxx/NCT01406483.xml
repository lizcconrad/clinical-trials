      The primary objective of this exploratory cohort study is to describe levels of platelet
      reactivity in patients on a thienopyridine awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

    <textblock>
      The recent emergence of platelet reactivity testing as a potential option for evaluating the
      degree of platelet inhibition promises to add another level of understanding to our concept
      of CABG-related bleeding. There is an emerging literature that links high levels of platelet
      reactivity with adverse clinical events, primarily in patients on clopidogrel.

      For example, studies of the VerifyNow P2Y12 platelet function assay have shown that Platelet
      Reactivity Units (PRU) &gt; 235-240 in patients on clopidogrel therapy appears to predict
      cardiovascular events.15,16 There is a paucity of literature, however, on the use of platelet
      reactivity testing to predict bleeding events and complications. In other words, if
      excessively high levels of platelet reactivity predict ischemic events, do excessively low
      levels of platelet reactivity predict bleeding events? This is an especially relevant
      question, given the emergence of prasugrel as a therapeutic option.

      The investigators therefore propose an exploratory cohort study of patients receiving a
      thienopyridine (clopidogrel or prasugrel) and undergoing CABG, in order to describe levels of
      platelet reactivity in such patients by using a variety of platelet function tests.
