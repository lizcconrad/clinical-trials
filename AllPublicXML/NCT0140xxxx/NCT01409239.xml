  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glycemic variability has been associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with
      hyperglycemia. However, it is unknown how modulation of glycemic variability would impact
      outcomes. One possibility is that glycemic variability could impact autonomic tone. In
      particular, heart rate variability (HRV) measurement is a sensitive marker for measuring
      autonomic tone, and aberrations in HRV have been associated with mortality. The current
      randomized pilot study will compare the effects of continuous intravenous (IV) insulin and
      subcutaneous basal bolus insulin on glycemic variability and autonomic tone in hospitalized
      non-critically ill patients with diabetes. Non-critically ill patients who are hyperglycemic
      or are requiring at least 20 units of insulin per day will be included. Patients with
      conditions that preclude accurate HRV readings (such as atrial fibrillation or paced rhythms)
      will be excluded. Patients randomized to intravenous insulin will receive the therapy for 24
      hours according to our standard hospital guideline. Patients randomized to subcutaneous (SQ)
      insulin will receive basal bolus therapy using insulin analogues. All therapies will begin
      between 8 and 10 AM. Patients will undergo repeated heart rate variability recordings during
      the 24 hour period. Blood draws will be collected at baseline and at 24 hours for measurement
      of catecholamines, insulin, and c-peptide. Glycemic variability will be measured using a
      continuous subcutaneous glucose monitor and reported as coefficient of variation. The primary
      outcome measure is low frequency-to-high frequency power spectrum ratio of heart rate
      variability.

        1. Glycemic variability is associated with unfavorable changes in autonomic tone, as
           assessed by low frequency (LF)/high frequency (HF) HRV ratio, independent of changes in
           overall glycemia.

        2. Short-term increases in glycemic variability, followed by more prolonged glycemic
           stability are observed in generalized hospitalized patients treated with intravenous
           insulin compared to standardized basal bolus therapy. LF/HF HRV differs among subjects
           receiving intravenous compared to subcutaneous insulin.

        3. Glycemic variability differs among subjects receiving intravenous compared to
           subcutaneous insulin

          <description>Among patients receiving subcutaneous insulin, basal and prandial insulin were administered in approximately equal total daily doses with correction dosing. Daily adjustments were based upon 10-20% of the total daily dose.</description>

          <title>Intravenous Insulin</title>
          <description>IV insulin was started at 0500 hours the morning following consent. Patients continued to receive prandial and correction insulin until the IV insulin was started, after which only the prandial component was continued. All patients receiving IV insulin were managed using our hospital’s universal nursing run guideline, which was adapted from a published protocol and has a target glucose of 6.1-8.3 mmol/l. All floor nurses are trained in its use. Patients were transitioned from the infusion at 1700 hours using approximately 70% of the estimated basal insulin infusion requirement with 4 hours of overlap.</description>
