      Aims: to explore the value of TREM-1 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1)
      ,PCT(Procalcitonin), as well as CPIS (clinical pulmonary infection score) in the diagnostic
      and prognostic assessment of VAP (ventilator associated pneumonia); and to make a comparison
      with WBC (white blood cells) and CRP (C-reactive protein) level as well as SOFA (Sequential
      Organ Failure Assessment) Score Methods: There were 92 subjects of sepsis, who were either
      receiving endotracheal intubation or had undergone tracheotomy and were exposed to mechanical
      ventilation. The subjects were divided into the VAP group (32) and the Non-VAP group (60),
      the criterion being the contraction of VAP 48 hours after ICU admission. Etiological culture
      was conducted in BALF (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid). And sTREM-1 density was determined by
      examining serum sTREM-1, PCT, WBC, CRP and EVC (exhaled ventilator condensate). Meanwhile,
      the CPIS and SOFA score were worked out. With a 28-day survival as the demarcation line, the
      VAP group was further divided into the survivors group, who stayed alive for 28 days or more
      , and the non-survivors group, who died within 28 days. The sTREM-1 and PCT level were
      denoted as meridians (range interquartile), while the WBC and CRP level as well as the CPIS
      and SOFA score, means±standard deviations (SD).

      Results: Averagely, the patients would contract clinically-confirmed VAP 6.9 days after
      admission, which was mainly traced to Gram-negative bacilli infection. On the very day of
      diagnosis, compared with the Non-VAP group, the VAP group showed a higher level of serum
      sTREM-1, PCT, WBC and CRP as well as CPIS and SOFA score（295.6pg/ml vs.143.5pg/ml,
      P&lt;0.001；4.5ng/ml vs. 1.4ng/ml，P=0.008；16.7×10∧9/L vs.10.9×10∧9/L, P&lt;0.001；11.5mg/dl vs.
      7.7mg/dl，P=0.012； 6.0vs. 1.9, P&lt;0.001；10.0vs. 7.5, P=0.017）, AUC (area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve）turned out as follows :sTREM-1: 0.73（95% CI 0.61-0.85）;PCT :
      0.70（95% CI 0.57-0.83）;WBC: 0.73（95% CI 0.60-0.85）.The CPIS score, which was proved by
      logistic regression analysis as the sole risky factor to VAP, amounted to 0.96（95% CI
      0.91-1.00）. Combined prediction probability containing all the data was calculated in
      accordance on the relative regression equation. sTREM-1+WBC+CPIS score proved to be most
      reliable for diagnosis. AUC turned out as 0.98. With 0.277 as the cut-off point, sensitivity
      measured 0.97, specificity, 0.9 and YDI, 0.87. There were only 5 VAP subjects whose sTREM-1
      density could be detected in EVC. The VAP patients were divided into a survivors group (n=15)
      and a non-survivors group (n=17) with a 28-day survival as the demarcation line. The
      non-survivors group demonstrated a higher PCT level and higher CPIS &amp; SOFA score than the
      survivors. （3.0ng/ml vs. 15.3ng/ml，P=0.032；5.4vs. 6.6, P=0.03；8.1vs.11.7 P=0.049). AUC worked
      out PCT 0.752（95% CI 0.547-0.956）and CPIS 0.764（95% CI 0.575-0.953）. Calculations on the
      regression equation showed the PCT+CPIS score was most reliable for prognostic assessment.
      AUC turned out as 0.848. With 0.516 as the demarcation line, sensitivity measured 0.867,
      specificity, 0.818 and YDI, 0.685.

      conclusion: WBC + CPIS helps improve VAP diagnosis; PCT+CPIS may be used for VAP prognostic
      assessment. Taking two items into consideration will be of guiding value in VAP treatment as
      well as mortality rate reduction. The sTREM-1 level in EVC，however，may be devoid of value for
      VAP diagnosis.
