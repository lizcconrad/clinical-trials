  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of nasogastric/oral gastric (NG/OG) tube
      placement for efficacy and safety in the placement of NG/OG tube in infants less than 6
      months of age. One method is based on the infant's length determined by measurement using a
      length board and plotted on a graph derived from a formula to determine the depth for tube
      insertion (graph method) and the other method is based on current standard of care, measuring
      from the nose to the ear and then the ear to mid abdomen (NEM) and mark the tube to know how
      far to insert the tube. Outcome comparison will be xray verification of placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants often require nutritional intake through a nasogastric or oral gastric tube
      to meet their high energy requirement and avoid aspiration of nutrition due to their immature
      suck/swallow reflex. When providing nutrition via an NG or OG tube, there are two basic
      safety issues; accurate placement, determined by the end of the tube reaching the mid
      abdominal area, and verification methods to assure placement is optimal. Based on a review of
      relevant literature, a potentially more accurate method of tube placement is available than
      the method used in current practice. We hypothesize the graph method will result in a more
      accurate and less variable placement of the NG tube into the mid-stomach of preterm infants
      than the current standard using the NEM method.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Study terminated due to change in clinical practice affecting recruitment. For majority of
    patients, NJ tubes are now used instead of NG tubes.

    <description>The graph method is based on the infants' length determined by measurement using a length board and plotted on a graph derived from a formula to determine the depth for tube insertion (graph method). The graph method has been tested in the pediatric population but not in infants under six months of age (Klazner, Luke and Scalso, 2002). Using a graph method might reduce some of the variability in placement. We propose to extend the Klazner, Luke and Scalso (2002) study in the infant population.</description>
