      The primary objective of the study is to determine physician reported persistence with the
      Avonex PEN at Month 12/End of Study as well as determining factors associated with
      persistence. The secondary objectives for this study are as follows: To evaluate the
      tolerability for treatment administration of the Avonex PEN at Months 3, 6, and 12; To
      evaluate patient quality of life (QoL) while using the Avonex PEN for treatment
      administration at Months 3, 6, and 12; To evaluate clarity of directions for use of the
      Avonex PEN at Month 3; To evaluate ease of use and the patient's assessment of the injection
      procedure with the Avonex PEN at Months 3, 6, and 12; To evaluate patient reported adherence
      at Months 6 and 12; To evaluate physician reported persistence at Month 6; To evaluate
      overall patient satisfaction with the use of the Avonex PEN for treatment administration at
      Months 3, 6, and 12; To evaluate patient reported fear of injection at Months 3, 6, and 12;
      and To evaluate the percentage of patients switching from caregiver to self-injection at
      Months 3, 6, and 12.
