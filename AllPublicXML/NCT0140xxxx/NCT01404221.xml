      Can a combination of prenatal screening blood tests, early ultrasound, and a 3D ultrasound of
      the fetal face at approximately 20 weeks gestation identify fetuses with congenital anomalies
      and predict maternal and fetal complications?

      Pts will be consented upon presenting to the department for a comprehensive ultrasound.The 3D
      picture is the only part of the study that is not part of standard obstetrical care.
