  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to test the efficacy of an EPA-enriched oil made by DuPont versus a
      DHA-enriched oil, a standard fish oil preparation, and olive oil placebo in a double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial. This study will compare the efficacy of 1800 mg/day of
      EPA versus 1800 mg/day of DHA versus a fish oil product containing 1800 mg of EPA and 1200 mg
      of DHA/day as compared to olive oil placebo at 6 grams/day over a 6 week period in a parallel
      arm design study of 120 healthy adults studied in both the fasting and post-prandial state.
      Safety will be monitored by assessing for adverse reactions, measuring vital signs and a
      variety of lab tests including a complete metabolic profile and complete blood count.
      Efficacy will be assessed by measuring changes in fatty acid profile and or fatty acid
      ratios,as well as by measuring plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and markers of inflammation.

    <description>Subjects receiving EPA at 1800 mg/day will have significantly greater plasma EPA levels as well as the EPA/DHA ratio than the placebo group or the group receiving DHA, while the group receiving DHA will have significantly greater increases in plasma DHA levels as well as the DHA/EPA ratio than the placebo group or the group receiving EPA.</description>

    <description>Subjects receiving the active supplement, especially at the 1800 mg daily dose of EPA will have significant reductions in LpPLA2 as compared to both baseline values and to the placebo group.</description>
