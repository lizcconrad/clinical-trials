    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational, exploratory study in patients undergoing any cardiac valve
      replacement or repair is to assess the rate of bacterial colonization over native
      degenerative calcified cardiac valves.

    <measure>To asses the rate of bacterial colonization over degenerative cardiac valves and to discover whether there is a link to a specific micro-organism.</measure>

    <description>Baseline demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters such as age, gender, medical history, complete blood count and biochemistry profile will be compared between research group (degenerative cardiac valve disease) and control group (Isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients) by means of multivariate analysis and pattern recognition techniques.</description>

          -  Male or Female subject, 50 years or older

          -  Subjects are scheduled to go through any cardiac valve replacement or repair due to
