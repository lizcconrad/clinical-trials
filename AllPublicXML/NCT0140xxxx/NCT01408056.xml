  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Timolol 0.5% Gel Forming Solution is safe
      and effective in promoting wound healing of infantile ulcerated hemangiomas compared with
      standard conservative management with topical antibiotic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulceration is the most common complication associated with infantile hemangiomas. Ulceration
      and the delay in wound healing places patients at risk for infection, bleeding, pain and
      permanent scarring. Currently, the care of ulcerated hemangiomas is extremely difficult and
      patients are often subject to multiple treatment modalities.

      In the past two years, the leading advance in the treatment of hemangiomas has been the use
      of the non-selective, oral beta-blocker propranolol to arrest growth and promote involution
      of hemangiomas. Recent literature also suggests beta-blockers may have a role in helping
      ulcerated wounds re-epithelialize.

      The use of a topical non-selective beta-blocker on isolated ulcerated hemangiomas may promote
      early healing and reduce the number of complications associated with ulceration.
      Investigation is needed to explore the safety and tolerability of applying a topical
      beta-blocker on an ulcerated hemangioma and whether topical beta-blockade may be more
      efficacious than conservative care with topical antibiotics.

      In this study, infants will be randomized to either receive a topical antibiotic (topical
      mupirocin 2% ointment twice per day) or a topical beta-blocker (Timolol 0.5% Gel Forming
      Solution) according to a dose-escalation schedule. Subjects will be seen in clinic on day 7,
      day 14, 1 month and 2 months into therapy and 1 month after therapy is completed. Photographs
      and safety and efficacy measurements will be taken at each visit to assess response to
      therapy.
