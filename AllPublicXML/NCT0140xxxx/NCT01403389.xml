      The purpose of this study is to determine if Eculizumab is safe and effective in the
      prevention of delayed graft function following deceased donor kidney transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on experimental data and supportive observations in humans associating complement gene
      upregulation with ischemic reperfusion injury, it is hypothesized that C5 cleavage is a key
      step in the pathogenesis of ischemic reperfusion injury following transplantation. It is
      further hypothesized that eculizumab, an antibody that blocks C5 cleavage in humans will be
      an effective prophylactic agent to prevent ischemic reperfusion injury in high risk
      recipients. To test this hypothesis, this study is a pilot prospective, randomized study to
      test the efficacy of eculizumab vs. placebo given once at the time of transplantation in
      preventing delayed graft function in first adult recipients of deceased donor kidneys.

    <description>Delayed Graft Function defined as follows:
A need for at least one dialysis treatment during the first 7 days after transplantation (not including a single session for hyperkalemia or hypervolemia in the first 48 hours)
A less than or equal to 50% reduction in serum creatinine in the first 24 hours post-transplantation
A serum creatinine reduction ratio &lt; 30% at 48 hours post-transplantation
Slow Graft Function Defined as Follows:
A functioning graft at Day 5 Post-transplantation with a serum creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dL and no need for dialysis</description>
