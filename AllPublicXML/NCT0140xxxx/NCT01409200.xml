    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is learn if adding axitinib to hormonal therapy can
      help to control prostate cancer when given before surgery. The safety of this drug will also
      be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Axitinib is FDA approved for kidney cancer. Axitinib is
      currently being used for research purposes only in prostate cancer.

      Up to 72 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the roll of the dice) to 1 of 2 groups:

        -  If you are in Group A, you will receive axitinib and hormonal therapy.

        -  If you are in Group B, you will receive hormonal therapy alone.

      You will have a 2 out of 3 chance of being placed in Group A. You have a 1 out of 3 chance of
      being placed in Group B.

      Study Drug Administration:

      All participants will receive hormonal therapy. The hormonal drug you receive will be
      standard of care hormone therapy. The study doctor will decide what hormone therapy you will
      receive and will explain when and how you should take the hormone therapy and any risks.

      You will have 8 weeks of hormone therapy before you are assigned to a study group. After you
      are assigned to a study group, you will receive up to 4 more months of hormone therapy.

      If you are in Group A, you will also take 1 capsule of axitinib by mouth 2 times a day. You
      will be asked to take your blood pressure 2 times a week and record it in a diary before
      taking your axitinib dose. Note: If your blood pressure is above 150 systolic (the upper
      number) OR above 100 diastolic (the lower number) or if you develop any symptoms related to
      increased blood pressure please contact your study doctor immediately. You can take your
      blood pressure at home or elsewhere, such as at the drug store or doctors office. Doses
      should be taken about 12 hours apart and at about the same time each day, with food. If you
      miss a dose, you may take it up to 3 hours late before the next scheduled dose; otherwise do
      not make up the missed dose. Instead, skip the missed dose and take your next dose as
      scheduled. If you vomit any time after taking a dose do not make it up, but instead take your
      next dose as scheduled. You will be asked to keep a diary to help you keep track of when you
      take each dose of the study drug. Record any missed or vomited doses in the diary. Bring the
      diary with you to each visit.

      Each cycle is 30 days. You should return all unused study drug and/or empty pill bottles at
      the end of each cycle.

      Study Visits:

      At every visit, you will be asked about any side effects you have had and any drugs you may
      be taking.

      About 8 weeks after you begin hormonal therapy:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your PSA. Your
           blood will also be tested for levels of certain proteins.

        -  You will have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the prostate with 10-12 samples collected.
           Â°You will be separately consented for this biopsy, which will describe the procedure and
           its risks in more detail.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Your blood will also be
           tested to check your thyroid function (Group A only).

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests (Group A only).

        -  You will have an ECG (Group A only).

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1 (Group A only):

        -  Your vital signs and weight will be measured.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3 (Group A only):

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests to check your PSA and
           testosterone levels. Part of this blood will be used to check your thyroid function
           (Cycle 2 only).

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests

      About 2 months before surgery (Group B only):

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check your PSA and testosterone levels.

      About 2 weeks before surgery or if you go off study early:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  You will have a digital rectal exam.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your PSA and
           testosterone levels. Your blood will also be tested for levels of certain proteins.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. Your blood will also be
           tested to check your thyroid function (Group A only).

      Length of Study:

      You may receive the study drug(s) for about 6 months. You will be taken off study early if
      the disease gets worse, if you have intolerable side effects, or if your study doctor thinks
      it is in your best interest to stop.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up visits
      after surgery.

      Surgery:

      After 6 months of study treatment, you will have surgery to remove your prostate. You will be
      asked to sign a separate consent form for this surgery, and the risks will be discussed with
      you.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      At 1 month after your surgery:

        -  You will be asked about any drugs or treatments you may be receiving (including

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you have had.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PSA and testosterone levels.

        -  If you are in Group A, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and
           to check your thyroid function.

      At 3 months after your surgery:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will be asked about any disease-related symptoms and/or side effects you may have
           had.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight, height, and vital
           signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your PSA and
           testosterone levels.

      You will have follow-up visits every 3 months for the first year, every 4 months for the
      second year, every 6 months in the third to fifth year, and 1 time a year after that unless
      the disease worsens, you start taking hormone therapy, or you begin radiation treatments. At
      these visits, blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your
