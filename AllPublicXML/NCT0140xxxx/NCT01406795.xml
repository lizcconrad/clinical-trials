  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the safety and efficacy of drug coated stents for the treatment of venous occlusions
      and stenoses in the lower extremity. The use of the device for the treatment of peripheral
      arterial disease is approved by the FDA, however, the use of the device in venous occlusions
      and stenoses, although performed by some practitioners, has not yet been studied in detail.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stent Migration</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 month following the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Stent migration is reported as the count of participants with stent migration within 1 month following stent placement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stent Migration</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one year following the procedure 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Stent migration is reported as the count of participants with stent migration within 1 year following stent placement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Patency Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year following the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Patency refers to whether the stent is unoccluded (open). Primary patency rate was defined as the count of participants with &gt;= 50% patency following initial stent placement, and is reported as the count of participants meeting this criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Freedom From Device-related Amputation</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year following the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Freedom from device-related amputation (amputation of infected limb) is reported as the count of participants with no device-related amputation within 1 year following stent placement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assisted-primary Patency</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patency refers to whether the stent is unoccluded (open). Primary refers to the first time a stent was placed (or the first time patency needed to be established). Assisted refers to the fact that a device (like a balloon) was used to open the stent. Assisted-primary patency is defined as the count of participants that demonstrated the need for an intervention to establish patency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Patency</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary patency means that the initial intervention failed and a second intervention was performed to establish or maintain patency. Secondary patency is defined as the count of participants that required a second intervention to establish patency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to two years 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were reported as the count of participants that experienced an adverse event within two years of their procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease in Swelling of Affected Extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The count of participants that experienced a decrease in swelling after the stent was placed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Venous Clinical Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Venous Clinical Severity represents the severity of the venous pathology, which includes measures like pain, inflammation, and number of ulcers. It is scored on a scale of 0-3 with the upper end representing very severe outcomes for the patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VEINS-QOL</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VEINS-QOL is a questionnaire that represents a patient's quality of life, using measures like how well the patient can walk, sleep, and enjoy life. Responses are graded on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being very good, and 5 being very poor. The VEINS-QOL measure is defined by the count of participants that showed a decreased overall score following their procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Villalta PTS Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Villalta PTS Scale is a score based on the patient's symptoms, includes cramps, pain, and redness. It is scaled from 0 to 48, with a higher score representing more severe disease.</description>
