  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to measure with CERSR® (Computerized
      Electrophysiological Reconstruction of the Spinal Regions) the electrical signals made by the
      muscles in the lower back 1) when the subject has no low back pain 2) during the time low
      back pain begins, or 3) during the treatment and resolution of the low back pain, and 4) to
      study the changes which take place in these muscles as the pain improves with physical
      therapy treatment as an intervention. The hypotheses to be tested are 1) The CERSR® scan
      parameters for normal (pain-free) subjects are different from those of subjects with low back
      pain. 2) CERSR® scan aids the physician in determining a directed physical therapy treatment
      which leads to relief of low back pain following no more than eight weeks of physical
      therapy, as measured by relief of pain using a Visual Analog Scale and symptom improvement as
      measured using the Oswestry Disability Index.

    <description>The subjects will complete a form indicating their pain level upon enrollment. Subjects will then be scanned again at four weeks and at eight weeks. At the time of the scan subjects will also be asked to complete a follow up VAS. Upon completion of the study the change in VAS scores will be analyzed.</description>
