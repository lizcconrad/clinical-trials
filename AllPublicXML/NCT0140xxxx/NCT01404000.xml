    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study s to determine whether treatment with Iodinated Active Charcoal can
      improve lung function and physical capacity in patients with chronic obstructive lung
      disorders. The rational for the study is the observation that COPD patients have an increased
      tissue load of mercury interfering with the function by NeuroEpithelial Endocrine (NEE) cells
      in the respiratory tract. Mercury binding to these NEE cells leads to an increased smooth
      muscle tonus and a reduced response to bronchodilator treatment. Initial observational data
      have shown an improved lung function and improved functional capacity after treatment
      motivating a larger placebo controlled POC study
