      This study will implement a health navigation intervention to improve linkage to and
      retention in HIV care for inmates released from L.A. county jail into the community.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study has two Primary Specific Aims:

        1. To examine individual-level and structural-level barriers to HIV care after release from
           jail, using formative semi-structured interviews with ex-inmates, case managers, and HIV
           care providers; and to use the information we obtain to inform the adaptation and
           tailoring of an intervention designed to improve linkage with and retention to HIV care
           for HIV+ ex-inmates (Complete);

        2. Using a two-group experimental RCT design, to test the adapted health navigation
           intervention condition for HIV+ inmates upon release from jail compared to a usual care
           condition, and to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness at improving linkage with
           and retention in HIV care, self-reported ART adherence, and HIV RNA viral load
           suppression;

      We hypothesize that the intervention will result in more rapid linkage to care, a greater
      proportion completing at least three HIV care visits per year, increased self-reported ART
      adherence, and decreased levels of HIV RNA viral load compared to the usual care control
      group.

      Secondary Aims of the study include assessing the potential moderating effects of substance
      abuse, the potential mediating effects of substance abuse treatment, and the program's
      effects on recidivism, and costs.

      We hypothesize that active substance abuse will moderate the effect of the intervention, so
      the intervention will be less effective among participants who report substance use.

    <description>Subjects will receive the following health navigation services:
1) 10 Navigator meetings: Navigators will meet with participants in person to teach linkage/retention skills and knowledge
2a) 2 Navigator accompaniment sessions: the health navigator will accompany participants to HIV care appointment. Before and after the appointment, participants and navigators will review linkage and retention skills/knowledge things that make it hard or easy for him to get regular HIV care
2b) Optional health navigator accompaniment sessions: If the participant requests, the health navigator will provide accompaniment to supportive HIV care appointments (one per month max)
3) 14 Health navigator care calls: During these calls, navigators and participants will talk about any problems that could make it difficult to get regular HIV care.</description>
