  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keloid is chronic skin conditions that results in formation of tumor like growths on the
      skin. Despite its benign nature, keloid can cause severe aesthetic and, in some cases,
      functional problem which negatively impacts person's quality of life.

      Keloids do not regress on their own and results of most available treatments such as surgery,
      injecting keloids with steroids, chemotherapy injections, or even radiation therapy, have
      mostly proven disappointing.

      Some laboratory studies have shown that there is excessive amount of a protein called
      &quot;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&quot; in keloid tissue. This may play role in the
      formation and evolution of keloid.

      Bevacizumab is a drug that works by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which
      helps new blood vessels form. Without new blood vessels, the growth of the keloid may be
      slowed

      Based on presence of excess amount of VEGF in keloid tissue, we hypothesize that bevacizumab
      will be effective in treatment of keloids. This exploratory clinical trial is to confirm or
      reject this hypothesis.

      Sixty Eligible patients will be enrolled in the study. This will be a two stage design trial.

      In stage I of the trial, 21 patients will be treated with intralesional bevacizumab. Keloids
      that fail to respond to 4 injections will not be treated any longer with bevacizumab and all
      such patients will be removed from the trial.

      If 5 or more patients show some degree of objective response to treatment in at least one
      treated keloid, the trial will continue to enroll another 45 patients to a total of 66
      patients, otherwise, the trial will stop in its entirety.

    <description>Bevacizumab will be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride to achieve a concentration of 1 mg/0.3 ml. Bevacizumab will be injected inside ONE keloid tissue to result in a visual expansion of the keloid. Only 1 mg of bevacizumab is injected inside ONE keloid. The injections will be repeated every 14 days. Patients will receive maximum of 12 injections only.
A log will be kept for each patient indicating the date and the dose of bevacizumab that was delivered to each patient.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical Diagnosis of a flat keloid.

          2. Age 18 to 50

          3. A signed informed consent document (ICD)

          4. Able and willing to receive bevacizumab

        Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during screening. The
        effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of
        child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
        study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
        participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
