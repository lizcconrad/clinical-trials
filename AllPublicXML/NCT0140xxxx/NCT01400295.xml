  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine a relatively safe contrast media volume to creatinine clearance cut-off value to
      avoid contrast-induced nephropathy in patients following coronary angiography
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrast media volume to creatinine clearance (V/CrCl) ratios were obtained from consecutive
      consenting patients after coronary angiography. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves
      were used to identify the optimal sensitivity for the observed range of V/CrCl. The
      predictive value of V/CrCl for the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy was assessed using
      multivariate logistic regression.Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with creatinine
      clearance &lt; 60 ml/min,diabetes,emergent angiography.
