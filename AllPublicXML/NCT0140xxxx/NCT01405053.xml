    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the cognitive effect, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      rufinamide on Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome inadequately controlled in pediatric subjects already
      taking other anti-epileptic drugs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Key Inclusion:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of LGS at screening, which might include the presence of a slow
             background electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythm, slow spikes-waves pattern (less than 3
             Hz), the presence of polyspikes; care should be taken not to include benign myoclonic
             epilepsy of infancy, subjects with a diagnosis of atypical benign partial epilepsy
             (pseudo-Lennox syndrome), or continuous spike-waves of slow sleep (CSWS).

          2. On a fixed dose of one to three concomitant regionally approved antiepileptic drugs
             (AEDs) for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to randomization with an inadequate response to
             treatment.

          3. Consistent seizure documentation (i.e., no uncertainty of the presence of seizures)
             and AED treatment documentation during the 8 week pre-randomization period.

        Key Exclusion:

          1. Familial short QT syndrome

          2. Prior treatment with rufinamide
