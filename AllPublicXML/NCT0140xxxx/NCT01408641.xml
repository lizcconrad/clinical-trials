  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol abuse and dependence (alcohol use disorders, AUDs) and posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) are both prevalent in Veterans. Treating AUDs in Veterans with PTSD may be more
      difficult than treating AUDs in the general population. The FDA-approved medication
      topiramate has been shown to improve drinking outcomes in people with AUDs. Topiramate has
      also improved symptoms in people with PTSD. This study is designed to investigate whether
      topiramate will improve drinking outcomes in Veterans with PTSD.

    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Alcohol Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) interview was conducted to establish a baseline drinking pattern over the previous 90 days and confirm the presence of an alcohol use disorder (defined as consumption of greater than 35 standard drinks per week over the previous 4 weeks). The TLFB involves asking participants to retrospectively report their drinking days using a calendar.</description>

    <measure>Amount of PTSD Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) contains 30 questions relating to PTSD symptoms. Each question asks about both the frequency and the severity of each symptom. These questions are split into categories. Each criterion has several questions, and scores for each criterion are added up at the end. To meet criteria for a symptom, a patient must meet criteria in both frequency and intensity score for each item. Frequency and intensity and then combined to form a single severity score. Severity scores range from 0-4, with 0 being absent to 4 being extreme/incapacitating.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Heavy Drinking Days</title>
        <description>The Alcohol Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) interview was conducted to establish a baseline drinking pattern over the previous 90 days and confirm the presence of an alcohol use disorder (defined as consumption of greater than 35 standard drinks per week over the previous 4 weeks). The TLFB involves asking participants to retrospectively report their drinking days using a calendar.</description>

        <population>There were not enough interested, eligible participants available to continue the study. Additionally, the study drug expired and the pharmacy that had done the compounding was bought by a larger chain and was set to be closed. Therefore, the study was stopped and closed in April 2013.</population>

        <title>Amount of PTSD Symptoms</title>
        <description>The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) contains 30 questions relating to PTSD symptoms. Each question asks about both the frequency and the severity of each symptom. These questions are split into categories. Each criterion has several questions, and scores for each criterion are added up at the end. To meet criteria for a symptom, a patient must meet criteria in both frequency and intensity score for each item. Frequency and intensity and then combined to form a single severity score. Severity scores range from 0-4, with 0 being absent to 4 being extreme/incapacitating.</description>
