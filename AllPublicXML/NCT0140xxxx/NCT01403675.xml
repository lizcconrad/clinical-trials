    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy can cause permanent damage to a woman's ovaries. Women who are cancer survivors
      may find that they are not able to produce female hormones, and they may not be able to have
      a child. Scientists are trying to find ways to help cancer survivors regain their hormonal
      function and possibly get pregnant, if they desire. Scientists have developed a method where
      ovarian tissue is removed and frozen before chemotherapy; then it is thawed and put back into
      the woman's body after she is cancer-free. Putting a woman's previously-frozen tissue back
      into her body is called ovarian autotransplantation.

      Ovarian autotransplantation is a very new technique, and there have only been a small number
      of women who have had this procedure. So far, only five babies in the world have been born
      using this technique.

      The purpose of this study is to learn more about ovarian autotransplantation. Scientists hope
      to find better ways to use this method to help a woman's ovaries start working again after
      chemotherapy. If the ovaries start working again, it might be possible to have a baby.

    <description>There are two ways to transplant the thawed ovarian tissue back into a woman's body. It can be put back inside the abdomen, close to the natural location of the ovaries, or the tissue can be put under the skin of the abdomen. After you have had the transplant, your hormone function will be tested every month. Each month, you will have a blood draw to measure hormones and an ultrasound to see how the tissue is growing. These monthly visits will continue until you have normal hormone levels. If the transplant is successful, it is expected that your hormones would return to normal in 3 - 7 months. If your hormone levels return and stay regular for three months, then Dr. Kim will talk to you about trying to get pregnant. The method of getting pregnant will depend on the type of transplantation surgery you had and your current medical condition. You will have weekly blood tests and other tests to determine the best way to get pregnant.</description>
