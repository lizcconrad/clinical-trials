    <textblock>
      The standard treatment choice for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is sorafenib, and
      its efficacy is limited. More active treatments were performed in patients with advanced HCC
      in China, which include radical hepatectomy or TACE. The study is to investigate whether the
      active treatment will profit survival of patients, and to evaluate the safety.

      This is a prospective non-randomized controlled study. Patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma (BCLC C stage) who underwent palliative resection or TACE followed with Sorafenib
      or treated by sorafenib alone will be included. The patients will be divided to group A
      (palliative resection plus sorafenib), group B (palliative TACE plus sorafenib), and group C
      (sorafenib alone). The sample size will be about 200 cases altogether.
