  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, consecutive series, multicenter clinical study that
      will include patients who will have total hip replacement with the R3 Acetabular System.

      The study design was selected to assess the safety and effectiveness profile of the R3
      Acetabular System in patients with degenerative joint disease requiring primary total hip
      replacement. A non¬-randomized, consecutive series of up to 158 patients will be enrolled,
      and a maximum of 8 sites will participate in the study. Each site is allowed to enroll up to
      22 patients. When 158 patients are enrolled from all sites, enrollment will be stopped,
      regardless of the number contributed from each site. The clinical data from this study will
      be compared with a historical control. The study will include follow up through 5 years.

        This clinical study can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate subjects are enrolled.
        All relevant medical and non-medical conditions should be taken into consideration when
        deciding whether a particular patient is suitable.

          -  Patient has met an acceptable preoperative medical clearance and is free from or
