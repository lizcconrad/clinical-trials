  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to compare the effect of a family-based HIV prevention program
      to the effect of an adolescent-only health promotion program on adolescent HIV risk and
      marijuana use among adolescents enrolled in the Juvenile Drug Court (JDC) of the Rhode Island
      Family Court.

    <textblock>
      Adolescents and parents admitted to our study receive either an adolescent-only health
      education program that focuses on general health risk behaviors related to HIV/AIDS, smoking,
      diet and exercise or one that focuses on family-based HIV/AIDS education through safe
      decision-making and control of one's emotions as well as parent-child interactions that are
      associated with dysregulated affect, subsequent parenting deficits and adolescent HIV risk
      behaviors.
