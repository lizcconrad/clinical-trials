  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menopause represents a critical period in a woman's life as the hormonal changes and the
      failing ovarian function not only determine relevant modifications in the reproductive
      function but also in many other conditions and organs that apparently are scarcely linked
      with hormones. The PI's centre has among its main goals the treatment of chronic liver
      disease; in the last years, a increasing interest in gender-related issues has grown.

      Goal of this study is to verify the impact of menopause on response to antiviral therapy for
      CHC and in determining more severe fibrosis in comparison with age-matched men. To achieve
      this goal a database of all the PEG IFN/Ribavirin patients treated in the GI Unit of the
      University of Modena and Reggio Emilia in the last 7 years will be set up. Demographic,
      clinical and biochemical data as well data regarding the reproductive history, time, type,
      length of estrogen deprivation and of hormone-replacement therapy will be collected.

      The study is designed retrospective epidemiological cohort study. Overall, a group of 442
      women (168 still in fertile age; 274 menopausal) with HCV-positive CAH who underwent PEG IFN
      treatment in the last 5 years will be evaluated. For comparison, a group of 548 HCV-positive
      males with CAH will be evaluated. Liver biopsies before undergoing standard antiviral therapy
      will be scored for fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis. In women the presence, type and
      timing of menopause, associated hormonal/metabolic features and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      and hepatic tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels will be evaluated.

      The primary endpoint will be evaluation of SVR in females (in fertile and menopausal age) and
      in males.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All women treated for HCV chronic hepatitis, at the Unit Gastroenterology, University
             of Modena and Reggio Emilia, in the last 7 years.

          -  Control group is a cohort matched for age (ratio 1:1) selected from a group of 558 men
             with chronic HCV treated in the same period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No exclusion criteria aret pre-defined as the study includes all patients who were
             treated for chronic HCV hepatitis; exclusion was made upstream of the constitution of
             this cohort.
