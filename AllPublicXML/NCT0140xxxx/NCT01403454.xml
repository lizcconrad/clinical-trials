  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves Chronic Kidney Disease patients that must choose the type of dialysis
      therapy they ultimately wish to perform. These patients receive education regarding dialysis
      types from nurses and Nephrologists at a Kidney Function Program. The investigators have
      developed a web-based Interactive Health Communication Application that could provide more
      education and support to patients about their dialysis choices. The investigators will
      compare patients that will receive usual care dialysis education versus patients that will
      receive additional education through this web-based application. The investigators feel that
      this tool may increase the proportion of patients who start home dialysis, which offers
      advantages such as improvement in quality of life and deceased overall healthcare costs, over
      hospital hemodialysis.
