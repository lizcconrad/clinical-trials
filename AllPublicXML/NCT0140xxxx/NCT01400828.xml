        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study disease was diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria: Nasal symptoms

             the year prior to entering.

          -  Patients with history of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis, positive skin prick test and
             symptoms were included if they were between 12 and 70 years old, gave their informed
             consent, attended the required visits scheduled and also underwent a complete medical
             examination..

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if they had a significant nasal abnormality which could
             interfere with the aim of the study, acute or chronic sinusitis, asthma or any
             condition, disease or hypersensitivity that could be harmed.

          -  Patients were not allowed to take forbidden medications or not comply the study
             requirements.

          -  Patients who were currently participating in or had participated in another clinical
