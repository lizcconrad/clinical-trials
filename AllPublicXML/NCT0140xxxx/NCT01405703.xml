      This is a prospective, level II evidence comparison between two cohorts. This study is
      designed to compare the percutaneous versus open approach for plate fixation of diaphyseal
      clavicle fractures. This study includes questionnaires and measurements that will collect
      data on incision-related numbness, union rates, overall outcomes, complication rates of the
      two methods, infection rates, and overall satisfaction. The surgical procedure, all
      radiographs and follow-up visits to a minimum of one year are the principle investigators
      (PI's) standard of care for this injury. Measurements and questionnaires are related to the
      study.

    <description>The primary outcome measure for this study will be incision related numbness, based on clinical examination and the use of our skin numbness map. Our null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in incision related numbness between the two groups: percutaneous versus open approach. Our primary objective is to disprove this hypothesis, predicting that the percutaneously treated group will have less incisional numbness.</description>

    <measure>Incision numbness at surgical site.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 wks, 6 wks, 3 mths, 6mnths and 1+ year post-op</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary outcome measures will be union, malunion, and nonunion rates between these two methods, as well as infection rates and functional and satisfaction outcomes based on subjective questioning and the DASH and Constant shoulder score questionnaires. Our null hypothesis for these secondary outcomes is that there will be no difference between the two treatment groups.</description>
