    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a
      randomized, controlled dietary intervention trial of high versus low dietary intake of
      advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in 24 adults; and to gather preliminary data on the
      impact of high versus low AGE diet health parameters. The investigators hypothesize that it
      will be feasible to conduct a randomized, parallel arm, controlled dietary intervention in a
      pilot study involving 24 subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), bioactive molecules formed by the non-enzymatic
      glycation of proteins, are emerging as a possible dietary risk factor for many key adverse
      health outcomes related to obesity and to aging. Major sources of systemic AGEs are
      endogenous AGEs generated in the body and exogenous AGEs found in foods. When food is heated
      to high temperatures, the characteristic &quot;browning&quot; generates Maillard reaction products,
      known as AGEs. Although AGEs have been implicated in atherosclerosis, insulin resistance,
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, aging-related eye disease, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic
      kidney disease, the possible adverse effects of dietary AGEs have not been well characterized
      in humans.

      The objective of the study is to determine whether it is feasible to conduct a randomized,
      parallel arm, controlled dietary intervention in a pilot study involving 24 subjects; and to
      compare the effects of a high-AGE and low-AGE diet on (a) serum and urine
      carboxymethyl-lysine and serum receptor for AGEs (RAGE), (b) endothelial function, (c)
      interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, (d) lipids, (e) adipokines, (f) glucose metabolism and
      insulin resistance, (g) renal function, and (h) cognition.
