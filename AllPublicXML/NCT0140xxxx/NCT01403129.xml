  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal disease which will in many cases ultimately require corneal
      transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current
      technology, would allow early treatment and prevent severe damage to KC corneas inadvertently
      operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of different
      properties of the cornea to develop means for early detection of KC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. As keratoconus
      develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to
      maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect.
      This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of a
      keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Early
      detection of keratoconus will benefit patients because of the recent development of methods
      for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression.

      The investigators have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound
      for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the
      epithelium and the stroma. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to
      bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to
      maintain a smooth anterior surface. The investigators have also developed methods for
      characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface
      displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force.

      Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus-suspect by at least
      a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. This would provide
      two major benefitsÍ¾ (1) to be able to predict eyes with higher risk of developing ectasia
      after corneal refractive surgery, and (2) early diagnosis would allow earlier treatment of
      the condition with collagen crosslinking, preserving the cornea from disease progression.
