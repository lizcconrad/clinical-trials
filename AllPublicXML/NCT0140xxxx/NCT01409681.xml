  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D exerts antiproliferative and differentiating effects in cancers, including
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The active form of Vitamin D is 1,25,
      dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) which rapidly induces expression of cytochrome P450
      24R-hydroxylase (CYP24A1). CYP24A1 initiates inactivation of calcitriol as a result of
      successive hydroxylation/oxidation reactions. This study seeks to prospectively determine the
      relationship between Vitamin D gene expression and median survival as a primary outcome, and
      between the Vitamin D receptor (VDR)/CYP24A1 gene expression and cancer stage, smoking
      status, serum 1,25 (OH)2D3 levels as well as CYP24A1 genotype.

      This study seeks to prospectively determine the relationship between Vitamin D gene
      expression and median survival as a primary outcome, and the relationships between the
      Vitamin D receptor (VDR)/CYP24A1 gene expression and cancer stage, smoking status, serum 1,25
      (OH)2D3 levels as well as CYP24A1 genotype.

      Patients who are suspected to have lung cancer will be recruited to this study prior to their
      diagnostic biopsy. Those who have consented to the study will give permission for blood and
      tissue from this biopsy to be analyzed for the study endpoints. Statistical analysis on this
      data will seek to correlate CYP24A1 expression and medican survival of the participants.
      Patients' data will be collected for smoking status and cancer stage.

      Study enrollment to adequately power the study statistically is 80 patients. Anticipated
      study duration is from 12 months to 18 months for sample collection and two years for
      follow-up for patient survival.
