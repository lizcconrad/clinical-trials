  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide evidence for the feasibility and initial
      effectiveness of a manualized, telephone-based (telehealth) approach to the delivery of
      cognitive interventions (SMARTease) targeted to improve cognitive performance in daily
      activities after stroke.

    <textblock>
      An initial brief screening interview will be completed with the potential participant by
      telephone to determine whether or not the individual meets the criteria for the study.

      In an initial onsite visit, informed consent will be obtained from both the stroke survivor
      and their study partner and baseline evaluations will be completed with the stroke survivor,
      including a baseline cognitive assessment and setting goals to work on during the study
      period. Then the introductory section of the study Handbook (Making the Most of Your Memory)
      which includes procedural information on the Stroke Help Program will be reviewed with the
      stroke survivor and study partner. A study Handbook and a large button speaker phone will be
      provided to the stroke survivor/partner pair to ensure that both members of the
      participant-caregiver team can listen to the rehabilitation coach without having to be
      concerned with holding a handset (an action that may be difficult for some stroke survivors).

      Telephone contact by the rehabilitation coach will be organized and the 16-week Stroke Help
      Cognitive Strategy Training Intervention will proceed. In general the topics or strategies to
      be discussed will be used to achieve one or more of the following rehabilitation strategies:
      1) Understanding cognitive deficits that may result from stroke; 2). Reinforcing,
      strengthening or re-establishing previously learned patterns of behavior; 3) Establishing new
      patterns of compensatory mechanisms; 4) Enabling persons to adapt to their cognitive
      disability.

      Following the 16-week Cognitive Strategy Training Intervention participants will have an
      on-site visit to provide qualitative and quantitative data related to the feasibility and
      efficacy of the program.

    <description>The strategy intervention is a 16-week program during which a trained rehabilitation coach speaks by telephone to the stroke participant and their caregiver twice a week (one approximately 45-minute 'training' call and one approximately 15-minute 'update' call). Rehabilitation discussions during the training calls will follow a detailed protocol and focus each week on the stroke education and cognitive strategy training information provided in each section of the manual provided to the participants.</description>
