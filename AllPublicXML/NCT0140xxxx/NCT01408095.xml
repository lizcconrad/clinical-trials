    <textblock>
      The study is designed to see if once daily oral dosing of LY2608204 will help control
      diabetes as measured by the glycosylated fraction of hemoglobin A (HbA1c) level. It will also
      help to determine the safety of the medication and the most useful doses of the medication.
