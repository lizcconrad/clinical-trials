  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) has been demonstrated in multiple pre-clinical models to
      enhance survival and regeneration of retinal ganglion cells, the retinal neurons injured in
      diseases like glaucoma. We hypothesize that CNTF delivery to the human eye will provide
      neuroprotection (prevent loss of vision) and neuroenhancement (improve vision indices) in
      glaucoma. Patients in the trial will receive an NT-501 CNTF implant (made by Neurotech) into
      one eye, and will be carefully followed to evaluate safety and efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  must understand and sign the informed consent

          -  must be medically able to undergo ophthalmic surgery for the NT-501 device insertion
             and possible removal, as well as the testing required.

          -  diagnosis of glaucoma characterized by (a) clinical evidence of progressive RGC
             dysfunction and degeneration using both visual field and at least one structural
             modality; (b) residual visual field preservation including best-corrected visual
             acuity (BCVA) better than 20/100; (c) failure to contain glaucomatous progression with
             maximally tolerated reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), OR visual field defect
             affecting fixation, but not reducing BCVA below 20/100.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  other corneal, lens, optic nerve or retinal disease causing vision loss,

          -  blind in one eye

          -  requirement of acyclovir and/or related products during study

          -  receiving systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive medications.

          -  pregnant or lactating.

          -  considered immunodeficient or has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV)

          -  on chemotherapy, or a history of malignancy, UNLESS it was treated successfully 2
             years prior to inclusion in the trial.
