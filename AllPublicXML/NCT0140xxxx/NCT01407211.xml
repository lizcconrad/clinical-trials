  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is the comparison between the effects of supplementation with vitamin A
      (retinyl palmitate) or placebo for 6 months on gene expression of T CD4+ lymphocyte in
      multiple sclerotic patient.

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system (CNS).The most important reason for the limited success obtained in the
      treatment and prevention so far is most likely related to the limited knowledge about its
      cause and pathogenesis of MS.One of the recent proposed mechanism for autoimmunity base of MS
      is Th1/Th2 implance of as well as other inflammatory and anti-inflammatory T cell such as
      Th17 and Treg and their releasing cytokines. Therefore the control of cytokine production may
      become potential therapeutic targets and modulation of the Th1/Th2 balance may provide a new
      pharmacological tool to treat this disease. Vitamin A (VA) or VA-like analogs known as
      retinoids, are potent hormonal modifiers of type 1 or type 2 responses but a definitive
      description of their mechanism(s) of action is lacking. high level dietary vitamin A enhances
      Th2 cytokine production and IgA responses, and is likely to decrease Th1 cytokine production.
      Retinoic acid inhibits IL 12 production in activated macrophages, and RA pretreatment of
      macrophages reduces IFNγ production and increases IL4 production in antigen primed CD4 T
      cells. Supplemental treatment with vitamin A or retinoic acid (RA) decreases IFNγ and
      increases IL5, IL10, and IL4 production. Thus, vitamin A deficiency biases the immune
      response in a Th1 direction, whereas high level dietary vitamin A may bias the response in a
      Th2 direction.
