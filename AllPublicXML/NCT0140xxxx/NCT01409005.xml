  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there have been remarkable advances in the treatment of metastatic or recurrent
      colorectal cancer (MRCRC), long term survival cannot be expected in most patients with MRCRC
      because of inevitably developing resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs except some MRCRC
      patients who can undergo complete resection (metastasectomy). Until now, approved cytotoxic
      drugs for treatment of MCRC are only 3 categories (fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin and
      irinotecan). Recently, molecularly targeted drugs are approved for MRCRC patients, and
      bevacizumab and cetuximab (for K-ras wild type tumors) are available. When cytotoxic and
      targeted drugs are appropriately combined, about 24 months of overall survival (OS) can be
      expected in patients with MRCRC. However, when these drugs are all used or patients cannot
      afford to receive expensive targeted drugs because of economical problems, there is no option
      for chemotherapy and best supportive care is the only option, although some patients still
      have good performance status and medical conditions. Therefore, there are unmet needs for
      additional salvage chemotherapy regimens for patients with oxaliplatin, irinotecan and
      fluoropyrimidine-refractory MRCRC.

      In some previous studies, gemcitabine-based chemotherapy showed some antitumor activities in
      MRCRC patients. Especially, when combined with fluoropyrimidine, gemcitabine has been shown
      to exert synergic effects on antitumor activities. On these backgrounds, this phase 2
      clinical study was designed. In this study, efficacy and safety of gemcitabine plus UFTE
      chemotherapy will be evaluated in MRCRC patients.
