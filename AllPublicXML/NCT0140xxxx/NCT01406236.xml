  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the SAFE-PCI for women trial is that, compared with transfemoral PCI,
      transradial PCI will result in a significant reduction in bleeding and vascular
      complications. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy and feasibility of the
      transradial approach to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in women compared with the
      transfemoral approach.

      This study is a multicenter, randomized, open-label active controlled study. Three thousand
      women undergoing urgent or elective PCI from at least 50 centers will be randomized to either
      transradial or transfemoral PCI. Patients who are enrolled at sites performing ad hoc PCI
      will be randomized before diagnostic angiography. A total of approximately 3000 women will be
      randomized to obtain a cohort of approximately 1800 patients undergoing PCI.

      The Data Safety Monitoring Board has alerted us that the bleeding event rate overall in our
      trial is very low, making it unlikely that there will be statistical power to show a
      difference between the randomized arms in the SAFE PCI for Women study using the BARC
      bleeding definition per protocol. Based on this statistical futility, the DSMB has
      recommended stopping enrollment. They also noted, however, that as this is not based on any
      safety issues, and since there are a variety of key secondary endpoints (contrast and
      radiation exposure, quality of life) that are of clinical and scientific interest, the DSMB
      left it to the discretion of the Steering Committee to continue enrollment to meet sufficient
      power for these outcomes. On March 1, 2013, the Steering Committee met to discuss these
      issues and voted to continue enrollment until the planned sample size for the Quality of Life
      substudy was met (300 patients).

    Study stopped for Statistical Futility. Low rate of bleeding events made it unlikely there
    would be statistical power to show a difference in the 2 arms.
