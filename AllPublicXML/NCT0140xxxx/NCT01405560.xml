  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of vaniprevir
      (300 mg twice daily) given in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2b (peg-IFN) and
      ribavirin (RBV) in Japanese participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype (GT) 1 who
      have not responded to previous treatment. The primary efficacy objective is to estimate
      efficacy of vaniprevir, peg-IFN and RBV for 24 weeks as assessed by the percentage of
      participants achieving undetectable Hepatitis C Virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) 24 weeks
      after completion of all study therapy (Sustained Viral Response 24 [SVR24]).

    <time_frame>24 weeks after 24 weeks of study therapy (up to 48 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>SVR24 was defined as having an undetectable HCV RNA level 24 weeks after completion of all study therapy. The percentage of participants achieving SVR24 were reported along with corresponding 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals for each treatment regimen.</description>

    <time_frame>From Day 1 (post-dose) through completion of Week 24 Follow-up (up to 48 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an AE. For this study, safety parameters or AEs of special interest that were identified a priori included serious rash, anemia (anemia plus haemoglobin decreased), neutropenia (neutropenia plus neutrophil count decreased), bilirubin increased and gastrointestinal adverse experiences (vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea). The percentage of participants with ≥1 specific AEs were reported along with corresponding 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals for each treatment regimen.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>HCV RNA levels were assessed at baseline (BL) and during treatment weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 using the Roche TaqMan HCV assay, and transformed to Log 10 values. HCV RNA values below the limit of reliable quantification (LoQ) or the limit of detection (LoD) at any time point were handled as follows (imputations done for computational purposes): values below the LoQ but above the LoD were imputed with the LoQ minus 0.1; values below the LoD were imputed with the value of 0 Log IU/mL. HCV RNA levels below the LoD were considered &quot;undetectable&quot;.</description>

          <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the product, was also an AE. For this study, safety parameters or AEs of special interest that were identified a priori included serious rash, anemia (anemia plus haemoglobin decreased), neutropenia (neutropenia plus neutrophil count decreased), bilirubin increased and gastrointestinal adverse experiences (vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea). The percentage of participants with ≥1 specific AEs were reported along with corresponding 95% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence intervals for each treatment regimen.</description>
