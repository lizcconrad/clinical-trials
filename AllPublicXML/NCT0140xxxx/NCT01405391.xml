      Phase I Study of PM01183 in Non-Colorectal (non-CRC) Cancer Patients to determine the
      recommended dose (RD) of PM01183, to characterize the safety profile, compliance and
      feasibility of the schedule, to optimize and individualize PM01183 dosing in non-CRC patients
      according to individual tolerance, to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the schedule,
      to obtain preliminary information on the clinical antitumor activity and to perform an
      exploratory pharmacogenomics (PGx) analysis.

    <description>Patients will receive PM01183 on Days 1 and 8 q3wk (three weeks = one treatment cycle) as an i.v. infusion, starting at 3.0 mg/day, flat dose (FD), over a minimum total volume of 100 ml dilution (on 5% glucose or 0.9% sodium chloride) via a central catheter or over a minimum total volume of 250 ml via a peripheral line, over one hour (at a fixed rate) and through a pump device.</description>

    <description>PM01183 drug product (DP) is presented as a lyophilized powder for concentrate for solution for infusion with two strengths, 1 mg and 4 mg vials. Before use, the 1 mg and 4 mg vials should be reconstituted with 2 ml and 8 ml of water for injection respectively, to give a solution containing 0.5 mg/ml PM01183. For administration to patients as an i.v. infusion, reconstituted vials are diluted with glucose 50 mg/ml (5%) solution for infusion or sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion.</description>
