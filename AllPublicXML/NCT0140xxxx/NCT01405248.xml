      The purpose of this study is to determine whether butylphthalide are effective for Preventing
      Restenosis after Intracranial and Extracranial Artery Stenting

    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is a significant cause of death, most of the patients is caused by
      atherosclerosis,current treatments include internal medicine medications, interventional
      treatment and so on,among them, the interventional therapy can make narrow blood vessels
      blood recovery fastly,and for its small trauma,Gradually accepted by psychiatrist, But stents
      are easy to narrow has been plagued by everybody ,At present, prevent restenosis stent is
      mainly of antiplatelet therapy,But,prevention effect is not obvious often easy to appear
      harmful response,how to effectively reduce postoperative restenosis, become the majority
      concern of patients and doctors .Clinical trials showed that, butylbenzene can promote the
      function of ischemic stroke recovery patients. Animal pharmacodynamics study suggests that
      this product can block the ischemic stroke of brain damage caused by DuoGe pathological link,
      with strong against ischemic and brain protection, especially can obviously increase in small
      brains ischemia ATP and phosphoric acid creatine level, decrease local cerebral ischemia in
      rats, reduce infarct size, cerebral edema improved energy metabolism and brain ischemia of
      microcirculation and blood flow in the brain, restrain the nerve cell apoptosis, and has the
      cerebral thrombosis and anti-platelet aggregation function. Research shows that, butylbenzene
      phthalocyanine influence through arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, selective inhibition and
      their metabolites from DuoZhong mediated pathophysiological events, can remove microvascular
      spasms. Inhibit platelet aggregation, restrain TXA2 synthesis, scavenging free radicals,
      thereby through many ways, many link blocking caused by cerebral ischemia the pathophysiology
      of development process. These mechanisms may make butylbenzene in preventing phthalocyanine
      intracranial carotid stenting noted restenosis and related ischemia of events play an
      important role.

    <description>Stenosis detected by DSA(digital subtraction angiography), CTA(CT angiography) or MRA(MR angiography) was measured according to NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) method.Concretely, NASCET stenosis is calculated from the ratio of the linear luminal diameter of the narrowest segment of the diseased portion of the artery to the diameter of the artery beyond any poststenotic dilatation: NASCET = (1-md/C)Ã—100%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>NIHSS, mRS</measure>
    <time_frame>at one year</time_frame>
    <description>NIHSS and mRS are widely used stroke deficit assessment tools. Most clinical stroke-related trials require a baseline and outcome severity assessment. The baseline of mRS is rank 0, NIHSS 0; the severity of mRS is 6, NIHSS 42. AS many patients have one or more strokes before they perform stening, this study selected NIHSS and mRS as the supplementary materials to estimate the stroke deficit of patients and to reflect the therapeutic effect and safety of stening and butylphthalide therapy.</description>
