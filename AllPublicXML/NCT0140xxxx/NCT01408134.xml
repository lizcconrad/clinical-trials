    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is twofold:

        1. To define inter-reader variability of myocardial viability imaging within the first pass
           and delayed enhancement cardiac CT perfusion imaging

        2. To evaluate DE CT image quality using a consensus DECT protocol

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of myocardial scar using radionuclide or magnetic resonance imaging techniques
      indicates myocardial segments with a reduced likelihood of functional recovery following
      myocardial revascularization. Preliminary evidence suggests that multi-detector CT (MDCT)
      angiography also can detect irreversible myocardial scarring through the detection of regions
      of delayed hyperenhancement (DE) of the myocardium.1-4 However, existing studies have been
      performed in single centers, and the reproducibility, and impact of this modality on recovery
      of myocardial function is unknown. In this study, the investigators propose a single-center
      trial using a standardized MDCT DE protocol among patients scheduled for clinical cardiac CT
      with planned reoperative surgical. The primary endpoint will be characteristics of DE imaging
      of the myocardium including its inter-reader variability and factors associated with image
      quality. These findings will further our understanding of the role of DE MDCT for the
      detection of myocardial viability.

    <description>To define inter-reader variability of myocardial viability imaging within the first pass and delayed enhancement cardiac CT perfusion imaging, specifically:
Per myocardial segment binary visual estimation of the presence/absence of contrast enhancement on either a first pass or 10-minute delayed CT scan.
Myocardial enhancement (hyper and hypo-enhancement) will be evaluated using a binary assessment for estimation of the involved myocardial segments on delayed images. Regional wall motion will be assessed qualitatively using a 4 point scale: normal, hypokinetic, akinetic, dyskinetic.</description>
