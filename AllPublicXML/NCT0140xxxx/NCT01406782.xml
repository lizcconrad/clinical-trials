      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors predict how well patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research study is studying DNA isolated from blood samples to see how well it
      influences response to rituximab in patients with follicular lymphoma treated on clinical
      trial ECOG-E4402.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To test the influence of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and human lymphocyte
           antigen (HLA) genotype on response to anti-CD20 antibody lymphoma immunotherapy.

      OUTLINE: DNA samples are analyzed for killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and human
      lymphocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping with sequence-specific primers (SSP) by real-time PCR.
      KIR and HLA typing are analyzed according to KIR-HLA matched vs mismatched, KIR B haplotype
      content, and the number of inhibitory KIR-HLA pairs. Results are then correlated to each
      patient's overall response and duration of response to rituximab.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Patients diagnosed with follicular lymphoma enrolled on ECOG-E4402

               -  Treated with single-agent rituximab; the trial compared two different
                  rituximab-dosing strategies - maintenance vs retreatment as needed

          -  Available germline DNA samples isolated from peripheral blood as well as clinical
             evaluation of disease status prior to and at initial response to the therapy

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Not specified
