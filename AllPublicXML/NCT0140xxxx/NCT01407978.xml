  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind, reference drug controlled study to assess safety and tolerability of
      FLUVAL P H1N1 monovalent influenza vaccine (whole virus, inactivated, adjuvanted with alumn
      phosphate gel) containing 6 mcgHA per 0.5mL active ingredient in children and adolescents. To
      assess, as secondary objective, the efficacy (immunogenicity) of the vaccine by serology
      testing.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess tolerability/safety (incidence of adverse events 21-28 days following
           vaccination) of the study drug.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the efficacy (immunogenicity) of the study drug by serology testing of blood
           samples taken at Day 21‑28 after immunization in groups and age groups.

        -  To assess long term (180-210 days following vaccination) tolerability/safety (incidence
           of adverse events) of the study drug.

             pregnancy test prior to vaccination who agrees to use an acceptable contraception
             method (includes implants, injectibles, combined oral contraceptives, effective

          -  History of Guillain-Barré syndrome;

          -  Active neoplasm (i.e. requiring any form of anti-neoplastic therapy);

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy in the preceding 36 months;

          -  Concomitant corticosteroid therapy, including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (local
             corticosteroid or corticosteroid nasal spray are permitted);

          -  Immunoglobulin (or similar blood product) therapy within 3 months prior to
             vaccination;

          -  Documented HIV, HBV or HCV infection;

          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the
             evaluation of the immunoresponse;

          -  Acute febrile respiratory illness within one week prior to vaccination;

          -  Vaccine therapy within 4 weeks prior to vaccination;

          -  Influenza vaccination within 6 months prior to vaccination;

          -  Experimental drug therapy within 1 month prior to vaccination;

          -  Past or current psychiatric disease of the volunteer or the legitimate representative
             that upon judgement of the investigator may have effect on the objective
             decision-making of the volunteer or the legitimate representative;

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse of the participant or the legitimate representative.
