  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of siltuximab in patients with
      multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter (study
      conducted in multiple sites), non-randomized (patients are not assigned by chance to
      treatment groups), Phase 2b study. Up to 75 patients with MCD will be eligible for the study,
      the majority of whom will be on active therapy with siltuximab at the time of enrollment.
      Patients will be either siltuximab-naive or have not progressed on siltuximab in the opinion
      of the investigator. Duration of disease control and survival will be assessed. Data
      collection for patients who discontinue treatment will be limited to survival, occurrence of
      malignancies, and subsequent therapies for MCD, which will be assessed twice per year until
      the patient has been lost to follow up or has withdrawn consent for the study, whichever
      occurs first. An interim analysis will be conducted (no later than 2 years after the start of
      enrollment) to further evaluate the benefit and safety of long-term treatment with siltuximab
      in patients with MCD. A data will occur at 6 years after the start of enrollment and for
      those patients remaining on treatment after the data cutoff, data collection will be limited
      to pregnancies and serious adverse events (SAEs), including information on study agent
      administration and concomitant medications associated with an SAE. Safety evaluations for
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical examination will be
      performed throughout the study. The end of study is the date of the last assessment for the
      last patient.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Previously Responding Participants Who Maintained Disease Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants maintaining disease control (defined as stable or better response) was defined as the percentage of previously responding participants who had not progressed during the long-term safety extension based on investigator assessment. A worsening in any of the measures will be considered as a progression of the disease.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Siltuximab-naive Participants Who Experienced Disease Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants experiencing disease control was defined as the percentage of siltuximab-naïve participants who had stable or better response during the long-term safety extension based on investigator's judgment. Disease control was defined as stable or better response assessed by the investigators.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Disease Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of disease control (DODC) was defined as the time from the first siltuximab administration in this study to disease progression as assessed by the investigator. Disease control was defined as stable or better response assessed by the investigators. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the duration of disease control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time between the first study siltuximab administration and death due to any cause. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the overall survival.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Positive for Antibodies to Siltuximab</measure>
