      This is a Hungarian, Multicentre, Observational Study to study Adherence and Long Term
      Outcomes of Therapy in paediatric subjects using easypod™ electromechanical device for growth
      hormone treatment to assess the level of adherence of subject receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in a multicenter longitudinal observational study. Parents/subjects
      will provide their Informed Consent/assent to upload their data for population-based analyses
      and, ultimately, clinical outcomes. Adherence data will be primarily derived from the
      easypod™ device combined with physician data entry of outcome measures. Data will be
      collected retrospectively and prospectively. This will allow the establishment of adherence
      profiles and subsequent clinical outcomes. Collected data will be also analyzed in a
      multinational pooled analysis of comparable national studies.

      Primary Objective:

      • To assess the level of adherence of subjects receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To identify adherence subject profiling

        -  To describe the impact of adherence on clinical outcomes for subject receiving SAIZEN®
           via easypod™

        -  To asses the impact of adherence on Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) (i.e. above,
           below or within normal ranges)
