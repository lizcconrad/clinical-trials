      Study Population Phu Wieng district, Khon Kaen Province was chose to be a represent of rural
      community in Thailand. 551 subjects were desired to cover 80% sensitivity of the original
      test, at 95% confidence level, 80% power, and 7% margin of error. Regarding to 22.7% of the
      estimated prevalence of hearing loss and 10% drop out rate, then the total subjects need was
      606 persons. Subjects were divided to recruit from simple random villages, one from the
      municipal and the other from non-municipal area. All people in target villages whether having
      ear problem or not, who was older than 18 years old, could read or understand Thai language,
      and wanted to participate, were persuaded. Those who had aphasia, or severe mental
      disability, or other conditions that could not perform audiometry were excluded.

      Study Procedure After consenting to participate, subjects were interviewed with Thai-FMHT.
      Then the subjects were undergone the audiometry in the soundproof booth performed by
      audiologists who were blinded the result of Thai-FMHT. Pure tone threshold at 250, 500, 1000,
      2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000 Hz of both ears were recorded. Tympanogram was done to confirm
      middle ear pathology. Any pure tone air-conduction threshold greater than 25 dB in one or two
      frequencies was considered as abnormal hearing. However, the severity of hearing loss was
      defined by pure tone average air-conduction threshold according to ASHA criteria. To compare
      with the original FMHT, the pure tone average air-conduction threshold at 500, 1000, and 2000
      Hz was defined as speech PTA (SF-PTA), whereas, the pure tone average air-conduction
      threshold at 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000 Hz was defined as high frequency PTA (HF-PTA). Hearing
      disability was classified according to the hearing level of the better hearing ear.

      Otolaryngologists did history taking. Ear symptoms such as otalgia, itching, otorrhea,
      tinnitus, and hearing loss was asked before performing otoscopy and making a final diagnosis.
      The treatment, or medication if needed, and advice were complementary provided to subjects as
      post-trial benefits.

      Statistical analysis Descriptive analysis was used to present demographic data. The
      sensitivity, specificity, and ROC were analyzed using STATA software version 10.

    <description>Hearing loss is defined as an elevation, at least more than 25 dB of air-conduction, pure tone average threshold at speech frequencies. The severity loss is categorized into mild (26-40 dB), moderate (41-55 dB), moderately severe (56-74 dB), severe (75-90 dB), and profound (&gt;90 dB). In this study, we aim to use FMHT as a screening tool for hearing disability (Better hearing ear has hearing threshold greater than 40 dB).</description>

          <description>The Phu Wieng district in Khon Kaen Province was chosen as a representative rural community in Thailand. This district comprises 114 villages and has a population of 24,201 inhabitants. Of these, 13,001 inhabitants lived in municipal areas, whereas the rest lived in non-municipal areas. The subjects were recruited from different target villages. The villages had been divided according to their municipality. The target villages were simply randomly selected from a list of villages that have more than 300 adults in their populations. One village was from a municipal area and the other village was from a non-municipal area. All of the people in the target villages, who were older than 18 years, could read or understand the Thai language, and wanted to participate, were recruited. Those who had aphasia, severe mental disability, or other conditions that precluded audiometry were excluded.</description>

        <description>FMHT has 15 questions and there are 4 possible answer for each question. The best possible answer is &quot;never&quot; and is scored &quot;0&quot;, &quot;occasionally&quot; is scored &quot;1&quot;, &quot;half the time&quot; is scored &quot;2&quot; and &quot;almost always&quot; the worst answer is scored &quot;3&quot;. The total possible range for the FMHT scores 0-45. We then compared the total score with the better hearing ears as in Outcome measure 1. The total number of participants with a score from 0 to 45, and that all participants in the study had a score within this range. It would appear, from information provided in the previous version of this record, that the total score might range from 0 to 45.</description>

        <title>Standard Hearing Test</title>
        <description>Hearing loss is defined as an elevation, at least more than 25 dB of air-conduction, pure tone average threshold at speech frequencies. The severity loss is categorized into mild (26-40 dB), moderate (41-55 dB), moderately severe (56-74 dB), severe (75-90 dB), and profound (&gt;90 dB). In this study, we aim to use FMHT as a screening tool for hearing disability (Better hearing ear has hearing threshold greater than 40 dB).</description>

            <description>The severity of hearing loss was defined by the pure tone average air-conduction threshold at the speech frequencies of the better hearing ears, according to the ASHA criteria. Normal hearing means PTA of less than or equal 25 dB. Mild hearing loss means PTA of 26-40 dB. Moderate hearing loss means PTA of 41-55 dB. Moderately severe hearing loss means PTA of 56-74 dB. Severe hearing loss means PTA of 75-90 dB. Profound hearing loss means PTA &gt; 90 dB.</description>
