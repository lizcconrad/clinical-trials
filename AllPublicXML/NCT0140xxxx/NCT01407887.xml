      Title: Efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine combined with methylene blue for
      falciparum malaria treatment in African children: randomised controlled trial.

      Design: Mono-centre, two arms, open randomized controlled study in children with
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso.

      Phase: Phase II.

      Objectives: The primary objective of this trial is to study the efficacy and safety of the
      triple therapy artesunate (AS) - amodiaquine (AQ) - methylene blue (MB) given over three days
      in young children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso compared to the local
      standard three days artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) AS-AQ regimen.

      Population: Children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated falciparum malaria from Nouna
      Hospital in north-western Burkina Faso.

      Sample size: 180 patients (90 per study arm).
