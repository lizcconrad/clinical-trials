  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Active immunotherapy of cancer is based on the premise that the vaccine raises a
      cytotoxic immune response to tumor-associated antigens, thereby destroying malignant cells
      without harming normal cells.

      IMA950 is a therapeutic multi-peptide vaccine containing 11 tumor-associated peptides
      (TUMAPs) found in a majority of glioblastomas, and is designed to activate TUMAP-specific T
      cells. The use of 11 TUMAPs increases the likelihood of a multi-clonal, highly specific
      T-cell response against tumor cells leading to decreased likelihood of immune evasion of the
      tumor by down-regulation of target antigens.

      PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of
      IMA950 when given with cyclophosphamide, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor
      (GM-CSF) and imiquimod in patients with glioblastoma and to determine if IMA950 shows
      sufficient immunogenicity in these patients.

      ELIGIBILITY: Patients with histologically proven GBMs who have completed radiotherapy, and
      have stable disease following at least 4 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to poor accrual. This decision was taken without any safety reasons. Since beginning of the
    study (June 2011) only six patients were enrolled.
