      Introduction: Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as inflammation of the nose and the
      paranasal sinuses. It is a very common disorder increasing in both incidence and prevalence
      with significant impact on quality of life and substantial health care costs. In this study
      we evaluate the prevalence of CRS in Denmark and there is a need for consensus about
      diagnosing this disease. Different questionnaires and different tests used for examination
      are evaluated together with the patients compliance and days lost through illness.

      Methods: As part of Ga2len (Global Asthma and Allergy European Network) a questionnaire on
      CRS was posted to 5000 residents on Funen. From the completed and returned questionnaires
      self reported CRS was evaluated. Respondents were invited for clinical examination including
      spirometry, skin prick test, bloodsample and an ENT examination including nasal endoscopy,
      acoustic rhinometry, peak nasal inspiratory flow and smell test. Questionnaire on quality of
      life (EQ-5D) and symptom severity (SNOT-22) was completed. Medical diagnosed CRS was
      diagnosed according to the definition on CRS stated by EPOS (European Position Paper on
      Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2007). CRS is defined as inflammation in the nose and
      paranasal sinus and should be characterized by two or more symptoms one of which should be
      either nasal blockage/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge, +/- facial pain/pressure,
      +/- reduction or loss of smell. Endoscopic signs should be present and symptoms must have
      been present &gt; 12 weeks. Patients diagnosed with CRS were invited for a 1 year and 2 year
      follow up where examination and questionnaires were repeated and treatment compliance and
      days lost through illness were evaluated.
