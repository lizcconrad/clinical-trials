      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)
      following the administration of iopamidol-370 (Iopamiro-370) and iodixanol-320 (Visipaque
      320) in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing coronary angiography.

      To compare the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)(an absolute SCr increase 0.5
      mg/dL from baseline) following the administration of iopamidol-370 (Iopamiro-370) and
      iodixanol-320 (Visipaque 320) in patients with chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine level
      more than 1.5 mg/dL for men and more than 1.3 mg/dL for women or preprocedural estimated
      glomerular ﬁltration rate(eGFR):15-60 mL/min/1.73 m2) undergoing coronary angiography.

          -  Is planned to undergo major surgery (e.g. CABG, valve surgery, etc.) within 48-72
             hours after contrast administration;

          -  Is planned to receive an intravenous diuretic or mannitol as prophylaxis to prevent
             acute renal injury (Note: chronic administration is allowed);

          -  Is hemodynamically unstable within 48 hours pre-contrast administration defined as a
