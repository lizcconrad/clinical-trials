  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence and intensity of possible pain on
      injection as well as patient satisfaction caused by propofol (a lipid based medication);
      Lusedra (a water based medication); and the drug combination of propofol with lidocaine (a
      local anesthetic commonly used with propofol injection).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) is one of the most common induction and sedative agents used
      today. Properties that make this agent popular include rapid onset and quick recovery.
      However, as its use became more widespread, side effects such as pain on injection have
      attracted more attention. The incidence of pain on propofol injection is as high as 70 - 90%.
      Numerous studies report that more than 50% of patients recall the unpleasant burning
      sensation during injection.

      Many techniques to minimize pain on injection associated with propofol have been described;
      pre-administration of different medications including lidocaine, ketamine, thiopental,
      metoclopramide, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and remifentanil have been reported with mixed
      success. Some have even tried to use lidocaine with a tourniquet. Others have reported the
      use of distraction techniques including counting numbers aloud.

      Recently, a solvent mixture of medium chain triglyceride and long chain triglyceride has been
      tested for prevention of pain on propofol injection. Lusedra (fospropofol disodium), the
      water-soluble prodrug of propofol, does not cause pain on injection as it is water based
      medication. Demonstrating the benefit of fospropofol over propofol in patient satisfaction
      will improve acceptance by anesthesia providers.
