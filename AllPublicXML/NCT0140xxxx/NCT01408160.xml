      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of deglycosylated ricin A
      chain-conjugated anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins when given
      together with cytarabine in treating patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that
      has come back after a period of improvement (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment
      (refractory). Immunotoxins, such as deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated
      anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins, can find certain cancer cells and kill them without harming
      normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or
      by stopping them from spreading. Giving deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated
      anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins with cytarabine may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Combotox (deglycosylated ricin A
      chain-conjugated anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins) when added to high-dose cytarabine during
      salvage therapy for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-lineage acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of this regimen. II. To assess for the presence of a postulated
      CD34+/CD38-/low/CD19+ leukemic stem cell phenotype in the bone marrow at time of relapse and
      to assess its association with treatment outcome.

      III. To determine the development of human mouse or ricin antibodies (human anti-mouse
      antibodies [HAMA]/human anti-ricin antibodies [HARA]).

      IV. To determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Combotox. V. To evaluate the value of
      fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) as early marker of toxicity.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated
      anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins.

      Patients receive high-dose cytarabine intravenously (IV) over 2-3 hours every 12 hours on
      days 1-3 and deglycosylated ricin A chain-conjugated anti-CD19/anti-CD22 immunotoxins IV over
      4 hours on days 8, 10, and 12. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.

The change in percentage expression from pre-treatment to post-treatment for cycle 1 only will be correlated with the response achieved. Response to treatment is defined as either complete or partial remission.

    <measure>Change in fractional excretion of urinary sodium (FeNa)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to up to day 12</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in the FeNa will be correlated to the development of grade 3 or greater vascular leak syndrome (VLS). VLS will be dichotomized into absent or mild (grade 0-2) versus moderate to severe (3-5). Changes in FeNa from baseline to day 8, 10 and 12 will be calculated as percent change at each time point. Associations will be tested for in a logistic regression model using presence of moderate or severe VLS as outcome as well as in a linear regression model using the grading of VLS as an ordinal variable. Both models will be adjusted for the use of diuretics and intravenous fluids.</description>
