  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to show that, in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy,
      brain damage, assessed by the determination of S100B before removing the clamp, is less
      severe with a balanced anesthesia consisting of remifentanil combined with Xenon
      (experimental arm) compared with remifentanil anesthesia associated with propofol (reference
      arm).
