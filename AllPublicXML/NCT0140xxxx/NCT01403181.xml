  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of HCV-specific T cell responses in patients treated with boceprevir to assess
      whether therapy can induce restoration of the T cell function and to what extent this
      recovery can be achieved

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reconstitution of the antiviral T cell function may represent a component of the anti-viral
      effect of protease inhibitors. If T cell responsiveness is restored under therapy,
      potentiation of anti-viral T cell functions by exogenous T cell stimulation might be
      exploited to complement and to further improve response to available therapies. Monitoring
      the T cell function might also be useful to predict more accurately response to therapy.

      To address these issues, phenotype and function of HCV-specific T cells will be analyzed
      longitudinally before, during and after therapy in naïve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C
      patients treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin or with peginterferon and ribavirin plus
      boceprevir. To analyze the global CD4 and CD8 reactivity against all structural and
      non-structural HCV proteins a wide panel of peptides corresponding to the whole HCV genome of
      genotype 1 will be employed. To further analyze CD8 reactivity, HLA-A2/peptide tetramers will
      be used in HLA-A2 positive patients to directly quantify ex vivo HCV-specific CD8 cells
      circulating in the peripheral blood.The T cell function will be analyzed as capacity of
      expansion in vitro, cytokine production and cytotoxicity.

    <description>In the experimental arm boceprevir (800 mg orally three times daily), PEG-IFN and ribavirin will be given for 24 weeks after the lead-in; the patients who will have undetectable HCV-RNA at week 8 will stop treatment at week 28; those who will be HCV-RNA positive at any visit between week 8 and 24 will receive an additional 20 weeks of PEG + RBV. Treatment will be discontinued if HCV-RNA is positive at week 24.
Immunological analysis will be performed longitudinally at the following time points: week -4, 0, 4 (end of lead-in), 8, 12, 24, 48, week 24 of follow-up. HCV-RNA will be quantified at the same time points and viremia will be correlated with immunological data.</description>
