    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that the use of Contact Therapy™ Cool Path™ ablation catheter in conjunction
      with the EnSite Velocity Contact Technology for the treatment of typical atrial flutter

        -  Does not result into unacceptable risk of intra-procedural composite serious adverse
           events and,

        -  Does not affect efficacy of the ablation procedure The study will also evaluate the

      This will be a prospective, multi-center and non-randomized study. All enrolled patients who
      meet the eligibility criteria will receive ablation therapy for typical atrial flutter using
      the Contact Therapy™ Cool Path™ Cardiac Ablation System. Historical data from published (PMA
      P060019 Cool Path) , reported (IDE G090109 Cool Path Duo) and published literature on Atrial
      Flutter RF ablation studies is used to determine performance goals for primary study
      endpoints and derive the sample size. In addition, the following analyses will be performed
      in the study

        1. Validation of ECI against conventional methods of assessing tip tissue contact and

        2. Ancillary analysis to assess the relationship between the ECI and study outcomes.
           Subjects will undergo two follow up visits at day 10 and month 3 post procedure. The
           following assessments will be performed during these visits:

             -  ECG

             -  Query regarding adverse events since the last visit

             -  Assessment of anti-arrhythmic and anti-coagulation medication

             -  Query regarding recurrence or repeat ablation for typical atrial flutter

    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Primary safety is defined as the incidence of composite, serious adverse events within 7 days post-procedure, regardless of whether a determination can be made regarding device relatedness.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Primary efficacy or Acute success is defined as achievement of bidirectional block in the cavo-tricuspid isthmus and non-inducibility of typical atrial flutter at least 30 minutes following the last RF ablation with the investigational system.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary efficacy / Chronic success is defined as freedom from recurrence of typical atrial flutter 3 months post ablation. Flutter recurrence will be documented on an ECG (or similar such as Holter, telemetry, rhythm strips, etc.). Repeat ablations, new antiarrhythmia medication (Class Ia, Ic, or III) or increase in the dosage of existing anti-arrhythmic medication (Class 1a,
1c, III) during the 3 months post ablation are considered chronic failures.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A signed written Informed Consent

          -  Presence of typical atrial flutter (cavo-tricuspid isthmus dependent)

          -  If subjects are receiving antiarrhythmic drug therapy (Class I or Class III AAD) for
             an arrhythmia other than typical atrial flutter, then they need to be controlled on
             their medication for at least 3 months. If a subject had typical atrial flutter before
             starting the AAD(s) (Class I or Class III) and then subsequently had another
             arrhythmia (i.e. atrial fibrillation), then the 3 month AAD criteria will not apply.

          -  One documented occurrence of the study arrhythmia documented by ECG, Holter, telemetry
             strip, or transtelephonic monitor within the past 6 months

          -  In good physical health

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Agree to comply with follow-up visits and evaluation

          -  Prior typical atrial flutter ablation treatment

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Atypical flutter or scar flutter (non isthmus dependent)

          -  Significant coronary heart disease or heart failure; that is unstable angina pectoris
             and/or uncontrolled congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) at the time of

          -  A recent myocardial infarction within 3 months of the intended procedure date

          -  Permanent coronary sinus pacing lead

          -  Clinically significant tricuspid valvular disease requiring surgery and/or a
             prosthetic tricuspid heart valve.

          -  Evidence of intracardiac thrombus or a history of clotting disorders

          -  Participation in another investigational study
