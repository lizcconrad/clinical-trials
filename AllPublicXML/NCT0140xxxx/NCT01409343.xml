    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, multicenter study evaluating the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of TrasGEX™ after intravenous administration in patients with HER-2 positive
      cancers. The effect of TrasGEX™ on the development of anti-drug antibodies and on tumour
      response will also be evaluated.

    <description>The primary objective of this first-in-man study is to determine the optimal dose and regimen of TrasGEX™ in patients with locally advanced or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive cancer. The recommended phase II dose needs to have an acceptable safety profile and provides evidence for efficacy based on clinical observations or the pharmacokinetic profile.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine preliminary evidence of activity</measure>
    <time_frame>approx. every 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CT or MRI imaging will be performed. Assessment of tumor response (SD, PR, CR. PD) will be performed following a modified version of the revised RECIST guidelines, version 1.1. Basically, patients will receive treatment with TrasGEX™ until progression of disease and/or unacceptable toxicities are observed.</description>
