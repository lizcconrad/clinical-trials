      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is assess the effect of a psychological based
      treatment model on eating behaviors and motivation for lifestyle changes in morbidly obese
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

      Hypothesis: As compared with usual care, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Motivational
      interviewing-based (CBT/MI) intervention program will reduce dysfunctional eating behaviors
      and increase pre-surgical intrinsic motivation for lifestyle changes.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is usually treated as a medical disease, prescribing interventions which adhere to
      the theoretically sound principles.The prevalence of obesity is increasing, and, accordingly,
      an increasing number of morbidly obese patients are eligible for Bariatric Surgery. This
      surgical procedure is highly effective and is often followed by resolution or remission of
      obesity related comorbidities (e.g. diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea). However, some
      individuals may have psychological and motivational problems that reduce these beneficial
      effects. Bariatric surgery represents a substantial part of total health care costs, and such
      costs may increase in the future. Another issue is that it is important to prevent
      post-surgical relapses. Hence, there is every reason to increase the effect and efficacy of
      both conservative treatments and bariatric surgery.

      Clinically the investigators meet patients who regain their weight post-surgically, and the
      investigators have some experience that these patients may display more dysfunctional eating
      than those who are able to maintain a lower target weight. Given the expected outcome of the
      RCT, the autonomous motivation for lifestyle changes will be increased. Lowering
      dysfunctional eating, as well as increasing the probability of better success in preoperative
      weight loss, may help the patient to maintain a healthier weight after the surgical
      procedure. Moreover, developing a more tailored intervention for surgery patients may enable
      new evidence based treatments to be established for these patients.

    <description>Eating behaviors: We will assess emotional eating, uncontrolled eating and cognitive restraint. The aim of the trial is to reduce emotional- and uncontrolled eating behavior.
Primary outcomes will be scored on the subscales &quot;emotional eating&quot; and &quot;uncontrolled eating&quot; on the TFEQ-R21. The predetermined criterion for clinically important improvement at 12 weeks will be a decrease of 15% from baseline on the emotional eating and uncontrolled eating subscale (range 0 to 100)</description>
