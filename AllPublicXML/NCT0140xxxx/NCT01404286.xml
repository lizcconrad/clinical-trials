      Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of a session of resistance
      training on the sleep patterns of elderly people.

      Methods: Forty men aged 65 to 80 years, sedentary and clinically healthy were divided into
      two groups: the control group (n=18) and the resistance group (n=22). Both groups underwent
      two polysomnography tests, one at baseline and another after either a resistance training
      session (One Repetition Maximum - Strength Test, resistance group) or without physical
      exercise (control group).

      Upon completion of the baseline polysomnography (PSG), volunteers underwent body composition
      evaluations (total body mass, height and body mass index calculation) to characterize the
      sample. Three familiarization sessions were conducted with the exercise machines used in the
      study, and one repetition maximum test (1 RM) was completed in order to quantify the training
      session load. A PSG test was conducted on the same day of the exercise session for the
      resistance group, and the control group had a second PSG without exercise to compare the
      groups at both times.

      The body composition assessment, the adaptations to the exercises and the training sessions
      were held at the Center for Psychobiology and Exercise Studies.

    <description>After the adaptation sessions, volunteers underwent a session of resistance training at 60% of 1 RM organized as follows: 3 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions on each exercise machine with a 1 minute and 30 second interval between each set and an interval of 2 minutes between each exercise machine, giving a total duration of training between 50 and 60 minutes. The sequence of exercise machines used was alternated by body segment. The sessions were performed at the same time of day (morning) under controlled temperature conditions (24 ± 21C).</description>
