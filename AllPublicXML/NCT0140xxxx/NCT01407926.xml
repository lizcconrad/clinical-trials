      Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and
      effectiveness of a 6-month nurse-led, interprofessional mental health promotion intervention
      aimed at older home care clients with depressive symptoms using personal support services.

      Methods/Design: This one-group pre-test post-test study aims to recruit a total of 250
      long-stay (&gt; 60 days) home care clients, 70 years or older, with depressive symptoms who are
      receiving personal support services through a home care program in Ontario, Canada. The
      nurse-led intervention is a multi-faceted 6-month program led by a Registered Nurse that
      involves regular home visits, monthly case conferences, and evidence-based assessment and
      management of depression using an interprofessional approach. The primary outcome is the
      change in severity of depressive symptoms from baseline to 6 months using the Centre for
      Epidemiological Studies in Depression Scale. Secondary outcomes include changes in the
      prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety, health-related quality of life, cognitive
      function, and the rate and appropriateness of depression treatment from baseline to 12
      months. Changes in the costs of use of health services will be assessed from a societal
      perspective.
