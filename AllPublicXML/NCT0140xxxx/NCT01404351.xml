    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the operative performance of the PEAK
      PlasmaBlade® 4.0 during bilateral breast reduction; to monitor and record post-operative
      pain, adverse events and skin scarring following surgery; and to compare these outcomes to
      the HARMONIC SYNERGY® BLADE.

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the difference in pain between the Harmonic and PlasmaBlade operative sites. The primary efficacy variable will be pain at each treatment arm operative site, as measured by visual analog scale for 24 hours post-operatively and for 10 post-op days twice daily.</description>
