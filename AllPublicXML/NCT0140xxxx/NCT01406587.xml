  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PP4001 is a medication not yet approved by the US FDA. This is a phase 2, multi-center,
      randomized, double-blind study of 3 doses of PP4001 versus placebo in the treatment of
      symptoms associated with uncomplicated urinary tract infection. After the screening, patients
      are randomized to receive one of three doses of PP4001 or placebo. Patients are screened and
      randomized on the same day, and take 4 doses of study drug, one dose every 12 hours. Data
      about uncomplicated urinary tract infection symptoms are collected from the subjects on
      electronic handheld devices throughout the 48-hour study period. The primary endpoint is
      burning during urination.

             pregnant or nursing and employ appropriate methods of contraceptives for the duration
             of the trial. Medically acceptable forms of contraception include abstinence, oral
             contraceptives, intra-uterine devices, injectable hormonals, intra-vaginal rings, or
             double-barrier methods (condom plus spermicide), for at least 1 month prior to
             treatment. Subjects in a monogamous, long term relationship with a partner who has had
             a vasectomy at least 3 months prior to screening are also study eligible.

             screening.

          -  A negative urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

          -  If subject has a chronic, clinically stable disease that requires medication,

             screening.

          -  Ability to perform study procedures, including the completion of electronic diary
             assessments, and supply the necessary information to the study personnel as required
             by the protocol.

             study has been fully explained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant medical history or a clinically significant abnormal finding on
             the physical exam, vital signs or ECG at screening, including serious acute illness
             (e.g. pneumonia), gastrointestinal illness that would interfere with study drug
             absorption, or an untreated or unstable medical illness that would likely interfere
             with the study assessments.

          -  At risk in terms of the precautions, warnings, and contraindications in the package
             insert for phenazopyridine hydrochloride including:
