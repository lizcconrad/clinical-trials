  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ISTO Technologies, Inc. is proposing a clinical study with 225 subjects, to establish the
      safety and efficacy of the Neocartilage Implant for the treatment of ICRS Grade 3 and 4
      articular cartilage lesions of the knee compared to microfracture treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States alone, more than 500,000 cartilage lesions per year require some
      treatment to reduce pain, restore joint mobility, and prevent further damage caused by the
      progression of osteoarthritis. The lack of effective cartilage repair approaches or products
      for restoration of defective articular cartilage to its native, hyaline morphology only
      continues to exacerbate the incidence of osteoarthritis as these initial defects enlarge and
      degrade over a 10 to 20 year period. The repair of cartilage, especially in the knee, remains
      a formidable clinical challenge. Regenerative medicine approaches to cartilage repair have
      only begun to be explored as possible options and there is a clear trend toward biological
      solutions for the repair and regeneration of damaged or diseased articular cartilage. The
      study was designed to compare how well the Neocartilage Implant works against the
      microfracture therapy, a widely used and accepted cartilage repair therapy. Data to be
      collected include Pain and Function in Daily Living scores, symptoms, Function in Sports and
      Recreation, and Knee Related Quality of Life. Additionally, MRI and X-rays will be collected
      to evaluate the cartilage repair progress. These assessments will be used through the five
      years of post-operative follow-up.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Generally, the following inclusion criteria must be met, however, this is not a complete
        list.

          -  Male or Female between the ages of 18 and 60

          -  (1) or (2) articular cartilage lesions of the distal femur ranging in no more than 5
             cm2 each

          -  Ipsilateral knee compartment has intact menisci (or meniscectomized remnant with &gt; 5mm
             wide rim) and stable ligaments in the affected knee

          -  3 months out from initiation of conservative non-surgical management (e.g.hyaluronic
             acid injection, activity modification) or previous minimal surgical intervention
             (e.g., arthroscopic lavage, debridement) or 12 months out from marrow stimulation for
             this condition

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Generally, if a potential participant meets any of the following criterions, they will not
        be eligible for this study. Additionally, more criteria will be evaluated to confirm
        eligibility as this list is not a complete list of criteria.
