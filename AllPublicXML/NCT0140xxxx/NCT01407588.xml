    <description>If the patient have had recurrence or not of atrial fibrillation after ablation. An implanted arrhythmia loop recorder (Reveal XT) is used for monitoring. Recurrence is defined as an attack of atrial fibrillation of more than 2 minutes. It will also be specified if the patient is referred for a second ablation procedure.</description>
