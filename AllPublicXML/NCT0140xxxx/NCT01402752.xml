  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the reproducibility of a method of
      measuring blood flow rates to the tracheo-bronchial mucosa using diluted dimethyl ether as a
      tracer.

    <measure>The reproducibility of two measures of Qaw at a five minute interval</measure>
    <time_frame>Five minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Qaw is the blood flow measured in the tracheobronchial mucosa. Qaw = VDME/(FDME*alpha*10s) where VDME is the volume of dimethyl-ether exhaled (ml), FDME is the mean concentration of dimethyl-ether (%), alpha is the Bunsen coefficient for the dissolution of dimethyl ether in tissues and blood at 37°C (i.e. 9ml/ml).</description>
