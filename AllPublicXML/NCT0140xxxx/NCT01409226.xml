      This study is to find out if 3.0 Tesla (3.0-T) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will improve
      in diagnosing breast cancer in women with high-risk of breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Life time risk of developing breast cancer is greatly elevated in women with familial breast
      cancer, especially in BRCA carriers. Prevention and early detection strategies in these high
      risk women include risk reducing surgery, chemoprevention and close surveillance with
      semiannual clinical breast exams and yearly mammograms starting at age 25-35. Unfortunately,
      screening mammography detects only half the breast cancers in mutation carriers, presumably
      due to higher breast density in the younger women and perhaps due to inherent characteristics
      of their tumors such as rapid growth. In light of these limitations in this high risk group,
      some have suggested incorporation of semiannual mammograms and/or other imaging modalities
      such as ultrasound (US) and MRI.

      In this study, high risk women who have a suspicious mammographic lesion - categorized as
      Breast Imaging Reporting and data System (BI-RADS) 4 will be recruited to undergo a breast
      MRI before to a biopsy of the suspicious abnormality. All women will undergo a biopsy as a
      part of her standard of care. The results of the MRI will not influence our decision on
      whether a biopsy should be performed. The MRI results will be compared with the biopsy
      results with pathology as the gold standard.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women at high risk of developing breast cancer as outlined by the American Cancer
             society (ACS): women with known predisposing mutations (in BRCA1, 2 or PTEN genes),
             women with first degree relative who is a known carrier or has a 20% or more life time
             risk of breast cancer.

          -  The above high-risk women with a suspicious lesion classified as BIRADS 4 that is
             detected on mammography. Since the spatial resolution of 3.0-T breast MRI is similar
             to digital mammography, there is no limitation to the size of the mammographic lesion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or lactating women

          -  Contraindications for MRI:

               1. electrical implants (e.g. cardiac pacemakers or perfusion pumps)

               2. ferromagnetic implants such as aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses,
                  artificial hearts, valves with steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos
                  near the eye, or steel implants

               3. pre-existing medical conditions including a likelihood of developing seizures or
                  claustrophobic reactions, and any greater than normal potential for cardiac
                  arrest

               4. weight over 350 lbs

          -  Although a women meets our criteria for high risks for breast cancer and has an
             abnormal mammogram, she will be excluded from our study if her insurer does not
             provide payment for the breast MRI. The suspicious lesion will be biopsied under
             mammographic guidance as part of her standard of care. The third party carriers have
             been reimbursing payment for a breast MRI in these high risk women, especially after
             the ACS guidelines were released in 2007. Therefore, this outcome is unlikely to
             occur.
