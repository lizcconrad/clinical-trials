      The German Treatment Program for Children with Aggressive Behaviour (Therapieprogramm für
      Kinder mit aggressivem Verhalten, THAV) aims at the therapy of children aged 6 to 12 years
      with peer-related aggressive behaviour, which results in a persistent impairment of the
      relationships to other children. Contrary to other treatment approaches, this intervention
      aims at the individual treatment of problem maintaining and moderating factors of aggressive
      behaviour. Depending on the individual problem maintaining factors the treatment aims to
      modify social cognitive information processing, impulse control, social problem solving,
      social skills and social interactions. Methods: The efficacy will be tested in a partial
      randomized control group design with n=100 children. N=60 children will be treated for about
      half a year with the modules of THAV in weekly sessions. The control group of n=40 children
      will receive alternative interventions with group play and techniques to activate resources
      of the child. These interventions give the children the opportunity to train pro-social
      interactions. Outcome parameters are aggressive behaviour und comorbid symptoms as well as
      problem maintaining factors, psychosocial functioning, family burden and treatment
      satisfaction. Moreover, variables of the treatment process are assessed. Questionnaires,
      tests and individual problem checklist were used to assess these outcome and process
      parameters
