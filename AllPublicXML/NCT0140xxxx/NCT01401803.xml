  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide data to assess Dysport™ injections as a treatment
      therapy for brow ptosis. This study will assess the outcome of brow lifting with use of
      Dysport.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common reasons that patients present to both dermatologists and plastic
      surgeons is for brow and lid ptosis. Although some patients that present for these entities
      require surgery, most will decline to have surgical intervention. Alternative treatments
      include brow lifting with botulinum toxins.

      Brow lifting with botulinum toxins may be performed by injecting the muscles responsible for
      brow and lid depression. These muscles include: the corrugators, procerus, medical aspect of
      the frontalis and the depressor component of the orbicularis oculi muscles. By relaxing these
      muscles, the brow elevators may be able to lift the brow and help both brow and lid ptosis.
      This trial is unique as it utilizes Dysport to treat an entire anatomic muscle group (the
      brow depressors) rather than injecting isolated muscles._

    <description>Patients entering will be based on gender and assessment of the glabella region (including the corrugators, procerus, and medial frontalis muscles). Muscle mass will be graded separately for males and females as +, ++, or+++ (light/small, moderate/medium, or heavy/large). Male patients will receive 0.3 mL to 0.4 mL (60, 70, or 80 units) in five equally divided doses of Dysport™ and female patients will receive 0.25 mL to 0.35 mL (50, 60 or 70 units) in equally divided doses of Dysport™ at 5 designated injection sites in the glabellar region. On (Day0) patients will be treated with Dysport™ 10 to 20 units bilaterally to the depressor component of the orbicularis. The dosing for patients will be based on assessment of orbicularis muscle mass. Patients will receive .05 mL to 0.1 mL (10 or 20 units) in two equally divided doses of Dysport™. Muscle mass will not be graded based upon gender for this region.</description>

          -  postmenopausal for &gt;12 months prior to study drug administration;

          -  without a uterus and/or both ovaries; or
