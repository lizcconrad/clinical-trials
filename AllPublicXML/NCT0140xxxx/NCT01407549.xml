  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic pain is a common condition in the general population, causing great
      suffering in both physical and mental aspects. Previous research shows that mindfulness based
      interventions help chronic pain patients to cope better with their pain, and improve their
      quality of life. Although evidence support the efficacy of mindfulness based interventions
      for chronic pain, it is still unclear whether this efficacy involves a direct influence on
      sensory aspects of pain perception. Further more, the mechanisms of change responsible for
      the improved life quality and the possible moderating factors that may influence treatment
      efficacy, are still unknown.

      Aim: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness based intervention
      on pain perception and quality of life in individuals suffering from chronic pain. The
      investigators will also evaluate potential mechanisms responsible for the change following
      mindfulness practice. Finally the investigators will examine the role of personal
      characteristics as potential moderating factors of mindfulness effect.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that 1) compared to a waitlist control group,
      chronic pain patients participating in a full mindfulness based program will report greater
      improvements in a) pain severity, b) quality of life and psychological symptoms, and c) will
      demonstrate changes in physiological characteristics of pain. 2) Changes following the
      mindfulness based program will be mediated by change in pain catastrophizing, self regulation
      capacity and pain acceptance. 3) The investigators hypothesize that gender, baseline
      mindfulness, and anxiety sensitivity will moderate the efficacy of the mindfulness based
      program.

      Method: A randomized controlled design will be used to evaluate the efficacy of mindfulness
      based intervention on pain perception and quality of life in individuals suffering from
      chronic recurrent low back pain and osteoarthritis. Participants will be randomized to a
      mindfulness based treatment group, or to a waitlist control group, and will be assessed for
      psychological variables and psychophysical pain assessment before treatment. Participants
      allocated to treatment group will then attend six group meetings in which they will learn and
      practice different mindfulness meditation techniques, and will be asked to practice these
      techniques on a daily basis. Post treatment assessments will take place at the end of the
      intervention for both treatment and control groups.

    <description>53 items and provides nine sub-scale scores measuring a range of psychological symptoms and somatic complaints. Participants rate on a scale of 0 ('not at all') to 4 ('extremely') how much they were bothered in the last 7 days by each of 18 symptoms, including separate scores for anxiety, depression, somatization, and a global symptom severity index</description>

    <description>Sullivan, Bishop, &amp; Pivik, 1995) This questionnaire includes 13 items representing the three components of pain catastrophizing: rumination (e.g., &quot;I can't seem to keep it out of my mind&quot;); magnification (e.g., &quot;I wonder whether something serious may happen&quot;); and helplessness (e.g., &quot;There is nothing I can do to reduce the intensity of pain&quot;).</description>

The scales are: Non-acceptance of Emotional Response, Difficulties engaging in Goal-Directed Behavior, Impulse Control Difficulties, Lack of Emotional Awareness, limited access to Emotion Regulation Strategies and Lack of Emotional Clarity.

    <description>The Mindfulness Program consists of one 2-hour session each week for 6 consecutive weeks plus a half day retreat near the end of the intervention. Participants will attend weekly group meetings (15-20 individuals per group) in which they will be guided through a progressive experiential exploration of mindfulness. Participants will be asked to develop a daily meditation practice of 30-45 minutes with audio-recordings for guidance, and will report the amount and type of practice in a daily dairy. . A psychologist with rich personal experience in mindfulness who is trained in mindfulness based therapy will be responsible for administering the program.</description>
