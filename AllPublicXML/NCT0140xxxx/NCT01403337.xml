  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular surgery is considered a high-risk operation with an anticipated risk of major
      cardiovascular complications in excess of 5%. The occurrence of a cardiovascular complication
      after surgery carries a long-term higher mortality risk. The main objective of this
      investigation is to reduce the proportion of patients having major cardiovascular
      complications during surgery through a clinical protocol of remote preconditioning that is
      safe, effective and reproducible.

    <description>The RIPC protocol will consist of three cycles of the following: 5-minute inflation of a blood pressure cuff around the right upper arm to 200 mmHg (or 20 above the systolic blood pressure if baseline BP &gt; 200 mmHg) to allow for external compression of the brachial artery resulting in transient arm ischemia, followed by a 5-minute interval of cuff deflation to allow for reperfusion. The total duration of the protocol is 30 minutes equally divided between ischemia and reperfusion. The protocol is to be applied in the patient room the morning of the operation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients would be those undergoing elective major vascular surgery at the
             Minneapolis VA Medical Center for an expanding abdominal aortic aneurysm, obstructive
             carotid disease, and/or chronic limb ischemia during the study period. All patients
             must be â‰¥ 18 years of age and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include hypertensive crisis, acute coronary syndrome in the
             preceding 6 weeks, severe valvular heart disease, peripheral arterial disease of the
             upper extremities, manifested by a systolic blood pressure difference greater than 20
             mmHg, pregnant women, patients unable to understand the consent process due to mental
             illness, advanced malignancy with limited life expectancy (&lt;1 year), and hemodialysis
             with a fistula in the upper extremity.
