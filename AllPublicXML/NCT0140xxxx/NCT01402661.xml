  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Corrona Data Collection Program study is designed to systematically collect and document
      use patterns, effectiveness, and safety of DMARDs (Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs),
      biologic agents and any other treatments currently used in the management of Rheumatoid
      Arthritis (RA), Undifferentiated Arthritis (UA), Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), and other
      rheumatic diseases. Data collected through the Corrona Data Collection Program will be
      maintained in a comprehensive database (the Corrona Database), which will be used for
      purposes related to clinical, outcomes, and market research. Participating physicians will
      have access to information about their own participating patients, and may use this
      information for purposes such as research and in providing patient care. It is anticipated
      that the study data may help improve the quality of information upon which clinical decisions
      are based.

      The Corrona Data Collection Program represents a novel advance by collecting, analyzing, and
      reporting real-time data trends on these issues. Information gathered through the Corrona
      Data Collection Program is maintained in a comprehensive database (the Corrona Database). The
      Corrona Organization provides participating sites with access to technology that enables them
      to interact with and manipulate data maintained in the Corrona Database on their own patient
      populations. The Corrona Organization uses the Corrona Database for purposes related to
      clinical, marketing, and outcomes research. Significantly, the Corrona Organization intends
      to conduct its own novel clinical trials in rheumatology. In addition, the Corrona
      Organization provides reports regarding information contained in the Corrona Database for a
      fee to select industry subscribers who are not allowed direct access to the Corrona Database.
      Rather, they are permitted to submit research queries to the Corrona Organization which are
      executed by the Corrona biostatisticians who generate appropriate responses to queries.

      Physicians and subjects complete Corrona Data Collection Program Questionnaires (see Appendix
      B) approximately every four months (RA) or six months (PsA and UA). During the course of a
      regularly-scheduled office visit, the physician performs assessments as mandated on the
      Corrona Data Collection Program Physician Questionnaires with recording of pertinent data.
      Results from certain laboratory tests are included, but not mandated, on these
      Questionnaires. Subjects are asked to complete Data Collection Program Questionnaires
      designed to capture information ranging from their general demographics and experience with
      prescription drug use to an overall global assessment of their disease. During their
      regularly-scheduled physician office visits, it is anticipated that they will spend
      approximately five to ten minutes completing the Questionnaires. Neither the Questionnaires
      completed by physicians nor the Questionnaires completed by subjects contain subject's names,
      addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, or social security numbers.

      Patients are enrolled in the Corrona Data Collection Program during regularly-scheduled
      office visits. Upon enrollment, physicians complete a set of Enrollment Questionnaires,
      including a 28 joint count (see Appendix C) and the New Biologic Start (NBS) Questionnaire
      when appropriate. Subjects also complete a Corrona Data Collection Program Enrollment
      Questionnaire along with Health Assessment and EQ5D

      In the event of a biologic new start or biologic switch in a RA patient, the physician will
      complete the NBS Questionnaire, Appendix A. Appendix B is to be completed by the physician
      and subject cooperatively at the very next Corrona visit. If the Appendix B of this
      Questionnaire is completed at a visit other than the next subsequent visit, the set of
      Appendices will be null and void. In the event a subject initiates A NEW BIOLOGIC and
      discontinues a biologic at the same visit, then both Appendices A (FOR THE NEW BIOLOGIC) and
      B (FOR THE BIOLOGIC BEING DISCONTINUED) will be completed at the same visit.

      Data are collected on subjects for as long as they consent to remain in the study.

      Any adverse events that are spontaneously volunteered by the subject or discovered as a
      result of general questioning by the investigator should be recorded on the Provider
      Follow-up Questionnaire for that visit.

        Patients are enrolled in the CORRONA Data Collection Program during regularly-scheduled
        office visits. Selected rheumatologists are invited to participate as investigators in the
        CORRONA Data Collection Program. Physicians are selected carefully in an effort to ensure
        enrollment of subjects that represent a reasonable representation of a cross-section of the
        population throughout the country with rheumatic diseases. All potential sites are screened
        for clinical research experience and adherence to GCP (Good Clinical Practice) guidelines
