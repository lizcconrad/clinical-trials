      This phase II trial studies bioimpedance spectroscopy in detecting lower-extremity lymphedema
      in patients with stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV vulvar cancer undergoing surgery
      and lymphadenectomy. Diagnostic procedures, such as bioimpedance spectroscopy, may help
      doctors to predict the onset of lower-extremity lymphedema in patients with vulvar cancer
      undergoing surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of bioimpedance technology as
      compared to clinically derived measurements to include circumferential volumetric
      measurements to detect lower-extremity lymphedema in patients who are undergoing an inguinal
      lymphadenectomy during the concurrent surgical management of a vulvar cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo preoperative and postoperative lower-extremity lymphedema assessment
      comprising serial circumferential measurements, bioimpedance spectroscopy measurements, and
      clinical evaluation using the Stemmer sign. Patients undergo radical vulvectomy or radical
      local excision as prescribed by GOG-0244, and unilateral or bilateral inguinal or
      inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year,
      and then every 6 months for 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with vulvar cancer already enrolled onto Gynecologic Oncology Group
             (GOG)-0244 who will undergo or have undergone definitive surgery for primary stage
             I-IV vulvar cancer who will receive a radical vulvectomy or radical local excision
             with concurrent unilateral or bilateral inguinal or inguinal-femoral lymphadenectomy;

               -  Patients who are going to receive multi-modality therapy (radiation +/-

             complete lymphadenectomy during that same operative event
