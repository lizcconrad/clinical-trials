    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess whether a 6-month treatment with adalimumab added on
      the treatment with conventional antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) will decrease the number of days
      on sick leave compared to placebo. In addition, the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of
      the intervention compared to the conventional treatment is evaluated, and the patients who
      benefit most are characterized.

    <textblock>
      In spite of the improved medical treatment, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still causing both
      significant morbidity and marked loss of work productivity. Short periods of work inability,
      i.e., sick leaves represent a significant part of the socioeconomic burden of RA. The study
      is a randomized, controlled double blind multi-center study. 160 patients of 25 to 55 years
      of age with recent-onset (≤2 years from diagnosis) RA who have been treated with a
      combination of conventional antirheumatic drugs but have an inadequate response to treatment
      and are at the risk of losing their ability to work, are enrolled. The patients should be
      biologic-naïve. Their RA should be active, but not so active that the conventional criteria
      for biologic therapy would be fulfilled. The subjects are randomized at 1:1 ratio to receive
      either adalimumab (40 mg every two weeks) or placebo for 6 months added on their concurrent
      antirheumatic therapy. The RA-related sickness absence and clinical response will be
      evaluated.
