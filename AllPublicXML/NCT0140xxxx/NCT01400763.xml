  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Macular pigment is composed primarily of the xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin, which are
      members of the carotenoid family. Epidemiological evidence indicates that a higher intake of
      lutein and zeaxanthin is associated with a lower risk to develop age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). The lipid matrix of an egg yolk is an excellent vehicle for the efficient
      absorption of dietary lutein and it is possible to increase the natural lutein concentration
      in an egg yolk. A fresh lutein-enriched egg yolk beverage has been produced using these
      lutein-enriched egg-yolks. However, this beverage has a limited shelf life of maximum three
      weeks. Drying this fresh beverage extents the shelf live, however, this should be without
      loosing its functional properties concerning lutein bioavailability. At WUR-FBR two types of
      drying procedures have been evaluated resulting in two different dried product formulations,
      which need to be tested. The question is, whether the lutein bioavailability is not affected
      by different drying procedures.
