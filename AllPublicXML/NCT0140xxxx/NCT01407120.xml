    <textblock>
      The project is a 15-year follow-up of 240 young adults whose families participated in an
      experimental evaluation of the New Beginnings Program (NBP), a preventive intervention for
      divorced families. The NBP was provided in late childhood; the follow-up occurred in young
      adulthood. Families were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: mother program (MP),
      dual-component mother and child program (MPCP), or literature-control (LC) condition.
      Programs were designed to change several putative mediators of children's post-divorce mental
      health problems using empirically-supported change strategies. The investigators expected
      that the NBP would have either main or risk by program interactive effects on mental health
      and substance use problems and disorders, developmental tasks, parent-young adult
      relationships, physical health problems, and competencies, such that YAs who participated in
      NBP will have better functioning than YAs in the control condition. The investigators
      expected that the NBP will have either main or risk by program interactive effects on
      mothers' mental health; those in the NBP are expected to have fewer mental health problems
      than those in the control condition.
