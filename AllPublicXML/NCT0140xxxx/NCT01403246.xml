      This is a phase I-II multicenter, open label study in previously untreated and elderly
      patients (&gt; 60 years) with CLL ,which includes 2 sections:

      Induction phase with Chlorambucil and Lenalidomide (CL):

        -  Phase 1: a non-comparative phase aimed at defining the MTD of lenalidomide given in
           combination with chlorambucil and the efficacy and safety of the lenalidomide and
           chlorambucil combination;

        -  Phase 2: a non-comparative phase aimed at defining the overall response rate of
           lenalidomide given at the MTD in combination with chlorambucil.

      Maintenance versus clinical observation:

      -A comparative phase including lenalidomide or clinical observation aimed at defining the
      benefit of lenalidomide given as maintenance therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive six monthly courses of the chlorambucil (C) and lenalidomide (L)
      schedule consisting of 8 days of C (d1-d8) combined with L given daily until response
      assessment which will take place 12 weeks from the start (d+1) of course VI, while patients
      continue their treatment with lenalidomide daily.

      In the first phase of the induction phase of the study the dose of L given with C will be
      gradually escalated to reach the MTD. In the second phase of the induction phase, C will be
      given in combination with the Maximum Tolerated Dose of L (either the MTD or the maximum
      planned dose of 10mg).

      Patients who will achieve a response after 6 courses of CL induction phase -PR, CRi, CR and
      MRD negative CR- will be eligible for the post-induction phase of the study. Patients will be
      randomized (1:1), stratifying according to the quality of response (PR vs CR, CRi, MRD-CR)
      and the genetic profile (11q, 17p-, p53mut vs other), to receive L daily, (L arm) or no
      further therapy (Clinical observation arm) until day 364 or until PD or unacceptable toxicity
      develops, whichever occurs first. During maintenance (L arm), L will be given at the dose
      tolerated by the patient during the period interval from d+28 of the 6th course of CL and the
      day of evaluation of the response (d+84 from the start of 6th course of CL). At screening,
      blood samples will be drawn and a physical examination, a CT scan or a thorax radiography and
      an abdomen ultrasound, a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be performed. A clinical
      examination will be carried out and blood samples will be harvested weekly during CL
      treatment. Twelve weeks from the start (d+1) of 6th CL course (d+84), clinical response will
      be assessed. During the post-remissional phase, a monthly clinical examination will be
      performed in all patients. Patients randomized to receive L as maintenance therapy will have
      an additional blood examination during treatment. Eight weeks after the completion of the
      post-remissional phase (d+420), a new response assessment will be performed (physical
      examination and blood samples, a CT scan or a thorax radiography and an abdomen ultrasound, a
      bone marrow biopsy and aspirate). Thereafter, patients will be monitored for response
      duration at least over the following 18 months.

             situ&quot; of the cervix or breast.

          -  Able to take low molecular weight heparin or in alternative, low-fixed-dose warfarin
             or, in alternative, low-dose aspirin.

          -  Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential(FCBP) must:

               -  Understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child and the need for
                  effective contraception;

               -  Be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures.

               -  Be informed and understand the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need
                  to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy.

               -  Understand the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study drug is
                  dispensed following a negative pregnancy test.

               -  Uderstand the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the
                  frequency outlined in this protocol.

               -  Contraception.

               -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to
                  use two reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete
                  abstinence from heterosexual contact during the following time periods related to
                  this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 2) while
                  participating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 days
                  after study treatment discontinuation.

               -  The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective
                  method and one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a
                  qualified provider of contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples
                  of highly effective and additional effective methods of contraception:

               -  Highly effective methods:

                    1. Intrauterine device (IUD)

                    2. Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants)

                    3. Tubal ligation

                    4. Partner's vasectomy

               -  Additional effective methods:

                    1. Male condom

                    2. Diaphragm

                    3. Cervical Cap

          -  Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple
             myeloma taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pills are
             not recommended. If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the
             patient should switch to one of the effective method listed above. The risk of venous
             thromboembolism continues for 4 to 6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral
             contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during
             co-treatment with dexamethasone.

          -  Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an
             increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding.
             Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients with
             neutropenia.

          -  Pregnancy testing.

          -  FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests prior to starting study drug. The first
             pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the start of study drug
             and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of
             study drug.

          -  FCBP must agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including
             4 weeks after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal
             sterilization. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who
             practice complete and continued abstinence.

          -  Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at
             least 28 days after study drug discontinuation.

          -  Male patients must:

               -  Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a
                  pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential.

               -  Must practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact
                  with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while participating
                  in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following study
                  drug discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

               -  If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male
                  study patient during study participation, the investigator must be notified
                  immediately.

          -  Female and male patients:

               -  should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and
                  to return any unused capsules to the study doctor at the end of treatment.

               -  Should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days following
                  discontinuation of study drug.

               -  Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at
                  least 28 days following discontinuation of study drug.

          -  Laboratory test results within these ranges:

               -  Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL and creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min

               -  Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL
