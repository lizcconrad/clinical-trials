      This is an open-label, single-arm, historically controlled, prospective, multicenter phase
      III study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of Immune Globulin
      Intravenous (Human) IVIG-SN™ in subjects with primary immunodeficiency diseases.

      Subject will be infused every 21 to 28 days according to their previous IVIG treatment
      schedule. Subjects treated every 28 days will receive 13 study IVIG infusions. Subject
      treated every 21 days will receive 17 study IVIG infusions.

      Duration of treatment:The total duration of treatment is 12 months.
