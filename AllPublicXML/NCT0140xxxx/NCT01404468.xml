  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimisation of drug absorption through skin is of great value in modern
      therapy.Phonophoresis is the use of therapeutic ultrasound to increase percutaneous drug
      absorption. However,few studies have compared pulsed and continuous modes of therapeutic
      ultrasound.This study compared these two modes by investigating the effect of lidocaine
      phonophoresis on sensory blockade.

      Ninety-three healthy volunteers, assigned at random to one of three ultrasound
      groups:pulsed(ultrasound+lidocaine),continuous(ultrasound+lidocaine)and control(sham
      ultrasound+lidocaine).

      Lidocaine was administered transdermally using a transducer.Two point discrimination, touch
      and maximum pain thresholds were assessed before and after the intervention in each group.

      Pulsed ultrasound with topical lidocaine gel induced greater anaesthetic effect compared with
      continuous ultrasound with topical lidocaine gel and lidocaine application alone. The
      mechanical properties of pulsed ultrasound appear to be responsible for greater drug
      penetration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lidocaine is a common local anaesthetic drug that is used topically to relieve pain,itching
      and burning, and also for minor surgery.However,its application via this conductive
      method,has been confined to surface anaesthesia because it seems that it is not possible to
      have a deep transmission with local drug massage, without injection or systematic
      administration.On the other hand,the injection of lidocaine can lead to tissue injury and
      pain,and its use is not advised in children. Phonophoresis is one of the common procedures
      for reducing these problems. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to compare the two
      modes of therapeutic ultrasound by assessing the effect of lidocaine gel phonophoresis on
      percutaneous absorption and sensory blockade.
