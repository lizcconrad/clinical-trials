    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of Adapalene gel 0.3% compared to Tretinoin Emollient cream 0.05%,
           reducing signs of cutaneous photoageing, measured trough photonumeric scale evaluation,
           investigator evaluation of global response to treatment and subject's evaluation of
           improvement.

        2. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of Adapalene Gel 0.3%, compared to Tretinoin
           Emollient cream 0.05% during 24 weeks of treatment.

      The study has the clinical hypothesis that Adapalene Gel 0.3% is as effective as Tretinoin
      Emollient cream 0.05% in the treatment of cutaneous photoaging.
