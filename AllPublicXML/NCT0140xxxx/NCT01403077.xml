        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt;/= 18 years

          2. De novo stenotic lesion(s) in the superficial femoral artery located at least 1cm
             distal to the femoral bifurcation and &gt; 3 cm above the knee joint

          3. Lifestyle-limiting claudication defined as symptomatic subjects with Rutherford Becker
             Category 2-3

          4. Target lesion native reference vessel diameter 4.6 - 6.0 mm by on-line QVA; target
             lesion native reference vessel diameter less than 5.0 mm only if lesion residual
             stenosis is ≤ 25%

          5. Lesion length: up to a maximum that can be covered by one 100mm scaffold

          6. Target lesion &gt; 50% stenosis or total occlusion

          7. Undisturbed flow to the foot via at least 2 patent infrapopliteal vessel on the
             treated side with one vessel free from &gt; 50% stenosis to the ankle joint

          8. Patent common and external iliac; TASC A &amp; B lesions may be successfully treated (&lt;30%
             residual stenosis) at the time of the index procedure

          9. The study patient or the study patient's legal representative has been informed of the
             nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed
             consent as approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of the respective
             clinical site

         10. The study patient agrees to comply with all required post-procedure follow-up visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previously implanted stent(s) or stent graft(s) in the target lesion

          2. Previous endovascular treatment of the target lesion

          3. Femoral access in the target limb within 30 days of study procedure

          4. Target lesion residual stenosis &gt; 30% after pre-dilatation with nominally sized
             balloon

          5. Severely calcified lesions as determined by a balloon deformity during dilatation with
             a nominally sized balloon inflated at nominal pressure.

          6. Acute embolic complication at the trifurcation following pre-dilatation not resolved
             by aspiration

          7. Target vessel contains acute thrombus

          8. Aneurysm in target vessel

          9. Critical limb ischemia defined as Rutherford-Becker Category 4-6

         10. Intolerance, or allergies which cannot be adequately pre-medicated, to the following:
             aspirin, clopidogrel or ticlopidine, heparin, any scaffold components, contrast agents

         11. Life expectancy of less than 12 months

         12. Pregnancy or breast feeding (negative pregnancy test within 7 days required in females
             of child bearing potential)

         13. Non-atherosclerotic lesion (e.g. vasculitis or Berger's disease)

         14. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level &gt; 220 µmol/L, or subject is on dialysis)

         15. Immunocompromised

         16. Active systemic infection or lower limb infection of any nature

         17. WBC &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3

         18. Myocardial infarction within the past 1 month

         19. Stroke within 3 months

         20. Un-controlled Atrial-Fibrillation

         21. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study. Note:
             Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were investigational, but have
             since become commercially available, are not considered investigational trials
