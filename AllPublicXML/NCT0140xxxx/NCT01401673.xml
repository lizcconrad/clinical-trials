  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that cough reflex hypersensitivity, demonstrated in chronic
      cough patients, is due to a phenomenon known as central sensitisation. Central sensitisation
      is a hyper-excitability of the sensory nerves as they join the central nervous system, and is
      believed to be mediated by the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor[1-3].
