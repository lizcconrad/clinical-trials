  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand whether there is any difference in the
      amount of midazolam (including its breakdown product) in the blood when midazolam is given
      with tasimelteon, and whether there is any difference in the amount of rosiglitazone in the
      blood when rosiglitazone is given with tasimelteon.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Ability and acceptance to provide written informed consent;

          2. Subjects must be males or females between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive;

          3. Female subjects of childbearing potential must be non-pregnant and non-lactating and
             have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test at the Screening visit and at Check-in
             (Days -1) and agree not to attempt to become pregnant during the course of the study.
             Female subjects of childbearing potential (including peri-menopausal women who have
             had a menstrual bleeding within 1 year) must be using appropriate birth control (e.g.
             intrauterine device [IUD], diaphragm or condom with spermicidal jelly or foam or
             abstinence, or cervical cap) for a period of 35 days before the first dosing, for the
             duration of the study, and for one month after the last dose;

             a. Note: Women are not permitted to use hormonal methods of birth control (e.g. oral
             contraceptives, hormonal intrauterine device [IUD], patch and steroids) and must use
             another acceptable method of birth control during the study and for one month after
             the last dose. Women currently taking oral contraceptives will be required to
             discontinue their regimen two weeks prior to first dosing.

          4. Subjects with Body Mass Index (BMI) of &gt;18 and &lt;35 kg/m2 (BMI = weight (kg)/ [height
             (m)]2);

          5. Vital signs (after 3 minutes resting in a semi-supine position) which are within the
             ranges shown below:

               1. Body temperature between 35.0-37.5 °C;

               2. Systolic blood pressure between 90-150 mm Hg;

               3. Diastolic blood pressure between 50-95 mm Hg;

               4. Pulse rate between 50-100 bpm.

          6. Willing and able to comply with study requirements;

          7. Subjects must be in good health as determined by past medical history, physical
             examination, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests and urinalysis;

             gastrointestinal or metabolic dysfunction judged by the Investigator to be clinically
             significant;

          5. Any condition requiring the regular use of medication;

          6. History of intolerance and/or hypersensitivity to drugs including midazolam,
             rosiglitazone or other 'glitazones', melatonin or melatonin agonists, or anyone who

             1;

          7. History of or current evidence of hypoglycemia judged by the Investigator to be
             clinically significant;

             results: HCV, HIV, HBsAg

          9. Treatment with any drug known to cause major organ system toxicity (e.g.,
             chloramphenicol or tamoxifen) during the 60 day preceding Day 1;

         10. Elevated (&gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal) liver function tests (i.e. aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]), alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT]), and total
             bilirubin);

         11. Inability to be venipunctured and/or tolerate venous access;

         12. Subjects who have used tobacco products 3 months prior to dosing.

             longer) of baseline, including placebo;

         14. Participation in a previous BMS-214778/VEC-162 trial;
