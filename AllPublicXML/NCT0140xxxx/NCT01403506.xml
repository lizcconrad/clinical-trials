      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of (NAC) N-Acetyl Cysteine on
      biomarkers of Delayed Graft Function (DGF), including Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated
      Lipocalin (NGAL) and Intereleukin 18 (IL18).

      Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for most patients with end stage renal failure,
      but limited numbers of suitable kidneys are available for transplantation. So preservation of
      graft is vital. This necessitates the studies and interventions to improve outcome of renal
      transplantation surgery.

      Delayed Graft Function (DGF) or delay in performance of transplanted kidney means absence of
      acceptable function in the renal activity in postgrafting phase. DGF is a consequence of
      ischemic and reperfusion injuries (IRI), and oxygen free radicals have a main role in
      pathophysiology of DGF. In meta-analysis studies, it has been demonstrated that DGF has a
      correlation with long and short time graft survival. Despite great advances in the
      transplantation procedure, dysfunction prevalence has not decreased. Major causes of this
      problem are the lack of appropriate markers for early diagnosis of DGF and on the other hand
      lack of appropriate and effective interventions to controll DGF.

      Studies have shown that N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) can induce GSH synthesis, scavenger of free
      radicals, and infusion of NAC had similar effects as glutathione.

      This is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) on patients who have received kidney
      transplantation from living donors. Sixty transplanted patients will be randomized into 2
      groups. The first group of patients will be treated with NAC 600mg 6 hr before
      transplantation and two doses of NAC 12 hours apart after transplantation in addition to
      standard treatment, and the second group will receive only standard antirejection treatment.
      For all patients entered the study, urinary concentrations of IL18 and NGAL will be measured
      in designated times. Risk factors of DGF will be compared in two groups and effectiveness of
      NAC in reducing DGF will be determined.
