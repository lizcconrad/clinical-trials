  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators hope to study a number of variables the investigators
      believe may help us predict why some people respond better to some medications than others.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of two typical medications for OCD,
      clomipramine or escitalopram. Individuals who would like to participate but who have
      previously tried one or both of these medications may instead take a newer drug, duloxetine,
      and undergo the identical procedures. The factors the investigators will be studying include
      demographics (i.e. age, gender, age of onset of OCD), genetic markers (such as variants in
      genes involved in breaking down drugs in the liver (cytochrome P450 system), and genes
      involved in several brain chemical systems, such as serotonin), the dimensions of OCD
      symptoms (i.e. checking, washing, and hoarding) and cortical inhibition. Cortical inhibition
      will be measured transcranial magnetic stimulation and is being studied because deficits in
      this process may be important in the development of OCD. The investigators hypothesize that
      certain pretreatment clinical characteristics will correlate with poor treatment response
      including earlier age of onset, longer duration of illness, increased YBOCS severity and
      presence of significant hoarding symptoms. The investigators expect that increasing degree of
      deficit in CI pre-treatment will predict poor treatment response, but that increase in CI
      from pre- to post-treatment will correlate with a positive treatment response. Differences in
      genetic marker status for cytochrome P450 genes will correlate with tolerability and/or
      response, as well as differences in genetic marker status in SLC1A1, GRIN2B, 5HT1B and 5HT2A
      will correlate with response.

    <measure>YBOCS Obsessive-Compulsive Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Bi-monthly (every 2 weeks for duration of trial. Approx. 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The YBOCS yields an OCD severity score by scoring participants on time, interference, distress, resistance and control of their obsessive and compulsive symptoms on a scale of 0-4. When these scores are summed, they give a total severity score from 0-40. The primary outcome will measure the degree of change in this measurement from pre- to post-treatment.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Improvement - Improvement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Bi-monthly (every 2 weeks for duration of trial. Approx. 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a clinician/Research assistant rated score of clinical improvement. Both treating physician and research assistant (who interviews the participant every two weeks) will independently provide ratings from 1-7, 1 being very much improved and 7 being very much worse.</description>

    <measure>Genotype marker data for SLC1A1, GRIN2B, 5HT1B, 5HT2A and P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19.</measure>
    <time_frame>Collected at week 0, analyzed periodically (approx. 1x/year)</time_frame>
    <description>We will initially focus on GLU and GABA gene candidates for which there is good evidence of involvement in cortical inhibition. We will also prioritize other markers previously implicated in response and/or etiology of the illness including 5HT1B, 5HT2A, 5HTT, DRD3, DRD4, MOG, BDNF, MAOA, COMT. We will test 200 SNPs across these 12 genes, and also explore any highly promising genes emerging from the literature as time and resources permit. We will test both single markers and haplotypes. Genotyping of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 will be typed by the Roche Diagnostics Amplichip (www.amplichip.us).</description>
