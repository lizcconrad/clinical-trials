  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canadian statistics indicate that the incidence of obesity is increasing and that the
      occurrence of diabetes in obese individuals is 5-fold greater than those with a healthy
      weight, making weight control in this population particularly relevant. Preliminary clinical
      data has shown that the whole grain, Salba, may improve type 2 diabetes control, reduce
      after-meal blood glucose, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and suppress appetite.
      Its use may therefore have potential implications in long-term weight management, while
      improving diabetes.

      The objective of this research (weight loss) is to evaluate whether adding Salba to an energy
      reduced diet for six months will result in greater weight loss compared to control in
      overweight and obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. The study recruited 77 overweight or
      obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. They were instructed to follow a calorie restricted
      diet and their regular diabetes therapy together with regular exercise. Participants were
      randomly assigned to receive 30 g Salba/1000 kcal of daily energy requirements, or an oat
      bran control supplement matched for energy. The effect of the supplements on weight-loss
      (including waist circumference, % body fat) and glucose control (A1c, fasting glucose levels)
      will be assessed. In addition, related outcomes such as low-grade body inflammation,
      hunger-regulating hormones (ghrelin, adiponectin), safety measures (urea, creatinine, ALT and
      prothrombin time) and satiety scores were evaluated.

      Modest weight loss has been associated with improved glucose control in individuals with type
      2 diabetes. Addition of Salba to an energy reduced diet may facilitate greater weight loss
      and improve glycemic control and CVD risk factors compared to such a diet alone. Salba may
      also promote maintenance of weight loss and therefore help prevent weight gain by providing
      feelings of fullness that reduce appetite. In light of the high incidence of obesity in
      individuals with diabetes, Salba grain may be a useful addition to the diet.
