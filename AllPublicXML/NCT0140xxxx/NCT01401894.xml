  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to assess what the participant understands about their
      illness, prognosis, the goals of the cancer treatment and their communication with their
      oncology providers. This study will help us to figure out how the investigators can improve
      how other patients understand their illness and goals of treatment and help us improve
      communication with their doctors. This research is being done because there is not a lot of
      information on how much patients understand about their illness and prognosis.

      -  Participants will be asked to answer a few basic questions regarding race, ethnicity,
           religion, relationship status, education, income, and living situation.

        -  They will then be asked to complete a questionnaire which contains questions about their
           mood, spirituality, quality of life and their understanding of their treatment and
           prognosis and their communication with their oncologist. They will complete these
           questionnaires in the clinic or infusion room on one of their regularly scheduled visit.
