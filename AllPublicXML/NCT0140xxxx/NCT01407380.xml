      This is a Phase 1 study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and
      clinical effects of orally administered PWT33597 mesylate in subjects with advanced
      malignancies.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be conducted in
      2 phases. The Dose Escalation Phase (up to 36 patients) will determine the MTD of PWT33597
      mesylate and evaluate its safety and tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary clinical effects;
      the subsequent Dose Confirmation Phase (up to 36 patients) will be a cohort expansion at or
      below the MTD of PWT33597 mesylate. Subjects will be treated with once-daily oral doses of
      PWT33597 in consecutive, 28-day cycles. Subjects will be evaluated regularly for safety.
      Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 28 days after completion of the last dose of study
      drug. Subjects who tolerate the drug and who do not experience progressive disease may
      continue to receive PWT33597 mesylate at the discretion of the principal investigator for up
      to 24 cycles

         21. Any severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, may interfere with the informed consent process and/or with
             compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the investigator's opinion, would make the
             patient inappropriate for entry into this study.
