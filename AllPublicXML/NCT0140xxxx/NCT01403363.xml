  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fentanyl is considered a potent synthetic opioid widely used in anesthesiology, for short and
      long-term pain management, and for sedation. The fentanyl patch is constructed like a matrix,
      a system based on a polyacrylate net with fentanyl that attaches directly onto the skin. The
      doses available today are from 12µg/h, 25, 50, 75, to 100 µg/h. Despite the variable doses
      available, often in certain patients as the elderly or children, there is a need for slower
      titration than the 12 µg/h currently available.

      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate pain control and to examine the blood
      fentanyl concentration of patients on a fix dose of fentanyl patch up to 100 µg/h every two
      or three days, and compare it with pain control and concentration levels obtained from a
      similar dose patch, but after cutting the patch into two.

      The study will take place at the pain clinic of Clalit Health Services-South District
      (CHS-SD), and the Negev home palliative care unit. In CHS-SD there are approximately 300
      patients treated regularly with opioids and about 120 patients in the home palliative care
      unit. A sample of 95 patients will be recruited. Once consent form is signed, blood samples
      will be collected twice: 1. At the time of the visit; 2. After 144 hours (about 6 days) from
      the first sample, and at least 36 hours after replacing the cut patch. Pain management will
      be evaluated at both visits using the Brief Pain Inventory (Hebrew version) - BPI
      questionnaire, and rescue doses used before and after the cutting of the patch. The blood
      samples will be transferred to the laboratory for testing of fentanyl concentration levels.
