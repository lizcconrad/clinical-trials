  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transition between acute care and community care represents one of the most vulnerable
      periods in health care delivery, particularly as the complexity of inpatient populations
      increases. Two recent North American studies found an incidence of post-discharge adverse
      events between 19-23%, with adverse drug events accounting for 66-72% of these. The
      vulnerability of this period has been attributed mainly to a failure of care providers to
      adequately reconcile discrepancies between home medications and discharge medications, as
      well as a failure to transfer this and other important information about the hospitalization
      and discharge to community care providers. While discharge communication with the primary
      care physician has traditionally occurred via a handwritten or dictated summary, major
      deficits exist with respect to timeliness of information transfer and adequacy of content in
      discharge summaries.

      Computer-enabled discharge communications can potentially avert such problems. This is
      particularly true for web-based solutions that do not require end users to acquire additional
      software/training to use them. The purpose of this research is to definitively assess the
      efficacy of a web-based seamless discharge communication tool that the Medical Ward of the
      21st Century (W21C - see www.w21c.org) team in Calgary has developed through iterative
      consultation with multiple clinical stakeholders as well as patients/families. This tool has
      great potential to be implemented on a provincial level as well as across Canada and
      internationally because it operates on a web interface that does not confine its
      applicability to a single type of hospital information system.

      The purpose of this research is to definitively assess the efficacy of the web-based
      discharge communication tool that our team has developed in partnership with Alberta Health
      Services. In doing so, our specific objective will be to answer the following research
      questions:

        1. Is the seamless discharge communication tool efficacious with respect to reducing
           hospital readmission and mortality (at 3 months), as well as reducing adverse events and
           adverse drug events?

        2. Does the seamless discharge communication tool transfer appropriate, complete, and
           accurate discharge information in a timely manner compared to traditional discharge
           communication?

        3. Is the seamless discharge communication tool efficacious with respect to improving
           physician and patient satisfaction?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vulnerability of the transition period has been attributed to three main factors. First,
      changes to patients'medication regimens during hospitalization are numerous, yet failure to
      reconcile discrepancies between admission and discharge is frequent. Second, the
      patient/family is required to take over care responsibilities at discharge and must often
      relay important information to the primary care physician. This can be particularly
      challenging if discharge information is poorly communicated, presented too rapidly, if
      instructions are verbal only, or if the patient has low literacy or low health
      literacy.Finally, crucial information is often not transferred between acute care physicians
      and community physicians.

      Information about the hospitalization (such as medication changes, patient diagnoses,
      interventions,diagnostic findings, and necessary follow-up) is commonly transferred to the
      primary care physician via a discharge summary that is typically faxed or mailed.
      Unfortunately, deficits with respect to timeliness and/or complete failure to transmit are
      widespread. At the first post-discharge appointment, the discharge summary is unavailable to
      the primary care physician up to 75% of the time. This negatively impacts the continuity of
      care provided to many patients. When summaries are received, inconsistent content and
      inaccuracies are common. Acute care physicians, whether medical or surgical, often neglect to
      include diagnostic findings, treatment/hospital course, discharge medications, pending tests
      results, and whether the patient and family received counselling.

      Computer-enabled discharge communications have potential to avert such problems. Such
      communication platforms can provide an immediate link between acute care and primary care
      physicians, and interfaces can be designed to ensure consistent information transfer. In
      addition, physicians in both settings have expressed preference for electronic discharge
      documents over hand written/dictated summaries with respect to clarity, comprehensiveness,
      and positive impacts on continuity of care.

    <description>The primary outcomes are identified as such because these are recognized to be major events that we are ultimately trying to prevent through safer health care. The 3 month time frame is felt to be most relevant, because it is short enough to potentially relate to discharge communications, but also long enough after discharge to permit some events to occur. The primary outcomes of interest will be assessed through existing linkages to hospitalization data from the Alberta Health Services Health Outcomes Group based in Calgary,for the outcome of readmission to acute care hospitals; and to data from Alberta Bureau of Vitals Statistics to determine all-cause mortality</description>
