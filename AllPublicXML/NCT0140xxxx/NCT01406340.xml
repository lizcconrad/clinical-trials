      This will be an open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of
      GSK1278863 and metabolites in normal subjects and subjects with impaired renal function,
      including those who are hemodialysis dependent. GSK1278863 will be administered once daily
      for 14 days to normal subjects and subjects with Stage 3 and Stage 4 renal function, and 15
      days to subjects with Stage 5 renal function. Pharmacokinetic assessments will be made on
      Days 1 and 14 (normal subjects, subjects with Stage 3 and Stage 4 renal function) or Days 14
      and 15 (dialysis and non-dialysis days; Stage 5).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of childbearing potential, and
             must agree to use one of the contraception methods described in the protocol. This
             criterion must be followed from the time of Screening until completion of the
             Follow-up Visit. OR Non-childbearing potential as defined in the protocol.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from the
             time of the first dose of investigational product until completion of the Follow-up
             visit.

             dry weight after hemodialysis.

          -  QTcF &lt; 450 msec; OR QTcF &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. These should
             be based on average of triplicate values obtained over brief recording period at
             screening and Predose on Day 1.

          -  Vitamin B12 and folate above the lower limit of normal at screening.
