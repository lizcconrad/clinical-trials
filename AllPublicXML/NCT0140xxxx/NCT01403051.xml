  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was done with people who were infected with HIV and needed to start treatment for
      their HIV disease. The purpose of this study is to see if taking vitamin D and calcium will
      help prevent the bone loss that sometimes happens when people start HIV treatment. For this
      study, the following HIV treatment (or HAART) were provided in the form of a single tablet
      that contains three different drugs: efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF). These
      drugs are approved by the FDA to treat HIV infection. The HIV treatment provided is common
      for people who are taking HIV drugs for the first time. The risks seen with this HIV
      treatment are the same that you would encounter when taking these drugs outside of the study.
      The lists of risks of this HIV treatment are included in this document because the drugs are
      provided by the study, not because the drugs are being tested. The purpose of the study is
      only to look at the impact of high doses of vitamin D and calcium in preventing bone loss.
      There are no study objectives related to HIV treatment (EFV/FTC/TDF).
