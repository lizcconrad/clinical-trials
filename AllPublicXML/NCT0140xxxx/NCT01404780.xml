  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing chest surgery often require insertion of a breathing tube (double lumen
      tube) after they are unconscious. The double lumen tube enables the anaesthetist to ventilate
      (assist breathing) one lung at a time. The other lung is partially deflated to enable enough
      space for the surgeon to perform the procedure. The breathing tube is inserted with a
      laryngoscope (blade with a light at the end) so the vocal cords can be seen. This is standard
      medical practise. Two laryngoscopes are commonly used at Toronto General Hospital to insert
      the tube. The Macintosh laryngoscope has been is use for over 50 years and the Glidescope for
      over 10 years. Both devices have been extensively researched for single lumen tubes insertion
      and found to be very safe and effective. Research is limited to say which of the two
      laryngoscope is the most effective for double lumen tubes.

      The Glidescope (GVL) has been extensively studied for single lumen tube intubation and found
      to be a very safe and useful device. It is a particularly useful for patients with difficult
      airways as it has a camera attached to the blade. Despite being used for double lumen tube
      (DLT) intubations, research of its effectiveness and safety, is lacking. The study aims to
      determine the speed and safety of the GVL for DLT insertion. This information will assist
      anaesthetists in choosing the appropriate laryngoscope for DLT intubation of their patients.

    <time_frame>Number of minutes (0-2) that is required to intubate will be recorded, if a 2nd attempt is required, duration to successfull intubation will be recorded in minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be randomized to either MDL or GVL. If the first attempt fails to intubate within 2 minutes the anesthetist will remove the laryngoscope and provide mask ventilation. The second intubation attempt the anesthetist is encouraged to use the same randomized laryngoscope however, if the treating anesthetist feels a different device and technique will have a higher success rate they can perform that technique on the second attempt regardless of the randomized device. Anesthetists will complete a questionnaire after intubation.</description>

    <description>Information about the procedure (times and complications) will be collected and documented by the study Anesthetist and questionnaires completed at the end of the 24hr postoperative period. Visits: patients will be followed up for a 24 hour period either on ward or by telephone if discharged, and assessed for sore throat, hoarseness, trauma to mouth and lips, dental damage and swallowing difficulties.</description>
