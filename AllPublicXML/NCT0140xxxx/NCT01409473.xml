  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
      with simultaneous boost (higher radiation dose) to areas within the prostate with more
      prominent cancerous growth (intraprostatic lesions) utilizing intensity modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) planning techniques is a safe and effective treatment in patients with
      low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer
      involves several weeks of daily treatment sessions. Stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) is a newer form of EBRT that gives fewer treatments but higher doses of radiation per
      treatment. In many patients there are certain areas within the prostate with more prominent
      cancerous growth (intraprostatic lesions), which may require higher doses of radiation
      (boost) to treat effectively. This study will treat the prostate with simultaneous boost(s)
      to intraprostatic lesion(s) in 5 treatments over 10-14 days.

    <description>Local recurrence-free survival, defined as the time from the first date of radiation to first pathologic confirmation of in-prostate tumor recurrence. The local recurrence will be dated when the palpable progression was first identified. In the event of biochemical failure followed by negative metastatic workup and positive biopsy for in-prostate recurrence, the local recurrence will be dated the date of the documented biochemical failure.</description>

    <description>Distant disease-free survival, defined as the time from the first date of radiation to first documentation of metastatic disease by any method, regardless of the occurrence of any intervening local or regional failure or non-prostate second primary cancer. If metastatic diagnosis was prompted by biochemical failure, distant recurrence will be dated the date of biochemical failure.</description>
