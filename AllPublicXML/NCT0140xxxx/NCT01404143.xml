      What is the difference in subscapularis strength between two different methods of
      subscapularis mobilization: incision of the tendon (tenotomy) versus peel, as measured by a
      hand-held dynamometer in the belly-press position at one year post operative? It is the
      investigators' hypothesis that a peel of the subscapularis will result in greater strength, a
      higher healing rate, and a greater improvement in shoulder function and quality of life
      following shoulder replacement.

    <description>After the deltopectoral approach is completed, the subscapularis tendon will be tenotomized one centimeter medial to its insertion on the lesser tuberosity. The tendon will be tagged for later repair. Repair will take place with a combination of transosseous sutures (3) placed in a mattress configuration through the area of exposed lesser tuberosity. In addition, a soft tissue tendon to tendon repair will be carried out using figure-8 stitches using #2 (heavy) non-absorbable suture (Ticron).</description>

    <description>The subscapularis will be elevated from the lesser tuberosity. The tendon will be tagged with stay sutures for later reattachment (3 sutures in mattress configuration). Reapproximation will take place with three non-absorbable mattress sutures placed in a trans-osseous fashion through the bicipital groove, exiting the greater tuberosity and tied over a 4-hole mini-fragment plate.</description>
