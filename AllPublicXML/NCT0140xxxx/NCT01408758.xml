      The Virtual Clinician Research Tool (VCRT) will use a virtual format to present our National
      Cholesterol Education Program (Brown, 2004) and the Tobacco Use and Dependence Treatment
      Clinical Guideline (Fiore et al., 2008) integrated with principles of human motivation from
      Self-Determination Theory (SDT) for patients with elevated risk for cardiovascular disease
      from LDL-cholesterol or tobacco dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypercholesterolemia and tobacco use interact to increase cardiovascular disease (USDHHS
      1990; 2004). Smoking is a cause of metabolic syndrome and diabetes (Eliasson, 2003; Hu et
      al., 2001; Weitzman et al., 2005). Smokers live on average 13 years less than non-smokers
      (USDHHS, 2004), and tobacco remains the number one health threat in the United States
      (Mokdad, Marks, Stroup, &amp; Gerberding, 2004). The Public Health Service (PHS) has published a
      Guideline for Tobacco Dependence Treatment (Fiore, 2000; Fiore et al., 2008).
      Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk for cardiovascular disease, and effective treatment with
      lifestyle and medications lower the risk of cardiovascular events including sudden death,
      myocardial infarction, and stroke. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has
      published clinical guidelines for its management (Brown, 2004). These include recommendations
      for therapeutic lifestyle change and medications.

      The specific aims of the proposed work are: first, to determine abstinence from tobacco at
      6-months and lower LDL-cholesterol from baseline to 6-months for patients assigned the VCRT
      in addition to the clinician compared to those just receiving clinician care; second, to test
      for increase in medication use (number of days of medication use-for tobacco dependence
      mediations and for statin medications for cholesterol) for those receiving the VCRT +
      clinician; third, to examine the self-determination process model, expanded to include
      autonomous motivation and perceived competence for medication adherence and actual adherence
      to promote maintained abstinence and lower LDL-cholesterol.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria Tobacco Dependence: Subjects must be currently smoking at least 5
        cigarettes per day in the past month, and have smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime to
        qualify for the tobacco VCRT; and will be eligible regardless of their desire to stop
        smoking.

        B. Inclusion Criteria Cholesterol. Subjects must have moderate or moderately high risk for
        coronary artery disease defined by NCEP (two or more of the following risk factors (male
        age &gt; 45 years, female &gt;55, HDL-C &lt;40 mg/dl, active smoking, family history of CHD age &lt; 55
        years male or age &lt; 65 years female) and the average of two LDL-cholesterols &gt; 100 mg/dl,
        or the average of two non-HDL cholesterols of 130 mg/dl. Participants will be eligible
        regardless of desire to lower their cholesterol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion Criteria Tobacco and Cholesterol: Participants will be excluded if they are
        pregnant or lactating, have a psychotic disorder, are unable to make decisions about
        medications for themselves, are too sick to participate, or have a life expectancy of less
        than 12 months (e.g., advanced cancer). Participants will be excluded from the tobacco
        portion of the trial if they have suicidal ideation (score of 1 or more on the suicidal
        thought or self harm question in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) 9). Participants
        will be excluded from the cholesterol portion of the trial if they have had a heart attack
        or a stroke, if they have diabetes mellitus, aortic aneurysm, peripheral vascular disease,
        or chronic kidney disease. They will also be excluded if they are already taking a statin
        medication to lower their cholesterol. They will be excluded if they are unable to take any
        of the statin medications due to allergy or adverse reaction in the past (before the study
        starts). They will be excluded from both cholesterol and tobacco portions of study if they
        do not speak or write English. Participants will be excluded if they do not have access to
        a personal computer at home (Mac or PC) with broadband internet access (such as cable modem
        or digital subscriber line [DSL] and Firefox, Internet Explorer 7 (or higher), or Safari
        browser software.
