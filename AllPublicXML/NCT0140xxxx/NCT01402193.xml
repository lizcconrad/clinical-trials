      The purpose of this study is to compare TGF-β1 change in concomitant with that in sequential
      Arimidex in postmenopausal women with breast cancer, as measured by the proportion of
      patients with an elevation of TGF-β1 level at the 4th week after initiation of radiotherapy
      relative to the pre-treatment baseline.
