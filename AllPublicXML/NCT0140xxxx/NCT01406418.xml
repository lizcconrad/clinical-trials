  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess in healthy subjects the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of single escalating doses of CR6261, a monoclonal
      antibody against influenza A viruses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study will enroll up to 6
      cohorts of healthy subjects. Eight subjects will be enrolled in each cohort (1 to 5) and will
      receive a single 2-hour intravenous infusion of CR6261 (6 subjects) or placebo (2 subjects)
      on Day 1. Subjects will be dosed in pairs of two. Once all subjects in a cohort have
      completed Study Day 8, the preliminary safety data will be reviewed. Provided that no safety
      issues are identified, dose escalation to the subsequent cohort may be permitted.

      To obtain additional data at the 30 mg/kg dose level, a sixth cohort will be enrolled after
      the preliminary safety and tolerability of the 30 mg/kg dose in Cohort 4 is demonstrated.
      Cohort 6 will be comprised of 24 subjects (randomized 5 : 1 to CR6261 or placebo) following
      the same visit schedule as subjects in Cohorts 1-5.
