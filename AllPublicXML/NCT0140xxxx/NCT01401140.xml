  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 8% to 15% of patients hospitalized for a coronary pathology undergo coronary
      revascularization surgery with extracorporeal circulation (ECC). (1) Like most major cardiac
      surgical interventions, it is performed with the heart stopped; this leads to more or less
      severe myocardial ischemia. The heart is stopped (and therefore deprived of oxygen) for a
      duration that varies depending on the number of bypasses required, and on the local
      difficulties encountered. On average, myocardial ischemia lasts between 20 and 80 minutes.
      Heart protection during coronary revascularization surgery remains a crucial factor in
      limiting the heart's aerobic function during aortic clamping, and in minimizing the resulting
      post-operatory ventricular dysfunction. Its quality is a determining factor of the
      post-operatory issue.

      High-performance heart protection solutions such as Custodiol have been used by heart
      surgeons for a few years. They are used as an alternative choice to other cardioplegic
      solutions, the efficacy of which has already been proven (St Thomas). These two myocardial
      protection solutions have never been evaluated in an in vivo, randomized, comparative trial.

      Myocardial microdialysis is the state-of-the-art technique for evaluating the protective
      effects of cardioplegic solutions; it enables physicians to monitor oxidation-reduction
      muscle metabolism during an ongoing operation.

    <description>Once the upper aorta has been clamped, the cardioplegic solution St Thomas will be administered directly into it via an anterograde approach. St Thomas will be infused every 30 minutes at a dosage of 10ml/kg bodyweight (infusion takes about three minutes). If the heart appears to be starting again (ventricular fibrillation) for more than three minutes, infusion will be resumed at the same rate until the heart is effectively stopped.</description>

    <description>Once the upper aorta has been clamped, the cardioplegic solution Custodiol will be administered directly into it via an anterograde approach.
