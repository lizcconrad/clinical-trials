  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot/feasibility study. The study design represents a modification of current
      standard of care for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) (5580 cGY involved field
      radiation), with the final two doses of radiation given at intervals during the vaccination
      phase of treatment.

      Patients between the ages of 3 years and 25 years diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine
      Glioma (DIPG) will be allowed to participate in the trial. Study enrollment will occur after
      the completion of conformal radiation therapy to a dose of 5580 cGy and the post radiation
      therapy (RT) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows no disease progression.

      Three patients with glioblastoma multiforme, aged 16 years and older, will be entered first
      to confirm vaccine safety before enrolling DIPG patients.

    <textblock>
      Vaccine will be produced by the University Of Minnesota Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics
      Facility using the established brain tumor initiating cell (BTIC) cell line GBM-6 as the
      antigen source. Vaccine administration will begin at four weeks (week 10) following
      completion of radiation therapy and will be given every two weeks for four doses. At the time
      of the 1st and 3rd vaccinations, additional 180 cGy fractions will be delivered in single
      doses in a novel effort to induce NKG2D ligand upregulation (thereby &quot;sensitizing&quot; residual
      tumor to lymphocyte attack). The total radiation dose for each patient will be 5940 cGy.
      Subsequent vaccinations will be given every four weeks and will continue to a maximum of one
      year from study enrollment, by which time median survival will have passed based on
      historical data. Imaging will be obtained at study entry (post radiation therapy) and every
      eight weeks thereafter to eighteen months, after which time the interval between imaging
      follow-up episodes will be determined by the patient's clinical status. Imaging will include
      MRI of the brain using our current institutional brain tumor imaging protocol. Imaging will
      also include SPECT/MRI and perfusion MRI. FDG-PET imaging may be used in certain cases to
      differentiate tumor necrosis from progression.

    <description>Imaging will include MRI, SPECT/MRI and perfusion MRI. FDG-PET imaging may be also be used Response criteria: Complete responses (CR) are those in which there is a disappearance of all enhancing tumor or tumor mass on consecutive MRI scans. Patients must be off steroids, and neurologically stable or improved.
Partial responses (PR) are those in which there is a â‰¥ 50% reduction in the size of the enhancing tumor or tumor mass on consecutive MRI scans. In addition, the patient must be neurologically stable.</description>
