      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of TRC150094 in male
      patients with cardiometabolic risk. Cardiometabolic risk which is the overall risk of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes resulting from the presence of hypertension, HDL
      cholesterol, insulin resistance, dysglycemia and visceral obesity.

      20 Subjects will be enrolled in Veeda Clinical research,India and another 20 subjects at
      Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The maximum duration of participation in the study for each
      subject will be 9.5 weeks including a less than or equal to 4 weeks screening period, 4 weeks
      of treatment and a 10 days post treatment follow-up evaluation period.

      At each study site, 20 subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will attend the study centre
      in a fasting state, for a screening visit, 2 study visits (one baseline and one end of
      treatment), 1 intermediate safety visit and 1 post-study follow-up visit (Total 5 visits).
      The subjects at each site will be randomized to receive TRC150094 or placebo in a ratio of
      1:1. 50 mg dose will be administered once daily (morning) under fasting conditions. Dosing
      will take place daily on Days 1-28. Subjects will arrive at the study centre for screening
      visit. Physical examination, vital signs, safety biochemistry and laboratory investigations
      for verification of inclusion/ exclusion criteria will be performed during screening visit.
      Subjects meeting all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria and who have
      given their informed consent for the study will be asked to come for the study on Day 0 (or
      day -1 if required). Baseline investigations (including baseline clamp procedure and hepatic
      MRS) will be done on Day 0 (or day -1). Subjects will receive properly labelled bottle
      containing either Active treatment or Placebo as per the randomization number of the subject.
