  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacity of hemodiafiltration and
      hemofiltration for decreasing plasma urea at 12h among intensive care patients. Secondary
      objectives include comparing urea clearance, filter duration, and %down-time, between the two
      techniques.
