  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to assess the effect of the standard of care, which is continuation of
      the pre op beta blocker dose into the post operative period compared to the administration of
      esmolol titrated to a pre determined target HR. The primary outcome will compare
      postoperative plasma levels of metoprolol in 2 cohorts in a group who has been continued on
      metoprolol (administrated via a nasogastric tube in NPO patients) to a group who has been
      withdrawn from metoprolol but given an esmolol infusion titrated to HR. Secondary outcomes
      will compare a) the hemodynamic responses, documenting the incidence of unplanned hypotension
      and bradycardia and b) to compare the effects of Heart rate to the incidence of myocardial
      ischemia, arrhythmias, delirium and infarction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of high-risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery has increased continuously
      over the last two decades. There is a paucity of data exist about the bioavailability of
      postoperative administrated beta-blockers. One study reported adequate plasma levels of
      Propanolol after administration via nasogastric tube but not after oral administration in
      patient undergoing thyroid surgery.Thus it is possible that patients maintained on oral beta
      blockers may in fact be experiencing a withdrawal syndrome. Because of the importance of
      avoiding withdrawal of beta blockers, intravenous administration may be the only alternative
      in cases where oral administration fails to achieve adequate plasma levels perioperatively.
      Furthermore, due to changes in pharmacodynamics, intravenous dosage may be the optimal way to
      achieve tight hemodynamic control. There is, however, no data on the post-operative
      hemodynamic effects of orally administered beta blockers in patients on chronic beta
      blockers.

    <description>Comparisons measured in the pre-operative to intra-operative and post operative periods within metoprolol arm as well as between esmolol arm and metoprolol arm. Plasma levels will be correlated with both the hemodynamic response (HR) and the incidence of postoperative ischemia. The covariates (HR, BP, HR variability, etc) on PK/PD correlation will be examined.</description>
