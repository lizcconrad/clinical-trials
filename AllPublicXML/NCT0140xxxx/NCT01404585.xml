        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, 18 years of age or older, with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for
             at least 6 months prior to screening

          -  Subjects must have a tender joint count of at least 6 (28 joint count), swollen joint
             count of at least 6 (28 joint count) at screening. All subjects must have clinical
             evidence of synovitis in one hand/wrist at screening

          -  Serum C-reactive protein (hsCRP) above upper limits of normal at screening

          -  Subjects must have been treated with and tolerated Methotrexate (MTX) therapy at a
             weekly oral or parenteral dose ≥ 10 mg for ≥ 4 months prior to screening. Dose must be
             stable, with no change in route of administration, for ≥ 6 weeks prior to
             randomization. A MTX weekly dose as low as 7.5 mg is permitted if intolerance to doses
             ≥10 mg has been documented in the subject's medical history

          -  Subjects must be receiving folic acid, folinic acid, or leucovorin supplementation at
             a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization

          -  Subjects who were previously treated with up to two tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)
             inhibitors

          -  If taking antimalarials (e.g. hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine), subject must have
             been on a stable dose for ≥ 4 months prior to randomization

          -  If taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), subjects must have been on
             stable doses for ≥ 2 weeks prior to randomization

          -  If taking oral corticosteroids, daily doses must be ≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent and stable for ≥ 4 weeks before randomization

          -  Subject is willing to participate to the study and has signed the informed consent
             prior to undergoing any screening procedures

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use at least two

             (for women) and 90 days (for men) after the last dose of BMS-817399. WOCBP must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test at screening, randomization and at scheduled visits
             throughout the study
