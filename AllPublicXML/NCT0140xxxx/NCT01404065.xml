    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) combined with watching a visual illusion on chronic pain due to spinal
      cord injury. The investigators hypothesize that active tDCS will reduce pain in subjects with
      spinal cord injury when compared to sham stimulation. The investigators will also measure
      changes in EEG data (alpha and beta frequencies) as well as motor cortex excitability.

    <description>Determine whether treatment with tDCS coupled with visual illusion change cortical activity as assessed with electroencephalography (EEG). We hypothesize that tDCS plus visual illusion increase in alpha activity and inhibit beta activity and this will be associated with pain reduction in patients with moderate to severe below-level spinal cord injury (SCI) pain. EEG measurements will take place throughout the subject's participation in the study, measured at: baseline, immediately pre- and post- stimulation and at follow-up visits for a total of approximately 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>To investigate whether active tDCS combined with visual illusion induces changes in motor cortex and as indexed by single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) as compared with sham tDCS coupled with visual illusion. We will also determine whether these changes are correlated with the clinical outcome (pain reduction). TMS measurements will take place throughout the subject's participation in the study, measured at: baseline, immediately pre- and post- stimulation and at follow-up visits for a total of approximately 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo tDCS stimulation. For both active and sham stimulation, we will use electrodes of 35cm^2, at an intensity of 2mA. For active tDCS, the subject will undergo stimulation for 20 minutes. For sham stimulation, the current will be ramped up and then down again (for 30 seconds total) to simulate the feeling of active stimulation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Providing informed consent to participate in the study

          2. 18 to 64 years old

          3. With traumatic spinal cord injury (complete or incomplete) - for instance, due to
             fall, car accident or gun shot; (for spinal cord injury only)

          4. Stable chronic pain for at least the three preceding months (for spinal cord injury
             only)

          5. Score higher or equal to 4cm (0 cm= 'no pain' and 10cm='worst possible pain') on the
             Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain perception at the baseline/start of the treatment
             (for spinal cord injury only)

          6. Refractoriness to drugs for pain relief - such as tricyclic antidepressants,
             antiepileptic drugs and/or narcotics (pain resistant to at least 2 of these drugs
             supplied in adequate dosages for six months) (for spinal cord injury only)

          7. Pain is not attributable to other causes, such as peripheral inflammation

             skull fracture, or objective neurological findings that can be reasonably attributed
             to TBI as assessed by the study PI

          4. Implanted devices for pain control, such as vagal or deep brain stimulators

          7. Use of ventilators or ventilation support

          8. Complete tetraplegic lesion (no motor function in the arms) (C3 to C8) as we will be
             measuring the motor evoked potential in the FDI (upper limbs); only tetraplegic
             patients with incomplete functional status and also as defined by the ability to
