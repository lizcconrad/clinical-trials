  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GnRH (Gonadotropin-releasing hormone) antagonists in IVF (in vitro fertilization) has been
      accomplished by several randomized controlled trials compared with conventional GnRH agonist
      long protocol in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients. Moreover, there are debating
      issues that refer to the timing of GnRH antagonist initiation. The purpose of this study is
      to investigate the laboratory and clinical priority during ovarian stimulation for IVF in
      patients with PCOS treated with three different protocols.
