  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since selenium has demonstrated significant characteristics for a series of biochemical
      processes, for antioxidant activity and immune stimulation, this observational study should
      represent the effect of heart-lung-machine on selenium status of cardiac surgical patients
      undergoing coronary bypass surgery. It will be examined in (approximately 100) adult
      patients, under which 50 patients are operated conventionally (meaning with the use of
      heart-lung-machine). Another 50 patients are operated on beating heart without the use of
      heart-lung-machine (OPCAB = &quot;off pump coronary artery bypass&quot;). The allocation of individual
      patients in these two groups is done according to clinical criteria and is undertaken by the
      operating surgeon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To produce two comparable groups of patients, the characteristics are recorded using
      EURO-Score; additionally the groups are &quot;matched&quot; (Matched-Pairs-Analysis).

      All patients are operated by the same surgeon (senior physician Dr. A.K. Menon) under general
      anaesthesia through median sternotomy with elective or urgent indications.

      After induction of anaesthesia, within the first hour after admission to the Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU) and every further morning in the ICU or Intermediate Care Station (IMC), 10ml
      blood are removed by a central venous catheter, allowing to measure blood selenium levels in
      whole blood by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry.

      All blood draws will be held on vascular access, which is lying independently of the study
      participation for surgery or for intensive care treatment. The blood samples will be stored
      until completion of the study and its evaluation (up to 24 months) and are discarded
      afterwards. All data collected are recorded on a documentation sheet.
