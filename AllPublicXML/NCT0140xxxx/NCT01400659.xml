    <textblock>
      The Pizza-Salami-Study aims to investigate the efficacy of carbohydrate plus fat/protein
      (CFP) counting compared with carbohydrate (CARB) counting using normal and dual-wave bolus in
      sensor-augmented pump therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. For
      fat/protein counting the model used by Pankowska et al. will be applied.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, international multi-centre, open randomized clinical trial to assess
      whether the use of Paradigm REAL-Time System from the onset of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) leads to
      a better glycaemic control after 12 months of T1D compared with the use of Paradigm 515/715
      insulin pump combined with conventional Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose finger-sticks in
      paediatric patients. Total randomized treatment duration of the study for a patient will be
      12 months with an optional phase of follow-up of 3 months.Patients eligible according to
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups. A
      total of 160 patients will be recruited. Each subject will participate in the study for 15
      months, which includes 12 months of treatment and 3 months of follow-up. Each patient is
      asked to use either the Paradigm REAL-Time System that provides a combination of insulin pump
      and the Real-Time continuous glucose monitoring or Paradigm 515/715 insulin pump combined to
      conventional SMBG finger-sticks. Main time-points of assessments are at baseline (within one
      month after T1D onset) and 12 months thereafter. In total, there will be 6 study visits at
      the local site. During study, patients will regularly attend the outpatient clinic according
      to local Standard care, i.e. every 8±2 weeks.

The insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio will be applied according to the current individual therapy of the patient. The insulin-to-FPU ratio is the same as the insulin to carb ratio.</description>

    <description>Patients receive a standardized test meal at lunch time. The required insulin dose is calculated by CFP counting. Insulin is given as bolus and basal rate using an insulin pump. Continuous glucose monitoring is performed by sensor-augmented pump system for 6 hours after the meal. The intervention is taking part under in-patient clinical conditions.</description>
