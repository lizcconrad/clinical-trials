    <textblock>
      A timing diagnosis of candidemia is as important as the correct choice of empiric or targeted
      antifungal therapy. In the last years a growing body of knowledge has better characterized
      health-care associated (HCA) infections, which have been described in 2002 in outpatients
      with MRSA bloodstream infections. So far there is no compelling evidence that patients with
      HCA infections may develop candidemia before the usual timing of around 20-25 days after
      admission. Risk factors associated with HCA infections are represented by admission from long
      term chronic care facilities (LTCF), haemodialysis, previous admission or parenteral broad
      spectrum antibiotics. There are few data HCA features and early onset candidemias in the
      published literature.

      In this proposal, the investigators aim at studying early-onset candidemia in a retrospective
      study in one of the largest referral hospital in Italy with a consistent range of specialties
      ranging (bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, immunosuppressed patients, ICU,
      complex surgery). The investigators speculate that patients with candidemia diagnosed within
      10 days (early-onset) by the admission have different risk factors and prognosis of those
      with a late diagnosis.

        The selection of patients for inclusion will be based on microbiological data (with
        suscesptibilty patterns of the various antifungals) extracted from the computerized archive
        with search for Candida spp. and &quot;blood&quot; either peripheral or from a central venous
        catheter. Candida isolated from a removed CVC tip will not be considered. The candidemia
        will also be defined early or late based on the time elapsed between hospital admission and
        diagnosis (â‰¤ 10 days early, &gt; 10 days late candidemia).
