  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Lupus is frequent. Approximately 70% of patients with SLE will develop cutaneous
      involvement at some point during course of their disease. In spite of the esthetic
      consequence during the acute phase, the main problem is still related to its disfiguring and
      incapacitating nature. Topical steroids and/or antimalarial therapy continue to be the
      conventional therapy. Unfortunately, approximately 30% will be refractory to these measures.
      For those patients, immunosuppressive therapy can be an alternative with controversial
      results. Several series have shown a 90% of clinical efficacy in patients treated with
      Thalidomide. Unfortunately, the main drawback has been the serious described side effects
      such as fetal malformations, polyneuropathy and drowsiness. Recently, a new thalidomide
      analogue, more potent, efficient and with better safety profile has been discovered. The main
      objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lenalidomide for patients
      with Refractory cutaneous Lupus. Secondary objectives include evaluating the effect of this
      drug on the systemic manifestations of lupus disease, the adverse effects, frequency of flare
      after withdrawal, the sequela and the effect on the seric parameters. Methods: Twelve
      patients with refractory cutaneous lupus will be included. Lenalidomide will be started at
      5mg/day and tapered progressively. Blood test and EMG will be performed at onset and at the
      end of follow up.
