      A study to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of ASP3026 in patients with advanced
      malignancies (solid tumors).

      This study will be conducted using a traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation study design.
      Enrollment of at least 3 subjects is planned for each dosing cohort. The decision to expand a
      cohort or dose escalate will be based on the occurrence of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in
      Cycle 1 that are considered by the Investigator to be related (possibly or probably) to
      ASP3026. The Safety Data Review Committee may elect to enroll additional subjects in a cohort
      to further evaluate the dose level. Each cycle will include 28 days of continuous dosing with
      ASP3026. Treatment with ASP3026 may continue until one of the discontinuation criteria is
      met.

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose of ASP3026 on a dosing
      schedule at which &lt; 33% of subjects experience a DLT during Cycle 1. The MTD or lower dose,
      as determined by the Safety Data Review Committee, will be the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D). Twelve additional patients will be treated at the RP2D to further evaluate safety and
      tolerability.
