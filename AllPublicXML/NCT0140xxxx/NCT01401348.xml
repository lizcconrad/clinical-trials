      A research study to evaluate the effect of aging and HIV on neurocognitive dysfunction
      (declining ability to process information), physical frailty and heart disease. HIV-infected
      participants whose virus is controlled on antiretroviral medications will be studied to
      determine the rates and risk factors of developing these conditions.

    <textblock>
      With advances in antiretroviral therapy, the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals
      continues to improve with older individuals representing a rapidly growing proportion of
      those infected. However, despite improved life expectancy, substantial residual morbidity
      remains in treated HIV including increased rates of neurocognitive dysfunction, frailty, and
      cardiovascular disease. As these conditions also increase with normal aging, HIV is often
      thought to be a risk factor for &quot;early&quot; or &quot;accelerated&quot; aging. Prior studies have generally
      focused on HIV-specific factors and risk for neurocognitive dysfunction, frailty, and
      cardiovascular disease, while few have examined extensively risk factors found to be
      significant for these conditions in the general population.

      The investigators hypothesize that the effects of age and HIV will be synergistic on the
      rates of non-AIDS morbidity. While the correlates and risk factors for non-AIDS morbidity in
      younger individuals may largely be related to HIV, in older individuals with sustained
      virologic control, traditional risk factors for neurocognitive disease, frailty, and
      cardiovascular disease will contribute more significantly to disease than HIV-specific risk
      factors. Our primary objectives are to:

        1. Define the prevalence and incidence of neurocognitive dysfunction, frailty, and
           cardiovascular disease in a well-defined cohort of aging virologically suppressed
           HIV-infected individuals.

        2. Identify correlates and risk factors for prevalent and incident neurocognitive
           dysfunction, frailty, and cardiovascular disease.

        3. Compare and contrast the identified correlates and risk factors for the co-morbidities
           of interest in older (&gt;50 years old) and younger HIV-infected individuals.

        300 HIV-infected participants whose virus is controlled on antiretroviral medications from
        the Stanford Positive Care Clinic. Five (150) patients over 50 years old and five (150)
        patients less than 50 years old

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have an HIV RNA level below the limit of quantification (e.g., &lt;75
             copies, &lt;50 copies, or &lt;48 copies/mL, depending on the assay used) for at least 6
             months excluding &quot;blips&quot; (e.g., a single measurement between 48-200 copies/mL preceded
             and followed by measurements below the limit of quantification) while on
             antiretroviral therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Completed treatment for any acute systemic infection (other than HIV-1) less than four
             weeks before study entry.

          2. Any active brain infection (except for HIV-1), brain neoplasm, or space-occupying
             brain lesion.

          3. Receipt of immunomodulating medication (e.g., corticosteroids, immunoglobulin, etc.)
             within four weeks of study entry.

          4. Any active psychiatric illness including schizophrenia, severe depression, or severe
             bipolar affective disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound
             the analysis of the neuropsychological test results.

          5. Active drug or alcohol abuse that, in the investigator's opinion, could prevent
             compliance with study procedures or confound the analysis of study endpoints.

          6. Unable to provide informed consent
