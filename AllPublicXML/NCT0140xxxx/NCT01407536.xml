    <textblock>
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has confirmed that thermal stimulation (TS) may
      facilitate cortical excitability in healthy adults. However, it is unknown whether TS can
      increase cortical excitability in stroke patients. Compared to the fMRI, the transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) possesses more concise conditions in temporal resolution, and it
      can present the cerebrum activation situation more instantaneously. This study aimed to use
      TMS examining the effect on corticomotor excitability, reorganization and functional motor
      recovery after TS on affected upper limbs of chronic stroke patients.

      The study was an assessor-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. The participants
      (more than 3 months posts-stroke)were randomly assigned to experiment (EXP) and control (COT)
      groups. All participants received regular conventional rehabilitation programs. The EXP and
      COT received additional upper extremity TS protocol for 30 minutes a day for 20 days. The TS
      temperature of EXP for noxious stimulation was set at 46-47°C for heat and 7-8°C for cold
      stimulation; the temperature of COT for innoxious stimulation was set at 40°C for warm and
      20°C for cold stimulation. The motor and sensory performance were evaluated at baseline and
      post-20th- TS by Brunnstrom's recovery stage, Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Barthel Index
      (BI), Upper Extremity Subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Motor Function Assessment (UE-FM) and
      Thermal Quantitative Sensory Testing (tQST). At pre-1st-TS, post-1st-TS, post-10th-TS and
      post-20th-TS, focal TMS was used to obtain measurement of motor threshold (MT), motor evoked
      potentials (MEPs), size of cortical motor output map and location of the amplitude-weighted
      centre of gravity of the motor output map (CoG) from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in
      bilateral upper extremities.

    <description>The subjects meeting our criteria will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group (EXP) or the control group (COT). The EXP and COT received upper extremity thermal stimulation protocol for 30 minutes a day for 20 days. The TS temperature of EXP for noxious stimulation was set at 46-47°C for heat and 7-8°C for cold stimulation; the temperature of COT for innoxious stimulation was set at 40°C for warm and 20°C for cold stimulation.</description>
