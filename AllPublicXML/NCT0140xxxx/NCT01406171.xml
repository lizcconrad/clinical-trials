    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of isavuconazole at steady state on the
      pharmacokinetics of midazolam in healthy adult subjects.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will check-in on Day -1 and remain confined to the study center until the completion
      of study procedures on Day 14. Subjects will return to the study center for an outpatient
      follow-up visit on Day 21. Blood and urine samples will be taken at various times during the
      study.

      Subjects will receive a single dose of oral midazolam syrup on Day 1. On Days 3 and 4,
      isavuconazole will be dosed orally three times daily (TID). On Days 5 through 13,
      isavuconazole will be dosed orally once daily (QD). A single dose of oral midazolam syrup
      will be administered on Day 12.
