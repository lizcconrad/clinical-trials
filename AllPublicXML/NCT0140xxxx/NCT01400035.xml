      Trial Title：The treatment of Vinpocetine（Cavinton）in patients with cerebral infarction, an
      open, randomized, multi-center control study

        1. Objectives Evaluate the efficacy and safety of Vinpocetine（Cavinton）for treatment of
           cerebral infarction

        2. Design Open, randomized, multi-center control study

        3. Trial Population:Patients with acute cerebral infarction

        4. Number of Subjects 720 patients in test group and 240 patients in control group, totally
           960 patients will be recruited.

        5. Administration Test group: intravenous infusion drip of Vinpocetine 30 mg and Citicoline
           0.4g once daily; additionally oral take aspirin 75-100mg or clopidogrel sulfate tablets
           75mg once a day.

           Control group: intravenous infusion drip of Citicoline 0.4g once daily; additionally
           oral take aspirin 75-100mg or clopidogrel sulfate tablets 75mg once a day.

        6. Outcome evaluation 6.1 Primary end points: 6.1.1 Modified Rankin Scale. 6.1.2
           Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 6.2 Second end points 6.2.1 Barthel index 6.2.2
           NIHSS score 6.2.3 Transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination 6.3 Safety data 6.3.1 Serology,
           hepatic and renal function examination 6.3.2 Adverse events

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of this study is a randomized, open, multi-center and control study. The patients
      with cerebral infarction are as the study objects. Coronal CT / MRI examination combined with
      NIHSS and Modified Ranking Scale, MMSE, Barthel index, Transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination
      are applied to evaluate the Vinpocetine treatment efficacy and safety for cerebral infarction
      [14]. From ethical side, all patients will receive a conventional therapy, and based on it,
      the test group will be given intravenous injection of Vinpocetine as add-on treatment.
      Observation period is 10-14 days, and follow up for 3 months.
