    <time_frame>week 0 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The primary aim of this study is to analyze metabolic profiles as well as expression data in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis undergoing systemic treatment with TNF_-inhibitor agents (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab) and fumaric acid ester (FAE) in order to identify clinical and metabolomic markers that underlie variability in response to therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of metabolomic signatures associated with psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary aim is to identify metabolomic signatures associated with psoriasis and to identify possible treatment-specific metabolomic signatures.
It is anticipated, to get insights into mechanisms of anti-TNF drug action and response as well as first indications for metabotypes that are associated with psoriasis. In addition, genetic variants correlated to these metabotypes might be identified.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients aged 18 - 80 years, body weight ≤ 180 kg

          -  Dermatological diagnosis of psoriasis

          -  Initiated therapy with TNFα-inhibitor agents (etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab)or
             fumaric acid ester (FAE) within the scope of routine patient care by treating
             physician

          -  Signed informed consent from patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of any skin condition that would interfere with the evaluation
             of psoriasis

          -  Use of systemic anti-psoriatic drugs such as steroids, retinoids, methotrexate,
             cyclosporine within 30 days of Visit 1 or used FAE or other any biologic agent such as
             etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab within 12 weeks prior to Visit 1

          -  Patients who are considered potentially unreliable or where it is envisaged the
             patient may not consistently attend scheduled study visits

          -  Patients who are unable to complete a patient diary or complete questionnaires on
             paper

          -  Patients with any other condition or prior/current treatment, which in the opinion of
             the investigator renders the patient ineligible for the study schedule

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant unless they use effective contraception during the study. Effective
             contraception is defined as either: use of established oral, injected or implanted
             hormonal
