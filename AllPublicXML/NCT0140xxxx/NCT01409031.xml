      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intravenous sildenafil reduces pulmonary
      artery pressure and improves oxygenation in near-term and term infants with persistent
      pulmonary hypertension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Term infants with respiratory failure and persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) are among
      the most critically ill infants in the NICU, with significant mortality and morbidity
      reported even for infants with moderate disease. Currently, management is largely supportive,
      and includes oxygen, mechanical ventilation (conventional or high frequency ventilation), and
      exogenous surfactant therapy. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is a pulmonary vasodilator that was
      approved for the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) and PPHN of the newborn in
      1999 based on clinical trials showing a reduction in the need for rescue treatment with
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

      One promising therapy to decrease pulmonary arterial pressure and improve oxygenation is
      sildenafil. Sildenafil is a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor that causes relatively
      selective pulmonary vasodilation. The use of intravenous (IV) sildenafil was recently FDA
      approved for use in adults in PPHN. A pilot trial studying dose response and pharmacokinetics
      in 36 term newborns with PPHN found that IV sildenafil was well tolerated and has the
      potential to induce marked improvements in oxygenation. The data from this pilot trial
      provided background to support the dosing regimen for this Phase II trial. We hypothesize
      that IV sildenafil will acutely reduce pulmonary artery pressure and improve oxygenation in
      near-term and term infants with PPHN, thus reducing the need for rescue therapy iNO and/or
      ECMO.
