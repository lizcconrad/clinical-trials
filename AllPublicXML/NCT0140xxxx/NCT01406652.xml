      Th study investigates prospectively the cost-savings related to a one-stage bursectomy
      (debridement, drainage and closure at the same time) versus two-stage bursectomy
      (debridement, left open and closure at a second time) of severe bursitis among hospitalized
      patients for surgical treatment of septic bursitis.

      We suppose that the one-stage bursectomy reveals similar recurrence rates but is associated
      with a significant shortening of hospital stay, consumption of resources and increased
      patient satisfaction.

      Start as single center interventional study at Geneva University Hospitals Study open for
      additional centres (electronic CRF) Funding on 24.6.2011 (50,000 Swiss Francs). Further
      demand for funding ongoing.

      Spetic bursitis of knee and elbows, for which the patients are hospitalised (a substantial
      part of patient with failure of conservative treatement) Randomisation 1:1 (one-stage vs.
      two-stage).

      Duration of concomitant postsurgical antibiotic therapy fixed to 7 days Exclusion of severely
      immuno-depressed patients.

      Assessment of all costs of inpatient treatement and outpatient follow-up of included cases.

      Interim analysis after ca. 100 cases planified

    <description>Onestage bursectomy is associated with significantly reduced costs of overall treatement of septic bursitis compared to a two-stage approach.
The cost reduction concerns probably all strata of cost evaluation: surgery and anesthesiology costs, nursing costs, costs related to postoperative follow-ups, medication use, and absence from work</description>
