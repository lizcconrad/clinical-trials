  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased glycemic variability has been proposed as an independent predictor of hypoglycemia
      in diabetic patients. Likewise, episodes of dysglycemia have been found to be predictive of
      diabetes in antibodypositive nondiabetic individuals. We hypothesise that an in-depth
      observational study comparing state-of-the-art measures of functional beta cell mass and
      glycemic variability will specify the relationship between both variables over a broad range
      of residual function and will identify treatment goals for functional beta cell mass to be
      reached in future beta cell therapy trials in order to avoid frequent hypoglycemia in
      patients and dysglycemia in risk groups. The available expertise and infrastructure (see
      background and (inter)national context) place the promoters of the present project in a
      unique position to carry out the planned experiments and support their feasibility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The established clinical network and the developed dynamic function tests and biological
      markers provide us with the unique opportunity to identify sufficiently large groups of
      high-risk first-degree relatives (&gt; 50% risk of diabetes) of a proband with type 1 diabetes
      and of recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients with the overall aim to investigate the
      correlation between functional beta cell mass and glycemic variability in relation to
      metabolic outcome in order to determine thresholds of residual function below which:

        1. glucose tolerance starts to decline sharply in relatives

        2. the risk of deteriorating metabolic control and (severe) hypoglycemic events strongly
           increases in patients

      To this effect we will:

        1. measure and follow over a two-year period

             1. the functional beta cell mass of participants as determined by AUC C-peptide
                release - the preferred outcome measure in type 1 diabetes trials during
                hyperglycemic clamp test

             2. the participants' within- and between-day glycemic variability as determined by
                seven point selfmonitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose
                monitoring (CGM) during 5 days preceding each clamp procedure

        2. perform oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs; only in relatives), determine HbA1c levels
           centrally (relatives and patients) and record insulin requirements and hypoglycemic
           episodes (in patients) Our previous experiments have documented that the selected
           patients and relatives (see workplan) display large inter-individual differences in
           functional beta cell mass (ranging anywhere between control values and &lt; 10% of
           controls) allowing to study glycemic variability as a function of residual cell function
           over a large range of values. They also illustrate that the recruitment capacity of the
           clinical network and the acceptance rate and compliance of the patients and relatives
           for the clamp procedure is high and sufficient to carry out the planned experiments.

    <description>In newly diagnosed patients a hyperglycemic clamp tests will be performed within 4 weeks after diagnosis and 6, 12, 18 and 24 months later in 40 patients. The clamp will not be carried out in participants who became Cpeptide negative (defined as AUC C-peptide â‰¤ 0.03 nmol/L x min.) at a previous visit. HbA1c will be determined at the day of the clamp and glycemic variability during 5 days starting immediately after the clamp procedure. Insulin requirements and severe hypoglycemia (defined as an episode in which a patient required the assistance of another person and which was associated with a blood level of &lt; 50 mg/dL or prompt recovery following intravenous glucose, glucagon or oral carbohydrate) will be recorded</description>
