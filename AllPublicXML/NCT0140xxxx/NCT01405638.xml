  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Aim: To evaluate the effect of a lifestyle intervention delivered through
      telephone-based motivational interviewing (MINT) versus a patient navigation intervention on
      blood pressure reduction and CRC screening.

      Hypotheses: Among black men, aged &gt; 50 years with uncontrolled HTN and in need of CRC
      screening:

        1. Hyp. 1: those randomized to the lifestyle intervention will have lower BP compared to
           those randomized to the patient navigation intervention at 6 months.

        2. Hyp. 2: those randomized to the patient navigation intervention will have higher CRC
           screening rates compared to those randomized to the lifestyle intervention at 6 months.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary outcomes will be (1) within-patient change in systolic and diastolic BP from
      baseline to 6 months and (2) CRC screening rates as determined by colonoscopy report or fecal
      immunochemical test (FIT) result from the primary care provider at 6 months. Blood pressure
      will be assessed with an automated digital BP monitor based on American Heart Association
      guidelines.1 CRC screening will be assessed by self-report and verified with medical records
      and/or the actual colonoscopy or FIT report from participants' providers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be age 50 years or older

          -  Participants must have a working telephone (a necessary criterion since much of the
             interventions are telephone based)

          -  Self-identified as a black or African American and male

          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension defined as SBP&gt;135 mmHg or DBP&gt;85 mmHg and SBP &gt;130
             mmHg or DBP &gt;80 mmHg (in those with diabetes) at the screening

          -  Have a need for CRC screening defined as: 1) no colonoscopy in the last 10 years; 2)
             no Flexible sigmoidoscopy, Digital Contrast Barium Enema or CT-colonoscopy in the last
             5 years, or 3) no Fecal Immunochemical Test or Fecal Occult Blood Test in the last 12
             months.

          -  All participants must be fluent in English. Certain measures used have not been
             verified in other languages.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to comply with the study protocol (either self-selected or by indicating
             during screening that he could not complete all requested tasks).
