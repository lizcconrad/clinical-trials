    <textblock>
      Tachyphylaxis occurs when a medication is applied multiple times and a decreased response
      takes place. Many dermatologists believe that tachyphylaxis to topical steroids commonly
      occur. Other believe that tachyphylaxis can be explain by patient non-compliance with topical
      medications. This study is looking to prove or disprove the phenomenon of tachyphylaxis by
      using topical steroids in the psoriasis patient population. The investigators are looking to
      enroll 10 patients with symmetric, bilateral, and small psoriasis plaques. The investigators
      will either apply a strong topical steroid or a vehicle ointment to the plaques, which is be
      occluded with a band aid for a one week period. Weekly, the investigators will inspect the
      plaques for tachyphylaxis. This regimen will be repeated during phase 2, to see if there is
      change in the time to tachyphylaxis. This regimen will be repeated during phase 3, however,
      both plaques will be treated with steroid in this phase, and time to tachyphylaxis will be
      measured.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be at least 18 years of age and in good general health as confirmed by a
             medical history.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test on
             Baseline/Week 0 and must agree to use adequate birth control methods during the entire
             study (a barrier method i.e. condoms, diaphragm; hormonal contraceptives i.e. birth
             control pills, implants, or injections; intrauterine device, or abstinence).

          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with stable plaque psoriasis affecting 1% to 10% body
             surface area (excluding the face, scalp, groin, axillae or other intertriginous
             areas).

          -  Subjects receiving phototherapy for their psoriasis.

          -  Subjects must have at least two symmetrical lesions suitable for evaluating response
             to test agents (one on the right side and one on the left side of the body). The
             severity of the disease for each target lesion at Baseline/Week 0 must be rated at
             least 2 (Mild) for each of the key psoriasis characteristics (scaling, erythema, and
             plaque elevation) on the Target Lesion Severity Score.

          -  Subjects must be able to understand the requirements of the study abide by the
             restrictions and return for the required examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy during the study.

          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any components of the test medication.

          -  Subjects with non-plaque psoriasis (e.g. guttate, erythrodermic) or other related
             diseases not classified as plaque psoriasis.

          -  Subjects whose psoriasis involves only the scalp, face, groin, axillae, and/or other
             intertriginous areas.

          -  Subjects requiring any other medication (topical or systemic) that may affect the
             course of the disease during the study period as determined by the study
             investigators.

          -  Subjects using biologics or any other systemic treatment (e.g. immunosuppressants,
             acitretin) for psoriasis within 12 weeks of entering the study.

          -  Subjects using systemic corticosteroids within 28 days of entering the study

          -  Subjects using topical corticosteroids or other topical therapies (other than
             emollients) at the treatment area locations within 14 days of entering the study

          -  Subjects using phototherapy (UVB, PUVA) on target treatment sites within 4 weeks of
             entering the study.

          -  Subjects with overt pre-existing telangiectasias or skin atrophy at intended treatment
             sites (treatment areas).

          -  Subjects who are using any medication or has any disease which in the judgment of the
             investigator will interfere with the conduct or interpretation of the study.
