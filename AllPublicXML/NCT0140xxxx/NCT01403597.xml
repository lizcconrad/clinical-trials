  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine the safety, efficacy, patient comfort and patient
      satisfaction of the combined treatment of Refirme ST and Matrix RF both devices approved
      under 510k clearances. The evaluations will include skin condition, physician/subject
      improvement assessment, and subject comfort and satisfaction score by questionnaires.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Refirme ST and the Matrix RF applicators are both FDA approved devices indicated for
      improvement of skin appearance. The Matrix RF applicator has FDA clearance for ablation,
      resurfacing of the skin, and for wrinkles treatment, whereas the Refirme-ST applicator has
      FDA clearance for non-invasive wrinkles treatment. The combined treatment of Refirme ST and
      Matrix RF is intended to improve skin appearance both by enhancement of collagen production
      as the result of the Refirme ST primary heating of the treated area and by causing ablation
      and resurfacing of the skin with the Matrix RF. In the current clinical setting, each
      applicator is used in a separate session although there is no contra-indication preventing
      the usage of these applicators in the same treatment session. A combined treatment in one
      session is believed to be more efficient and will be more time effective for the patient and
      therefore will have a commercial benefit for the manufacturer.
