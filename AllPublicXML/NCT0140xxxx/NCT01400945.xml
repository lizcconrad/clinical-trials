    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopy is performed at baseline and 4 week. All patients whose esophageal lesions are graded (LA Grade A, B, C and D). The study is completed for the patients whose esophageal lesions are healed. However patients whose esophageal lesions are not healed at 4 week were treated for an additional 4 week with endoscopy repeated at 8 week. At 8 week, the study is completed regardless healing of esophageal lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>4 week</time_frame>
    <description>Patients recorded the improvement of typical reflux symptoms such as heartburn, acid regurgitation, acid reflux and esophagus irritation on diary card. The presence of symptoms are classified to absence (Score 0), mild (Score 1), moderate (Score 2), severe (Score 3) and very severe (Score 4).</description>
