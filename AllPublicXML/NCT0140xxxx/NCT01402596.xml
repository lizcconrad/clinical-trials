  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thousands of children receive sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions annually,
      and this number is expected to increase. Children are at higher risk for sedation-related
      complications than adults. In different scenarios, multiple drugs are used to achieve
      sedation, each one with particular adverse events that must be monitored and reported.

      Children that need CT scans for traumatic brain injuries often need sedation, without needing
      and IV line for that. Chloral hydrate is an hypnotic agent used since 1832 with low incidence
      of adverse events; however, despite its worldwide use, it's being abandoned due to bitter
      taste, long time of sedation onset, vomiting and mild sedation. Intranasal midazolam, on the
      other hand, produces high and fast concentrations on CSF with greater rates of success but
      probably with higher adverse events. There are no prospective studies with large series of
      patients using intranasal midazolam.

      The aim of this study is to determine if nasal midazolam is a safer approach and more
      effective sedative regimen when compared to rectal chloral hydrate to children undergoing CT
      scans.

    <description>Patients vital signs and adverse events will be monitored through patient stay in the emergency department. Mean time after sedation is about three hours.
Variables collected include Ramsay score for sedation. To consider hospital discharge, we will try to validate Aldrette score and compare the scores between the two arms. Mean time to onset of sedation and time of emergency department stay will also be compared as a mark of efficacy of these two drugs.</description>
