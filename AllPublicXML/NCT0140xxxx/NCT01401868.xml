      The purpose of this study is to determine the tolerability of ME-143, find the maximum
      tolerated dose, dose limiting toxicities, and the safety profile in patients with refractory
      solid tumors. In addition, the study is planned to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile
      of ME-143 and describe any clinical anti-tumor activity observed in patients.

    <description>experimental drug, dose escalation with 4 dose cohorts of 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg; Cycle 1 is 3 weekly IV infusions on Days 1, 8 and 15. If either the 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg dose levels are not tolerable, a 7.5 mg/kg or a 15 mg/kg dose level will be evaluated. After safety assessment, if there is clinical benefit, weekly dosing may continue until withdrawal.
Once the highest tolerated dose has been determined, patients will be enrolled to receive IV infusions 2-days per week. Cycle 1 at the highest dose level is 3 weekly IV infusions on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16. After safety assessment, if there is clinical benefit, weekly dosing may continue until withdrawal.</description>
