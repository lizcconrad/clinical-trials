  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fluid and electrolyte imbalance (FEI) is pretty common encountered during the clinical
      process of patients suffered sellar lesions. Moreover, if the patients are undergone the
      surgery for remove the lesion, FEI happens in all cases without exception. Hypo- and
      hyper-natremia is the most common electrolyte disorder, which is directly correlated to the
      patients' outcome. However, in clinical works, different sellar diseases cause variant
      features of FEI. For example, after the surgery of craniopharyngioma, the hyponatremia and
      hypernatremia always happen alternatively even without any precursor manifestation. Under
      this situation, it is quite difficult for fluid supplement. In contrast, the severe FEI will
      cause poor outcome, even death. So it is necessary to systematically collect and review the
      clinical data of sellar lesions. Through the analysis of variant FEI patterns of sellar
      diseases, more precise strategy for clinical fluid replacement will be proposed.
