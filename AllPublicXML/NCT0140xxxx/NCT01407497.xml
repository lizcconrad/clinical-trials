  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While antiretroviral drugs have shown great promise in reducing HIV replication and thus in
      reducing HIV/AIDS associated morbi-mortality and HIV transmission, the cost is substantial
      and side effects are a potentially limiting factor. Development of an effective
      safe-affordable vaccine is likely to be the best way to stop further virus spread. The study
      aims to determine safety and immunogenicity of the DNA-vaccine at a dose of 600µg and 1200µg
      delivered id in combination with MVA-CMDR boost im.

    <description>The safety of immunization will be assessed by clinical features and standard clinical chemistry and hematological tests. Safety endpoints: Adverse events will be assessed using a standard format for soliciting local and systemic reactogenicity to the vaccine and collection of unsolicited adverse events. Solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated for 7 days following each vaccination. All other AE will be collected from the time of first injection until the end of the study follow-up period.</description>

    <measure>Immunogenicity</measure>
    <time_frame>44 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary immunogenicity endpoint will be determined by the interferon gamma (IFN-gama) enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay.
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints will include cellular immune responses determined by intracellular cytokine staining and T cell proliferation assays as well as binding antibody and neutralizing antibody responses.</description>
