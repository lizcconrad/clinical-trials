    <textblock>
      This study will treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis with MRC375 (either 75 mg 3
      times a day, 150 mg 3 times a day or placebo 3 times a day)in patients 18 years of age or
      older that can be currently on low doses of methotrexate or can stop treatment of current RA
      medications to enter the study. Safety of MRC375 will also be evaluated. There are up to 8
      clinic visits over 24 weeks.

      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of MRC375 at 75 mg or 150 mg with matching placebo (taken tid with meal or light
      snack) in patients with moderate to severe RA. Patients will be randomized to one of the
      following study arms for 24 weeks:

        -  Treatment 1, Placebo: 2 tablets taken tid

        -  Treatment 2, MRC375: 1 tablet of 75 mg tetracycline HCL plus 1 matching placebo tablet
           taken tid. Total daily dose = 225 mg.

        -  Treatment 3, MRC375: 2 tablets of 75 mg tetracycline HCL taken tid. Total daily dose =
           450 mg.

      Study medication should be taken within 30 minutes of a meal or light snack (either before or
      after).
