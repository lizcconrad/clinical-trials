      Study of safety of Saizen® in children born with serious intra-uterine growth retardation
      (IUGR) treated to final height. An open, phase III study involving 17 centers in France.

      The study enrolled children who have completed 3 or 2 years of treatment and at least one
      year of post treatment observation in the Sponsor Studies GF 4001 (Safety and Efficacy of
      Saizen in the Treatment of Young Children Born with Severe IUGR) or GF 6283 (Effect of
      Intermittent versus Continuous Saizen Therapy in Young Children Born with Severe IUGR),
      respectively.

      Detailed description: Serious IUGR is a syndrome characterized by low birth length and weight
      for gestational age (less than 10 percentile). The secretion of growth hormone in response to
      provocative stimuli (e.g. arginine, insulin) is normal in these children. Apart from low
      birth weight, children born with IUGR may have minor or major malformations.

      A catch-up period with a supraphysiological growth velocity generally occurs during the first
      6 to 24 months of life in 80 to 90 percent (%) of these children. This generally allows them
      to reach normal height. That means that conversely, approximately 10 to 20% of children do
      maintain a statural handicap. Puberty occurs at a normal age and the retardation in bone
      maturation present during the first years of life disappears very quickly. This leads to
      short adult stature in subjects who have not shown spontaneous catch-up during the first
      years of life. A safe and effective means of promoting growth without accelerating the timing
      or tempo of puberty would therefore be desirable.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Final Height</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after final height was attained up to 10.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Final height was defined as the height reached 1 year after height velocity (HV) was less than 2 centimeter/year (cm/year). Height velocity was the change in height since the previous year's measurement. Height was measured with a wall-mounted stadiometer (or in supine position if the participant's age was less than 3 years) and the measurement was repeated thrice by the same observer. The mean of the values obtained in the repeated measurements was taken for the analysis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Height Standard Deviation Score (HSDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after final height was attained up to 10.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>HSDS was calculated as height minus reference mean height divided by SD of the reference mean height, both given by the reference growth table (Sempe) for the corresponding chronological age at the height measurement. Greater HSDS indicate greater height. (Sempe M et al., 1979)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parental Adjusted Height Standard Deviation Score (PAHSDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year after final height was attained up to 10.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>PAHSDS is the distance between the participant's current and target heights, expressed in units of SD of the height distribution of the reference population. Target height is a measure of the height which the participant could hypothetically reach based only on his parents' heights. Target height standard deviation score (THSDS) was calculated as target height minus mean adult height of the reference population divided by SD of the mean adult height of the reference population.</description>

        <title>Final Height</title>
        <description>Final height was defined as the height reached 1 year after height velocity (HV) was less than 2 centimeter/year (cm/year). Height velocity was the change in height since the previous year’s measurement. Height was measured with a wall-mounted stadiometer (or in supine position if the participant’s age was less than 3 years) and the measurement was repeated thrice by the same observer. The mean of the values obtained in the repeated measurements was taken for the analysis.</description>
        <time_frame>One year after final height was attained up to 10.6 years</time_frame>
        <population>Intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all participants enrolled in this study. Safety population was identical in this study.</population>

        <title>Parental Adjusted Height Standard Deviation Score (PAHSDS)</title>
        <description>PAHSDS is the distance between the participant’s current and target heights, expressed in units of SD of the height distribution of the reference population. Target height is a measure of the height which the participant could hypothetically reach based only on his parents’ heights. Target height standard deviation score (THSDS) was calculated as target height minus mean adult height of the reference population divided by SD of the mean adult height of the reference population.</description>
        <time_frame>One year after final height was attained up to 10.6 years</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included all participants enrolled in this study. Safety population was identical in this study.</population>
