  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a
      treatment module addressing the mental health and functional impact of killing in the war
      zone.

      The investigators will enroll between 12-20 Veterans who have killed in war and have been
      diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for a pilot study assessing the efficacy
      of the six-session treatment. Veterans will be randomized either to the treatment or to the
      waitlist control group.
