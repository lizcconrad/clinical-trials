      The goal in this research is to develop better ways to detect and treat the damage caused by
      bleeding in the brain.

    <textblock>
      Patients who suffer from a bleeding in the brain (stroke or hemorrhage) often experience
      secondary complications that can occur up to 2 weeks after the initial bleeding.
      Complications can include decrease of consciousness, weakness or paralysis, difficulty with
      speech and language, and worsening of brain damage. These decrease a patient's chances for a
      good recovery. A brain scan will be used to determine the damage caused by the bleeding, and
      the brain's electrical activity will be monitored to detect abnormal activity. These measures
      will be analyzed together with routine medical information to better understand and diagnose
      complications.

          2. Only a thin diffuse layer or no visible subarachnoid blood in the initial CT

          3. Admission in a clinical state with unfavourable prognosis (e.g., bilateral dilated,
             non-reactive pupils for more than 1h)
