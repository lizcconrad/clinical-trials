  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known the efficacy of 5% 5-fluoruracil for multiple and superficial actinic
      keratosis (AKs)treatment. Recently its additional benefit for advanced and severe photoaging
      while treating Aks was reported.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of the two modalities of 5% 5-FU
      use for forearms photoaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of 5% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream, twice a day, during 3 weeks represents a classic
      treatment for multiple and superficial AKs. The main adverse event is the severe skin
      irritation leading to interruption of the treatment in some cases. In the last decade a
      superficial pulse-peeling using it as agent in sequential applications was described. This
      modality of treatment has been demonstrated efficacy and better tolerability.

      The improvement of the overall aspect of photodamaged skin is observed while treating
      multiple AKs.

      There are no comparative study between the two types of 5% 5-FU use. So that is the purpose
      of our clinical trial.

    <description>Photographic blinded evaluation by two independent observers, comparing modifications of forearms skin overall aspect before and after 60 and 180 days of the treatments. The following 5 point scale will be used: -2=much worse; -1=worse; 0=inlatered; 1=better, 2= much better</description>

    <measure>Change in Microscopic Evaluation</measure>

    <description>Skin biopsies will be performed and coloration by hematoxilin-eosin, Verhoeff, Tricromio Masson , Picrosirius and biomarkers (p53, bcl2, collagen 1)will be used. The modifications on corneal layer and epidermal thickness, dermal elastotic material and collagen deposition and biomarkers expression will be evaluated by digital quantitative analysis, comparing the findings before (day 0) and after (day 180)treatments.</description>

    <description>Investigator efficacy evaluation through actinic keratosis counting, on days 0, 30, 60 and 180 as weel as modification on forearms skin overall aspect. That will be performed by comparision of skin examination on days 60 and 180 to photography captured on days 0 and 60, i.e, 0 to 60, 60 to 180 and 0 to 180, using a 5 point scale: -2=much worse; -1=worse; 0=inaltered; 1=better, 2= much better</description>

    <description>A classification will be created and validated by investigators and five independent observers previously to classify forearm photoaging. After validation it will be applied to study subjects on days 0, 60 and 180 to evaluate modification on the forearm photoaging grade for each tretament.</description>
