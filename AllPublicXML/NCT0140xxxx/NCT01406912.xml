    <textblock>
      A multicentre, randomized, two parallel group study comparing virtual reality using Wii
      gaming technology versus Recreational activities in patients receiving conventional
      rehabilitation after an ischemic stroke.

      Primary Hypothesis: Virtual reality using the Wii gaming system is more efficacious in
      improving motor function than recreational therapy among patients receiving conventional
      rehabilitation following a recent ischemic stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Virtual reality (VR) gaming systems are novel and potentially useful technologies that allow
      users to interact in three dimensions with a computer-generated scenario (a virtual world).
      In particular, the Nintendo Wii gaming system applies relevant concepts in rehabilitation
      (i.e. repetition, intensity, and task-oriented training of the paretic extremity) showing
      benefits in motor function improvement after stroke. While standard rehabilitation (i.e.
      physiotherapy and occupational therapy) helps improve motor function after stroke, the
      magnitude of its benefit is suboptimal. The implementation of conventional rehabilitation is
      resource-intensive and costly, usually requiring transportation of patients and affecting
      adherence. Moreover, as improvement of motor function may be achieved after multiple sessions
      over a period of rehabilitation. The duration and intensity of the rehabilitation strategy
      are important factors in its effectiveness. Some studies compared an intervention plus
      conventional physical therapy versus conventional physical therapy alone, which by necessity
      allowed for more rehabilitation time in the experimental group. This creates a bias in favour
      of the new intervention as the intensity and frequency of rehabilitation per se is known to
      directly and beneficially affect functional outcomes. Therefore, the investigators are
      proposing comparing VR Wii versus an active control [(recreational activities (RA)].

    <time_frame>1 (±3) days after the end of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy in motor function improvement at the end of the intervention will be measured by the abbreviated Wolf Motor Function Test. The Wolf MFT is a time-based method to evaluate upper extremity performance while providing insight into total limb movements. It consists of 15 timed measures and 2 force-based measures which progress in complexity. Difference in Wolf MFT is one of the most commonly used outcome measures in stroke rehabilitation trials.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in motor function, performing activities of daily living, and quality of life, as well as sustainability of motor improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>End of intervention and 4 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary efficacy outcome measures include Box &amp; Block Test, quality of life as measured by the Stroke Impact Scale, and Barthel Index at the end of the interventions. In addition, sustainability of motor improvement will be assessed through the Wolf Motor Function Test and Box &amp; Block Test conducted at 4 weeks post-intervention, which is approximately 3 months from stroke onset.</description>

    <description>Secondary safety outcome will be measured as the proportion of patients experiencing intervention-related adverse events (e.g. pain, dizziness), or any serious adverse event (death, life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity) during the study period. We will also measure patients' perceived exertion after treatment by using the Borg Perceived Exertion scale (excessive fatigue defined as any score &gt; 13 points)</description>
