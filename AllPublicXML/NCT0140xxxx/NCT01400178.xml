      Objectives: To assess a group of post-lingually children after 10 years of implantation with
      regard to speech perception, speech intelligibility, and academic/occupational status.

      Study Design: A prospective transversal study. Setting: Pediatric referral center for
      cochlear implantation. Patients: Ten post-lingually deafened children with Nucleus and Med-El
      cochlear implants.

      Interventions: Speech perception and speech intelligibility tests and interview.

      Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measures were score of Hint sentences recognition
      (silence and noise), speech intelligibility scores(write-down intelligibility and rating
      scale scores) and academic/ occupational status.

        The age at evaluation was 19,3 to 29,2 years. The age at cochlear implant surgery was 5,4
        to 16,10 years. The etiology of the deafness was: meningitis (5), ototoxic (1), mumps (2)
        and unknown (2).
