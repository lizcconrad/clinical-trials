  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying motivational interviewing (MI). MI is a counseling method to
      help people adopt healthy behaviors. The investigators will test whether MI improves
      patients' accurate use of glaucoma eye drops. The investigators will train eye clinic staff
      called glaucoma educators to use MI. Up to 250 patients at 3 clinics will be recruited. All
      patients will receive their usual eye care. Based on chance, some patients will also be
      supported by a glaucoma educator. The groups will be compared on medication adherence using
      micro-electro-mechanical system(MEMS). MEMS are electronic bottle caps that track when a
      medication bottle is opened. Patients will be aware that their medication use is tracked. The
      groups will also be compared on treatment value, outcomes, and cost. The investigators will
      also collect data on variables that may predict medication adherence.

    <measure>Primary Outcomes - MEMS-based Medication Adherence and Persistence:</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Compare adherence and persistence between the intervention and control groups. (Medication Event Monitoring Systems)that record the date and time a pill bottle is opened we are evaluating the percentage of prescribed doses taken during ain one-week intervals, but will augment it by also considering a more fine-grained percentage of prescribed doses taken in required dosing window (defined as within 3 hours before or after the scheduled time) as a second primary outcome measure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Counselor-Rated Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Month</time_frame>
    <description>we will supplement MEMS-based adherence metrics with a counselor rating of adherence completed by the glaucoma educator during each in-person or telephone contact with intervention group participants. The interview also measures patients' perceived reasons for nonadherence, including treatment cost, lack of commitment based on low perceived benefits of treatment, and fear of potential adverse drug events (ADEs)</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  community-dwelling adults with primary or secondary open-angle glaucoma, and

          -  a current prescription for monotherapy topical glaucoma medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patient-reported inability to administer eye drops that cannot be addressed
             successfully through in-person instruction at the clinic,

          -  cognitive impairment at a level that would in the judgment of the referring physician
             interfere with study participation,

          -  referring physician's determination that glaucoma surgery is likely within the next 6
             months,

          -  any active medical, psychological, or substance use disorder that would in the
             referring physician's judgment significantly interfere with study participation (e.g.,
             comorbid congestive heart failure (CHF) resulting in a recent hospitalization; active
             psychosis due to uncontrolled bipolar disorder; etc.), or

          -  no visual field test within the past 6 months (data required for the randomization
             approach described below).
