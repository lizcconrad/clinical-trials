  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitro fertilization for infertility has been associated with a significant amount of
      treatment related stress for patients. In addition,stress levels increase between embryo
      transfer and pregnancy test, during this waiting period. The investigators evaluated whether
      or not brief interventions by phone by trained social workers influenced stress levels. Our
      data showed that these interventions did not change levels, but confirmed that stress did
      increase during this time and that patients report wanting additional emotional support to
      improve stress during this period.

    <description>Standard of care includes discharge instructions from one of our IVF nurses regarding medications and timing of follow-up, at which point patients are told what day they need to return for their pregnancy test. Patients have access to phone numbers for their IVF nurses and physicians, as well as information about how to contact the social workers if additional support is needed. They also are provided the emergency phone numbers for after-hour calls to the fellow on call. However, during the time between the embryo transfer and the pregnancy test, the current standard of care is that contact between the patient and our team is patient-initiated.</description>

    <description>The intervention consisted of two phone calls from an IVF social worker during the time between embryo transfer and pregnancy test. The first phone call occurred between days 2-4 after transfer and the second phone call occurred between days 5 and 9 after embryo transfer. Standard language for introductions to phone calls and for voice mails was established prior to the start of the study.</description>
