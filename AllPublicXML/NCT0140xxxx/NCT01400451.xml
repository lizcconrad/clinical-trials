    <textblock>
      Treatment of subjects who have metastatic melanoma that expresses an activated mutant form of
      the BRAF oncogene (V600E) with a combination of the specific BRAF inhibitor, Vemurafenib, and
      the Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor mAb Ipilimumab will be safe and
      feasible and will show preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy and survival in comparison
      to historical results following treatment with either agent alone.

      <recruitment_details>Study started Nov 2011; Primary Endpoint April 2013; Completed safety follow-up December 2013. Dose-limiting toxicities observed early in dose escalation (Phase I) part of the study. The combination of drugs was not well tolerated, and a maximum tolerable dose was not attained so the study was closed to enrollment and Phase II part was not started.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>18 participants enrolled; 12 treated with study drug and 6 participants were not treated because they no longer met study criteria. Two of the 12 only received vemurafenib while the other 10 received the combination of vemurafenib and ipilimumab.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Lead In Period: 28 Days of 960 mg vemurafenib orally twice daily (starting Day -27 or -13).
Combination Treatment (Induction of ipilimumab) Period: 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight (mg/kg) ipilimumab intravenously once every 3 weeks for 4 weeks (Week 1, Week 4, Week 7, Week 10) starting on Day 1 plus 960 mg vemurafenib orally twice daily throughout combination treatment.</description>

Combination Treatment (Induction of ipilimumab) Period: 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight (mg/kg) ipilimumab intravenously once every 3 weeks for 4 weeks (Week 1, Week 4, Week 7, Week 10) starting on Day 1 plus 720 mg vemurafenib orally twice daily throughout combination treatment.</description>

          <description>These participants were receiving 720 mg vemurafenib in the Lead in Period prior to starting ipilimumab but after the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were identified ipilimumab was not started. Due to disease stabilization, they continued on 720 mg vemurafenib alone orally twice daily. Note: the dose of vemurafenib could be escalated from 720 mg to 960 mg, at the investigator’s discretion.</description>

Combination Treatment (Induction of ipilimumab) Period: 3 milligrams per kilogram body weight (mg/kg) ipilimumab intravenously once every 3 weeks for 4 weeks (Week 1, Week 4, Week 7, Week 10) starting on Day 1 plus 720 mg vemurafenib orally twice daily throughout combination treatment.</description>

          <description>These participants were receiving 720 mg vemurafenib in the Lead in Period prior to starting ipilimumab but after the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were identified, ipilimumab was not started. Due to disease stabilization, they continued on 720 mg vemurafenib alone orally twice daily.</description>

AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment.

        <title>During the Combination Treatment Period: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), AEs Leading to Drug Discontinuation, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Deaths in Participants Treated With Concurrent Ipilimumab and Vemurafenib</title>
        <description>AEs graded using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0. AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4= Potentially Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death. Related=relationship to study drug reported as certain, probable, possible, or missing. AEs: onset on or after ipilimumab start and within 90 days of last dose. Immune-related AEs (irAEs) characterized by potential association with inflammation and considered by investigator as drug related. Day 1=first dose of ipilimumab.</description>
