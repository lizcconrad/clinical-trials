  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide safety information on the ligand, GSK2315698A. The
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the ligand will be determined together with the
      differences in routes of dose administration, namely the tolerability between intravenous
      versus subcutaneous dose administration. The study will be carried out in patients with
      systemic amyloidosis and the ability of GSK2315698A in depleting levels of serum amyloid
      protein (SAP) will be measured.

      This study is an open label, dose characteristic study assessing safety and pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic considerations of GSK2315698A. GSK2315698A is a ligand known to bind to
      serum amyloid protein (SAP), a key component of an anti-SAP approach to the treatment of
      systemic amyloidosis. Safety assessments will include adverse events, vital signs, ECGs and
      other relevant clinical laboratory tests. Dose administration routes will also be determined
      focusing on the tolerability of intravenous dose administration versus subcutaneous. The
      study aims to recruit up to 30 patients with a medical diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis.
      Subjects will be asked to attend 2 dosing sessions, each session will involve an intravenous
      infusion of GSK2315698A over 48 hours followed by a single subcutaneous dose in session 1 and
      up to 3 subcutaneous doses in session 2 to be administered over a 24 hour period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  medically diagnosed with systemic amyloidosis

          -  AST,ALT, alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 3xULN and bilirubin ,1.5xULN

          -  undergone radio-labelled-SAP scanning as part of their routine clinical care

          -  male or female between 18 and 80 years of age inclusive, at time of signing the
             informed consent

          -  subject is ambulant and capable of attending CUC

          -  capable of giving written consent, which includes compliance with the requirements of
             the requirement and restrictions listed in the consent form

          -  a female subjects is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea

          -  male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             contraception methods listed in the protocol and informed consent information. This
             must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication to 85 days
             post-last dose.

          -  smokers (&lt;10 cigarettes a day) are permitted but must be willing to abstain for the
             duration of residential study sessions
