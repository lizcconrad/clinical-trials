      This is an open label, dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      pazopanib combined with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid
      tumors. There will be a dose expansion cohort of thirty patients to assess detailed
      pharmacokinetics and to assess any signal of activity in patients with solid tumors and in a
      portion who have breast cancer that is triple negative (ER-negative, PR-negative, and
      HER2-negative).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin on a 28- day cycle</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity will be assessed every 28 days up to 30 days after the last dose of treatment. Dose limiting toxicity is defined as
Non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (excluding alopecia, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea for which adequate supportive therapy has not been instituted).
Hematologic toxicity:
Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥ 7 days
Grade 4 neutropenia and fever of ≥ 38.5°C
≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with ≥ Grade 3 infection
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
Inability to start next cycle of treatment by more than 4 weeks due to unresolved toxicity</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the drug-drug interactions with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and pazopanib</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The first 15 patients enrolled in the dose expansion cohort will undergo PK sampling as this is felt to be an adequate sample size.
4 blood samples (2 mL each) for the analysis of paclitaxel will be obtained in Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1
2 blood samples (2 mL each) for the analysis of carboplatin will be obtained in Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1
1 blood sample (2 mL) for the analysis of pazopanib will be collected in Cycle 2 Day 1</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of a solid malignancy with advanced disease that has relapsed,
             that is refractory to standard therapies, or for which there is not standard therapy,
             or for which the patient opts not to receive standard therapy.

          -  At the recommended phase II dose level, triple-negative breast cancer defined as
             ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative, will be enrolled and another 10 patients
             with a solid malignancy who would benefit from a paclitaxel and carboplatin-based
             regimen, will also be enrolled.

          -  Male or female ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major surgery within last 28 days or cytotoxic chemotherapy, biologic therapy,
             investigational agents, or radiotherapy within last 21 days. Patients who have
             completed therapy with mitomycin C or nitrosurea will have to wait 42 days.

          -  More than 3 prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic disease
