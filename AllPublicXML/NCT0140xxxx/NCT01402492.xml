      The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of buprenorphine in the
      presence of naltrexone for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will assess the utility of buprenorphine in the presence of naltrexone as a
      potential medication useful in reducing cocaine use, commencing a research direction of great
      importance to both theoretical and practical addiction medicine. Buprenorphine will be
      provided as sublingual buprenorphine+naloxone tablets (Suboxone速, &quot;BUP&quot;). Naltrexone will be
      provided as extended-release naltrexone by injection (Vivitrol速, &quot;XR-NTX&quot;).

      In this multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants will randomly
      assigned to one of three medication conditions: 4mg buprenorphine plus naltrexone
      (BUP4+XR-NTX), 16mg buprenorphine plus naltrexone (BUP16+XR-NTX), or placebo plus naltrexone
      (PLB+XR-NTX) for 8 weeks of treatment. Participants will be scheduled for clinic visits three
      times weekly (for a total of 24 visits across the 8-week treatment period) for observed
      medication administration, provision of take-home medication, collection of safety, medical,
      drug use, psychological, and compliance measures. In addition, all participants will be
      scheduled for once-weekly individual Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions.

      This protocol will explore the effects of these three medication conditions to test
      buprenorphine as a possible treatment for cocaine dependence. This study will advance the
      science, provide dosing information, and characterize the effects of the combination of the
      two medications in this population.
