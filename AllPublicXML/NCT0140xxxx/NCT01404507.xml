  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The routine use of glycoprotein (Gp) IIb-IIIa inhibitor such as abciximab is not recommended
      by current ACC/AHA guideline (Class IIb, level of evidence of A). This may be partly due to
      potential increase of bleeding. Compared bolus injection followed by continuous infusion of
      Gp IIb-IIIa inhibitor, single bolus administration was proposed to decrease bleeding
      complication while maintaining decrease ischemic events. It was also reported that direct
      intracoronary injection of abciximab might be superior to intravenous injection regarding
      myocardial perfusion.

      Aspiration thrombectomy is regarded as important adjunctive therapy in the treatment of acute
      ST-elevation myocardial infarction (IIa, level of evidence of B). We hypothesized that
      combination of intracoronary abciximab bolus injection and aspiration thrombectomy might
      enhance adequate myocardial perfusion in patient with acute ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction. We will determine whether combination of intracoronary abciximab injection and
      aspiration thrombectomy is superior to each treatment only in terms of myocardial perfusion
      through index of microcirculatory resistance and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
