             dystrophy, or Type II, i.e., causalgia), chronic pain, attendance at a chronic pain
             clinic, or neurologic disorder associated with sensory deficit of the lower
             extremities

         11. A clinically significant medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator
             would put the subject at increased risk, impair the subject's ability to comply with
             the requirements of the protocol, or confound the interpretation of the data

         12. Expected to receive a regional block for analgesia for this procedure

         13. Considered by the Investigator for any reason to be an unsuitable candidate for
             receipt of an investigational drug

         14. The Investigator, employee of the investigative site, and/or part of the
