      This is a retrospective observational and case-control multicenter study. The main objective
      of this study is determine the degree of association between cancer pain and depression by
      impact assessment of adequate control of pain associated with cancer risk depression in
      patients attending the Oncology Unit. The assessment of pain intensity will be performed by
      using visual analogue scales (EVAs) and verbal descriptive scales, as an observational study,
      not limit or modify the use of any drug. The patients included in this study have a medical
      history of cancer pain and mild depression (Beck = 8). The controls are patients with history
      of cancer pain and mild or absent depression (Beck = 7). n/a
