  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Besides a dramatic lack of financial and human resources in developing countries, health care
      is additionally endangered by quality deficiencies caused by low staff motivation. This lack
      of motivation leads to an insufficient translation of knowledge into optimal utilization of
      resources. The &quot;know-do&quot; gap represents a challenge that must be addressed to strengthen
      health services performance towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This
      is in particular true for some sensitive sectors like pre-natal and maternal health care.
      General objective of this research is to improve maternal health through better pre-natal and
      maternal care services offered by better motivated health workers. A computer-assisted
      clinical decision support system (CDSS) will be developed, implemented and tested aiming at
      (I) quality improvement of maternal and newborn care and (II) assessment of provider's
      performance. Based on this tool a commonly agreed incentive scheme to increase motivation
      will be shaped and tested in three SSA - countries, namely Burkina, Ghana, and Tanzania.

      The incentive scheme might contain both non-monetary and monetary incentives and will be
      designed according to the human resource policy in the three countries. The planned approach
      is an implementation study with control arms containing one hospital and 6 first line health
      facilities in each of the study districts and an equal number of facilities in the control
      arm. A set of indicators for measurement of changes in quality of delivered services will be
      identified in order to follow up the sustainability and effectiveness of the strategies after
      their implementation. The study findings will allow understanding the important factors of
      staff motivation and facilitate adequate management for improvement of maternal and neonatal
      health care. &quot;Knowing is not enough, we must apply; Wanting to do, is not enough, we must do
      it1&quot;
