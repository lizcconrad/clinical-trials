  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is still one of the serious complications of thoracic
      aortic surgery, with incidence of 8 to 50 percent. Postoperative AKI significantly increases
      the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing thoracic aortic surgery. Previous studies
      for AKI after DHCA reported confounding results due to different criteria of AKI. Therefore,
      the investigators tried to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of AKI after thoracic
      aortic surgery according to the diagnostic criteria and staging system of AKI reported from
      acute kidney injury network. The investigators also tried to develop a risk model with
      scoring system of AKI and evaluate the performance of the risk model.

      Significant improvement of morbidity and mortality has been achieved during last three
      decades since developing deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). However,postoperative
      acute kidney injury (AKI) is still one of the serious complications of thoracic aortic
      surgery, with incidence of 8 to 50 percent. Postoperative AKI significantly increases the
      morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing thoracic aortic surgery. Previous studies for
      AKI after DHCA reported confounding results due to different criteria of AKI. Therefore, the
      investigators tried to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of AKI after thoracic aortic
      surgery according to the diagnostic criteria and staging system of AKI reported from acute
      kidney injury network (2007). The investigators also tried to develop a risk model with
      scoring system of AKI and evaluate the performance of the risk model.
