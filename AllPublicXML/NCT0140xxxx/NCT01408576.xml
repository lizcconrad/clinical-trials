    <measure>Number of subjects reporting at least 1 serious adverse event (SAE) during the treatment period (maximum 96 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the treatment period (through Week 96)</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) that the investigator classifies as serious. This includes:
Death
Life-threatening
Significant or persistent disability/incapacity
Congenital anomaly/birth defect (including that occurring in a fetus)
Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition of serious
Initial inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The percent of subjects meeting treatment response criteria according to a combined response index</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Combined response index is a response variable (yes/no) incorporating the following criteria for achievement of responder status (ie, all criteria must be met to achieve responder status): (1) British Isles Lupus Activity Group (BILAG) improvement, (2) No worsening in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Activity Index (SLEDAI), (3) No worsening in Physician's Global Assessment of Disease, and (4) No disallowed changes in concomitant medications, with disallowed changes including mainly increases in corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and antimalarials.</description>
