      This is a multicenter, open-label, 4-arm, randomized, parallel-group study to evaluate safety
      and tolerability of Brivaracetam Intravenous (BRV iv) as adjunctive treatment for adults with
      epilepsy according to an initiation or a conversion scheme, during repeated dosing (100
      mg/administration twice daily for 4.5 days).
