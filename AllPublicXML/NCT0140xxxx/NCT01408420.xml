    <textblock>
      In Denmark around 3500 procedures are conducted involving a heart-lung-machine per year. An
      increase in the prevalence of postoperative kidney insufficiency have been observed following
      these procedures, during the last years. Kidney related complications are associated with a
      higher mortality and morbidity.

      The reason and mechanisms behind this impaired kidney function is unknown. One possible cause
      could be that the blood pressure used in the heart-lung-machine is too low, during surgery.
      In the PPC trial we plan to include 100 patients. One half of the patients are operated with
      a normal, lower, blood pressure on the heart-lung-machine. The other half receives a blood
      pressure of &gt; 60 mmHg during surgery.

      The primary goal of the trial is to measure the kidney function (GFR) the day before surgery
      compared to day 4 - 6 and 4 months (+/- 14 days) after surgery. During the surgery a catheter
      is inserted through the femoral vein into the kidney vein. This makes it possible to measure
      several biochemical markers and the oxygen consumption of the kidney, during the surgery.
      Urine samples are also collected and analyzed.

      The study hypothesis:

      The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is better preserved after cardiac surgery with extra
      corporal circulation with an intended increased periprocedural arterial blood pressure
      compared to current practice.

      1. Introduction:

           Renal function and cardiac surgery

           Impaired kidney function is a well known complication to cardiac surgery and is observed
           in up to 30% of the patients, depending on the definition of acute kidney injury (AKI).
           The precise pathophysiological mechanisms are unknown, it is, however, quite obvious
           that AKI is not initiated by a single harmful factor but seems to be the result of
           different combined factors. Known risk factors for the development of postoperative AKI
           are cardiac incompensation, poor ejection fraction, gender, chronic obstructive lung
           disease, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), previous heart surgery, acute
           surgery, complexity of surgery, preoperative creatinine levels and prolonged duration of
           extracorporeal perfusion. These associations are not necessarily causal. It is not
           surprising that a subacute operation for a severe aortic stenosis in a patient with
           preoperatively poor circulation and a marginally increased S-creatinine, results in
           impaired renal function postoperatively. However, to conclude that cardiac surgery is
           the reason for AKI is not justified.

           Several peroperative factors are likely to contribute in the development of AKI. Renal
           perfusion and oxygen delivery might be reduced (hypotension, lack of pulsatile flow
           during extracorporeal circulation (ECC), vasoactive pharmacological agents,
           anaesthesia), risk for emboli, general inflammatory response, direct nephrotoxins (free
           haemoglobin, free radicals, gentamycin etc.) and haemodilution. Current knowledge is
           limited and the general insight into regional perfusion during extracorporeal perfusion
           (heart-lung-machine) is very sparse.

           There do, however, exist guidelines regarding flow and blood pressure during ECC, but
           these are based upon empiric data, which are controversial and vary from centre to
           centre.

           The primary focus has been on regional cerebral perfusion and the possibilities to
           reduce the frequency of cerebral complications after cardiac surgery. This interest can
           easily be explained by the obvious catastrophic consequences for the patient due to
           coma, hemiparesis or serious cognitive dysfunction. The consequences of AKI are less
           evident, however there is a direct and strong association between a moderately increased
           postoperative creatinine level, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 30 day
           mortality as long term survival.

           A recent analysis of the kidney function of lung transplanted patients in our department
           after use of ECC showed that GFR was dramatically reduced by 40% 14 days after surgery.
           This impairment has furthermore been shown to be irreversible.

           Cyclosporine A is known to be nephrotoxic in the long term, but this can hardly explain
           the observed GFR reduction after 14 days, which must result from the combined influence
           of surgical/anaesthesiological trauma, cyclosporine, and side effects of antibiotic,
           antiviral, antifungal and immunosuppressive treatment.

           Data from our internal prospective registry shows an increasing incidence of patients
           with renal complications. In 2008 temporary dialysis was necessary in 7% of the patients
           (76/1130) and in 19% of the patients a postoperative increase of S-creatinine &gt; 200
           μmol/l was observed, mirroring a reduction in kidney function of 60-70%. We assume that
           the kidney function is completely normalized over time, but this is actually not known
           because these patients are not routinely controlled on a cardiac surgery outpatient
           basis. Currently, we are gathering 1-year outcome data on patients, who have undergone
           postoperative dialysis in 2008.

           One of the reasons for the increasing frequency of AKI might be increasing patient age,
           and thereby, an increase in comorbidity. At the same time the administration of ECC has
           changed. Ten years ago patients were routinely cooled during ECC. This is not the case
           anymore and results in a reduced degree of peripheral vessel constriction and
           consequently reduced blood pressure. The question regarding which blood pressure and
           which blood flow is optimal during ECC remains controversial, but generally a much lower
           blood pressure is now accepted, as long as the calculated blood flow is maintained and
           cerebral saturation values are sufficient (not measured routinely).

           The literature on the subject is sparse but two randomized trials exists. One had a
           primary focus on kidney autoregulation at different perfusion pressures, the other
           recent trial could not demonstrate significant differences in kidney function measured
           by s-creatinine at 3 different perfusion pressures. However, S-creatinine is a very
           crude method for measuring kidney function. In addition, the trial included patients
           with low risk of postoperative AKI.

           Postoperative increase in S-creatinine typically occurs on day 2 or 3 after surgery, and
           S-creatinine does not increase before GFR is reduced below 50%. This implies that the
           possible initial 50% reduction in kidney function cannot be detected by routine
           biochemistry. It is fair to assume that kidney injury occurs during surgery or within
           the first postoperative 24 hours. From a biochemical point of view there is an apparent
           lack of robust and reliable early markers of tubular kidney damage, which would allow a
           relevant early clinical intervention, and possible prevention of AKI aggravation.
           Creatinine kinases MB and troponins are very reliable markers for cardiac damage and can
           reveal acute myocardial infarction within hours after the occlusion of coronary vessels.
           A corresponding early diagnosis of AKI does not exist. At the same time it seems likely
           that specific enzymatic or cell membrane components could be detectable in the urine a
           few hours after an AKI. There has been some focus on possible candidates for early
           detection of AKI, but none have shown to be sufficiently robust for clinical use, yet.

           During the last 20 years there have been a few trials with focus on prevention and
           prophylactic intervention to avoid AKI with anti-inflammatory drugs, natriuresis
           inducing agents (ANP) or renal blood flow increasing pharmacological intervention.
           However, none of these interventions have had sufficiently convincing effects for
           further clinical testing. A recent Japanese study seems to indicate that prophylactic
           infusion of ANP can reduce postoperative kidney impairment, but these results need
           confirmation.

           Our department is currently performing a phase 2 trial in cooperation with Action Pharma
           (a Danish biotech company) in which we are testing AP214, a new small anti-inflammatory
           protein, with potential kidney protective characteristics (clinicaltrials.gov:
           00903604). At the same time we are investigating if AP214 can reduce the nephrotoxic
           effect of cyclosporine in a pig kidney transplant model.

           Summary / Conclusion:

             -  An increasing incidence of renal complications is seen after cardiac surgery.

             -  The aetiology is unknown.

             -  It is unclear if the reduction in renal function is reversible.

             -  Renal complications are associated with increased short- and long term mortality
                and morbidity after cardiac surgery.

             -  Renal regional perfusion during extracorporeal circulation is poorly understood,
                and the impact of blood pressure and perfusion on postoperative kidney function in
                patients with increased risk for AKI after cardiac surgery is unknown.

             -  There are several potential biochemical markers for the early detection of acute
                tubular kidney damage, however there is a substantial lack of clinical data.

             -  Several interventions might be kidney protective, however there are no robust
                clinical data.

        2. Hypothesis for the PPC trial

           The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is better preserved after cardiac surgery with ECC
           with an intended increased periprocedural arterial blood pressure compared to current
           practice.

        3. Methods

             1. Design:

                Phase 1: Randomized proof of concept trial, n = 12. Simple 1:1 randomisation.

                Phase 2: If the proof of concept trial turns out positive and logistically feasible
                (which we have shown, see later) the trial will be extended to include 2 x 50
                patients. There are no similar trials or data in the literature on which to base an
                estimate of the necessary trial size. N = 100 is a qualified assumption based on
                what is clinically possible to include within a 1-1½ year period. As earlier shown
                in the lung transplant population GFR was reduced with 40%. A clinically relevant
                improvement of an average reduction in GFR would be a reduction of 20%. However,
                GFR data are quite heterogeneous and some patients have perfectly normal GFR's
                throughout surgery and the postoperative course, while others develop pronounced
                AKI.

                Phase 3: Test of different preventive and prophylactic interventions (AP214,
                proANP, reduced haemodilution, pulsatile flow during ECC).

                Trial size and outcome measures will be dependent on results from phase 2. There
                are no earlier data on continuous saturation measurement in renal venous blood or
                sequential mass spectrometric analysis of urine in a cardiac surgery population.
                Current results will therefore decide on future primary outcome measures.

             2. Inclusion- and exclusion criteria:

                Patients with increased risk of postoperative AKI, who give written consent after
                appropriate information, are included.

                Inclusion criteria are:

                  -  Age &gt; 70

                  -  Combined procedures (heart valve-, bypass surgery and aortic aneurysm)

                Exclusion criteria are:

                  -  Age &lt; 70

                  -  S-creatinine &gt; 200 µmol/L

                  -  Acute operation

                  -  Endocarditis

             3. Intervention:

                Control group:

                Operation procedure and ECC run are performed according to current guidelines at
                the Dept. of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery / Rigshospitalet.

                Intervention group:

                During ECC run a MAP &gt; 60 mmHg is maintained.

                In both groups GFR measurements are performed using the Cr-EDTA clearance method.
                GFR is measured the day before surgery, day 4-6 after surgery and finally after 4
                months (+/- 14 days).

                A catheter is inserted in the renal vein through the femoral vein. The position is
                controlled by fluoroscopy. Repeated saturation measurements, by blood gas analysis,
                will be performed during and in the first 24 hours after surgery. Blood samples are
                taken from the same access. The catheter is removed before discharge from the
                intensive care unit.

             4. Outcome measures:

                Primary outcome measure: Cr-EDTA clearance, the day before surgery, at day 4 - 6
                and 4 months (+/- 14 days) after surgery

                Secondary outcome measures:

                  -  Oxygen consumption on-line in renal venous blood

                  -  Renal renin and proANP excretion

                  -  U-NGAL, U-Apolipoprotein M, U-IL-18, U-KIM-1 and S-cystatin C

                  -  Urine proteomics (mass spectrometry)

                Tertiary outcome measures:

                Standard clinical data collection (haemodynamics, diuresis, routine biochemistry)
                and clinical outcome in terms of time in intensive care, time to discharge,
                incidence rates of adverse- and serious adverse events.

             5. Economy:

      This investigation is a non-profit trial. None of the project members have economic interests
      in the trial. The involved clinical departments cover direct and indirect expenses regarding
      the prolonged admission, GFR-measurements and additional biochemical analyses estimated to be
      15.800 DKK per patient.

      The Danish Heart Association covers the salary for Ph.D. student Kristian Kandler.

      5: Perspectives

      This project combines expert knowledge from different medical fields on a highly scientific
      and clinical level (advanced cardiac surgery in high risk patients, advanced postoperative
      intensive care, innovative monitoring (invasive, biochemical, clinical physiology). We expect
      to provide original, innovative and scientifically relevant results that will contribute to a
      better understanding of the renal pathophysiology and autoregulation during and after cardiac
      surgery. As a clinical randomised trial this study may show new possibilities to reduce the
      incidence of postoperative renal complications in a group of patients with significant
      mortality and morbidity.
