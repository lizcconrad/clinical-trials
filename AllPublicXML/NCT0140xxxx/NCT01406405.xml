      Purpose The primary purpose of this study is to prospectively compare clinical and
      radiographic clinical outcomes in patients undergoing cervical or lumbar interbody fusions
      and randomized to receive either polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or cortical allografts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Skeletally mature adults between 18 and 70 years old

          -  Patients with back and leg pain due to degenerative disc disease, scheduled for
             TLIF/PLIF approach utilizing an interbody spacer and supplemental posterior fixation
             at 1, 2 or 3 adjacent levels

          -  Unresponsive to conservative care over a period of at least 6 months or has
             progressive neurological signs and/or symptoms of neurological compromise that mandate
             urgent surgical intervention

          -  Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol including followup
             requirements

          -  Posterior fixation used at more than 1 level for 1-level intervertebral fusion

          -  Posterior fixation used at more than 2 levels for 2-level intervertebral fusion

          -  Posterior fixation used at more than 3 levels for 3-level intervertebral fusion
