  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to conduct a human physiologic study to assess the renal and neurohumoral
      effects of CD-NP vs placebo in older subjects with stable chronic systolic heart failure and
      moderate renal dysfunction.

      The investigators will evaluate the renal and neurohumoral effects of dual receptor (NPR-A
      and NPR-B) activation with CD-NP. This is a clinically relevant patient population who is at
      increased risk of developing diuretic resistance during the treatment of HF exacerbations.

             years.

          -  Moderate renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance of 30-60 ml.min-1.1.73m-2, as
             calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula24 and adjusted for body surface area within the
             past year or at screening, or requirement for dialysis.

             absence of menses for ≥ 1 year and serum follicle-stimulating hormone ≥ 20 IU/L; or
             should be previously sterilized defined as bilateral tubal occlusion for ≥ 6 months,
             bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy)

             months.
