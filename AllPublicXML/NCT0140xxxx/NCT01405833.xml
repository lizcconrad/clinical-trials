  <brief_title>Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Safety of BG00010 (Neublastin) in Subjects With Sciatica.</brief_title>
  <official_title>Phase 1: A Multi-Centered, Randomized, Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, Serial-Cohort, Multiple Ascending Dose Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy of BG00010 (Neublastin) in Subjects With Sciatica</official_title>

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of 3 intravenous (IV) injections of BG00010 given on 2 fixed
      schedules; weekly and as frequently as every 48 hours (but no more than 3 times per week).

      Secondary objectives of this study in this study population are to explore the repeated-dose
      immunogenicity of BG00010 and to explore the potential of BG00010 to reduce pain following
      multiple-dose administration.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a diagnosis of unilateral sciatica, determined by the Investigator and as
             outlined in the protocol. Sciatica symptoms must be present for 3 or more months prior
             to the Screening Visit.

          -  Must rate their pain at &gt;/=40 mm on the 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of the
             Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)at the Screening and Baseline Visits.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of malignancy or clinically relevant allergies and/or cardiac, endocrinologic,
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic (not
             related to sciatica), dermatologic, rheumatic/joint, psychiatric, renal, and/or other
             major disease.

          -  History of severe pain as judged by the Investigator, other than that caused by
             sciatica during the 3 months prior to Screening Visit.

          -  Signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, other than symptoms of sciatica during the
             3 months prior to Screening Visit.

          -  Current generalized myalgia

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  History of or positive screening test for hepatitis C infection, hepatitis B infection
             and/or positive for hepatitis B core antibody or positive for human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV) antibody. Subjects who are HBsAg negative and HBcAb positive are allowed
             to participate if they are positive for HBsAb IgG (see the Centers for Disease Control
             and Prevention's interpretation of the hepatitis B serology panel).

          -  Treatment with any prescription medication and/or over the-counter products such as
             herbal supplements, unless the dose has been stable for 2 weeks prior to the Baseline
             Visit.
