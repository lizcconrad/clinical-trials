  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of immediate pancreatic enzyme suppletion on the physical
      and mental health status and survival of patients who are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer
      and are highly likely to develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency during their disease
      process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss in cancer is caused by primary tumour effects and secondary effects (e.g. side
      effects of treatment, mechanical and intestinal obstruction). In pancreatic cancer,
      additional weight loss and malnutrition may be due to the development of exocrine pancreatic
      insufficiency (EPI). The presence of EPI in pancreatic cancer is frequently overlooked,
      because the focus of treatment is directed at possible surgery or chemotherapy and its
      potential side effects. Although studies have proven that pancreatic enzymes may prevent or
      decrease weight loss, they are seldom being prescribed.
