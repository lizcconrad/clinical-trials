  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational study the investigators will undertake imaging studies on men with
      prostate cancer. The primary hypothesis is that ultrasound spectroscopy could be used to
      determine the extent of disease inside and outside of the prostate gland in patients with
      prostate cancer. It is hoped that the changes in ultrasound backscatter parameters obtained
      before radical prostatectomy could be used to correlate with pathological findings from the
      prostate specimen after surgery.

      This project is an early validation study in human subjects that will use ultrasound imaging
      and spectroscopy to predict the tumour extent before treatment so that this may allow the
      most appropriate treatment intervention to be individualised to patients. For examples,
      patients with evidence of extra-prostatic tissue involvement may be best served with
      definitive radiation therapy rather than radical prostatectomy as surgery alone in this
      situation, is not optimum. Furthermore, these ultrasound parameters may be used to monitor
      cell death occurring at various time points during patients' radiation treatment for prostate
      cancer.

      The research is exploratory since upon data analysis it will examine the use of different
      ultrasound parameters as potential markers of pre-treatment tumour extent and cell death, and
      correlate these with tumour shrinkage and complete pathological response. Sensitivity and
      specificity values for the various ultrasound parameters will be calculated for the different
      time points used and receiver-operator curves will be generated. From this data the
      investigators will potentially estimate the best time-points at which to make a prediction
      about patient response and the best ultrasound-spectroscopy variables to use for this
      purpose.
