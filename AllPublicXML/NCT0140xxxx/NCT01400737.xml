      Patent ductus arterioses (PDA) is a major morbidity in preterm infants, especially in
      extremely premature infants less than 28 weeks. The clinical signs and symptoms of PDA in
      preterm infants are non specific and insensitive for making an early diagnosis of significant
      ductal shunting. Functional echocardiography is emerging as a new valuable bedside tool for
      early diagnosis of hemodynamically significant ductus, even though there are no universally
      accepted criteria for grading the hemodynamic significance. Echocardiography has also been
      used for early targeted treatment of ductus arterioses, though the long term benefits of such
      strategy are debatable. The biomarkers like BNP and N- terminal pro-BNP are currently under
      research as diagnostic marker of PDA. The primary mode of treatment for PDA is
      pharmacological closure using cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors with closure rate of 70-80%. Oral
      ibuprofen is emerging as a better alternative especially in Indian scenario where parenteral
      preparations of indomethacin are unavailable and side effects are comparatively lesser.
      Though pharmacological closure of PDA is an established treatment modality, there is still
      lack of evidence for long term benefits of such therapy as well as there is some evidence for
      the possible adverse effects like increased ROP and BPD rates, especially if treated
      prophylactically.The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of oral ibuprofen
      prophylaxis administrated on the first 24 hours of life and the following two days on
      hemodynamically significant patent ductus arterioses and its long term effects such as ROP
      and BPD.

      Patent ductus arterioses (PDA) is a major morbidity encountered in preterm neonates,
      especially in babies less than 28 weeks gestation or 1000g.Natural ductal closure is
      inversely related to gestational age and birth weight. The incidence ranges from 15% to 37%
      in newborn babies less than 1750 grams.The presence of PDA has significant effects on
      myocardial functions as well as systemic and pulmonary blood flow. Preterm newborns adapt, by
      increasing the left ventricular contractility, and thereby maintaining the effective systemic
      blood flow even when the left to right shunts equals 50% of the left ventricular output. This
      is mainly accomplished by an increase in stroke volume (SV)rather than heart rate.This
      increase in stroke volume is primarily due to reduction in afterload and simultaneous
      increase in left ventricular preload. An increasing number of biological substances like
      hormones, enzymes which are markers of cardiac stress, dysfunction or myocardial
      injury-collectively called biomarkers-are emerging as diagnostic and prognostic markers
      especially in the setting of heart failure or ischemic injury. The pharmacological basis for
      medical therapy is the use of non selective cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitors, which inhibits
      prostaglandin synthesis and causes ductal constriction. The two most widely studied and used
      non selective COX inhibitors are indomethacin and ibuprofen. The future of pharmacological
      treatment of PDA could be with the use of nitric oxide inhibitors and prostaglandin receptor
      antagonists. Ibuprofen is an effective choice for the treatment of PDA in preterm infants as
      it has been demonstrated in previous several studies.Since there is a meta-analysis that
      claims there is no need for further studies about ibuprofen prophylaxis to treat PDA in low
      birth weight infants we aimed to evaluate the effect of ibuprofen prophylaxis in very
      extremely low birth weight infants. One such marker emerging in the diagnosis of hs-PDA is
      brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). Natriuretic peptides are hormones, produced either by atria
      (atrial natriuretic peptide-ANP) or by ventricles (BNP) in response to myocardial stress,
      secondary to dilatation, hypertrophy or increased wall tension.One of the aims of this study
      is to investigate the effect of oral prophylactic ibuprofen administration on BNP levels and
      renal functions.
