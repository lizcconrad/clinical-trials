  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the phase of the menstrual cycle (opposed versus
      unopposed estrogen phase) affects eating behavior, including types of foods preferred,
      wanting/desire for specific foods, and perception of hunger.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to investigate the effect of endogenous estrogen (E2) and
      progesterone (P4) levels on eating behavior and energy-yielding nutrient metabolism. Eating
      behavior will be assessed during a complete menstrual cycle during the first month of the
      study. Participants will track the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycle
      using urinary leuteinizing hormone (LH) kits, they will record information about their food
      intake, eating behaviors, and appetite in their home environments, and they will complete two
      laboratory test days: one test day scheduled during their follicular phase, and one test day
      scheduled during their luteal phase.
