  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fertility drugs have the effect of increasing hormone levels. Higher hormone levels from
      infertility treatments may increase breast cancer risk, but there has not been enough
      research to know for sure. Researchers want to use a method of taking breast tissue cells
      from women who are having infertility treatment. The breast tissue cells might show changes
      that would indicate an increased risk of cancer. The method of taking the breast tissue cells
      is called Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA).

      The purpose of this study is to examine the changes in breast tissue, in women at high risk
      of breast cancer who are being treated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.
