  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will randomize 300 cocaine-dependent methadone patients to 1 of 6
      conditions: (a) a control group, (b) a contingency management condition that arranges a 100%
      probability of winning a prize with each draw and has 3 prize categories, (c) a contingency
      management condition that arranges a 31% probability of winning and has 3 prize categories,
      (d) a contingency management condition that arranges a 100% probability of winning and has 7
      prize categories, (e) a contingency management condition that arranges a 31% probability of
      winning and has 7 prize categories, or (f) usual prize contingency management with a 50%
      probability of winning from 3 prize categories. Magnitudes of reinforcement will be identical
      across conditions, but lower overall probability conditions arrange for greater chances of
      winning larger magnitude prizes. The investigators expect that the new contingency management
      conditions will reduce cocaine use relative to the control condition, that 31% probability
      conditions will decrease drug use relative to 100% conditions, and that 7-prize category
      conditions will reduce drug use compared to 3-prize category conditions. In addition, the
      31%/7-category condition is expected to be most efficacious. Results will be instrumental for
      further developing prize contingency management to improve outcomes of cocaine-dependent
      methadone patients.
