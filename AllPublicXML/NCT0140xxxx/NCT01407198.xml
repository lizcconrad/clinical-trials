  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, Nilotinib, is believed to slow down tumor growth by regulating a gene
      involved in cellular growth of chordoma cells. During this research study, subjects will also
      receive radiation therapy which is considered a standard treatment for advanced chordomas. It
      is hoped by adding nilotinib, the benefits of radiation therapy can be enhanced without
      adding significant toxicities.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety of nilotinib when used in
      combination with radiation therapy, and the highest dose of nilotinib that can be given
      safely with radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nilotinib will be taken orally daily in two cycles of 28 days each. Two weeks after taking
      nilotinib, subjects will begin radiation therapy. Radiation therapy will continue every
      weekday until Day 56 of the study. If it is determined that the subject's tumor cannot be
      removed by surgery, an additional 3 weeks of radiation therapy will be applied after Day 56
      of the study.

      During study visits subjects will have physical exams, routine blood tests, urine and blood
      clotting tests, and EKGs. Subjects will also have tumor assessment by chest CT and MRI or CT
      of the tumor at screening, on approximately Day 56 of the study, then every 6 months for one
      year and then annually thereafter if ther is no disease progression.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A DLT will be defined as any of the following events occurring during days 1-56 of study according to CTCAE version 4.0. MTD is then determined by identifying a dose cohort demonstrating &gt; or = 30% rate of DLTs, which are defined as:
Any Grade ≥ 3 nonhematologic toxicity except alopecia, nausea, or vomiting not otherwise controlled by maximual supportive care.
Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC &lt; 500/µL) lasting &gt; 5 days, Grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting &gt; 7 days, or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia
Failure to resume treatment delays within a defined period of time.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event profile, as determined by CTC AE version 4.0, will be determined for patients treated with nilotinib and radiation therapy.
Adverse events analyses will include:
Detailed examination of adverse events
Laboratory test results
Vital signs or other physical findings
Frequency and extent of dose modification
The assessment of adverse events will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events, particularly adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment and on the number of significant laboratory abnormalities.</description>

    <description>Nilotinib is administered 400mg PO BID for 2 weeks and then administered concurrently with daily radiation therapy until completion of radiation therapy. Participants can then undergo surgery if clinically possible. After either surgery or definitive radiation, participants have the option to continue on nilotinib therapy.</description>
