  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computer tomography coronary angiogram (CTCA) has emerged as a noninvasive alternative to
      assessing coronary artery luminal disease. Although the use of noninvasive CTCA for the
      detection of coronary artery disease is on the rise, the current technology of the 64-row
      multidetector computer tomography (MDCT) is subjected to multiple patient artifacts that can
      affect image quality.To eliminate these patient related artifacts a more advanced 320-row
      MDCT was recently developed. The investigators therefore propose that the newly developed
      320-MDCT can provide an accurate noninvasive assessment of the severity of coronary artery
      luminal stenosis as an alternative to an invasive coronary angiogram.

      This pilot study consisting of a prospective non-randomized observational trial where a team
      of surgeon, anesthesiologist, and evaluator are blinded to CTCA results. We hypothesize that
      the preoperative use of noninvasive computer tomography, with the 320-row MDCT, to visualize
      the degree of coronary artery stenosis can lead to improved clinical prediction of
      perioperative cardiac complications.

      The 320-row MDCT is based on the 64-row technology with the significant addition of a larger
      detector capable of scanning the heart within 1 sec or a cardiac cycle, thereby, eliminating
      patient-related artifacts and may produce higher image quality.13, 14 The scanning time of 5
      seconds with the 320-row MDCT is significantly reduced compared to 8-10 seconds for the
      64-row MDCT
