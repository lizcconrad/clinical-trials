      Cerebral palsy (CP) is condition, sometimes thought of as a group of disorders that can
      involve brain and nervous system functions such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and
      thinking.Cerebral palsy is caused by injuries or abnormalities of the brain. Most of these
      problems occur as the baby grows in the womb, but they can happen at any time during the
      first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing.Bone marrow derived stem
      cells are known as a effective therapy.

      In this study the investigators evaluate the side effect of bone marrow stem cell
      transplantation in patients with cerebral palsy.

      Our study evaluate the side effects of bone marrow derived CD133 cells transplantation in
      4-12years old patients with cerebral palsy.first all the patients undergone a comprehensive
      evaluation(physical exam, serology tests,EEG,MRI,GMFM66).

      After bone marrow aspiration,autologous stem cells prepare for each patient. In operation
      room ,the cells are transplanted by intrathecal injection. all the patients would be under
      observed to notice acute side effects and 3,6,9 and 12 months after injection they will be
      followed and evaluate by comprehensive tests.
