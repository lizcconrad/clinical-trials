  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the bioavailability of cogniVida™ in 10 healthy male
      subjects after consumption of two different doses of cogniVida™ (50 mg and 100 mg) and to
      compare the plasma values with values obtained in subjects receiving rebaudioside A (303.68
      mg). In addition, also safety and tolerability parameters 24 hours after ingestion of the
      study compounds will be determined.

      cogniVida™ is considered a dietary supplement, and therefore it is not an approved drug by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is regulated like a food. The U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and dietary supplements. The investigators do
      not claim that this supplement is meant to treat any ailment.
