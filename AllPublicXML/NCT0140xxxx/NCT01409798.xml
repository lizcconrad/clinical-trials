    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-institutional prospective study in which patients that have undergone
      parathyroidectomy with intra-operative PTH assessment. The success of minimally invasive
      parathyroidectomy without and with intra-operative PTH will be assessed for each patient.
      Success for exploration without intra-operative PTH will be defined as directed exploration
      with detection of an abnormal parathyroid in the location suggested by imaging. Success with
      intra-operative PTH will be defined as per standard protocols (50% or &gt; decrease in
      intra-operative PTH following excision).
