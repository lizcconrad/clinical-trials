    <textblock>
      i) The primary objective of this study is to determine if physical therapy improves
      postoperative quality of life in participants following vaginal reconstructive surgery for
      pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence.

      ii) Secondary objectives include:

        1. Comparing pelvic floor symptoms (urinary symptoms, defecatory symptoms and prolapse
           symptoms) in participants undergoing physical therapy compared to standard postoperative
           care

        2. Comparing sexual function in participants undergoing physical therapy compared to
           standard postoperative care;

        3. Comparing postoperative pain scales, and activity assessment in participants undergoing
           physical therapy compared to standard postoperative care;

        4. Comparing pelvic floor strength and pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POPQ)(12) in
           participants undergoing physical therapy compared to standard postoperative care.

      This is a single center randomized controlled trial assessing quality of life in participants
      following vaginal surgery receiving physical therapy compared to standard postoperative care.
      Patients will be under care of the physicians of the Division of Urogynecology and
      Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery. All physicians are board certified, fellowship trained
      urogynecologists.
