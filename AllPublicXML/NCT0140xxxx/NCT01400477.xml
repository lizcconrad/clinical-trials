  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that sustained-release DMXB-A-SR (3-2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene
      anabaseine sustained release) will provide clinical improvement in cognition in patients with
      schizophrenia who are smokers and who are non-smokers. The study drug may also maintain
      abstinence from cigarette smoking and improve other symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia will be screened then enrolled for one week placebo trial in
      addition to their existing antipsychotic medication. If pill compliance is greater than 80%,
      then they will receive baseline clinical, cognitive, and brain imaging and all clinical
      laboratory examinations and a physical examination, vital signs, and cardiogram. Then they
      will receive in a randomized double blind trial either DMXB-A-SR (3-2,4 dimethoxybenzylidene
      anabaseine sustained release) or placebo comparator in addition to their existing
      antipsychotic medication. After one month they will receive repeat clinical, cognitive, and
      brain imaging testing and all clinical laboratory examinations and a physical examination,
      vital signs, and cardiogram.

    <description>MATRICS CCB T-score (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery Statistically Adjusted-score) and SANS (Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms) and BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale) rating; data for primary outcome measures are collected at &quot;baseline&quot; study visit and last study visit, 4 weeks post-&quot;baseline&quot; visit. The primary analysis compares values at 4 weeks, covaried for baseline measurements. A new algorithm for computing the MATRICS CCB Overall Composite T-Score using only six cognitive domains and omitting the Social Cognition domain will be used to compute the primary outcome. Non-smoking and smoking subjects will be compared and for efficacy of the drug on cognition.</description>
