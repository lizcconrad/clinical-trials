    <textblock>
      This study will address the role of percutaneous renal intervention for a hemodynamically
      significant renal artery stenosis in patients with heart failure exacerbations. Current
      guidelines suggest evaluation for renal artery stenosis in patients with pulmonary edema or
      heart failure that cannot be attributed to poor left ventricular function. While case series
      have suggested benefit to percutaneous intervention in patients with heart failure, no
      randomized study has addressed the potential benefit of renal stenting for heart failure
      patients. Two large randomized trial of renal stenting for hypertension or poor kidney
      function failed to show benefit in patients with intermediate renal artery lesions. No
      evaluation of the potential hemodynamic significance of the lesions was performed prior to
      randomization. The investigators will enroll patients with heart failure exacerbations not
      attributable to declining left ventricular function, valvular disease, acute coronary
      syndrome, or heart transplant rejection, who on non-invasive imaging appear to have renal
      artery stenosis. After routine invasive assessment, including renal angiography and
      pressure-wire assessment, patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenoses
      will be randomized to stent implantation or medical therapy. Patients will then be followed
      to determine whether stenting impacts cardiac mortality or hospitalization for heart failure.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women age 18 or older referred for invasive evaluation of possible renal
             artery stenosis will be screened for enrollment.

        Patients must be inpatients admitted for heart failure exacerbation, or have been admitted
        to a hospital for heart failure exacerbation within the past 90 days. Heart failure is
        defined as physician documentation or report of any of the following clinical symptoms of
        heart failure described as dyspnea on exertion, dyspnea occurring in the supine position,
        fluid retention; or the description of rales, jugular venous distension, pulmonary edema on
        physical exam, or pulmonary edema on chest x-ray; without being clearly attributable to
        liver, kidney, or lung disease. Patients must have one of the following: 1. an ejection
        fraction of 50%; 2. an ejection fraction of 25-50% in the setting of a systolic blood
        pressure of at least 160 mmHg; or 3. an ejection fraction of 25-50% and a systolic blood
        pressure of at least 140 mmHg while being treated with at least 2 antihypertensive
        medications. Patients who meet these criteria and have a proven hemodynamically significant
        renal artery stenosis (as described in the procedure section) will be included

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with heart failure from structural heart disease (including greater than moderate
        dysfunction of the mitral or aortic valve), acute coronary syndrome, post-partum
        cardiomyopathy, or acute rejection of a transplanted heart will be excluded. Patients who
        are considered unlikely to survive to hospital discharge will be excluded. Patients with
        fibromuscular dysplasia, prior renal stenting, or anatomy unsuitable for renal stenting
        (i.e. prior vascular surgery making stent delivery impossible) will be excluded. Patients
        who are unable to take aspirin and clopidogrel will be excluded. Patients with a creatinine
        clearance &lt;30 mL/min or a history of renal transplantation will be excluded. Pregnant women
        will be excluded.
