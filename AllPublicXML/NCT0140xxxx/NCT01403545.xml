      Aim of the present study is:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of intravenous liposomal
           Curcumin in healthy subjects by means of adverse events, vital signs and safety
           laboratory assessments.

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of intravenous liposomal
           Curcumin in healthy subjects.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by an absolute neutrophil count ≥1500
             cells/µl, all normal red blood cell indices, hemoglobin greater than 11 g/dl and a
             platelet count greater than 150,000/µl.

          -  Normal renal function.

          -  Normal hepatic function as evidenced by serum total bilirubin ≤1.2 mg/dl, or less than
             or equal to the upper limit of normal, and alkaline phosphatase less than or equal to
             the upper limits of normal, and ASAT and ALAT less than or equal to the upper limits
             of normal.

          -  Normal coagulation profile, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

          -  Normal urine analysis.

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intake of steroids within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Concomitant medications (especially anticoagulants and aspirin) or herbal supplements.

          -  Active infection, or a fever &gt; 38.5°C within three days prior to the first scheduled
             day of study drug dosing.

          -  Current or past history evidence of disease (e.g. hemolytic diathesis, anemia
             requiring substitution therapy, hemochromatosis) that could be exacerbated by
             administration of liposomal curcumin.

          -  History of prior malignancy within the past five years except for curatively treated
