    <textblock>
      The best treatment for resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma is unknown.
      Although an operation to remove the esophagus is the most common treatment, previous studies
      have shown that patients live longer when either perioperative (before and after surgery)
      chemotherapy or preoperative (before surgery) chemotherapy plus radiation is given, compared
      to surgery alone. However it is unknown which of these treatments (perioperative chemotherapy
      or preoperative chemoradiation) is more effective in improving survival. A study where
      patients with resectable esophageal / GE junction cancer are chosen at random to receive one
      of the two preoperative treatments would help determine if one form of treatment improves
      survival compared to the other.

      Patients with localized esophageal / GE junction cancer (adenocarcinoma) will be randomized
      to receive either preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation
      followed by surgery.

      The main objective of this pilot trial is to determine the possibility of conducting a larger
      study with many centers participating. If this study proves to be feasible with enough
      patients enrolled and able to tolerate treatments without major side effects then we can
      hopefully proceed to perform a larger multi-center trial to look for survival outcome
      differences between patients who receive preoperative chemotherapy and those who receive
      preoperative chemoradiation. The results of this trial would ultimately help us choose the
      most effective treatment of resectable esophageal cancer and hopefully improve survival.

      OBJECTIVE To determine the feasibility of a randomized trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs.
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation for patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or
      gastroesophageal junction.

      OR

      B) NEOADJUVANT CHEMORADIATION

      1) -carboplatin and paclitaxel given on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29

        -  paclitaxel: 50 mg / m2 IV

        -  carboplatin: dosed to an area under the curve of 2, by Calvert formula Radiation Therapy
           45-50.4 Gy in 25-28 fractions of 1.8 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/wk 45-50.4 Gy in 25-28
           fractions of 1.8 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/wk Upon completion of neoadjuvant therapy, all
           patients will be considered for surgery.

      Patients will be deemed acceptable for surgery provided:

        -  repeat imaging performed after neoadjuvant therapy does not demonstrate distant
           metastases or local invasion of the primary tumor into vital structures (heart, great
           vessels, trachea)

        -  maintenance of adequate performance status and ability to tolerate esophagectomy

      Surgery will be performed preferably within 8 weeks of completion of neoadjuvant therapy.
