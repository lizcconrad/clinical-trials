    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective clinical registry is to determine the prevalence
      and level of thienopyridine resistance seen in a population undergoing contemporary
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study of 1000 patients presenting to the Washington Hospital
      Center for percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery.

      The aim of this prospective clinical registry is to determine the prevalence and level of
      thienopyridine resistance seen in a population presenting for cardiac catheterization and
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).
      Thienopyridine resistance will be measured by flow cytometry of the vasodilator-stimulated
      phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation, and/or the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay, and/or the
      Chrono-Log Lumi-Aggregometer, and/or the PlaCor PRT 7000 platelet reactivity assay.

      A secondary objective of this study is to correlate a variety of genetic polymorphisms with
      levels of platelet reactivity.
