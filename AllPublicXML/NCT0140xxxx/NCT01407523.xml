    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <description>A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, results in significant or persistent disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (including that occurring in a fetus), or is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
