    <textblock>
      Haemophilus influenzae is an important pathogen which can cause primary infection and
      respiratory viral infection in infants and leaded to secondary infections. The infection of
      haemophilus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children. At present,
      the developed conjugant Hib vaccine is proved to be safe and effective, 90-99% of children
      will produce antibody of protection after 3 doses. Because Hib vaccine can prevent
      meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottis inflammation and other serious infection caused by Hib
      bacteria, the WHO suggested that Hib vaccine should be included in the infant's normal immune
      programming.

      Since the use of meningitis aureus polysaccharide vaccine, incidence of a disease in recent
      years is declined and maintain to the level of 0.5 per 1/100 thousand. But meningitis aureus
      polysaccharide vaccine with a relatively poor immune response in the infants under the age of
      two, and the remaining 60% with a low antibody level and a short duration.

      According to the present immunization schedule, to reach the median level of antibody levels
      there are at least 4 doses in need. So it is meaningful to improving vaccine immunogenicity,
      to provide high levels of long-term protection and to reduce the number of injections.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the group A, C polysaccharide
      meningococcal and type b haemophilus Influenzal Conjugate vaccine.
