      RATIONALE: Studying protein expression in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer
      in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help doctors find better ways to treat
      neuroblastoma.

      PURPOSE: This laboratory studying is looking at protein expression in tumor tissue samples
      from patients with neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine whether intersectin (ITSN1) proteins are present at elevated levels in
           primary human tumor samples.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for intersectin (ITSN1) expression by
      western blot assays with enhanced chemiluminescence and exposed to X-ray film. The films are
      scanned, and levels of ITSN1 signal are quantified by densitometry.
