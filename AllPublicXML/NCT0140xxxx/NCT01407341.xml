      This pilot clinical trial studies beta-tricalcium phosphate bone graft in treating patients
      undergoing surgery for metastatic spine cancer. A bone graft may help healing and bone growth
      in patients undergoing surgery for spine cancer

      OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if Chronos (beta-tricalcium phosphate bone graft) will form a
      posterolateral fusion mass in patients undergoing fusion surgery for spine cancer within 12
      months. II. To evaluate quality of life following the use of ChronOS as measured by (a) pain
      (or lack of pain) associated with pseudoarthrosis and (b) the need for additional treatment
      for instability as a result of hardware failure. OUTLINE: Patients undergo placement of
      beta-tricalcium phosphate bone graft strips posterolaterally during surgery. After completion
      of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month and then every 3 months for 1 year.

    <description>Measured from x-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) scans. Standard criteria of determining fusion is visualization of continuous trabeculating bone bridging the transverse processes and facets on AP and lateral x-rays or when there is &lt; 2 degree angular motion and &lt; 2mm of translation on standing flexion and extension radiographs.</description>
