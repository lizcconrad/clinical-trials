      The objectives of this study are to assess the safety and efficacy of concurrent
      administration of two injections of AA4500 into the same hand of subjects with multiple
      Dupuytren's contractures caused by palpable cords.

      Methodology/Study Design:

      This is an open-label, study in men and women with multiple Dupuytren's contractures.
      Approximately 60 subjects who have at least two Dupuytren's contractures caused by palpable
      cords in the same hand will be enrolled.

      After all pre-injection procedures are completed on Day 1, eligible men and women will
      receive two concurrent injections of AA4500 0.58 mg into the same hand. On Day 2, a finger
      extension procedure to facilitate cord disruption will be performed in those subjects who do
      not have spontaneous disruption of their cord(s). Follow-up visits for the evaluation of
      safety and efficacy will be on Day 8, Day 30, and Day 60.

      Upon completion of the Day 60 follow-up visit, subjects who require further treatment will
      have the option to receive three additional open-label treatments according to the XIAFLEX
      package insert (Appendix C). Subjects may receive up to a total of five injections and
      individual cords may receive up to a total of three injections.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Total Fixed Flexion</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after last injection</time_frame>
    <description>Total fixed flexion is defined as the sum of the fixed flexion contractures of the two joints receiving treatment. Change in fixed-flexion contracture is measured in degrees where a decrease of 100% would correspond to a reduction in contracture to 0 degrees</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Total Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after last injection</time_frame>
    <description>The total range of motion is the sum of the range of motion measurements of the two treated joints. Range of motion is defined as difference between full flexion angle and full extension angle expressed in degrees.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction With Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days after last injection</time_frame>
    <description>At the Day 60 follow-up visit, each subject will be asked to rate his/her satisfaction with treatment as follows:
Very Satisfied
Quite Satisfied
Neither Satisfied nor Dissatisfied
Quite Dissatisfied
Very Dissatisfied</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator Assessment of Improvement With Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days after last injection</time_frame>
    <description>At the Day 60 follow-up visit, the investigator will determine the degree of improvement in the severity of the subject's treated finger(s) compared with screening as follows:
Very Much Improved
Much improved
Minimally Improved
No Change
Minimally Worse
Much Worse
Very Much Worse</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Success by Joint Type</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after injection</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical success is defined as a reduction in fixed flexion contracture to 5° or less 30 days after injection of AA4500.</description>

          2. Be a man or woman ≥ 18 years of age

          3. Have a diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease and have at least 2 fixed-flexion contractures
             on the same hand that are ≥ 20º in PIP and/or MP joints in fingers, other than the
             thumbs, which are caused by palpable cords suitable for treatment

          4. Have a positive &quot;table top test&quot; defined as the inability to simultaneously place the
             affected finger(s) and palm flat against a table top

             uterine contraceptive device; oral contraceptive; diaphragm or condom in combination

             AA4500)

          6. Has a known recent history of stroke, bleeding, or other medical condition, which in
