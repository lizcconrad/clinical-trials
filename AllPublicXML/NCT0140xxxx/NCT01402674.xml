  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phentermine, an amphetamine congener, is the most widely used anti-obesity drug in the U.S.
      Although phentermine is the agent-of-choice among physicians specializing in obesity
      treatment, the use of this drug for obesity treatment by other physicians has long been
      curtailed because misapprehensions regarding phentermine safety. Concerns of
      phentermine-induced adverse cardiovascular reactions and of phentermine-induced addiction are
      two fears that have had a profound negative impact on phentermine prescribing. Although
      warnings of high incidence rates of adverse cardiovascular and psychiatric effects are
      included in FDA labeling and are often repeated in published reviews, the few clinical
      reports in the peer-reviewed medical literature of such adverse effects are anecdotal. Fear
      of phentermine adverse effects does not inhibit the use of phentermine by obesity treatment
      specialists. A 2008 survey of prescribing practices found that 98% of bariatric medicine
      specialists used pharmacotherapy in treating obesity and that 97% of those prescribed
      phentermine as their first choice.

      The fear that phentermine has addiction potential appears to be a factor influencing
      curtailment of use. At the time that phentermine was approved in 1959 the expectations were
      that it would prove to be addicting, although perhaps less so than amphetamine. These
      expectations were based on the chemical structural similarities between phentermine and
      amphetamine and on evidence in rats that phentermine stimulated spontaneous activity. No
      evidence suggesting the drug had human addiction potential appeared in clinical trials
      conducted prior to approval.

      After 52 years of use there is no evidence in the peer-reviewed medical literature to support
      the hypothesis that phentermine has significant human addiction potential. Research in
      addiction medicine has undergone significant development in the last 50 years. Concepts of
      addiction have shifted from an early focus on tolerance and withdrawal to a current emphasis
      on the psychological components of dependence. Drug addiction has been redefined as drug
      dependence and standardized diagnostic criteria have been adopted for drug abuse, dependence
      and withdrawal. Psychometric testing methods have been developed, validated, and applied
      clinically for measurements of dependence, drug craving, and withdrawal for a wide variety of
      substances of abuse including cocaine, heroin, and amphetamine.

      Until recently, none of these addiction medicine metrics had been used to study the addiction
      potential of phentermine. Presumably, since phentermine is an amphetamine congener, any
      clinical characteristics of dependence or withdrawal should mimic those of amphetamine
      dependence or withdrawal. One recent retrospective study investigated symptoms occurring when
      patients treated with long-term phentermine in a weight management program abruptly ceased
      taking phentermine. The study found that patients on long-term phentermine who ceased
      phentermine abruptly by their choice did not have an amphetamine-like withdrawal symptom
      complex. Significantly there was no evidence of phentermine cravings. Further investigation
      is warranted.

      The addiction potential of a drug may be investigated by measuring the drug's propensity to
      induce dependence, to induce cravings for the drug, and for cessation of the drug to induce
      characteristic withdrawal symptoms. In the case of amphetamine withdrawal symptoms appear
      very quickly reaching a maximum at 48 hours after drug cessation.

      In this prospective study the addiction potential of phentermine will be assessed with
      validated psychometric scales to examine patients who have taken phentermine long-term for
      two years or more. Patients who have taken phentermine for 7 to 14 days will also be
      assessed. Participating patients who have taken phentermine long-term in this study will be
      asked to interrupt phentermine therapy for 48 hours to participate in the study. Scale
      examinations will be conducted at 24 and at 48 hours after drug cessation.

      Hypotheses

        1. Long-term phentermine-treated (LPT) patients do not develop phentermine dependence or
           cravings.

        2. LPT patients who cease taking phentermine abruptly do not experience amphetamine-like
           withdrawal symptoms.

      Specific Aims

        1. To compare the severity of phentermine dependence and craving between LPT patients and
           acute phentermine-treated (APT) patients

        2. To compare the severity of stimulant withdrawal symptoms before and after phentermine
           cessation in LPT patients.

        3. To examine the prevalence of phentermine dependence in LPT patients
