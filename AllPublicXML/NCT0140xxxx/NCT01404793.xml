  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard anesthetic management of liver transplantation patients includes a general
      anesthetic using multiple drugs, including the neuromuscular relaxant rocuronium.
      Pharmacokinetic modelling of this agent has been poorly described during liver
      transplantation, which impacts on appropriate dosing of this agent within this population
      where plasma concentrations can vary with fluid shifts and hepatic drug metabolism during the
      various phases of liver transplantation. Plasma drug and drug metabolite concentrations will
      be measured using the technique of solid phase micro-extraction (SPME). Measuring and
      correlating the levels of rocuronium and other liver metabolites with the degree of post
      transplantation hepatic dysfunction may serve as a simple and cost-effective marker to aid
      diagnosis, identify those at risk of hepatic dysfunction and potentially grade the severity

    <description>All liver transplant recipients in this study will receive standard level of care including general anesthesia and the use of invasive arterial and central line monitoring. On induction, patients will receive the neuromuscular relaxant cisatracurium at 0.1 mg kg-1. After insertion of the new liver and restoration of portal venous flow, 0.6 mg kg-1 rocuronium will be administered. If further muscle relaxation is required, cistaracurium will be administered. Collection of 5ml blood samples will be performed at: 5, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 450 mins post bolus administration.</description>
