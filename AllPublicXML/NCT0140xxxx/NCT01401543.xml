      This study compares LY2452473 taken orally as a 5 mg capsule at the same time as a 5 mg
      tadalafil tablet with three different combination tablets (LY900010) of 5 mg LY2452473 and 5
      mg tadalafil taken orally. The study will evaluate the amount of LY2452473 and tadalafil
      circulating in the blood for each treatment. Side effects will be documented. This study is
      approximately 34 days not including screening.
