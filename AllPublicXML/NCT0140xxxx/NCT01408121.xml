    <textblock>
      This is a genetic and platelet reactivity study of African-American versus Caucasian patients
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and receiving clopidogrel or prasugrel. The
      investigators aim is twofold: to describe differences in allele frequencies between
      African-Americans and Caucasians, and to explore associations of platelet reactivity and
      genetic polymorphisms in these two groups.

      The investigators propose a pharmacogenetic cohort study of 100 African-American versus 100
      Caucasian patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome, receiving clopidogrel or
      prasugrel and undergoing PCI. The study will have four arms: African-American on clopidogrel;
      African-American on prasugrel; Caucasian on clopidogrel; and Caucasian on prasugrel. All
      patients will undergo genotyping and platelet reactivity testing with the VerifyNow P2Y12
      assay, at least 6 hours after receiving a thienopyridine loading dose, but before hospital
      discharge. All patients will be treated with aspirin 325 mg/day as well.

      Race determination will be based on a patient's self-report, but patients enrolled in the
      trial must also report that all four of their grandparents were of the same race as theirs.
      Other races (Asian, Native American, et al) will be excluded from this study.

    <measure>Distribution of CYP polymorphisms</measure>
    <time_frame>During hospital stay; average hospital stay is less than 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>CYP polymorphisms will be classified by their known effects upon enzyme function, using the consensus star-allele nomenclature. More specifically, patients will be classified as a &quot;poor metabolizer&quot; if they possess at least one CYP allele known to be associated with reduced function of that particular CYP enzyme. Allele frequencies will then be compared between African-american and Caucasian patients.</description>

    <time_frame>During hospital stay; average hospital stay is less than 48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary exploratory objective is to assess for associations between &quot;poor metabolizer&quot; CYP genotypes and the levels of post-thienopyridine platelet reactivity.</description>
