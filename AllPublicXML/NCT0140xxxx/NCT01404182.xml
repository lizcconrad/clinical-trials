  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the immunogenicity and tolerability of Fluval AB
      trivalent influenza vaccine in adults and elderly people.

    <textblock>
      Immunogenicity Objective:

      To assess immunogenicity of a single intramuscular (IM) injection of Fluval AB influenza
      vaccine (trivalent, seasonal, active ingredient content: 15 μg HA/0.5mL of seasonal H1N1,
      H3N2 and B influenza antigens each), as measured by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test.

      Safety and Tolerability Objectives:

      To evaluate safety and tolerability (incidence of adverse events) of a single intramuscular
      (IM) injection of Fluval AB influenza vaccine (trivalent, seasonal, active ingredient
      content: 15 μg HA/0.5mL).

          -  Are in good health (as determined by vital signs and existing medical condition) or
             are in stable medical condition. Subjects will not be excluded with known adequately
             treated clinically significant organ or systemic diseases (e.g. asthma or diabetes),
             such that, in the opinion of the investigator, the significance of the disease will
             not compromise the subject's participation in the study

          -  Female volunteers aged 18-60 years (i.e. participants of childbearing potential) with
             a negative result from the urine pregnancy test prior to vaccination who agrees to use
             an acceptable contraception method or abstinence throughout the trial and not become
             pregnant for the duration of the study.

          -  Capability of participants to understand and comply with planned study procedures

          -  Participants aged above 18 years provide written informed consent prior to initiation
             of study procedures

          -  Absence of existence of any exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy, breast feeding or positive urine pregnancy test at baseline prior to
             vaccination. Female subjects who are able to bear children but not willing to use an
             acceptable contraception method for the duration of the study.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to eggs, chicken protein, thiomersal, formaldehyde, gentamycin,
             ciprofloxacin, neomycin or any other component of the vaccine

          -  History of Guillain-Barré syndrome

          -  History of neurological symptoms or signs, or anaphylactic shock following
             administration of any vaccine

          -  Serious disease, such as cancer, autoimmune disease, advanced arteriosclerotic
             disease, complicated diabetes mellitus, acute or progressive hepatic disease, acute or
             progressive renal disease, congestive heart failure

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy within the past 36 months

          -  Concomitant corticosteroid therapy, including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids

          -  Receipt of immunostimulants,
