    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is much more common in the elderly than in the young; the
      latest studies show prevalence between 45% and 62% in individuals over 60. It is even higher
      in patients with dementia such as Alzheimer patients.

      Several trials in elderly patients showed modified cognitive functions, particularly
      executive and attentional functions, in patients with respiratory sleep disorder. However the
      benefit of CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) ventilation for Alzheimer patients is
      still controversial, as there are few studies documenting its effects on dementia patients'
      cognitive abilities, and clinicians appear reluctant to prescribe this type of treatment.

      The investigators must keep in mind that Alzheimer patients suffer significant sleep
      disorders; advanced- stage patients spend 40% of the night awake and are drowsy a large part
      of the day. In dementia patients, sleep disorder is a major cause of hospitalization and
      institutionalization. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in this population is
      estimated at over 50%, and appears to be higher the more advanced the dementia. Trials on
      obstructive sleep apnea syndromes in Alzheimer patients show significatively improved scores
      on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), as well as satisfactory treatment tolerance. However, any
      impact on cognitive abilities has yet to be demonstrated.

      In addition, cardiovascular pathologies such as arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias,
      and strokes are strongly correlated to OSA. In light of its consequences on morbidity and
      mortality, OSA should be considered a public health issue.

      In this context, the investigators wish to address the impact of CPAP treatment
      implementation on the cognitive parameters of patients diagnosed with OSA, particularly on
      their executive functions. This should provide evidence for mid-term assessment of the
      benefits of CPAP in caring for elderly patients with dementia.

      In light of the prevalence of obstructive sleep pathologies in elderly patients reported in
      various studies and of the potential impact of CPAP treatment on cognitive abilities, the
      investigators propose a study to evaluate the impact of OSA treatment on elderly Alzheimer
      patients' cognitive abilities, particularly on their executive functions.

      Executive functions are a rather heterogenous group of high-level cognitive processes which
      enable individuals to adopt a flexible, context-appropriate behavior. They also include
      planning abilities, working memory, cognitive control, abstract thought, rule learning,
      selective attention, motor response selection, etc... Executive functions are mainly
      associated to the functioning of the brain's frontal lobes, although subcortical structures
      also play a role. When the executive functions are affected by disease, daily life is
      significantly impeded as the individual becomes unable to perform complex tasks or regulate
      his/her behavior. Many tests can help evaluate these functions in dementia patients. A number
      of &quot;ecological&quot; tests, such as the zoo map test from the Behavioural Assessment of the
      Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) arsenal, are quite relevant for evaluating executive functions.

      This project aims to improve the daily life of Alzheimer patients with sleep apnea by
      improving their executive cognitive functions through CPAP treatment.

      According to the Paquid's trial, there are 12,400 Alzheimer patients in the French Loire
      department. [27] The study population will therefore be recruited in the &quot;La Charité&quot; center
      of CHU Saint-Etienne. The target population is older individuals (≥ 65) suffering from
      cognitive disorders similar to Alzheimer's disease.

      OSA will be diagnosed based on polysomnography, on an outpatient basis. Apnea patients will
      receive CPAP treatment for 4 months, which is the minimum duration required to implement and
      accept treatment, and to measure its impact on patients' neurocognitive abilities.

      This study's originality lies in that the target population is elderly and has been diagnosed
      with both Alzheimer's disease and sleep apnea, and in that it focuses on the impact of
      treatment on these patient's cognitive abilities, particularly on their executive
      abilities.We aim to provide practitioners with evidence-based arguments for screening and
      treating sleep apnea in dementia patients in order to care for these patients, whose
      treatment options are often scarce.

The consideration of these tests separately has no interest. The sum of these tests is important.</description>
