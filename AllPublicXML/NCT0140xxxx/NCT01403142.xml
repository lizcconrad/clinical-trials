  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a unique form of accelerated plaque formation seen in
      the coronary arteries of patients who have received heart transplantation. It is a major
      cause of morbidity and mortality in patients after heart transplant. Little progress has been
      made in characterizing this disease process, with more sophisticated imaging allowing for
      more detailed analysis of CAV, superior stratification of transplant recipients is possible
      and earlier interventions can be performed if necessary to prevent mortality and graft loss.

      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a novel imaging modality with much higher resolution
      then Intra-Vascular Ultrasound (IVUS). This study will involve examining patients post-heart
      transplant using this high-resolution imaging modality. It is currently the standard care for
      patients post-heart transplant to receive annual coronary angiograms with close follow up.
      Patients will be imaged using OCT at the time of their routine annual angiogram, and will be
      re-imaged one year later at the time of the next annual angiogram or earlier if clinically
      indicated. The study goal is to better characterize CAV in vivo with OCT imaging and to try
      to identify patterns of the disease, including intra-coronary risk assessment.

      This study will involve imaging up to 100 patients at different points in time post heart
      transplant as part of their standard of care, with various degrees of disease and with
      different lesion subtypes. Imaging will take place at the time of routine coronary angiogram,
      which is standard of care in this patient population,or when clinically indicated. In prior
      studies using IVUS todetect CAV, the yield was significantly higher with multi-vessels
      imaged. OCT is an intravascular light-based imaging modality that measures the intensity of
      reflected light waves and converts these echoes into a high-resolution tomographic image. It
      is a catheter-based invasive imaging system analogous to IVUS but uses light as opposed to
      ultrasound to generate in vivo images of coronary arteries. It has the highest resolution of
      any intravascular imaging modality, capable of obtaining detailed cross-sectional images of
      coronary arteries in vivo at a resolution of 10 um or near histologic. This device, which is
      FDA approved for intracoronary evaluation, has been used in evaluating patients with coronary
      artery disease, specifically for plaque composition analysis, as well as for proper stent
      deployment after percutaneous intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Post heart transplant patients

          -  Patients presenting for their routine annual or clinically indicated coronary
             angiogram post-heart transplant. The decision for coronary angiogram will be made by
             the treating physician from the heart-failure-transplant team (not by the physician
             who will do the angiogram)

          -  Clinically suspect or evidence of CAV in previous coronary angiogram

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Written informed-consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any complications that occur during routine biopsy of the coronary arteries during the
             same cath-lab visit

          -  Baseline renal failure with Cr &gt; 1.8

          -  Contraindication for anticoagulation

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigators would alter the safety of
             participation, or interfere with the ability to adhere to study procedures.
