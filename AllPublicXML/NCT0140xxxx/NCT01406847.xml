  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body-based interventions have consistently shown clinical effectiveness in patients with back
      pain. The primary objective for this study is to compare the effect of body-based
      interventions commonly used in the management of low back pain on behavioral and cortical
      measures of pain sensitivity and central sensitization of pain. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive one of the interventions or be in a control group. The central hypothesis
      for this proposal is that spinal manipulation, a specific form of body-based intervention,
      inhibits central sensitization of pain normalizing pain sensitivity more rapidly than other
      interventions. The completion of the proposed study will elucidate underpinning mechanisms of
      body-based interventions. Identification of these mechanisms will improve the clinical
      application and utilization of these interventions in the management of musculoskeletal pain
      conditions, especially back pain.

      170 participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the interventions or be in a
      control group. The investigators will use of a model of experimentally induced low back pain
      to investigate the effects of manipulative and body-based interventions in acute onset low
      back pain without some of the clinical confounds. The investigators will collect fMRI and
      psychophysical data about pain sensitivity before and after the induction of pain, and before
      and after interventions for that pain.
