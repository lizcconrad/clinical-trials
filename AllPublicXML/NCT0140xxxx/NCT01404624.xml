    <textblock>
      The problem point of the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) patient is the obesity which is intense
      and the plasma ghrelin level which increases unusual from the recently PWS patients was
      discovered. The Ghrelin is endogeneous ligand of growth hormone secretagogue receptor with
      peptide hormone and the location is 3p26-p25. Becomes the secretion even from nervous system
      but from dignity X/A cell it is secreted mainly and growth is important even in the vagal
      control against food and intake and a dignity function even on the action outside which
      promotes the secretion which drives it operates. It increases food intake specially and in
      order to accomplish the action which diminishes fat utilization the obesity with the week
      cause which it does the mortar it is thought. Active the ghrelin of the form is essential in
      hormonal activity of the ghrelin and appetite and growth hormone it participates to the
      secretion promotion which drives. Action of the Ghrelin measuring the quantitative change in
      middle acylated of the PWS patient ghrelin in order to happen after the acylation initially
      by one interest ghrelin which is attempted the appetite of the PWS patient is is controlled
      the method it will be able to prove the thing directly, it used the RIA kit and the ELISA it
      will be able to measure kit it will be able to measure the whole ghrelin to pick the PWS
      patient and the blood of the normal army and active ghrelin it measured a change.

      It will reach to respect, in 5 ' -flanking region of the ghrelin 2000 bp focus it let and it
      got luciferase assay it led and and it searched for the binding it sorted it put out and and
      to sleep the transcription factor which and and is the possibility of doing the essential
      region in the transcription and and it did an order deletion clone and and. is important in
      result and ghrelin activity the region role, -300~-200 region Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
      are containing -USF (-236 to -231) binding site specially to be compressed in -500~-400 and

        Sixteen PWS patients [age, 8.1 +- 2.6 yr; 12 males, 4 females; body mass index (BMI),
        25+-1.5 kg/m2], 19 healthy normal lean subjects (age, 8.9 +- 1.4 yr; 14 males, 5 females;
        BMI, 16.5 +- 0.42 kg/m2), 13 GHD patients (age, 9.1 +- 1.8 yr; 9 males, 4 females; BMI, 27
        +- 1.8 kg/m2), and 10 healthy normal obese subjects (age, 8.7 +- 2.3 yr; 7 males, 3
        females; BMI, 26 +- 1.7 kg/m2) were enrolled in the study. The subjects had no history of
        GH treatment and were not being treated with GH at study commencement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PWS patients were genetically confirmed using the standard methylation test. GHD was
             diagnosed using a GH stimulation test. The lean and obese normal subjects (comparison
             group) enrolled were the children or siblings of hospital staff who understood the
             purpose of and the procedures used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  GHD patients had no history of GH treatment, and were not being treated with GH at
