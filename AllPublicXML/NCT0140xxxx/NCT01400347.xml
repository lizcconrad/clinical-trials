  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is generally accepted that the effectiveness of an exercise can be controlled not only by
      the weight or resistance applied but also by doing an exercise that would better target the
      desired muscle. The purpose of this study is to obtain objective information regarding
      selected lower extremity muscle activity during specific exercise and the influence of
      fatigue and speed on muscular activation.

      It is generally accepted that the effectiveness of an exercise can be controlled not only by
      the weight or resistance applied but also by doing an exercise that would better target the
      desired muscle. Information regarding selected lower extremity muscle activity during
      specific exercise and the influence of fatigue and speed on muscular activation may enhance
      exercise prescription for all parties involved. Specifically, selection of specific training
      or rehabilitation exercises may be guided by increased awareness of specific muscle
      activation patterns during common exercises.

      Methods and Measures: Healthy subjects between 18 - 35 years old will be recruited from the
      community by a sample of convenience and word of mouth. Potential participants will report to
      the Institute for Human Performance. The potential participants will be asked to complete all
      documentation including informed consent, and health screening questionnaire. The qualified
      participants will be familiarized with the set up and specific exercises. If eligible,
      surface EMG recordings will be collected from the back extensors, gluteal muscles (buttocks),
      hamstrings (posterior thigh), quadriceps (anterior thigh), and gastrocnemius (calf) during
      squat and lunges exercises.

      For data analysis, a within subject measures analysis will be conducted using general linear
      models. Specifically, we will use paired t-tests and an analysis of variance (ANOVA). When
      applicable, post-hoc tests will be used to uncover differences among the groups of subjects
      on descriptor variables such as age, height, weight, rate of perceived exertion, and maximal
      and sub-maximal voluntary muscle performance variables (i.e. EMG amplitude, frequency). The
      statistical significance level will be set at alpha = 0.05 for all analyses performed.

        We will recruit healthy, young (18-35 y.o.) subjects. Following signing the inform consent,
        potential participants will be given a health risk questionnaires to identify possible
        cardiovascular and/or orthopedic risks to strength training exercise. Answering YES to any
        of the questions on the PAR Q will be considered an exclusion criterion. In addition we
        will use a MEDICAL HISTORY QUESTIONNAIRE (included at the end of this form). Specifically,
        subjects who are at risk due to recent (within the last year) neuro-musculo-skeletal injury
        to lower extremities will be excluded from the study. Also, we will exclude subjects who
        reported any significant respiratory-cardiovascular disease, which is not yet under
        control..
