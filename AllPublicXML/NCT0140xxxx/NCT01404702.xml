  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, with an annual
      incidence of 10.5 per million children less than 15 years of age. NB accounts for 15% of
      childhood cancer deaths. High risk (HR) patients carry a poor prognosis despite treatment
      with intensive chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiation, autologous bone marrow transplant, and
      treatment with cis-retinoic acid. New therapies are desperately needed for such patients.
      Recently, it has been demonstrated that HR NB patients benefit from anti-GD2 antibody therapy
      which directs the immune system against NB cells. To further explore means of harnessing the
      immune system to attack NB, the investigators are studying the combination of zoledronic acid
      (ZOL) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). ZOL has been demonstrated to have direct anti-neuroblastoma
      effects in laboratory studies. ZOL also augments the production of tumor killing white blood
      cells called gamma-delta T cells. When used in combination with IL-2, ZOL is capable of
      eliciting potent anti-cancer effects in patients, in part, via the expansion of gamma-delta T
      cells. In this present trial the investigators aim to study the tolerability of the
      combination of ZOL and IL-2 in pediatric NB patients. Patients will also be monitored
      radiologically for tumor response to therapy. Correlative biological studies will study the
      ability of this drug combination to elicit the production of NB killing gamma-delta T cells
      in children.
