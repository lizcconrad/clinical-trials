  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to gain new knowledge about genetic risk factors thta may affect
      the development of mucositis, the chemotherapy-induced sores in the mouth and esophagus
      following HSCT. The study seeks to understand if different forms of genes result in an
      increased risk of sores in the mouth and esophagus.

      Subjects will be provided with a saliva collection kit which can be used at home. Subjects
      will return the collection kit in a paid, pre-addressed mailer to the laboratory at
      Biomodels. The laboratory will isolate and store the DNA located in the cells of the saliva.
      A portion of this DNA will be used to analyze the different forms of genes. The remainder of
      the DNA will be destroyed when this study is completed. Biomodels will not be provided with
      patient identifiers.

      The investigators will also collect information from medical records, including information
      about diagnosis, treatment, stem cell transplantation and post-transplantation outcomes. This
      information will be de-identified.
