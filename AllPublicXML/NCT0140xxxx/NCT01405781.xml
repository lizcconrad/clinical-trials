      The objective of this study is twofold: First, to determine whether higher levels of
      pre-operative psychological distress predict worse outcomes after arthroscopic rotator cuff
      repair; second, to obtain functional outcomes (VAS pain, VAS satisfaction, VAS function,
      Simple Shoulder Test (SST) and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Score), physically
      examine and perform a radiographic analysis of patients at a minimum of 6 months after
      reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, total shoulder arthroplasty, arthroscopic
      scapulothoracic bursectomy, acromioclavicular joint reconstruction and arthroscopic rotator
      cuff repair.

      Clinical outcome studies have been performed in the evaluation of a variety of shoulder
      pathologies after surgical treatment. Among these disease processes include glenohumeral
      osteoarthritis, rotator cuff arthropathy, acromioclavicular separations and scapulothoracic
      bursitis. A variety of outcomes studies have been performed on these pathologies although few
      have utilized several functional outcome measures. Also with respect to each of these
      diagnoses, several specific areas of research regarding outcomes assessment have not been
      investigated.

      Glenohumeral osteoarthritis is one of the most common shoulder pathologies treated by
      orthopedic surgeons. For endstage osteoarthritis, an anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty
      provides excellent pain relief and functional improvement. In order to perform the
      replacement, the rotator cuff tendon in the front of the shoulder (subscapularis) needs to be
      taken down and then repaired at the completion of the case. There are three basic methods of
      takedown and repair: tenotomy, peel-off and lesser tuberosity osteotomy. The osteotomy has
      been compared clinically to tenotomy and found to provide a lower rate of subscapularis
      tears, higher outcome scores and universal healing evaluated using ultrasound and the PENN
      shoulder score.1 Gerber et al has also evaluated long-term outcomes of total shoulder
      arthroplasty with lesser osteotomy using the Constant score as a measure of outcomes.2
      Unfortunately, many outcome studies evaluating total shoulder arthroplasty utilize the Simple
      Shoulder Test and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) Score which have not been
      evaluated. Also, osteotomy was performed only utilizing a &quot;fleck&quot; of bone instead of the
      entire lesser tuberosity. No studies to date have evaluated TSA with an osteotomy of the
      entire lesser tuberosity.

      Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty has shown be a predictable operation for the treatment of
      rotator cuff arthropathy with clinical improvements in both pain and function at long term.
      3,4 Dislocation has been reported between 0% to 9% after reverse total shoulder arthroplasty
      and has been defined as one of the top three most common complications associated with
      reverse TSA.3-10 There is considerable debate regarding whether the subscapularis tendon
      needs repair after reverse TSA. Edwards et al reported a statistically significant reduction
      in dislocation rates from 9% to 0% with addition of subscapularis repair.10 These results had
      significant bias with regards to randomization of patients. Similarly, all patients in the
      non-repair group were at the initial portion of his learning curve. Consequently, the risk
      for instability is likely lower than reported in his series.

      Acromioclavicular joint separations represent one of the most common shoulder injuries
      accounting for approximately 9% of shoulder girdle injuries.11 Acromioclavicular injuries
      have been classified with increasing severity from I to VI based upon disruption of the
      various ligamentous and muscular supports including the acromioclavicular ligaments,
      coracoclavicular ligaments and deltotrapezial fascia.12 Recommended initial treatment for
      grade I to III injuries has been nonoperative with reasonable clinical results while initial
      surgical stabilization has been recommended for higher grade injuries.12-15

      A variety of surgical stabilization techniques for acromioclavicular joint separations have
      been reported including the transfer of the coracoacromial ligament from the acromion to the
      end of the resected distal clavicle originally described by Weaver and Dunn in 1972.16 A
      modification of the Weaver-Dunn acromioclavicular reconstruction was subsequently described
      which included coracoclavicular stabilization with nonabsorbable suture.17 Despite this
      modification, residual subluxation or dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint has been
      identified in up to 29% of patients.17 Consequently, alternative constructs have been
      described including an anatomic reconstruction utilizing a tendon graft which has been shown
      to have superior biomechanical strength compared to a Weaver-Dunn reconstruction.18

      As part of the surgical transition from the modified Weaver-Dunn reconstruction as described
      by Weinstein et al. to a reconstruction using a tendon graft, augmentation of the
      coracoclavicular suture fixation with either allograft or autograft tendon as well as
      performing the coracoacromial ligament transfer has been described.17,19 This differs from
      the anatomic reconstruction described by Mazzocca et al., as it includes both the transferred
      coracoacromial ligament and the hamstring graft for stabilization instead of just the
      graft.11 Coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction with a tendon graft has been reported as a
      treatment option for failed Weaver-Dunn reconstructions.20,21 Possible benefits of the
      combined reconstruction include improved construct strength and a vascularized ligament.
      Drawbacks include increased surgical dissection, increased operating room time and disruption
      of the coracoacromial arch. With the advances in arthroscopic techniques, acromioclavicular
      reconstructions utilizing a tendon graft are now being performed arthroscopically which has
      been described without the addition of coracoacromial ligament transfer.22 Reconstructions
      without coracoacromial ligament transfers may increase the ease of performing a
      reconstruction through smaller incisions with arthroscopic assistance. No study has evaluated
      the clinical effects of adding a coracoacromial ligament transfer to an acromioclavicular
      joint reconstruction utilizing a coracoclavicular tendon graft.

      Scapulothoracic bursitis or &quot;snapping scapula syndrome&quot; is an under-recognized shoulder
      disorder where the bursal sac between the scapula and chest wall becomes irritated and
      inflamed. The etiology is overuse causing reactive bursa formation between the scapula and
      thorax. If conservative measures fail as initial attempts at management, surgical excision of
      the inflamed bursa with resection of the superior medial angle of the scapula can be
      performed. The procedure can be performed either arthroscopically or open. A two-portal or
      three-portal technique can be utilized if performed arthroscopically. Very limited data
      exists regarding outcomes of two-portal or three-portal techniques with no use of validated
      patient-based outcome scores.23,24

      Rotator cuff tearing is the most common shoulder pathology treated by orthopedic surgeons.
      Healing rates after rotator cuff repair have varied in the literature from less than 5% to
      100% dependent on tear size, age, repair construct and muscle quality.25,26 A variety of
      methods have been used to repair the tendon. A recent biomechanical study has shown that
      repair with triple-loaded suture anchors have improved initial biomechanical properties
      compared to other constructs.27 No clinical data exists on healing after repair with triple
      loaded anchors or how healing effects function.
