    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that patients older than 60 years with a
      femoral neck fracture eligible for hemi-arthroplasty (HA) operated by an anterior
      minimal-invasive approach as compared to a standard lateral Hardinge approach show better
      functional recovery postoperatively as measured by the &quot;Timed up and go&quot;-test (TUG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HA via various well established approaches is the typical treatment for displaced femoral
      neck fractures in elderly patients. In the last decade, so called minimal-invasive surgery
      (MIS) for the implantation of total hip arthroplasty (THA) has become popular and studies
      have demonstrated that MIS is as safe as conventional approaches. Our hypothesis is that
      femoral neck fracture patients may especially benefit from MIS. To date, no published data
      exist comparing a Hueter minimal-invasive anterior (AMIS) with a conventional trans-gluteal
      Hardinge approach (CLAS) for HA.

      Geriatric patients presenting at the University hospital Basel (UHBS) with a femoral neck
      fracture eligible for HA are randomly assigned to the minimal-invasive or conventional group.
      In both groups HA will be performed using the same implants. Postoperatively patients will be
      followed-up continuously until discharge from our hospital (with 7 days as expected average
      duration of postoperative hospital stay) with a first functional status assessment on day 5.
      Further follow-up is planned at week 3 and 6, 3 months and one year postoperatively.

    <description>FIM is a widely used method of assessing quality of daily life and the amount of assistance required for a person with a disability to perform basic activities safely and effectively. It includes 18 items focusing on a minimum set of skills related to self-care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication, and social cognition. Possible scores range from 18 to 126.</description>

    <description>Postoperative complications (proximal femoral fracture, nerve palsy, postoperative surgical site infection, aseptic loosening, peri-prosthetic fracture, re-operation, non-surgical complications etc.) as a secondary outcome variable will be continuously recorded using the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications</description>

    <description>To assess delirium, patients will be screened 3 times a day by the responsible nurse using a modified Delirium Observation Screening scale (DOS). DOS is a 13-item scale for early recognition of delirium. If DOS results in equal or more than 3 points, the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) will be additionally applied. The CAM instrument consists of 4 respectively 5 operationalized criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).</description>
