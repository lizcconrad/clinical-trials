  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two phases, a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase. For dose
      escalation, the primary objective is to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of AEB071 in
      patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. The endpoint for this objective will be
      occurrence of Dose Limiting Toxicity. For dose expansion, the primary objective is to
      characterize the safety and tolerability of the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2
      dose of AEB071 in patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. The endpoints for this
      objective will be occurrence of Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs),
      assessment of clinical laboratory values, and vital sign measurements.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Study terminated due to enrolment challenges and availability of other options for DLBCL
    patients. The termination is not a consequence of any safety concern.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with activating mutations in CD79 (A or B
             subunits). DLBCL that arose from transformed indolent lymphoma is allowed.

          -  Prior treatment and relapse following anthracycline-based chemotherapy and autologous
             bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Patients who are not transplant eligible may be
             considered for the study following a single regimen of chemotherapy such as R-CHOP or
             R-EPOCH alone. There is no limit to prior therapy allowed.

               -  Patients may be treated with localized radiation to as many as two sites of
                  disease, so long as measurable or evaluable disease remains at untreated sites.

               -  Patients may be treated with corticosteriods immediately prior to enrollment and
                  during the course of the study treatment as long as steriod treatment is tapered
                  to a toal daily dosage of 10mg or less of prednisone (or it's equivalent) prior
                  to AEB071 administration

          -  WHO performance status of ≤2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients at screening who are treated with strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome
             P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) that can not be discontinued.

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, including any of
             the following:

          -  History or presence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia

          -  Presence of unstable atrial fibrillation (ventricular response &gt; 100 bpm); Patients
             with stable atrial fibrillation are eligible, provided they do not meet any of the
             other cardiac exclusion criteria.

          -  Angina pectoris or acute myocardial infarction ≤ 3 months prior to starting study drug

          -  Other clinically significant heart disease (e.g., symptomatic congestive heart
             failure; uncontrolled arrhythmia or hypertension; history of labile hypertension or
             poor compliance with an antihypertensive regimen)

             absorption of AEB071.

          -  Patients with a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)

               -  HIV testing is not required as part of this study

             antiviral therapy

               -  The determination of active hepatitis status should be as per standard of care at
                  each site

               -  Hepatitis B and C testing is not required as part of this study

        Time since the last prior therapy for treatment of underlying malignancy**:

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy: ≤ than the duration of the most recent cycle of the previous
             regimen (with a minimum of 2 weeks for all)

          -  Biologic therapy (e.g., antibodies): ≤ 4 weeks

          -  ≤ 5 x t1/2 of a small molecule therapeutic, not otherwise defined above

             **Patients must have recovered or stabilized from all toxicities related to their
             previous treatment except for alopecia

          -  Patients with any history of significant coagulopathy or a medical condition requiring
             long term systemic anticoagulation that would interfere with biopsies.

          -  Patients having undergone major surgery less than 4 weeks prior to enrollment or that
             have not fully recovered from prior surgery.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women
