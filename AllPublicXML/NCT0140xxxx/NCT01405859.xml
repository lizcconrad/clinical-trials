    <textblock>
      Doctors provide a ray of hope to children and their parents with the knowledge that, for most
      patients, symptoms of Tourette syndrome improve by the time they are young adults. The
      investigators do not know why some improve and others do not. This study is designed to help
      answer that question. The investigators will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques
      to test whether individuals who experience improvement of their Tourette's (tic remission)
      have more mature brain connections than those who do not.

      One of the most interesting aspects of Tourette syndrome is a virtual remission of tics by
      early adulthood in about half of patients. Information is needed to clarify the mechanism of
      tic remission in order to guide development of better treatments for this disabling
      condition. For this cross-sectional study, 10 individuals with tic remission and 10
      individuals with persistent Tourette syndrome are being recruited for a one-time study visit.
      10 neurologically normal (non-TS) controls have also been recruited to obtain control
      neuroimaging data. All participants will complete a study questionnaire and a 60-minute MRI
      procedure. Sequences used to compare the groups will be volumetric, diffusion tensor, resting
      state functional connectivity MRI and MR spectroscopy. Our primary hypothesis is that the
      pattern of functional connectivity in individuals with tic remission will be more mature than
      that of those with persistent tics. Secondary hypotheses tested will explore whether the
      other modalities can be used to differentiate tic remission from persistent TS.

    <description>Quantitative measurements of integrated voxel-by-voxel blood oxygen level dependent fMRI time-series data will be compared between activated regions. Cross-correlation coefficients will be computed following band-pass filtering of data for evaluation of frequency-dependent contributions to correlation using standard functional connectivity techniques. Similar correlation analysis will be performed with signal from pulse oximetry and respiratory effort to evaluate for confounding stimulus-correlated physiological noise.</description>

        Young adult males (aged 18-35) with a history of Tourette syndrome, including at least
        moderate disability from tics during childhood.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects: males aged 18-35 with history of Tourette syndrome and at least moderately
        disabling tics during childhood.

        Persistent Tourette's subjects: history of disabling tics during childhood but no longer
        taking tic suppressing drugs.

        Tic remission subjects: no longer experiencing any disability (even social discomfort) from
        tics. Must have had sustained improvement of tics for at least 3 years.

        Normal controls: no longer recruiting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Tourette's subjects still taking tic suppressing drugs are excluded. Also excluded are any
        patients with a condition (such as a pacemaker, recent tattoo, implantable metal device, or
        claustrophobia) that could make the MRI examination unsafe.
