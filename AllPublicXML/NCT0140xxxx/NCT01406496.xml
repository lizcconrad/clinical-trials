  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-meal glucose excursions may contribute to the development of diabetes-related
      complications. These glucose excursions are affected by the food content of the meal and the
      timing of insulin injection (or insulin pump-bolus) before meal. The best timing for insulin
      bolus (by pump) is controversial.

      The aim of the study is to examine three different timings of insulin bolus in three types of
      breakfast meals that contain carbohydrates, carbohydrates + proteins and carbohydrate+ fat.
      The 3h post-meal glucose excursions will be recorded by continuous glucose monitoring system.
      The results obtained in the diabetic patients will be compared to those obtained in a group
      of healthy individuals that will consume similar meals.

    <description>Each diabetes patient will be assigned for one of three breakfast meals, differed by their content: carbohydrates, carbohydrates + proteins or carbohydrates + fat. Post-meal blood glucose excursions will be recoded by continuous blood glucose monitoring at three different days. In each day insulin bolus will be administrated at a different timing before meal.
Each healthy participant will consume the three types of breakfast meals at three different days, and post-meal blood glucose excursions will be recoded by continuous blood glucose monitoring.</description>
