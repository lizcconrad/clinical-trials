      This is a phase 1, open-label study designed to determine the interaction of rifampin with
      linifanib.

      This study is designed to explore the drug interaction between rifampin and linifanib to
      determine the potential effect of rifampin on the metabolism of linifanib. Linifanib will be
      taken alone or in combination with rifampin. The safety of a single dose administration of
      linifanib when administered alone and in combination with rifampin will be assessed. Subjects
      may enroll in a separate extension study to continue receiving linifanib after completion of
      this study.

    <measure>To investigate the effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetic of linifanib in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples for the PK of linifanib will be collected at various time points from Day 1 through Day 17.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of linifanib and metabolite(s), an analysis will be performed for the natural logarithms of Cmax and AUC of linifanib and metabolite(s) with concentrations that permit confident determination of values of the pharmacokinetic variables. A paired t-test will be performed to compare the central value on Study Day 13 (with rifampin) to that on Study Day 1 (without rifampin). Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals will also be provided.</description>

    <measure>Safety: Physical Examination and Vital Signs - Physical examination will be performed and vital signs will be assessed for participants as a measure of safety.</measure>
    <time_frame>Physical exam will be done at Screening, Day1, Day 13, Day 17/Final Visit and 30 day safety follow-up. Vital Signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature) will be done at all visits.</time_frame>
    <description>Complete physical exam, including body weight, will be done at Screening and Day 1. A symptom-directed physical exam, including weight, will be done at Day 13, Day 17/Final Visit and 30 day safety follow-up.</description>
