      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of an investigational
      procedure for treating people with treatment resistant bipolar depression (TRD). Precise dose
      delivery of radiation to the predetermined targets in the brain will be accomplished with
      known Cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery methods. This technology is considered to be
      noninvasive (does not physically invade your body). We will be studying if the Cyberknife
      influences the sensitivity of certain nerves of your brain. Although many clinical treatments
      for psychiatric conditions have been done using stereotactic radiosurgery, the present study
      is experimental, because we are seeking to use more moderate doses of radiation that are
      intended not to destroy any brain cells, but to normalize or modulate their function.

      Main objective: To determine the safety of Radiosurgical Neuromodulation (RSN) for Refractory
      Depression using X-rays in a population of subjects with severe treatment resistant bipolar
      depression over a 12-month observational period post treatment. While almost any
      radiosurgical device could be used, the research team has extensive experience with the
      Accuray CyberKnife System, K011024, and it will be used for planning and delivery of the 6
      megavolt (MV) X-ray treatment for this study.

      Participation will be dependent upon subjects having a diagnosis of bipolar depression and
      meeting criteria for treatment resistance. Treatment resistance will be defined as a failure
      to show clinical improvement after at least four different medication trials and/or one
      course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) during the current episode. A medication trial is
      defined as an adequate dose and duration of one of four classes of psychoactive medications:
      lithium, anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotic mood stabilizers, and/or
      antidepressant medications. One course of ECT is defined as receiving six acute treatments.
      The study will include subjects who have failed ECT, or have had intolerable side effects to
      ECT, or elected not to receive such treatment due to stigma, or concern over possible side
      effects of the ECT treatment itself. The subjects enrolled will have exhausted all reasonable
      treatment strategies, and currently have no other reasonable or viable treatment options for
      their illness.

      Secondary objective: To examine clinical outcome initially over 3 months, then with follow up
      at 6, 9 and 12 months. Depression will be assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      (HDRS) 24 item, while manic symptoms will be measured by using the Young Mania Rating Scale
      (YMRS), and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity of illness (CGI-S), and Improvement
      (CGI-I). A battery of neuropsychological tests will be administered as well, assessing memory
      with the California Verbal Learning Task (CVLT), prefrontal function using a Delas-Kaplan
      Executive Function System (DKEFS) battery including the DKEFS Sorting task, DKEFS Trails
      task, DKEFS color-word interference task, and the DKEFS verbal fluency task. In addition, the
      investigators will request information regarding any possible adverse events that occur
      during this trial.

      The intended use for the CyberKnife System, the radiosurgical device being used in this
      research study, is to administer radiomodulation to the cingulate cortex target Cg25 in
      patients with refractory bipolar depression.

    <description>D-KEFS is a neurocognitive assessment of executive function. The composite score is derived from scores on tests that include Trails A, Color Word Interference, Verbal Fluency, Sorting, WAIS III Digit Span, and CVLT II Long Delay Free Recall. The scores are reported as deviation from a mean of 10, with a standard deviation of 3. A score of 7 is one standard deviation below the mean, while a score of 13 is 1 standard deviation above the mean. Higher numeric outcomes reflect better performance on the test, lower values reflect poorer performance. Results reflect scores at baseline, and 12 month observation period following Cyberknife System</description>

        <title>Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Composite Score</title>
        <description>D-KEFS is a neurocognitive assessment of executive function. The composite score is derived from scores on tests that include Trails A, Color Word Interference, Verbal Fluency, Sorting, WAIS III Digit Span, and CVLT II Long Delay Free Recall. The scores are reported as deviation from a mean of 10, with a standard deviation of 3. A score of 7 is one standard deviation below the mean, while a score of 13 is 1 standard deviation above the mean. Higher numeric outcomes reflect better performance on the test, lower values reflect poorer performance. Results reflect scores at baseline, and 12 month observation period following Cyberknife System</description>

Subject 3 had a signal abnormality on the MRI of the brain at 9 month time point which was unchanged 12 months on both T1 and T2 acquisition images. This is one adverse event that was sustained. The presence of the signal abnormality at 9 and 12 months indicates it did not change. A change in this type of signal abnormality would not be expected to resolve on that time scale. This adverse event is one occurrence that sustained for the next 3 months.</description>
