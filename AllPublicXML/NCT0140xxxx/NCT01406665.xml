  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early detection of (pre)diabetes, including impaired glucose tolerance is currently deficient
      because the best accepted standard, an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), is not feasible in
      a setting of screening or broad case-finding and other current methods lack in sensitivity. A
      previously reported study, and analysis of retrospective skin autofluorescence (AF) data,
      suggests that noninvasive skin AF may offer an alternative for detection of (pre)diabetes.
      The objective is to test the validity of a decision tree based on skin autofluorescence, and
      some simple clinical characteristics, as a detection tool for diabetes and impaired glucose
      tolerance. Sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive value of this skin
      AF based decision model will be compared to those of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated
      haemoglobin (HbA1c), and to two short questionnaires (Finnish Findrisk, and Cambridge score).

      Study design: Skin AF, HbA1c and an oGTT (including an FPG) will be simultaneously performed
      in at least 120 persons with the characteristics described in the following paragraph. A
      Findrisk and Cambridge questionnaire will also be collected.
