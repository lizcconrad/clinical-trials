    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient's signature on the informed consent document [each patient should be given
             ample time to read (or have read to them) the consent form, ask any questions they may
             have regarding the trial and have a clear understanding of the trial and the
             procedures involved prior to the signing of the consent form].

          -  Patients have a clinical diagnosis of migraine with or without aura according to IHS
             criteria at least one year prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients have a clinical diagnosis of migraine with or without aura and in addition a
             clinical diagnosis of tension type headache according to IHS criteria, if patients are
             able to differentiate between the two headache diagnoses and if migraine is more
             frequent in these patients

          -  Patients that report at least three headache days per month

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diseases or disabilities that disqualify to perform either aerobic endurance training
             or relaxation training

          -  Language difficulties that disable to fill out questionnaires

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Additional diagnosis of secondary headache according to the IHS criteria
