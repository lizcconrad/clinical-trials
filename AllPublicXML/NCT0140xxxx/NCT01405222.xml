  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbations of COPD remain a common cause of morbidity and are associated with a
      sustained increase in the normal respiratory symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, and sputum volume
      and purulence. It has previously been shown that a change in cough symptoms occurs in 51.7%
      of exacerbations in COPD. We wish to record cough during a COPD exacerbation to determine
      whether this can be a objective marker of exacerbation duration and severity.

    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbations of COPD remain a common cause of morbidity and are associated with a
      sustained increase in the respiratory symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, sputum volume and sputum
      purulence. Cough is one of the most commonly reported and key symptoms in COPD patients.
      Cough can also be a useful factor in finding patients at risk of progressive airflow
      obstruction and cough along with the breathlessness is the major cause of distress in
      patients with chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD). There is limited literature looking
      into cough and COPD especially objective assessments.

      in clinical practice and in most clinical trials scoring systems ie quality of life
      questionnaires or visual analogue scores, have been used to measure COPD exacerbation
      severity, although these may give an indication of the perceived severity of the symptom,
      they are inherently subjective and may be influenced by other factors. Shortfalls have
      prompted the development of cough recorders as an objective measure of this symptom. With
      this in mind we propose recruit 30 subjects with non-infective exacerbations of COPD and
      monitor their cough frequency as an inpatient in acute exacerbation and for 45 days post
      hospital discharge in order to elucidate the natural history of cough during and after an
      exacerbation.

    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of Hull Automated Cough Counter in recording transition of an acute COPD exacerbation. Change in no coughs/hr will be measured between start of exacerbation (day 0) to day 5 of exacerbation</description>

    <measure>compare cough/hr measured via Hull automated cough counter with that of Phillips 45 day cough monitor</measure>

    <description>The Key secondary endpoint will be to validate automated cough counts measured via the HACC with those measured via the Phillips 45CM at day 1, 5, 20 and 45. Cough monitor results will be compared using a bland altman plot, to determine if the systems are comparative with on another</description>
