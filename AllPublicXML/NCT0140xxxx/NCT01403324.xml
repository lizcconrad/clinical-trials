  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastases of thyroid cancer with iodine uptake are treated with repeated activity of I-131
      administered after thyroid hormone withdrawal. The goal of thyroid hormone withdrawal is to
      treat patients with elevated thyrotropin stimulated hormone (TSH), a hormone secreted by the
      pituitary, a gland just located under the brain. Another way to obtain elevated TSH levels is
      to perform intramuscular injection of recombinant human TSH, a hormone produced
      pharmaceutically. The goal of this study is to know whether the radioiodine uptake by the
      metastases is similar after rhTSH administration or after thyroid hormone withdrawal.

      Patients will undergo a rhTSH stimulation, staying on thyroid hormone treatment. Following 2
      administration of rhTSH an injection of I-124 will be performed. Positron emission tomography
      with computed tomography scans (PET/CT), blood tests, and measurements of whole body
      radioactivity will occurred during the 4 to 96 hours following I-124 administration in order
      to perform dosimetry (i.e.) to estimate the radiation dose delivered to the metastases. After
      4 weeks under thyroid hormones patients will undergo thyroid hormone withdrawal and a new
      administration of I-124 will be performed. The same dosimetry study will be realized with
      PET/CT, blood tests, and measurements of whole body radioactivity. A therapeutic activity of
      I-131will then be administered followed by whole body scan realized 24 to 72 hours after the
      administration of I-131. Dosimetry studies will be compared in order to determine whether
      rhTSH stimulation can replace thyroid hormone withdrawal for the treatment of distant
      metastases.

    <description>For each patient, the 124 I uptake after TSH stimulation (a marker of radiation absorbed dose) will be compared to the uptake after thyroid withdrawal in all lesions (up to 16 lesions per patient maximum). A decrease in the residence time of more than 2.5 fold in 25% or more of the lesions is considered unacceptable.</description>
