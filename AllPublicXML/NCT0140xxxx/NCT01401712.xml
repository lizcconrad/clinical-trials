  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rib fractures are a common injury of trauma patients and can cause significant pain which, if
      inadequately treated, can lead to impaired breathing, lung collapse, and respiratory failure.
      Hence, it is crucial to manage pain associated with rib fractures. Currently, epidurals are
      used to treat the pain, but placement can be risky as rib fractures are often associated with
      other injuries and complications.

      An alternative pain management option is the ON-Q® Pain Relief System. It is an FDA-approved
      device that automatically and continuously delivers medication to the region of the thoracic
      intercostal nerves. One study by Truitt et al (2010)demonstrated that the ON-Q® system
      effectively reduced pain and increased lung volumes after one hour, in patients with three or
      more rib fractures. However, that study sample was small and did not have a comparison group.
      In this study, we will compare two groups: 1) ON-Q system and 2) epidural analgesia. We
      hypothesize that trauma patients with three or more rib fractures, who receive pain
      management through the ON-Q® Pain Relief System achieve discharge criteria earlier and thus
      have a shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) when compared with epidural analgesia.

    <description>The study will compare the time to achieve discharge criteria between the two groups. Readiness for discharge is defined by the following criteria:
Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain below 4 (of a maximum 10);
Ability to perform incentive spirometry with sustained maximal inspiration for three seconds;
Hemodynamic stability (heart rate &lt;100 beats/min, respiratory rate &lt;20 breaths/min, and systolic blood pressure &gt;90mmHg at 3 consecutive time points that are 10 minutes apart) and oxygen saturation greater than 95% on room air;
Absence of neurological deficits; and
Monitored for at least 1 hour after ON Q® catheter placement to ensure no immediate complications from placement or local anesthestic toxicity.</description>

    <description>Identify insertion site lateral to paraspinous muscles and posteromedial to the rib fractures. Then, incise skin and soft tissue down to the level of the rib. Advance tunneler perpendicular to chest wall until it contacts the rib, then, advance superiorly at 45° angle in the extrathoracic space. Remove tunneler and advance catheter in space created. Attach catheter to pump filled with 0.2% ropivacaine at infusion rate of 2-12ml/hr.</description>
