  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      200 persons with depression are recruited via internet depression forums devoted to
      depression and are randomly assigned either to the online program deprexis or to a wait-list
      control condition. All participants receive free-of-charge online access to deprexis either
      immediately or with an eight week delay.

      Prior to intervention and eight weeks later, both groups are assessed via an anonymous online
      survey which was implemented using the software package OPST®. The survey consists of
      different questionnaires. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) represents the primary outcome.
      It is assumed that the severity of depressive symptoms will improve to a significantly
      greater extent in the deprexis than in the wait-list control condition in the course of eight
      weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deprexis is a web-based intervention that can be obtained online (www.deprexis.com). Deprexis
      encompasses 10 content modules with a strong focus on evidence-based cognitive-behavioral
      techniques, either from its so-called first (behavior-oriented), second (cognitive-oriented)
      or third wave (e.g. mindfulness and acceptance): (1) psychoeducation, (2) behavioral
      activation, (3) cognitive modification, (4) mindfulness and acceptance, (5) interpersonal
      skills, (6) relaxation, physical exercise and lifestyle modification, (7) problem solving and
      (8) expressive writing and forgiveness, (9) positive psychology and (10) dreamwork and
      emotion-focus interventions. The ten modules are framed by one introductory and one summary
      module. Communication is carried out online via simulated dialogues. Patients have to respond
      to narrative text messages from the virtual therapists in multiple-choice response fashion,
      enabling them to express doubt, to affirm a particular message or to request more
      information. Text messages are aided with drawings, photographs and animations. The program
      is adaptive and selects exercises and contents on the basis of the subject's response. The
      modules are sequential and each module refers and builds upon previous one. Modules can (and
      should be) repeated within the intervention period.

    <description>Web-based intervention deprexis consists of ten online modules (plus one introductory and one summary module) representing different psychotherapeutic strategies with a strong focus on evidence-based cognitive-behavioral techniques (e.g. interpersonal skills). Each module lasts approximately 10-60 minutes (e.g. depending on the user´s reading speed). Modules are sequential and organized as simulated dialogues. Each module refers and builds upon previous one. The program is delivered at no cost to participants.</description>
