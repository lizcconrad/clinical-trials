    <textblock>
      In a prospective randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to assess whether
      external lumbar drainage (ELD) of CSF is safe and reduces delayed cerebral ischemia and its
      sequelae in patients with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a frequent complication after an aneurysmal subarachnoid
      hemorrhage (SAH). Its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear but a role for cerebral
      vasospasm and the presence of blood in the arachnoid space is likely. A wash out of blood and
      blood breakdown products in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) could reduce the incidence of
      vasospasm and DCI.

      We aim to assess whether external lumbar drainage (ELD) of CSF is safe and reduces secondary
      ischemia and its sequelae.

    <description>DCI was diagnosed when all of the following criteria were met: (1) the onset of new neurological deficits such as confusion, disorientation, drowsiness, or focal deficit during post-hemorrhage days (4 to 14); (2) negative findings on CT obtained to rule out other causes of neurological deterioration such as hemorrhage, cerebral edema, or hydrocephalus. (3) No other identifiable cause of neurological deterioration such as hyponatriemia, hypoxia, drug toxicity, infection, or seizures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) with aneurysmal pattern graded as a Fisher
             grade III or higher on cerebral CT-scan.

          -  CSF drainage by external lumbar catheter can start within 96 hours after the initial
             SAH

          -  the drainage can start prior to the treatment of the ruptured aneurysm

          -  informed consent is signed by the patient or his representative

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  spontaneous SAH with aneurysmal pattern graded as a Fisher grade I or II on CT and
             perimesencephalic hemorrhages

          -  symptomatic hydrocephalus on admission necessitating drainage (EVD or ELD)

             CT

          -  the presence of a mass lesion with significant cerebral midline shift

          -  all patients whose neurological condition is too poor to allow clinical recognition of
             signs and symptoms of cerebral vasospasm. This includes all patients with a Hunt and
             Hess Grade V who failed to improve after initial resuscitation
