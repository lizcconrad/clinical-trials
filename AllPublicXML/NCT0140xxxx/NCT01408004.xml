  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study will be examined whether alternating treatment between two classes of drugs
      (TKI's and m-TOR inhibitors) postpones or prevents drug resistance in patients with renal
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current practice is to treat with VEGFR-TKI or mTOR inhibitors until progression and then
      continue with the next active agent. From a biological perspective, TKI's will most likely
      activate compensatory pathways which, may ultimately lead to the development of resistance.
      Recent studies suggest that resistance to treatment with TKI may be reversible after stopping
      treatment. There is therefore a rationale to alternate treatment to prevent or delay the
      occurrence of resistance.

      Our hypothesis is that alternating active agents in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) may
      reduce side effects, improve tolerability and compliance of treatment and prolong progression
      free survival and overall survival compared to the standard of care.

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed bi-monthly by using the FACT Kidney Symptom Index (FKSI)-Disease Related Symptom (DRS)and the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. The symptoms covered by the FKSI-DRS include fatigue, pain, weight loss, dyspnea, cough, fever and hematuria. The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire evaluates five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social and cognitive functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea, and vomiting), a global health status/QoL scale, and six single items (dyspnea, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, insomnia and financial impact).</description>
