  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this research study is to evaluate the effect on clinical outcomes of
      weight bearing as tolerated after forage surgery for the treatment of osteochondral defects
      of the ankle, thus potentially eliminating the need for a period of immobilisation or
      non-weight bearing after surgery.

      The investigators hypothesize that their will be no difference in functional outcomes between
      weight bearing as tolerated as compared to non-weight bearing for six weeks after forage
      surgery for OCD of the ankle.

    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for advantage of the investigational post-operative therapy is based on:

      Equivalent clinical outcomes to non-weight bearing; Similar radiographic findings on CT at
      follow-up visit between the two groups; reduced morbidity and disability to subjects through
      elimination of a period of non-weight bearing; reduction of cost to patients by eliminating
      need for adjuvant walking and mobility aids (crutches, taxis) and time off work.
