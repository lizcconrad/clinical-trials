  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of a single dose of intravenous (IV) fosaprepitant
      (MK-0517, EMEND速 IV) as salvage therapy when added to a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3
      antagonist (5-HT3 RA) and dexamethasone for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced vomiting
      (CIV) in participants who experienced CIV in the first cycle of moderately emetic
      chemotherapy (MEC). The primary hypothesis is that there will be no vomiting and no retching
      in at least 20% of participants during the second cycle of MEC in participants who previously
      experienced vomiting during the first cycle of MEC.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With No Vomiting and No Retching During Cycle 2 of Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2</time_frame>
    <description>A vomiting episode is defined as one or more episodes of emesis (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). Distinct vomiting episodes are separated by the absence of emesis and retching for at least one minute. The date and time of each vomiting episode was recorded by participants in diaries at the time of occurrence. The percentage of partcipants with no vomiting and no retching episodes 0-120 hours following chemotherapy in Cycle 2 was calculated.</description>

    <description>A vomiting episode is defined as one or more episodes of emesis (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). Distinct vomiting episodes are separated by the absence of emesis and retching for at least one minute. The date and time of each vomiting episode was recorded by participants in diaries at the time of occurrence. The percentage of partcipants with no vomiting and no retching episodes 0-120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2 was calculated based on type of chemotherapy received.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Complete Response During Cycle 2 of Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2</time_frame>
    <description>A complete response is defined as no vomiting/no retching episodes and no use of rescue medication during the 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy. The percentage of participants with a complete response during Cycle 2 of chemotherapy was calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Living Index - Emesis (FLIE) Total Score During Cycle 2 of Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 (prior to initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2) to morning of Day 6 (up to ~120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The FLIE Total Score is an 18-question quality-of-life questionnaire on the impact of nausea and vomiting (9 questions on nausea and 9 questions on vomiting) on daily life. Each question uses a visual analog scale (VAS) to rate the impact of nausea/vomiting from 1 to 7. FLIE Total Scores are calculated by summing the responses to the 18 questions and can range from 18-126 (18=a great deal of impairment, 126=no impairment), with a higher score indicating less impairment due to nausea and vomiting. &quot;No Impact&quot; on daily life was defined as a FLIE Total Score &gt;108. Participants completed the FLIE questionnaire on the morning of Day 6 following initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2; their responses covered their experiences with nausea and vomiting over the previous 5 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With No Significant Nausea During Cycle 2 of Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>From 24 to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated their degree of nausea in response to &quot;How much nausea have you had over the last 24 hours?&quot; using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS, 0=no nausea, 100=nausea as bad as it could be) on Days 2-6 following initiation of chemotherapy. No significant nausea was defined as VAS score &lt;25 mm over the 24-120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy. The percentage of participants who experienced no significant nausea during Cycle 2 of chemotherapy was calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Used No Rescue Medication During Cycle 2 of Chemotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded any use of rescue medication for established nausea/vomiting in their daily diaries from initiation of chemotherapy infusion through the morning of Day 6. The percentage of participants who used no rescue medication during Cycle 2 of chemotherapy was calculated.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With No Vomiting and No Retching During Cycle 2 of Chemotherapy Per Type of Chemotherapy</title>
          <description>A vomiting episode is defined as one or more episodes of emesis (expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth) or retching (an attempt to vomit that is not productive of stomach contents). Distinct vomiting episodes are separated by the absence of emesis and retching for at least one minute. The date and time of each vomiting episode was recorded by participants in diaries at the time of occurrence. The percentage of partcipants with no vomiting and no retching episodes 0-120 hours following initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2 was calculated based on type of chemotherapy received.</description>

        <title>Functional Living Index - Emesis (FLIE) Total Score During Cycle 2 of Chemotherapy</title>
        <description>The FLIE Total Score is an 18-question quality-of-life questionnaire on the impact of nausea and vomiting (9 questions on nausea and 9 questions on vomiting) on daily life. Each question uses a visual analog scale (VAS) to rate the impact of nausea/vomiting from 1 to 7. FLIE Total Scores are calculated by summing the responses to the 18 questions and can range from 18-126 (18=a great deal of impairment, 126=no impairment), with a higher score indicating less impairment due to nausea and vomiting. &quot;No Impact&quot; on daily life was defined as a FLIE Total Score &gt;108. Participants completed the FLIE questionnaire on the morning of Day 6 following initiation of chemotherapy in Cycle 2; their responses covered their experiences with nausea and vomiting over the previous 5 days.</description>
