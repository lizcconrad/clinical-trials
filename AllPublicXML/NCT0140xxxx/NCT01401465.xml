      This is a randomized, multicenter, 2-way crossover study in subjects 12 years or older with
      perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) to evaluate patient preference, satisfaction and efficacy
      of ciclesonide nasal aerosol versus mometasone aqueous nasal spray. A novel
      patient-administered assessment, developed and validated to measure patient satisfaction with
      and preference of intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) for the treatment of allergic rhinitis
      (AR), is utilized in this study.

      and preference of intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) for the treatment of allergic rhinitis
      (AR), is utilized in this study.

      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences:

      Sequence 1: Treatment Period 1 = ciclesonide nasal aerosol 74 mcg once daily for two weeks;
      Treatment Period 2 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 mcg once daily for two weeks Sequence 2:
      Treatment Period 1 = mometasone nasal inhalation 200 mcg once daily for two weeks; Treatment
      Period 2 = ciclesonide Nasal aerosol 74 mcg once daily for two weeks

    <measure>Total Preference Composite Score Assessed at the End of the Study. The Total Preference Score is the Standardized Sum of 17 Individual Preference Items</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Study - Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>For the 17 individual items, patients were forced to choose their preference between ciclesonide and mometasone (item choices: 1 = prefer ciclesonide; 0 = prefer mometasone). The items for the Total Preference Score assessed 16 treatment attributes and one overall treatment preference: Ease of use, Convenience, Flexibility in daily activities, Taste, Use in public, Smell, Less &quot;run out&quot; of nose, Longer relief, Less &quot;run down&quot; of throat, Symptom relief, If both were the same price, Better appearance, Less nasal irritation, Faster relief, Number of sprays per dose, Makes nose feel, and Overall - the one preferred. The score is based on the proportion of items (x 100) preferred for ciclesonide and a score of 50 indicates no preference and scores over 50 indicate preference for ciclesonide. This analysis presents the comparison of ciclesonide versus mometasone and provides the score in relation to the preference for ciclesonide.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Regimen Attributes Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline for this measurement was Day 1 for Treatment Period 1 and Day 29 for Treatment Period 2. The assessment for Treatment Period 1 was on Day 14 and for Treatment Period 2 on Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The Regimen Attributes Composite Score is a composite of the Sensory Impact and Regimen Management Scales of the Allergic Rhinitis Treatment Satisfaction and Preference Scales. The Regimen Management Scale assess patient satisfaction with issues relating to dosing, ability to remember to use the spray, the ease/difficulty of the spray, and convenience of the treatment. The Sensory Impact Scale assess patient satisfaction with issues relating to sensory attributes, including medication running out of the nose, medication running down the throat, impact on smell/taste, etc. Scores range from 0 (lower satisfaction) to 100 (higher satisfaction).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Process Composite Preference Score</measure>
    <time_frame>End of Study - Day 43</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Process Composite Preference Score is a standardized sum of 9 individual preference items (Ease of use, Convenience, Flexibility Daily Activity, Taste, Use in public, Smell. Less &quot;Run out&quot; of nose, Less &quot;Run down&quot; of throat, Number Sprays Dose). For each of these 9 individual items, patients were forced to choose their preference between ciclesonide nasal aerosol 74 mcg and mometasone AQ 200 mcg. Larger values greater than 50 indicated greater preference for ciclesonide, while smaller values less than 50 indicated greater preference for mometasone.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Subject-reported AM and PM rTNSS Averaged Over Each 2-week Treatment Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Averages over each two week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) is the sum of 4 Nasal Symptoms: Runny Nose, Sneezing, Itchy Nose, and Nasal Congestion. These symptoms were assessed each morning and evening, and their totals averaged to obtain a daily average rTNSS. These daily averages were averaged over the 6 days prior to treatment to obtain the baseline value, and over the 14 days of each two-week period to obtain the on-treatment averages. The baseline values were then subtracted from the on-treatment averages to obtain the change from baseline scores. Subjects assess each individual symptoms on a scale of 0-3 where: 0 = absent, 1 = mild ,2 = moderate ,3 = severe Therefore, rTNSS values range from 0-12 (with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms). Reflective TNSS measures these symptoms over the previous 12-hour time interval.</description>

             cockroach, molds, animal dander) for a minimum of two years immediately preceding
             screening. The PAR must have been of sufficient severity to have required treatment
             (either continuous or intermittent) in the past, and require treatment with an INCS
             throughout the entire study period.

          -  At least one treatment for PAR during the 6 months prior to expected randomization, 14
             days, with a nasal spray.

             nasal polyps or other respiratory tract malformations; recent nasal biopsy; nasal
             trauma; or nasal ulcers or perforations. Clinically insignificant findings may be
             allowed if, in the investigator's judgment, the findings are unlikely to impact on:
             the safety or efficacy of an INCS: the subject's perception of treatment with an INCS.

          -  Surgery and atrophic rhinitis or rhinitis medicamentosa within the last 60 days prior

        <title>Total Preference Composite Score Assessed at the End of the Study. The Total Preference Score is the Standardized Sum of 17 Individual Preference Items</title>
        <description>For the 17 individual items, patients were forced to choose their preference between ciclesonide and mometasone (item choices: 1 = prefer ciclesonide; 0 = prefer mometasone). The items for the Total Preference Score assessed 16 treatment attributes and one overall treatment preference: Ease of use, Convenience, Flexibility in daily activities, Taste, Use in public, Smell, Less &quot;run out&quot; of nose, Longer relief, Less &quot;run down&quot; of throat, Symptom relief, If both were the same price, Better appearance, Less nasal irritation, Faster relief, Number of sprays per dose, Makes nose feel, and Overall - the one preferred. The score is based on the proportion of items (x 100) preferred for ciclesonide and a score of 50 indicates no preference and scores over 50 indicate preference for ciclesonide. This analysis presents the comparison of ciclesonide versus mometasone and provides the score in relation to the preference for ciclesonide.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Regimen Attributes Composite Score</title>
        <description>The Regimen Attributes Composite Score is a composite of the Sensory Impact and Regimen Management Scales of the Allergic Rhinitis Treatment Satisfaction and Preference Scales. The Regimen Management Scale assess patient satisfaction with issues relating to dosing, ability to remember to use the spray, the ease/difficulty of the spray, and convenience of the treatment. The Sensory Impact Scale assess patient satisfaction with issues relating to sensory attributes, including medication running out of the nose, medication running down the throat, impact on smell/taste, etc. Scores range from 0 (lower satisfaction) to 100 (higher satisfaction).</description>

          <description>The Regimen Attributes Composite Score is a composite of the Sensory Impact and Regimen Management Scales of the Allergic Rhinitis Treatment Satisfaction and Preference Scales. The Regimen Management Scale assess patient satisfaction with issues relating to dosing, ability to remember to use the spray, the ease/difficulty of the spray, and convenience of the treatment. The Sensory Impact Scale assess patient satisfaction with issues relating to sensory attributes, including medication running out of the nose, medication running down the throat, impact on smell/taste, etc. Scores range from 0 (lower satisfaction) to 100 (higher satisfaction).</description>

        <description>The reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) is the sum of 4 Nasal Symptoms: Runny Nose, Sneezing, Itchy Nose, and Nasal Congestion. These symptoms were assessed each morning and evening, and their totals averaged to obtain a daily average rTNSS. These daily averages were averaged over the 6 days prior to treatment to obtain the baseline value, and over the 14 days of each two-week period to obtain the on-treatment averages. The baseline values were then subtracted from the on-treatment averages to obtain the change from baseline scores. Subjects assess each individual symptoms on a scale of 0-3 where: 0 = absent, 1 = mild ,2 = moderate ,3 = severe Therefore, rTNSS values range from 0-12 (with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms). Reflective TNSS measures these symptoms over the previous 12-hour time interval.</description>

        <description>Reflects preference on items concerned with perceived drug effectiveness (longer relief; symptom relief; prefer if both were the same price; for feeling better about your appearance; for few problems with irritation to nose; faster relief; how it makes your nose feel). The score is based on the proportion of items (x 100) preferred for ciclesonide and a score of 50 indicates an equal number of items preferred in the two groups. Larger values than 50 indicated greater than 50 percent of the subjects indicated preference for ciclesonide, while smaller values than 50 indicated greater than 50 percent preference for mometasone. Data is presented as the mean treatment outcome composite score. This analysis presents the comparison of ciclesonide versus mometasone in relation to preference for ciclesonide.</description>
