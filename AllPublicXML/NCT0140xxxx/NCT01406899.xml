    <textblock>
      In this behavioral trial 80 substance abusing individuals will be randomly assigned to either
      treatment as usual in the substance abuse clinic of the Newington, CT VA hospital OR
      treatment as usual plus 8 hours of access to the 'CBT for CBT' computer program over a period
      of 8 weeks. Primary outcomes will be retention in treatment and reduction in substance use
      (percent days abstinent, confirmed by urine toxicology screens). The patients' ability to
      demonstrate coping skills through a computerized role-play evaluation will be a secondary
      outcome. A six-month follow-up will assess durability and/or delayed emergence of effects.

      This pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of adding a computer
      based training program in Cognitive Behavior Therapy (&quot;CBT4CBT&quot;) for the treatment of
      addictions in a VA substance abuse outpatient clinic. Key secondary aims are to assess the
      impact of adding CBT4CBT to standard care on treatment attendance, engagement, retention, and
      to investigate if certain process measures are associated with substance use outcomes.
      Approximately 80 patients enrolled in the Newington Outpatient Substance Abuse Treatment
      Program (SATP) will be randomly assigned to either (A) treatment as usual, or (B) treatment
      as usual plus exposure to the CBT4CBT program.
