      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy on maternal infection, chorioamnionitis
      and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and to review the evidence and provide recommendations
      on the use of antibiotics in PPROM.

    <textblock>
      Despite major advances in perinatal care, preterm delivery is still the predominant cause of
      perinatal mortality and a major cause of neurological morbidity and mortality. Although the
      determinants of preterm labor and delivery are uncertain, evidence suggests intrauterine
      infection is a contributing factor. Antibiotic therapy for women in preterm premature rupture
      of membranes has been a routine practice. However the optimal regimen remains unclear and the
      choice of latency antibiotic regimen is at the discretion of admitting physician. The group 1
      is treated only with cefazolin (1.0mg iv every 6 hours for 7 days). The group 2 is given a
      combination of cefazolin(1.0mg iv every 6 hours for 7 days) and erythromycin(250mg p.o. four
      times a day for 7 days). In group 3, clarithromycin (500mg p.o. 4 times a day for 7 days) was
      treated with cefazolin(1.0mg iv every 6 hours for 7 days). This study is designed to compare
      the efficacy on maternal infection, chorioamnionitis and neonatal morbidity and mortality and
      to review the evidence and provide recommendations on the use of antibiotics, especially by
      comparing the combination regimen in PPROM.

    <description>Antibiotics regimen was one of cefazolin or cefazolin plus erythromycin or cefazolin plus clarithromycin. Intravenous 1g cefazolin was given every 6 hours after negative result skin test for allergic reaction. With cefazolin plus erythromycin group or cefazolin plus clarithromycin, cefazolin was given with same protocol and 250mg oral erythromycin every 6 hours or 500mg oral clarithromycin every 12 hours was added. All antibiotics were given for 7 days or until delivery.</description>
