  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively reviewed all patients with neurosurgical operations for
      hemorrhagic stroke (intracerebral hemorrhage) between 1999 and 2008. Research assistant then
      telephoned the survivors for neurological and cognitive status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Death at one year for intracerebral hemorrhage varies by location, with 42% for cerebellar in
      one series. Of patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage in the United States during 2002,
      only 20% are expected to be functionally independently at 6 months. Although case series
      established the value of selected timely hematoma evacuation, long term clinical outcome,
      especially on cognition, is not well described in the literature. With these in mind, we
      carried out this study.
