  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a disease that affects mainly young people, and
      is associated with headache and loss of vision. The medical and surgical management of IIH is
      problematic and many patients are not treated effectively. Some cases of IIH are associated
      with severe stenosis of the large veins of the brain and various researchers have recently
      reported significant improvement in patients with IIH after the narrow veins of the brain
      were treated with a stent. Our project aims to evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy of
      venous sinus stenting in patients with severe IIH refractory to medical management.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Age &gt; 18 years

          2. Established diagnosis of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension according to the
             criteria of the 2004 International Classification of Headache Disorders (Table 3).

          3. Visual field loss: One of criteria A, B or C must be fulfilled.

             A. Severe visual function loss, defined as grades 4 and 5 on the Humphrey Visual Field
             Analyzer SITA Standard 24-2 Test grading scale (Table 4) at initial presentation.

             B. Moderate visual function loss, defined as grade 3 on the Humphrey Visual Field
             Analyzer SITA Standard 24-2 Test grading scale (Table 4) at presentation and failure
             of treatment with acetazolamide (Diamox) given at efficient dose (2g/d or maximum
             tolerated dose) or Topiramate (Topamax) given at efficient dose (maximum 150mg daily).
             Failure is defined by the absence of visual function improvement after 1 month of
             treatment and/or medication intolerance.

             C. Mild visual function loss, defined as grades 0,1 or 2 on the Humphrey Visual Field
             Analyzer SITA Standard 24-2 Test grading scale (Table 4) at presentation and a
             worsening to moderate or greater visual function loss, defined as grades 3-5, after 1
             month of treatment and/or medication intolerance.

          4. Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV) or Computed Tomography Venography (CTV)
             demonstrating bilateral transverse sinus stenosis or unilateral transverse sinus
             stenosis with contralateral transverse sinus hypoplasia or atresia. At least one of
             the stenoses must cause â‰¥ 50% reduction of the sinus lumen diameter.

          5. Signed informed consent obtained from the patient.
