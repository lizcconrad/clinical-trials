  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the volume of injected ciment (polymethyl
      methacrylate) between a group of patients treated with vertebroplasty and a group of patients
      treated via kyphoplasty. Secondary evaluation will compare the restoration of vertebral
      height, volume and cyphotic angle between the two techniques, as well as extravation of
      ciment and functional and quality of life aspects related to these techniques.
