      The main purpose of this study was to compare the effects on bones of the following two drug
      combinations:

        -  maraviroc (MVC), emtricitabine (FTC), plus darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r)

        -  tenofovir (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) plus darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r)

      Additional study objectives were the following:

        -  To see how the drug combinations affect the brain and kidneys.

        -  To see how well the drug combinations lower the HIV viral load.

        -  To see how safe the drug combinations are, how well people are able to take the study
           drug combinations, and how well their immune systems respond to the study drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are now several HIV treatment options for a person with HIV infection who has not yet
      been treated. Most people who receive treatment and take their medications as directed have a
      good result. This is usually determined by measuring the amount of HIV in the blood (viral
      load). The best response is when HIV cannot be found (less than 50 copies/mL) in the blood.
      However, it has recently become clear that some people with HIV who are receiving effective
      HIV drugs continue to have more health problems than people without HIV infection. Sometimes,
      there is damage to organs in the body, including bone, kidneys, and the brain.

Participants who discontinued the study with an unconfirmed virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1000 copies at 16 weeks or HIV-1 RNA level &gt; 200 copies/mL at or after week 24) are considered as virologic failures at the study visit week of the unconfirmed value. Time to virologic failure is defined as the time from study entry to the planned visit week of the initial failure.
Product-limit estimates for the survival function were used to estimate the cumulative probability of virologic failure over time and its corresponding 95% confidence interval for each treatment group.</description>

        <description>Confirmed virologic failure is defined as confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt; 1000 copies/mL at or after week 16 and before week 24, or confirmed HIV-1 RNA levels&gt; 200 copies/mL at or after week 24. Participants who discontinued the study with an unconfirmed virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1000 copies at 16 weeks or HIV-1 RNA level &gt; 200 copies/mL at or after week 24) are considered as virologic failures at the study visit week of the unconfirmed value. Time to virologic failure is defined as the time from study entry to the planned visit week of the initial failure.
Product-limit estimates for the survival function were used to estimate the cumulative probability of virologic failure over time and its corresponding 95% confidence interval for each treatment group.</description>
