    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to determine if clonal deletion before kidney transplantation
      can effectively reduce the need for post transplant immunosuppression. The investigators will
      adapt a DAWN (Drugs (immunosuppressants) Added When Needed) treatment protocol to assess the
      effect of clonal deletion and closely monitor acute rejection, renal function, and graft
      survival. 15 patients eligible for the study as described below will be enrolled.

      The objective of this trial is to determine if clonal deletion can effectively reduce the
      need for post transplant immunosuppressive medicine. Emphasis will be placed on adverse
      events that are associated with clonal deletion. The investigators will assess whether DAWN
      (Drugs (immunosuppressants) Added When Needed) is feasible in living-relative donor kidney
      transplantation and the effectiveness of clonal deletion treatment on the rate of rejection,
      patient survival, and graft function from day 0 to 12 months after transplantation. Numbers
      of patients on single drug and dual therapy immunosuppression will be counted. Additionally,
      the investigators would assess time to immune event (rejection or antibody), the severity of
      acute rejection or antibody mediated rejection by Banff criteria, the incidence of delayed
      graft function (defined as the need for post-transplant dialysis), and the incidence of
      adverse events including infection, grade 3 and above non-hematologic toxicities, and grade 4
      hematologic toxicities.
