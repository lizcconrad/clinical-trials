  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fructose is an ingredient that is added to many of our foods. It is a cheaper, sweeter
      additive that can be found in everything from soda pop to yogurt to granola bars. In the last
      few years a significant number of studies have been published linking consumption of fructose
      with obesity, hypertension and more recently, kidney and cardiovascular disease.

      Animal studies show a strong link between excessive ingestion of fructose and the development
      of kidney and cardiovascular disease mediated by the renin angiotensin system, a hormonal
      system whose activation is detrimental to both the kidney and the heart. There has been very
      little research done on the potentially pathophysiological relationship between a high
      fructose diet and kidney and cardiovascular disease in humans.

      The investigators hypothesize that ingestion of fructose will result in upregulation of the
      renin angiotensin system in humans.

      PRIMARY AIM: To examine whether the physiologic and molecular responses to Angiotensin II
      (AngII) challenge differ in response to fructose intake as assessed by two independent means:

        1. The renal and mean arterial pressure (MAP) response to an AngII challenge.

        2. Reactive changes in circulating levels of renin and aldosterone with graded AngII
           challenge.

      PRIMARY HYPOTHESES: Ingestion of fructose in healthy subjects will result in:

        1. A decrease in renal and systemic sensitivity to infused AngII.

        2. A decrease in the reactive changes in renin and aldosterone with graded AngII challenge.
