  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes and high blood sugar are extremely common among patients presenting to US Emergency
      Departments. Intravenous fluids with or without insulin are often used to treat these
      patients. However, simple, low-cost interventions, such oral hydration have not been studied
      in this context. Oral rehydration may be better than no therapy at all, which is often what
      these patients receive in the first few hours when presenting to busy, overcrowded Emergency
      Department (ED) with long wait times, or in resource-poor environments such as developing
      countries. The investigators propose a study to see if oral hydration for adult patients
      presenting to the ED with high blood sugar i.e. finger-stick (FS) values between 250 and 500
      mg/dL can help lower blood sugar at the same rate as intravenous fluids. Half the patients
      will be given intravenous fluids per our department protocol, while the other half of the
      patients will be given 2 liters of water to drink over a 1-hour period. Both groups will have
      their blood sugar measured every 30 mins for 2 hours. The investigators will analyze the data
      to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in blood sugar between the
      two groups within 2 hours.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient, above the age of 18 years old, presenting to Emergency Department triage
             with a fingerstick glucose between 250 and 500 mg/dL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of DKA (hyperglycemia with ketonuria and abnormal pH or
             bicarbonate on venous blood gas), HHS, or other critical illnesses requiring immediate
             medical attention (as determined by ED triage nurses),

          -  end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis through an arterio-venous shunt or fistula,

          -  abnormal mental status (GCS &lt; 15),

          -  unstable vital signs including pulse &gt; 100, SBP &lt; 100, respiratory rate&gt;20, (or any
             combination of vital signs not meeting these cutoffs but deemed worrisome by the
             triage nurse) or unable to tolerate oral intake/actively vomiting.

          -  Patients who receive IV fluids prior to or during the study period.

          -  Patients unable to communicate in English or Spanish.

          -  Jail patients will also be excluded.
