    <textblock>
      Prevention and treatment of hypothermia by active warming in prehospital trauma care is
      recommended but scientifical evidence of its effectiveness in a clinical setting is scarce.
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of additional active warming during
      road or air ambulance transportation of trauma patients.

      Patients were assigned to either passive warming with blankets or passive warming with
      blankets with the addition of an active warming intervention using a large chemical heat pad
      applied to the upper torso. Ear canal temperature, subjective sensation of cold discomfort
      and vital signs were monitored.

      Mean core temperatures increased from 35.1°C (95% CI; 34.7-35.5 °C) to 36.0°C (95% CI;
      35.7-36.3 °C) (p&lt;0.05) in patients assigned to passive warming only (n=22) and from 35.6°C
      (95% CI; 35.2-36.0 °C) to 36.4°C (95% CI; 36.1-36.7°C) (p&lt;0.05) in patients assigned to
      additional active warming (n=26) with no significant differences between the groups. Cold
      discomfort decreased in 2/3 of patients assigned to passive warming only and in all patients
      assigned to additional active warming, the difference in cold discomfort change being
      statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). Patients assigned to additional active warming also
      presented a statistically significant decrease in heart rate and respiratory frequency
      (p&lt;0.05).

      In mildly hypothermic trauma patients, with preserved shivering capacity, adequate passive
      warming is an effective treatment to establish a slow rewarming rate and to reduce cold
      discomfort during prehospital transportation. However, the addition of active warming using a
      chemical heat pad applied to the torso will significantly improve thermal comfort even
      further and reduce the cold induced stress response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were sequential trauma patients, age ≥ 18 years, who had sustained an injury
             outdoors and were transported by one of the participating EMS units.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if initial level of consciousness was affected, (Glasgow Coma
             Scale &lt; 15), if they required prehospital CPR or if duration of transportation was
             expected to be shorter than 10 minutes.

          -  As the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of active warming intervention
             in cold stressed patients, those patients who had already received active warming or
             had been taken indoors for more than 10 minutes before EMS unit arrival or had an
             initial cold discomfort rating ≤ 2 were also excluded.
