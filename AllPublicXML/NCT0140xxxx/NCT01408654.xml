    <textblock>
      This randomized trial compares peer companionship to care-as-usual in primary care on the
      outcome of risk for suicidal behavior in late life. The investigators hypothesize that older
      adults assigned to receive peer companionship will report greater social connectedness and
      less death and suicidal ideation compared to older adults assigned to care as usual.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a pressing need for interventions that reduce risk for suicide in later life. Older
      adults in the U.S. have the highest rate of suicide and are the fastest growing segment of
      the population. The investigators can anticipate a large rise in the number of older adults
      who die by suicide in coming decades. This application is in response to RFA-CE-10-006.
      Consistent with the CDC's key strategy of reducing suicide by promoting connectedness, our
      long-term goal is to reduce late life suicide-related morbidity and mortality by leveraging
      the resources and expertise of the aging services provider network (ASPN) to address unmet
      social needs of community-dwelling older adults. Our objectives with this proposal are (1) to
      examine whether linking socially disconnected seniors with peer supports through the Retired
      and Senior Volunteer Program (RSVP) is effective in reducing risk for suicide, and (2) to
      test an hypothesized mechanism for the association of social disconnectedness and suicidal
      ideation and behavior informed by the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide.

      The investigators will recruit 400 primary care patients (200 men and 200 women) over age 60
      years who endorse feeling lonely and/or as if they are a burden on others. They will be
      randomly assigned to either of two conditions. Those assigned to The Senior Connection (TSC)
      will either be paired with a peer companion or, if they prefer and are eligible, be trained
      and placed as a peer companion for others by RSVP. The comparison group will receive no
      further intervention (&quot;care-as-usual&quot; [CAU]). Subjects will be followed for up to 24 months
      with repeated in-home (baseline, 12, and 24 months) and telephone assessments (3, 6, and 18
      months).
