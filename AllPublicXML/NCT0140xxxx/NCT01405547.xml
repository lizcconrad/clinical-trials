  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is on the rise and is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes later in
      life. Recent evidence indicates that abnormalities that increase risk for diabetes may be
      initiated early in infancy. Since the offspring of women with diabetes have an increased
      long-term risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes, the impact of maternal metabolic
      abnormalities on early nutrition and infant metabolic trajectories is of considerable
      interest. The purpose of the study is to investigate the impact of maternal nutrition and
      metabolic abnormalities in pregnancy on human milk and subsequently on infant health over the
      first year of life.

      The current investigation is a prospective study conducted within ongoing cohort studies of
      women and their offspring. Pregnant women attending outpatient obstetrics clinics in Toronto,
      Canada are recruited. The overall study protocol includes four study visits between the
      second half of pregnancy and the first year of infant's life and interim phone call
      interviews:

        -  Pregnant women undergo an oral glucose tolerance test at an expected average of 30 weeks
           of gestation and complete medical and lifestyle questionnaires including food frequency
           questionnaires.

        -  Infant birth anthropometry measurements and human milk samples are collected at an
           expected average of 3 days postpartum. The timing of onset of lactogenesis II is asked
           at 3d, 5d, 7d postpartum or until the event occurrence up to day 7.

        -  At 3 months postpartum, follow-up assessments including infant anthropometry, medical
           and lifestyle questionnaires and human milk sample collection are completed.

        -  Interim telephone interviews are conducted at 6 weeks and 5, 7, 9 months postpartum to
           characterize infant feeding and supplementation behaviors.

        -  At 12 months postpartum, infant anthropometric assessments are conducted.
