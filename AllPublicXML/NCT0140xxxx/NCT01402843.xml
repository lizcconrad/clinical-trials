  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pitavastatin, a representative statin-series anti-dyslipidemic drug, and Valsartan, a
      representative ARB-series anti-hypertensive drug, have been authorized for use also in South
      Korea. They have been tested in many countries and proved to be effective and safe. The
      concurrence of dyslipidemia and hypertension has a higher rate, hence statin-series drugs and
      antihypertensive drugs are simultaneously administered to such patients. The combined
      administration of statin-series drugs and CCB-series drugs have.

      This clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the combined
      administration of Pitavastatin and Valsartan to ethnic Koreans with dyslipidemia concurrent
      with hypertension, as well as to research the influence on the pharmacodynamic interaction
      between the two drugs.
