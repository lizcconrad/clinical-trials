      Background and rationale Chronic hepatitis B is the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and
      hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide.(1) Antiviral therapy with oral nucleoside analogs and
      interferon can reduce viral load and hepatic necroinflammation, and may reduce the risk of
      hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic complications. (2-4) Peginterferon has both direct
      antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. The advantages of this drug include a finite course
      of treatment and the lack of drug resistance. However, it requires subcutaneous injections
      and carries some side effects. Besides, only 30% to 40% of treated patients have sustained
      response to treatment.(5-8) To reduce the costs and side effects of treatment, it is
      important to predict if a patient will respond to peginterferon. Genetic host studies on
      peginterferon response will provide a lot of knowledge on the interaction between the host
      and the virus to induce immune control, also outside the setting of immune modifying therapy.
      Recently, genome wide association studies (GWAS) identified genetic polymorphisms of the
      IL28B gene that were shown to be associated with treatment response to interferon and
      ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C.(9-12) The same polymorphisms are also
      associated with natural clearance of hepatitis C virus. Whether the same phenomenon applies
      to patients with chronic hepatitis B is unclear. Furthermore, response to conventional
      interferon has shown to decrease the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and to prolong
      survival.(13) Virological and serological response to PEG-IFN is durable in a substantial
      proportion of patients through 3 years of follow-up (14), but whether treatment benefits are
      sustained after that period and amount to clinically meaningful results is unknown. To date,
      a GWAS to predict the response to peginterferon in chronic hepatitis B patients has not been
      performed. Polymorphisms in genes such as IL28B can be identified through a GWAS and can be
      used to assess the chance of response to treatment and select patients who have a high
      probability of response to peginterferon.

      We aim to perform a GWAS in chronic hepatitis B patients previously treated with
      peginterferon to identify polymorphisms in genes that are associated with response to this
      treatment regimen.

      For the GWAS stage of this study, a cohort study will be conducted comparing hepatitis B
      patients with a response (see definitions below) versus patients who did not achieve a
      response to (peg)interferon treatment. Replication of SNPs identified by the GWAS will be
      performed in an independent cohort of patients with similar characteristics, treated with
      (peg)interferon. A large independent cohort of peginterferon treated HBV patients has already
      been identified guaranteeing a replication cohort.
