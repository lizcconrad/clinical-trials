  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) in its typical form occurs after a food born infection
      with a shiga-toxin secreting bacteria, usually Escherichia coli of the O157H7 serotype. An
      outbreak of bloody diarrhea followed by HUS begun after a collective meal with 120 persons on
      June 8th, 2011 in Bègles, a city of Bordeaux urban area (CUB).

      At least 9 patients, 8 adults and 1 child have been involved in this HUS outbreak, E. coli of
      the O104:H4 serotype being demonstrated in most patients. This outbreak is remarkable by its
      preponderance in adults and women, its aggressiveness with multiorgan involvement , i.e. the
      kidneys, brain, liver, pancreas, and skin.

      Pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment of typical HUS are poorly defined, particularly in
      adults who are usually not involved in typical E. coli O157H7 HUS.

      The aim of the present study is to gain knowledge on these different aspects of the HUS,
      including response to therapy.
