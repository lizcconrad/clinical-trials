  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe drug concentrations of an investigational HIV
      medication, GSK1349572, in blood plasma, cervicovaginal fluid, vaginal and cervical tissue in
      HIV negative women.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe first dose and steady state
      pharmacokinetics of GSK1349572 in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) and vaginal (VT) and cervical
      (CT) tissue compared to blood plasma (BP) in HIV-1 negative women. Based on current
      literature, GSK1349572 has demonstrated a desirable pharmacokinetic profile in BP, including
      low to moderate pharmacokinetic variability (CV% 9-41), extended t1/2 (13-15h) and trough
      concentrations which remain 25-fold higher than the protein-adjusted IC90 ~0.064Âµg/mL for
      wild type virus. Understanding pharmacokinetic behavior of GSK1349572 in multiple female
      biological compartments will inform its role in sterilizing the genital tract in HIV-infected
      women, as well as protect mucosal tissue against HIV infection (pre/post-exposure
      prophylaxis).

    <description>Subjects will take an oral daily 50mg dose of GSK1349572 for 5-7 days. GSK1349572 in the CVF and BP will be measured over 24 hours after both the initial dose, and once steady state is reached 5-7 days later at the following time points: 0 (pre-dose) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 18, and 24h. Cervical and vaginal biopsies will be collected once at initial dose at either 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours post dose, and again at steady state at the same single time point. Samples will be collected from 2 subjects per time point. BP and CVF samples will be obtained at 48 and 72 hours following the final GSK1349572 dose.</description>
