  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV-infected people have an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). The
      standard course of treatment for TB is 6 to 9 months of isoniazid (INH). A shorter course of
      treatment may be as effective and potentially increase treatment adherence. This study will
      compare the safety and effectiveness of a 4-week regimen of rifapentine (RPT) plus INH versus
      a standard 9-month regimen of INH in HIV-infected people who are at risk of developing active
      TB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2009 there were 9.4 million new cases
      of TB, and 1.68 million people died as a result of TB. Among new TB cases, 1.1 million
      occurred in people who were HIV-coinfected, and 35% of TB deaths were among HIV-coinfected
      individuals. In Africa, TB is the leading AIDS-related opportunistic infection. Latent TB
      infection occurs when people are infected with the bacteria that cause TB, but they do not
      have any symptoms of TB infection. Latent TB can develop into active TB, and HIV-infected
      people have an increased risk of progressing from latent TB to active TB. INH is a medication
      that is prescribed for people with latent TB to help prevent active TB from developing. The
      standard INH treatment regimen is 6 to 9 months; a shorter treatment regimen may prove to be
      as effective and may improve adherence. The purpose of this study is to compare the safety
      and effectiveness of a 4-week daily regimen of RPT plus INH to a standard 9-month daily INH
      regimen for TB prevention in HIV-infected individuals.

      This study will enroll HIV-infected people who do not have evidence of active TB but who are
      at high risk of developing active TB. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive RPT
      and INH once a day for 4 weeks or INH once a day for 9 months. All participants will receive
      pyridoxine (vitamin B6) with each dose of INH to help prevent possible side effects. Study
      visits will occur at baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 36. At select study
      visits, participants will undergo a physical exam, clinical assessment, blood collection, and
      a chest radiograph or chest computed tomography (CT) scan (if needed). Some participants will
      have their blood stored for future testing. Follow-up study visits will occur every 12 weeks
      starting at Week 48 and will continue for 3 years after the last participant is enrolled.

          -  Female participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to study entry. More information on this
             criterion can be found in the protocol.

          -  All participants must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active
             attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, donate sperm, in vitro fertilization)

             to study entry or, at screening, presence of any confirmed or probable TB based on
             criteria listed in the current ACTG Diagnosis Appendix

          -  History of multi-drug resistant (MDR) or extensively-drug resistant (XDR) TB at any
             time prior to study entry

          -  Known exposure to MDR or XDR TB (e.g., household member of a person with MDR or XDR
             TB) at any time prior to study entry

          -  Treatment for more than 14 consecutive days with a rifamycin or more than 30
             consecutive days with INH at any time during the 2 years prior to enrollment

          -  For participants taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) at study entry, only approved
             nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with efavirenz (EFV) or nevirapine
             (NVP) for at least 4 weeks are permitted. Any other regimens at entry are
             exclusionary. A list of approved antiretroviral drugs is located on the A5279
             protocol-specific webpage (PSWP). Participants on NVP must be dosed at 200 mg twice
             daily (BID). NOTE A: NVP trough levels will be evaluated in the first 90 participants
             in Arm A who are receiving NVP at entry and who meet other criteria in Section 10.0 of
             the protocol, after which enrolment for participants on NVP may be temporarily halted.
             NVP PK data will be evaluated to determine whether standard NVP dosing results in
             adequate PK drug exposure in the presence of RPT treatment. If the A5279 team
             determines that concomitant dosing of NVP and RPT results in adequate drug exposure,
             the study may continue enrollment of participants receiving NVP. NOTE B: Participants
             randomized to Arm A may initiate any ART regimen after completing 4 weeks of RPT/INH.
             Participants randomized to Arm B may initiate any ART regimen after study entry.

             their formulation

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements
