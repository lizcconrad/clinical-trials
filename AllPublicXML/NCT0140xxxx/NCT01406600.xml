  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choriogonadotropin alfa (Ovidrel®) is a recombinant hCG (rhCG) preparation derived from
      genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells, which is widely used for final oocyte
      maturation triggering in assisted reproductive technology (ART).Recombinant hCG has been
      investigated about its safety and efficacy comparing with urinary hCG, but still the optimal
      dose of rhCG is questionable. From former studies, there only have been proven that high dose
      of hCG can make ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in usual condition. On the other
      hand, we hypothesize that high dose of hCG may improve oocyte maturity in poor responders who
      cannot easily provoke OHSS. Hence, this study will assess the comparative efficacy and safety
      of 250mcg and 500mcg of rhCG in ART treatment cycle.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>oocyte maturity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to the ovum pick up day. At the point of ovum pick-up, we can count how many mature or immature oocytes were retrived. Therefore, in one hour after ovum pick-up, outcome measurement will be possible.</time_frame>
    <description>After administration of different doses of rhCG, oocyte maturity will be assessed on ovum pick up day. Oocytes will be classified into GV, MI, and MII.</description>

    <measure>clinical pregnancy rate</measure>
    <time_frame>After confirming fetal heart beat via transvaginal ultrasound. Usually 2 to 4 weeks after ovum pick-up day.</time_frame>
