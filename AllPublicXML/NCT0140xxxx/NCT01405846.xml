  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are going to use a special type of bronchoscopy test to examine patients who have had
      previous surgical treatment for lung cancer or head and neck cancer. The aim is to determine
      a) whether we can identify precancerous changes in their airways b) whether this type of
      testing is acceptable and c) get an initial idea of whether a new drug called gefitinib has
      any effect on precancerous areas in the airway.
