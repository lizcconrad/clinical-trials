    <textblock>
      This observational study will examine the safety and efficacy profile of Elonva
      (corifollitropin alfa) when administered in Korean women undergoing controlled ovarian
      stimulation (COS) in combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist for
      the development of multiple follicles in an assisted reproductive technology (ART) program.
