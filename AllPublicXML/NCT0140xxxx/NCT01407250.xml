      Comparison of the quality of the outpatient clinic electrocardiogram performed on patients
      sent to a cardiology consultation with a standard cable and the PhysioGlove-ES
      electrocardiograms performed in the cardiology clinic.

      The correct performance of a 12 lead electrocardiogram depends on the correct placement of
      the electrocardiogram electrodes in internationally agreed upon anatomic locations on the
      patient's limbs and chest. This process requires specific training and diligence on the part
      of the electrocardiogram performer. The literature points towards a progressive quality
      degradation of the electrocardiogram performance probably due to the delegation of it's
      performance to lesser trained individuals. This study is attempting to ascertain the quality
      of the electrocardiogram recordings performed in non-specialized out patient clinics.

      For this purpose we will compare outpatient electrocardiograms of patients referred to a
      cardiological consultation with electrocardiogram's acquired using a conventional
      electrocardiogram cable as well as the PhysioGlove-ES by the well training cardiology clinic
      personnel.
