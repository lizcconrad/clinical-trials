  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Myelodysplastic syndrome, epigenetic treatments such as Azacitidine and Decitabine have
      been highlighted in phase 3 studies. However, as the 1st line treatment, it has not been
      evaluated the head to head comparison of two drugs. This study is a retrospective study to
      compare the efficacy of two drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among 300 MDS patient, 200 of them have been taking Azacitidine and 100 of them have been
      taking Decitabine. Medical chart of these patients will be reviewed to assess the efficacy
      and safety between two agents.
