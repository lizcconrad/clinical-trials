      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of temsirolimus when given
      together with dexamethasone, mitoxantrone hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and
      pegaspargase in treating young patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia or
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone,
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and pegaspargase work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving temsirolimus with combination chemotherapy may be and effective treatment
      for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose of
      temsirolimus administered weekly for 2 doses in combination with intensive re-induction
      chemotherapy in children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL).

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of temsirolimus in combination with intensive
      re-induction chemotherapy in children with relapsed ALL or NHL administered on this schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare minimal-residual disease (MRD) levels present at end of induction to historical
      control in patients with relapsed ALL or NHL with bone marrow involvement of disease.

      II. To determine the complete remission (CR) rate in patients with ALL or NHL who receive
      this regimen.

      III. To evaluate responsiveness of patient ALL cells to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      inhibition using in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic assessment of the response of ALL
      blasts to temsirolimus.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) or intravenously (IV) on days 1-5 and 15-19;
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-2; temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1 and 8; vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; and pegaspargase IV over 1
      hour on days 3 and 17. Some patients may also receive methotrexate intrathecally (IT) up to
      72 hours prior to or on day 1 and on day 8.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant are not eligible for this trial

          -  Patients who are currently receiving therapeutic anticoagulants (including aspirin,
             low molecular weight heparin, and others) are not eligible

          -  Patients who are currently receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
             are not eligible due to the development of angioneurotic edema-type reactions in some
             subjects who received concurrent treatment with temsirolimus + ACE inhibitors

          -  Enzyme-Inducing anti-convulsants: patients who are currently receiving enzyme-inducing

          -  Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible

          -  Patients with known optic nerve and/or retinal involvement (because it may not be
             possible to safely delay irradiation) are not eligible; patients presenting with
             visual disturbances by history or physical exam should have an ophthalmological exam
             and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 14 days prior to enrollment to determine
             whether there is optic nerve or retinal involvement

          -  Patients with known Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Kostmann syndrome, Shwachman
             syndrome or any other known bone marrow failure syndrome are not eligible
