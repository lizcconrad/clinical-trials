    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if provision of an effective psychotherapy for
      Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), prolonged exposure, can be tolerated in alcohol
      dependent patients with PTSD and if it is associated with better treatment outcomes compared
      to an active control condition.

    <measure>Impact of Event Scale-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Impact of Event Scale-Revised is a 22-item self-report measure of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The total score for the Impact of Event Scale-Revised ranges from 0 to 88 with lower scores representing less severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and higher scores representing more severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.</description>

    <measure>Timeline Follow Back</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The timeline follow back is a measure of drug and alcohol consumption in the prior 90 days. The timeline follow back is a calendar-based retrospective account of drug and alcohol consumption for a specified period of time (e.g., past 90 days). One of the most commonly reported metrics of drug and alcohol consumption from this measure is percent days abstinent (PDA). Percent days abstinent is simply the proportion of days for the specified period of time (e.g., 90 days) in which drugs or alcohol were not consumed. Percent days abstinent can range from 0 to 100 with 0 representing no abstinence during a specified period of time (i.e., consumed alcohol every day) and 100 representing complete abstinence during a specified period of time.</description>

    <description>Trauma focused exposure therapy is a well-described cognitive-behavioral therapy that utilizes imaginal and in vivo exposure techniques to reduce the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. In addition to imaginal and iv vivo exposure techniques, in the current study patients were provided psychoeducation about posttraumatic stress disorder, a rationale for trauma focused exposure therapy, and were taught breathing retraining as a method to manage arousal associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. Nine to 12 50-60 minutes sessions were provided.</description>

        <description>The Impact of Event Scale-Revised is a 22-item self-report measure of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The total score for the Impact of Event Scale-Revised ranges from 0 to 88 with lower scores representing less severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and higher scores representing more severe symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.</description>

        <title>Timeline Follow Back</title>
        <description>The timeline follow back is a measure of drug and alcohol consumption in the prior 90 days. The timeline follow back is a calendar-based retrospective account of drug and alcohol consumption for a specified period of time (e.g., past 90 days). One of the most commonly reported metrics of drug and alcohol consumption from this measure is percent days abstinent (PDA). Percent days abstinent is simply the proportion of days for the specified period of time (e.g., 90 days) in which drugs or alcohol were not consumed. Percent days abstinent can range from 0 to 100 with 0 representing no abstinence during a specified period of time (i.e., consumed alcohol every day) and 100 representing complete abstinence during a specified period of time.</description>
