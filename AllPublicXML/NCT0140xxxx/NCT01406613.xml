  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2year observational study that will recruit patients who have previously completed
      a randomised, open label, parallel, single centre study (TRIO Study) of three
      bisphosphonates: alendronate, ibandronate and risedronate. These drugs are the most commonly
      used group of treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the UK. However, the length of
      time for which these treatments continue to work after they are stopped has not been fully
      elucidated. Without this information it is unclear as to how long doctors should treat and
      whether it would be good practice to give drug 'holidays'.

      The investigators plan to compare the effects on bone quantity and quality of stopping these
      licensed bisphosphonates in patients who have taken the medication for a duration of two
      years. The investigators aim to recruit up to 100 postmenopausal and up to 100 premenopausal
      (reference range) subjects. Measurements collected at the final visit of the previous study
      will be used for 'baseline' values for this study.

      The postmenopausal group will have an initial study visit to secure informed consent, and
      then further study visits at 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks after stopping medication. Visit
      procedures will include:

      Blood and urine samples for measurements of bone biomarkers Bone Mineral Density of the
      spine, hip, whole body, forearm Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and heel dual X-ray
      and Laser (DXL) Quantitative Ultrasound of Bone (QUS) Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA).

      The premenopausal group will have one study visit, 96 weeks after completing the previous
      study. Visit procedures will include:

      Blood and urine samples for measurements of bone biomarkers Bone Mineral Density of the spine
      and hip (DXA)

      A subgroup of 50 premenopausal women will also have the following measurements:

      Bone Mineral Density of the whole body, forearm (DXA), and heel (DXL) Quantitative Ultrasound
      of Bone (QUS).

      The current study is an observational study aiming to compare the effects of stopping
      medication on bone quantity and quality, in patients who have previously taken bisphosphonate
      drugs for a duration of two years.

      This study will recruit participants who have previously completed the TRIO study. The TRIO
      study aimed to compare the effects of three licensed bisphosphonates on bone quantity and
      quality. Participants in the treatment group of the TRIO study were randomised to treatment
      with one of three licensed bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate and risedronate) for a
      duration of two years.

      Measurements taken at the final TRIO study visit will be used as 'baseline' values for this
      study. The postmenopausal group will have an informed consent visit, followed by further
      study visits at 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks after stopping medication.

      Study visit procedures for the postmenopausal group will include:

      Blood and urine samples for measurements of bone biomarkers at 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks off
      treatment.

      Study visit procedures for the postmenopausal group will include:

      Blood and urine samples for measurements of bone biomarkers at 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks off
      treatment Height and weight at 48 and 96 weeks off treatment. Bone Mineral Density of the
      whole body, spine, hip, forearm (DXA) and heel (DXL) at 48 and 96 weeks off treatment
      Vertebral Fracture Assessment (VFA) at 48 and 96 weeks off treatment. Quantitative Ultrasound
      of Bone (QUS) of the heel at 48 and 96 weeks off treatment.

      Participants will be given a diary at their first study visit, to record any newly prescribed
      medications, hospitalisations, etc. The diary will be reviewed at each study visit to record
      any adverse events or concomitant medications. Participants will also be asked to complete
      the standard Metabolic Bone Centre questionnaire at their first and final study visit, so
      that any changes in lifestyle can be captured. We will maintain the patients on treatment
      with calcium and vitamin D supplements throughout the study as this would be consistent with
      standard clinical practice.

      The TRIO study recruited a group of premenopausal women in order to collect data to act as a
      reference range for the physical measurements and also to act as internal controls for the
      study. This study plans to recruit these control participants to continue to act as a
      reference range in this study.

      The premenopausal group will have a single study visit, scheduled 96 weeks after completing
      the TRIO study. Study visit procedures for the premenopausal (reference) group will include:

      Blood and urine samples for measurements of bone biomarkers Urine based pregnancy test Height
      and weight Bone Mineral Density of the hip and spine (DXA).

      A subgroup of 50 premenopausal (reference) women will also have the following:

      Bone Mineral Density of the whole body, forearm (DXA) and heel (DXL) Quantitative Ultrasound
      of Bone (QUS) of the heel Participants will be asked to complete the standard Metabolic Bone
      Centre questionnaire, so that any changes in lifestyle can be captured. Participants will
      also be asked about any hospitalisations, newly prescribed medications, etc to capture any
      adverse events and concomitant medications.
