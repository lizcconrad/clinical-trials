  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine how different ways of performing prostate cancer surgery affect
      patient outcomes, such as recurrence of cancer or regaining control of bladder function
      (continence) after surgery. Surgery to remove the prostate is known as a &quot;radical
      prostatectomy&quot;. Surgeons know many things about the best way to do a radical prostatectomy.
      However, there is uncertainty about some methods of surgery.

      All of the surgeons who are taking part in this study have used these techniques at different
      times. However, they are unsure as to what is the best approach. This trial will evaluate
      whether the following two aspects of surgical technique influence outcome:

      Lymph node template. Prostate cancer can sometimes spread to the lymph nodes near the
      prostate. Surgeons often remove these lymph nodes to make sure that no cancer is left in the
      body. However, there is uncertainty about which lymph nodes to remove (the &quot;template&quot;). In
      particular, not all surgeons think that it is important to remove a large number of lymph
      nodes. Some believe that prostate cancer found in the lymph nodes is not aggressive. As a
      result, these surgeons feel that removing additional lymph nodes does not improve the chance
      that a patient will be cured. In the study patients will either have the standard lymph node
      dissection or a modified approach.

      Port site incision. Some surgeries are conducted with the help of what is called a surgical
      &quot;robot&quot;, or using a laparoscopic approach (sometimes known as &quot;keyhole&quot; surgery). The
      surgeons have to make small cuts (&quot;incisions&quot;) in order to insert their surgical instruments.
      Some surgeons believe that the way in which this cut is made can affect the chance that a
      patient will develop a hernia in the months after surgery. This is when tissues in the
      abdomen protrude through the incision, creating a small bulge that has to be surgically
      corrected. In the study, patients will either have the incision made vertically or
      horizontally.

      Antibiotics. About a week after surgery, you will return to the hospital to have your
      catheter removed. To guard against the chance of infection, you will be given antibiotics.
      These do help prevent infection, but are also harmful. Doctors are unsure whether to give a
      short course of antibiotics or whether patients really need several days of treatment. In the
      study, patients will receive antibiotics for either one or three days.

    <measure>urinary tract infection (UTI)</measure>

    <description>urinary tract infection (UTI) within 10 days of catheter removal. We will use the CDC's definition of UTI: symptomatic UTI diagnosed in patients with positive urine cultures (â‰¥100,000 microorganisms per cm3) and at least one of the following signs or symptoms with no other recognized cause: fever (&gt;38oC), urgency, frequency, dysuria or suprapubic tenderness.50 UTI is routinely captured by clinical staff as a surgical complication.</description>
