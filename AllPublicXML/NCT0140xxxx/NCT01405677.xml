  <brief_title>Safety and Immunogenicity of a Paediatric Dose of Virosomal Hepatitis A Vaccine</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the original study was to assess whether the protection afforded by
      the paediatric dose of Epaxal vaccine against hepatitis A was not inferior to the protection
      afforded by the standard dose of Epaxal. The aim of the follow-up phase was to perform a
      computer based modelling analysis of the long term protection afforded by the paediatric
      dose, and to compare this with the standard dose and also with an alternative hepatitis A
      vaccine (Havrix Junior).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Original study:

             vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject when applicable and from the
             parent/legal guardian of the subject. - Free of obvious health problems as established
             by medical history and/or clinical examination before entering the study.

        Follow up phase:

          -  Subjects enrolled and randomized in the primary study and having received two doses of
             the study vaccine

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered drug or vaccine within 30 days preceding
             the first dose of study vaccine, or planned use during the study period and safety
             follow-up

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first vaccine dose. (For
             corticosteroids, this means prednisone, or equivalent, &gt;=0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and
             topical steroids were allowed.)

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study vaccine

          -  Previous vaccination against hepatitis A

          -  Seropositive for anti-HAV antibodies (&gt;=10 mIU/mL)

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment
