  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of an insulin pump controlling
      algorithm while the subject is under close medical supervision in the Clinical Research
      Center (CRC) setting.

      This study is a non-randomized, uncontrolled feasibility study that looks to enroll people
      with type 1 diabetes who are currently using an insulin pump. During the subject's
      participation, the study staff will closely monitor the study subject in a clinical research
      center environment for approximately 24 hours, while controller algorithm determined insulin
      doses are delivered by an insulin pump, and utilizing continuous glucose monitoring results.

      Total subject participation approximately 1 week for screening to completion. This includes
      approximately 24 hours usage of the investigation device in the clinical research center
      under close medical supervision.
