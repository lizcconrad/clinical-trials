    <textblock>
      This pilot study examined the effect of providing a 4 weeks of cost free quit smoking
      medications to smokers identified in a stroke prevention clinic who were interested in
      quitting smoking compared to providing a prescription for the medication only.

      DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. METHODS: All patients seen at the Ottawa Hospital Stroke
      Prevention Clinic were screened for smoking status, advised to quit smoking and treated using
      a standardized protocol including counselling and pharmacotherapy. Eligible smokers were
      randomly assigned to either a prescription only usual care group, or, the experimental group
      who received a 4-week supply of cost-free quit smoking medications and prescription for
      medication renewal. All patients received follow-up counselling 7-days prior to and 5, 14,
      30, 60, 90, 180 days following their quit attempt. Levels of eligibility, consent, adherence
      and retention were used as indicators of study feasibility. The primary outcome was
      bio-chemically validated quit rates at 26-weeks.

    <description>The dependent variables of primary interest were measured at 26 weeks and included: (1) bio-chemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence; and (2) continuous abstinence since TQD. Participants who were not available for follow-up were considered smokers. At the 26 week follow-up, all patients who reported being abstinent from smoking had their smoking status confirmed by measurement of a CO sample. If any CO was &gt;10 ppm, the subject was considered a smoker.</description>

    <measure>quit attempts</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>At the 26 week follow-up assessments patient quit attempts in the previous six months of 24 hours or longer were documented.</description>

    <measure>adherence with intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>During the 26-week telephone follow-up assessment patient adherence with pharmacotherapy was assessed by evaluating the number of doses of pharmacotherapy consumed within the prescribed study interval. The telephone counsellor recorded the completion of all seven counselling sessions in order to assess patient adherence.</description>
