      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of implementing wireless remote monitoring
      combined with structured telephone monitoring, versus current care, on variation in
      rehospitalization among older patients hospitalized with heart failure at six medical
      centers.

    <description>During their hospitalization, patients will receive education on their condition and will be taught to use a wireless remote monitoring device that they will use from home on a daily basis for six months following hospital discharge. Patients will receive structured telephone phone calls from a centralized call center nurse at least once a week for the first month post-discharge, and monthly for the remainder of the six month study period. Patients may receive additional calls depending upon the information gathered during the scheduled call center phone calls and/or their health status as ascertained by the data (weight, heart rate, blood pressure, answers to general health and heart failure-related questions) transmitted daily by the wireless remote monitoring device.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients hospitalized at any of the six medical centers who are being actively treated
             for heart failure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who have previously received a transplant, are being evaluated for a
             transplant, or who are on the wait list for a transplant,

          -  patients who are enrolled or enrolling in hospice, or are expected to expire shortly
             after discharge,

          -  patients with dementia,

          -  patients who are admitted from a skilled nursing facility (SNF), or who we anticipate
             will be discharged to a long term stay in a SNF,

          -  patients who do not have a working land line phone or reliable cell service,

          -  patients on chronic dialysis,

          -  patients who cannot identify a usual source of care (free clinic is acceptable) and
             who will not be assigned a provider upon discharge,

          -  patients with the following cardiovascular conditions: patients with valvular
             disorders requiring surgical intervention (except for those with incidental valvular
             disease, who will be included), acute myocardial infarction (except for those with
             demand ischemia, who will be included), percutaneous coronary intervention

          -  patients expected to enroll in hospice or expire after discharge,

          -  patients who are unable to use the intervention equipment (e.g., unable to stand on
             the weight scale), or who are otherwise unable to comply with the intervention
