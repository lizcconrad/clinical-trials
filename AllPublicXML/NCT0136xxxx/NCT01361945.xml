  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, administering infusions of AUY922 with
      hormonal therapy (letrozole) and oral targeted drug (lapatinib) will have on the patients
      with advanced breast cancer known as ER+ HER2 +.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose and schedule of AUY922 is the MTD dose identified in the phase I, given as 1 hour
      infusion weekly.

      The Phase II component will have a 2 stage design single arm design. (Section 9.0). Overall
      response rate (ORR) is the primary endpoint. Estimated N=40 (12 in first stage) .A total of
      39 response-evaluable participants is required. In the first stage, 12 response-evaluable
      participants will be accrued; if there are 3 or fewer CR+PRs, the study will stop for
      futility. There is a 55% probability of stopping early if, in fact, the ORR is 28%. If there
      are 4 or more CR+PRs, the study will proceed to the second stage and an additional 27
      response-evaluable participants will be accrued. We will accrue 1 additional patient (then
      the needed 39 to account for attrition)

        Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) 1.5x109/L Hemoglobin (Hgb) 9 g/dl Platelets (plt) 100x109/L

          -  Potassium within normal limits

          -  Total calcium (corrected for serum albumin) and Phosphorus within normal limits

          -  Magnesium above LLN or correctable with supplements

          -  AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) if AP &gt; 2.5 ULN

          -  AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT ≤ 2.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) if AP ≤ 5.0 x ULN if

          -  Serum bilirubin 1.5 x ULN

          -  Serum creatinin 1.5 x ULN or 24-hour clearance 50 ml/min

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test. The serum pregnancy test must be obtained prior to the
             first administration of AUY922 (≤ 72 hours prior to dosing) in all pre-menopausal
             women and women &lt;2 years after the onset of menopause

          -  Histologically confirmed HER2 + and ER+ or PR + (i.e., HR+) Postmenopausal women with
             Metastatic breast cancer or resistant locally advanced breast cancer.

          -  Stage of disease (stage IIIb/c not responding or progressing to standard therapy with
             trastuzumab) or stage IV receiving first line treatment in the metastatic setting .
             All patients should have documented clinical progression prior to entering study

             in phase II, but allowed up to 3 lines for patients enrolled in Phase I. Prior
