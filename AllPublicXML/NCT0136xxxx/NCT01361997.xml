    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determinate if 70% isopropyl alcohol is not inferior
      preventing contamination of peripheral hemocultures, compared with 2% chlorhexidine in 70%
      isopropyl alcohol.

      The develop of contaminants in blood cultures is a problem of great impact to health
      institutions and patients, as they represent a waste of resources, and additionally increases
      the patient's hospital stay. The principal source of contaminant is the bacteria in the skin
      flora, so the greatest way to improve the sensibility of this test is to do an optimal skin
      antisepsis. It has been reported that 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol is
      superior that other skin disinfectants, and that 70% isopropyl alcohol has a high efficacy
      reducing the presence of bacteria on the skin, so both antiseptics are good options for skin
      antisepsis.

    <description>When a hemoculture is ordered, the laboratory technician will prepare the necessary materials for venipuncture. Previously the technician must take randomly a sealed envelope, where will be writing the antiseptic to be used for antisepsis. The technician will select a site for venipuncture, preferably in the forearm, and will do the antisepsis in the site selected, letting act the substance for 45 seconds. After this procedure, the venipuncture shall be done. The sample will be cultured for 120 hours at 35 +/- 2°C.</description>
