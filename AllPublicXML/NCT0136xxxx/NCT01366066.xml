  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation in spinal cord injured men an increase in
      pressure was observed in the external urethral sphincter along with an increase in bladder
      capacity. In a subsequent study it was demonstrated that Transcutaneous Mechanical Nerve
      Stimulation (TMNS) in women could induce pressure increment of the external urethral
      sphincter. A pilot study have since shown that after 6 weeks of stimulation 24 out of 33
      women suffering from urinary stress incontinence were able to contract their pelvic floor
      muscles and had become free of symptoms. Another pilot study has shown promising effect on
      the overactive bladder syndrome.

      The present study aims to treat urinary incontinence and includes 2 groups of patients with
      30 patients in each group: Women suffering from urinary stress incontinence and women
      suffering from urge incontinence. A medical vibrator is used and in each group the subjects
      will be randomized to vibration treatment or no vibration treatment. All patients will
      receive pelvic floor training and all women suffering from urge incontinence will receive
      anticholinergic medications.

      The stimulation will be performed at the perineum every day for 6 weeks with an amplitude of
      2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz. Results will be evaluated on the basis of questionnaires,
      micturition diaries and diaper tests.

      If the investigators are able to demonstrate a significant reduction in the incontinence
      symptoms in the subjects the investigators asses that vibration can be a way of
      reestablishing a normal function of the pelvic floor muscles and bladder function in
      incontinent patients.

    <description>A medical vibrator (FERTI CARE personel, Multicept A/S, Albertslund, Denmark) will be used. The stimulation works through a vibrating disc of hard plastic with a diameter of 3.5 cm. The stimulation point will be the perineum. The stimulation will be performed with a vibration amplitude of 2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz.
A daily stimulation sequence consisting of 10 seconds of stimulation followed by a 10 second pause repeated 10 times will be used through 6 weeks.</description>
