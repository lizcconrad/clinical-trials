  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In many surgical procedures, anaesthesiological care is provided according to the best
      scientific and clinical information available. However, since hemodynamic monitoring until
      recently did not allow for beat-to-beat information of the haemodynamical changes, many
      fast-changing events may have been unnoticed or have not been investigated as precisely as is
      possible today. Moreover, in several surgical procedures - like eye surgery - the
      invasiveness of the classical haemodynamical monitoring devices was of such a degree that
      until now, in these circumstances these vital parameters were not investigated yet.

      Therefore, the availability of this new device, which allows for noninvasive beat-to-beat
      assessment of these haemodynamical parameters gives a unique opportunity to investigate our
      anaesthesiological management and to elucidate whether improvements are desirable and
      possible.

      The Nexfin monitor consists of a cuff-micromanometer that is located around the third finger.
      It simultaneously uses continuous pressure readings and light-absorption spectrometry to
      determine valuable haemodynamical information. Data is recorded and available for subsequent
      offline analysis.
