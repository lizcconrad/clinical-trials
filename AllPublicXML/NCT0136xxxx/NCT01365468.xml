  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of RAD001 in patients with
      Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) associated with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1).

      The aim of the study was to :

        1. determine whether RAD001, administrated orally daily on a continuous dosing schedule
           might:

             1. Increases time to disease progression (TTP) based on volumetric MRI measurements in
                children and adults with NF1 in inoperable documented progressive PN (stratum 1).

             2. Results in objective radiographic responses based on volumetric MRI measurements in
                children and adults with NF1 and inoperable PN in the absence of documented
                radiographic progression at the trail entry (stratum

        2. To evaluate the tolerability and toxicity of chronic RAD001 administration in this
           patient population as assessed by the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, version 4.0.

    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 patients were to be enrolled to receive everolimus in an open label manner.
      A total of 9 patients were enrolled to either Stratum 1 or Stratum 2.

      The study was open for enrollment up to 2 years. Because the target enrollment was not
      achieved in this period, study was terminated with less patient than planned.

    <description>This endpoint was planned to be analyzed for only Stratum 1 patients. Progression of disease defined as a ≥ 20% increase in the volume (by volumetric MRI) of at least one of the index plexiform neurofibromas (PN) compared to the pretreatment volume measured prior to the start of the current treatment phase.</description>

    <description>Response was assessed at the time that a follow up volumetric MRI scan is performed (after course 6 and then every 6 months and at the end of treatment).
Complete response (CR): complete resolution of all measurable or palpable PN for ≥ 28days and no appearance of new lesions.
Partial response (PR): A ≥ 20% reduction in the sum of the volume of all index PN lesions for ≥ 28days.
Stable disease (SD): A &lt; 20% increase and &lt; 20% decrease in the sum of the volume of all index PN lesions for ≥ 28days.</description>

    <description>Adverse events were assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, the severity of mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening, corresponding to grades 1 - 4 respectively, were used. CTCAE grade 5 (death) was not used in this study.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening, after course #3, #6, #12, #18, #24, End of Treatment (1 course = 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician‟s Global Assessment of Clinical Condition (PGA) is a 7-point grading scale for the investigator's assessment of the overall extent of improvement or worsening of the patient‟s skin disease as compared to baseline. Responses must be confirmed by at least two assessments separated in time by at least 4 weeks. The grading ranges from 0 to 6; 0 is Completely clear where as 6 is for worse condition. A complete clinical response (CCR) requires a grading of 0 indicating the absence of disease (histological confirmation is not required). Grades 1, 2, and 3 constitute partial response, indicating improvement of at least 50 percent, but less than 100 percent improvement.</description>

Progression of disease defined as a ≥ 20% increase in the volume (by volumetric MRI) of at least one of the index plexiform neurofibromas (PN) compared to the pretreatment volume measured prior to the start of the current treatment phase.</description>

        <description>The Physician‟s Global Assessment of Clinical Condition (PGA) is a 7-point grading scale for the investigator's assessment of the overall extent of improvement or worsening of the patient‟s skin disease as compared to baseline. Responses must be confirmed by at least two assessments separated in time by at least 4 weeks. The grading ranges from 0 to 6; 0 is Completely clear where as 6 is for worse condition. A complete clinical response (CCR) requires a grading of 0 indicating the absence of disease (histological confirmation is not required). Grades 1, 2, and 3 constitute partial response, indicating improvement of at least 50 percent, but less than 100 percent improvement.</description>
