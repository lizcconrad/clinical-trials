  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This intervention program combines biofeedback PFME with a telephone or support group
      intervention to treat persistent urinary incontinence (UI). The study's primary aims are to
      improve continence, quality of life, and mood through enhancing adherence to PFME and
      self-management of incontinence symptoms. The secondary aims are to examine the physiological
      effects and cost effectiveness of the proposed interventions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled longitudinal study. Patients with early-stage prostate
      cancer and UI for more than six months were randomly assigned to one of three study arms: (1)
      biofeedback PFME plus a support group (BF+SUPPORT); (2) biofeedback PFME plus telephone
      (BF+PHONE); and (3) usual care (UC). The BF+SUPPORT and BF+PHONE participants learned PFME
      through computerized biofeedback. Thereafter, the BF+SUPPORT participants attended six group
      meetings and the BF+PHONE participants had six phone contacts every other week for three
      months. The UC participants did not receive biofeedback PFME or telephone/group intervention
      but continued receiving usual medical care. All subjects were assessed blind at baseline, 3
      months (post intervention) and 6 months (follow-up). In addition, 49 moderately to severely
      incontinent patients were recruited from the three study groups to undergo urodynamic testing
      at baseline and 3 months for the evaluation of physiological changes. Data of the costs for
      the interventions and the participants' medical care were collected for a cost-effectiveness
      analysis.
