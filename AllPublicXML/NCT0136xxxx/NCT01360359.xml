  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial of low back pain exercise programs is to
      determine if trunk control can be changed by core stabilization exercises. The proposed
      mechanism of pain reduction and functional improvement of core stabilization exercises is
      that it enhances trunk movement and muscle control. This study will provide preliminary
      evidence of the link between patient outcomes and treatment mechanisms.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        -  both treatment groups will demonstrate significant improvements in pain and function;

        -  only subjects in the core stabilization group will demonstrate significant improvements
           in trunk movement and muscle control.

Stage 2: promotes maintenance of co-contraction while performing movements of the arms/legs and trunk progressing to preformance of these exercises on unstable surfaces; trunk muscle conditioning also emphasized; feedback gradually reduced.
Stage 3: emphasis on maintenance of co-contraction while performing functional activities; stable and unstable surfaces; use of perturbation and random practice to enhance motor learning.</description>
