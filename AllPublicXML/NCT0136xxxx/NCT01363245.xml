  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to compare the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of an inpatient
      smoking cessation intervention for all smokers hospitalized at two urban public hospitals.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our sites are: Bellevue Hospital Center (a New York City public hospital) and the Manhattan
      campus of the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System. During hospitalization, all smokers will
      receive usual care. At the time of discharge, patients will be randomized to one of two arms:
      multisession telephone counseling by their hospital's smoking cessation staff, or faxed
      referral to the state Quitline (which will then perform phone outreach as per Quitline
      protocol). All patients enrolled in the study will receive nicotine replacement therapy.

      The primary aims are:

      Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of the intervention (proactive multisession telephone
      counseling by in-hospital staff) versus control ('fax-to-quit' Quitline referral).

      Aim 2: To evaluate and compare the cost-effectiveness of these interventions from a societal
      perspective and from a payer perspective.

      The secondary aims are:

      Secondary Aim 1: To compare outcomes by race/ethnicity, immigrant status, inpatient
      diagnosis, and location of patient hospitalization Secondary Aim 2: To compare outcomes of
      the interventions at 6 and 12 months post-discharge Secondary Aim 3: To compare
      biochemically-verified abstinence rates at 6 months post-discharge Secondary Aim 4: To
      compare cessation outcomes between those who are known HIV-seropositive and those who are
      not, and explore possible mediators of cessation in HIV-seropositive patients
