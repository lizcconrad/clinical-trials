      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. it may also help doctors
      predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarker expression in tissue samples from young
      patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the expression of immunoregulatory proteins including CD4, FOXP3 and CD276
           in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

        -  To correlate the expression of these proteins with the levels of anaplastic lymphoma
           kinase (ALK) autoantibodies in patient of ANHL0131.

      OUTLINE: Archived tissue microarray samples are analyzed by mass spectrometry and validated
      by Western blotting, flow cytometry, and IHC.
