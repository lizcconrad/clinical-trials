    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to clarify wether body posture during ingestion of 60mg Efient, a
      thrombocytic inhibitor, has influence on the time to thrombocytic inhibition.

      The study aims to mimic the treatment Danish patients receive when admitted to the hospital
      with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction since these patients are refereed to acute
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) necessitating fast and efficient thrombocytic
      inhibition.

      Current guidelines recommend the administration of Efient right before the PCI procedure,
      while the patient is lying down, either in the ambulance or in the operating room. We, the
      investigators, believe that this is suboptimal for the patient, since any sort of prolonged
      inhibition time will possibly worsen the patients prognosis and make the patient more prone
      to later clotting issues.

      Our hypothesis is that by making the patients ingest the tablets in a 90 degrees upright
      position and making them sit up for 2 minutes after ingestion, the effect of the pills will
      commence faster than if taken in a supine position. This will possibly lead to faster
      inhibition of the thrombocytes, which we believe will lead to a lower incidence of clotting
      issues during and after the procedure.

      The study will be divided into two sessions: first session will be the control arm- ingestion
      of Efient in supine position.

      14 days later, the same test-persons will be doing the intervention- ingestion of Efient
      sitting upright for 2 minutes. Besides this, the second session will be exactly the same as
      the control arm.
