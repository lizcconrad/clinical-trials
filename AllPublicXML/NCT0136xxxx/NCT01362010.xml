      This is a phase IIa prospective, multicenter, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled,
      parallel group, dose range finding clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of Minocycline Foam 1% and 4% for the treatment of Acne Vulgaris.

      The study consists of a screening / baseline visit, a treatment period where patients will be
      treated topically on the facial skin areas affected by acne twice daily for 12 weeks,
      followed by a post-treatment follow up visit 4 weeks after end of treatment. The first dose
      will be applied in the presence of the study investigator or his assignee. Subsequent
      applications will be made by the patients.
