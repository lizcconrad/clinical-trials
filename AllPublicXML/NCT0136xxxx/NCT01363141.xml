  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously demonstrated that Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs)
      are associated with several chronic diseases in humans and that blood AGE levels can be
      significantly reduced by simply changing the way food is cooked.

      This is an interventional-randomized study in which we are trying to determine whether a diet
      low in AGE followed for 1 year can effectively reduce circulating AGE levels as well as
      markers of the metabolic syndrome in a group of patients with these abnormal markers.

    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome (MetSyn), a well-defined cluster of pathogenic conditions, includes
      glucose intolerance, insulin resistance (pre-diabetes), hypertension, abdominal obesity, and
      dyslipidemia. The MetSyn has a strong inflammatory component and raises the risk for
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) by five-fold and of diabetes by two fold in aging. Although,
      excessive caloric intake, i.e. &quot;over nutrition&quot; is known to be involved in developing the
      MetSyn, the actual causative agents of MetSyn in human nutrition have not been determined.

      The investigators have previously shown that Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs) can
      induce oxidant stress and inflammatory responses and modulate insulin signaling in animal
      models and more recently in humans. These studies separated the effects of &quot;over-nutrition&quot;
      from the pro-inflammatory effects of AGEs, a factor not previously considered. These data
      support our hypothesis that AGE-restriction could be an important intervention in the MetSyn
      in aging.

      The investigators would like to demonstrate that this safe, practical and economical
      intervention can arrest the progression of three major &quot;epidemics&quot; of aging: diabetes,
      obesity, and vascular disease associated with the metabolic syndrome. This simple
      intervention could have significant health and economic implications.

      Our hypothesis is that dietary AGE restriction can reverse several cardinal manifestation of
      the MetSyn, specifically insulin resistance, abdominal obesity and cardiovascular disease.
