  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether a study medication (d-cycloserine) improves
      the ability of older adults to perform on tests of neuropsychological functioning. Tests of
      neuropsychological functioning assess attention, memory, and executive functioning skills
      (for example, problem-solving, planning and organizing skills). It was hypothesized that
      participants who received study medication would perform better on neuropsychological tests
      than would participants who received the sugar pill.

      Accumulating data support the augmenting effects of d-cycloserine (DCS) when combined with
      exposure-based treatment for anxiety disorders. Additional research is needed to determine
      whether DCS facilitates other forms of cognitive processing (e.g., attention, memory,
      executive functioning) that are involved in cognitive behavioral therapies which do not rely
      on extinction as a mechanism of action. This question is particularly important among older
      adults who have experienced normal age-related declines in cognitive functioning, which may
      interfere with their ability to benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapies. The aim of the
      current study was to determine the cognitive enhancing effects of DCS on neuropsychological
      test performance among healthy older adults. It was hypothesized that participants who
      received d-cycloserine would demonstrate superior performance on neuropsychological tests
      than would participants who received placebo.

    <description>The CLVT-II is an assessment of verbal learning and memory which measures recall and recognition scores, encoding strategies, learning rates and error types. A list learning task with 16 words from 4 semantic categories are read over a series of 5 list presentations. Recall is assessed after learning and at a 20-minute delay. Software produces a report that computes raw and standardized scores. Our dependent variable was the age adjusted t-score for total number of words recalled after 5 trials. A higher score indicated better recall. The maximum possible score was 80 and a minimum was 0.</description>

          <title>California Verbal Learning Test-II (CLVT-II)</title>
          <description>The CLVT-II is an assessment of verbal learning and memory which measures recall and recognition scores, encoding strategies, learning rates and error types. A list learning task with 16 words from 4 semantic categories are read over a series of 5 list presentations. Recall is assessed after learning and at a 20-minute delay. Software produces a report that computes raw and standardized scores. Our dependent variable was the age adjusted t-score for total number of words recalled after 5 trials. A higher score indicated better recall. The maximum possible score was 80 and a minimum was 0.</description>
