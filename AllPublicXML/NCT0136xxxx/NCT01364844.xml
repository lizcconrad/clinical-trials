  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open-label study of DS-7423 to assess its safety and tolerability,
      identify a RP2D, (recommended Phase 2 Dose) and assess its Pharmacokinetics (PK) (what your
      body does to process the drugs and how your body gets them out of your system.) and
      pharmacodynamics (PDy) (Pharmacodynamics is a study of what a drug does to your body)
      properties in subjects with advanced solid malignant tumors. This study will include 2 parts:
      part 1-Dose Escalation and part 2-Dose Expansion.

      Study Hypothesis: DS-7423 will be safe and tolerable, and will exhibit acceptable PK and PDy
      properties in subjects with advanced solid malignant tumors for whom standard therapy has
      failed or for whom no standard therapy exists.

      Part 1 : Dose-escalation of DS-7423 to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in subjects
      with advanced solid tumors Part 2 : Dose Expansion: The purpose of Part 2 of this clinical
      research study is to confirm the safety and tolerability of the MTD of DS-7423 identified in
      Part 1, and measure the effects of DS-7423 on your cancer. Part 2 will be conducted in
      subjects with advanced colorectal or endometrial cancer.
