      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of community
      gynecologist initiated treatment of intra-uterine polyps and submucosal fibroids with the
      MyoSure Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal System in a significantly sized patient population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 500 and 600 subjects will be enrolled in a prospective, multi-center registry study.
      Approximately 100 of these cases will be completed in an office setting, with the remaining
      400-500 cases completed in a hospital outpatient or ambulatory surgery center. Subjects will
      undergo a hysteroscopic tissue removal procedure to remove intrauterine polyps and submucosal
      fibroids.

    <description>The MyoSure Tissue Removal Device consists of a hand-held tissue removal device comprising a mechanical drive assembly connected to a drive cable and associated control box on one end, and a 3 mm shaft on the other end of the device. The shaft is approximately 12 cm long and equipped with an open channel that houses an oscillating blade. When the side channel is exposed to target tissue and the motor is activated, the oscillating blade will cut the tissue within the channel. Once cut, the tissue travels down the center of the 3mm shaft via suction coupled to the proximal end of the tissue removal device, and is trapped in a vacutainer bottle.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy female between 18 and 65 years of age

          2. Subject must be able to understand, read and sign the study specific informed consent
             forms after the nature of the study has been fully explained to her

          3. Subject is indicated for myomectomy or polypectomy

          4. Subject exhibits intrauterine polyps and/or submucous myomas which meet one of the
             following criteria. In cases of subjects with multiple intrauterine pathology,
             classification is based as follows:

               -  All polyps

               -  All Type 0, Type 1 or Type 2 myomas ≤ 6 cm in diameter

               -  Polyps plus Type 0, Type 1 or Type 2 myomas ≤6 cm in diameter

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is pregnant

          2. Subject has an Intrauterine Device (IUD) at the time of the procedure. A subject may
             be enrolled in the study if the IUD is removed prior to the treatment procedure

          3. Subject is taking an anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication other than low dose
             aspirin

          4. Active pelvic inflammatory disease or pelvic/vaginal infection

          5. Subject has a known or suspected coagulopathy or bleeding disorder

          6. Subject has a history of disease which increases the risk for fluid overload (i.e.
             significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction)

          7. Subject has other co-morbid condition(s) that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could limit the subject's ability to participate in the study or impact the scientific
             integrity of the study

          <title>Intrauterine Pathology, Myomectomy</title>
          <description>Subjects with intrauterine fibroids and/or polyps will undergo intrauterine pathology removal using the MyoSure Tissue Removal System; myomectomy procedure.
MyoSure Tissue Removal System: The MyoSure Tissue Removal Device consists of a hand-held tissue removal device comprising a mechanical drive assembly connected to a drive cable and associated control box on one end, and a 3 mm shaft on the other end of the device. The shaft is approximately 12 cm long and equipped with an open channel that houses an oscillating blade. When the side channel is exposed to target tissue and the motor is activated, the oscillating blade will cut the tissue within the channel. Once cut, the tissue travels down the center of the 3mm shaft via suction coupled to the proximal end of the tissue removal device, and is trapped in a vacutainer bottle.</description>
