  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether the omega-3 fatty acid stearidonic
      acid (SDA), when used as a food ingredient, increases the level of the long-chain omega-3
      fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in red blood cell (RBC) membranes in men and women.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male or female, 21 to 65 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) ≥18.00 and &lt;40.00 kg/m2 at visit 1, week -2.

          3. Subject has no health conditions that would prevent him/her from fulfilling the study
             requirements as judged by the Investigator on the basis of medical history and routine
             laboratory test results.

          4. Subject is willing to avoid alcohol consumption for 24 h prior to every clinic visit.

          5. Subject has no plans to change smoking habits during the study period.

          6. Subject is willing to maintain a stable body weight, activity level and dietary
             pattern except for use of the study products, as directed.

          7. Subject understands the study procedures and signs forms providing informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization for release of relevant protected health
             information to the study Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has coronary heart disease or a coronary heart disease risk equivalent
             including any of the following:

               1. Diabetes mellitus (or fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL at visit 1, week -2);

               2. Clinical signs of atherosclerosis including peripheral arterial disease,
                  abdominal aortic aneurysm, carotid artery disease [symptomatic (e.g., transient
                  ischemic attack or stroke of carotid origin) or &gt;50% stenosis on angiography or
                  ultrasound] or other forms of clinical atherosclerotic disease (e.g., renal
                  artery disease);

               3. Presence of multiple risk factors that give a person a greater than 20% chance
                  for developing coronary artery disease within 10 years. This will be determined
                  by the Framingham risk index calculated at visit 1, week -2.

          2. Abnormal laboratory test results of clinical significance, including, but not limited
             to creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL and ALT or AST ≥1.5X the upper limit of normal at visit 1,
             week -2.

          3. TG ≥400 mg/dL at visit 1, week -2.

          4. Subject smokes more than one pack of cigarettes (20 cigarettes) per day.

          5. Subject has a history or presence of clinically important renal, hepatic, pulmonary,
             biliary, gastrointestinal, neurologic or endocrine disorders that in the judgment of
             the Investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to provide informed
             consent, comply with the study protocol (which might confound the interpretation of
             the study results), or put the subject at undue risk. Stable, treated hypothyroidism
             is allowed.

          6. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic blood
             pressure ≥100 mm Hg as defined by the average blood pressure measured at visit 1, week
             -2). One re-test will be allowed on a separate day prior to visit 2, week 0 for
             subjects whose blood pressure exceeds either of these cut points at visit 1, week -2.

          7. Unstable use (initiation or change in dose) within four weeks of visit 1 (week -2;
             Appendix 1) of antihypertensive medications or thyroid hormone replacement.

          8. Use of any lipid-altering drugs, including statins, bile acid sequestrants,
             cholesterol absorption inhibitors, fibrates, or prescription formulations of niacin
             within four weeks of visit 1 (week -2) and throughout the study. If a subject needs to
             wash off of a drug, he/she will be consented and then asked to return after the four
             week washout.

          9. Use of EPA/DHA from a drug or supplement within four months of visit 1, week -2 and
             throughout the study period. If subject has used &gt;1.0 g/d of EPA, DHA, or combination
             of EPA and DHA from a drug or supplement, use must have been discontinued at least six
             months prior to the visit 1, week -2 blood draw.

         10. Frequent use (more than twice per month) of any non-study-related EPA/DHA containing
             enriched foods (such as DHA-enriched eggs) within four months of visit 1, week -2 and
             avoidance of these enriched foods throughout the study period.

         11. Use of ALA-containing seeds and oils (i.e., flaxseed, perilla seed, hemp, spirulina,
             walnut, mustard seed or black currant oil) for more than one week duration within four
             weeks of visit 1, week -2 and throughout the study period.

         12. Consumption of fatty fish (salmon, herring, mackerel, albacore tuna, or sardines) more
             than twice per month within four months of visit 1, week -2. Unwillingness to avoid
             all fish, except shellfish and crustaceans, throughout the study period (Appendix 6.
             Note: it is recognized that many fish are not significant sources of omega-3 fatty
             acids; however, these foods are restricted to simplify the dietary advice in this
             low-dose SDA study).

         13. Use of any dietary supplement known to alter lipid metabolism, including but not
             limited to: dietary fiber supplements, red rice yeast supplements, garlic supplements,
             soy isoflavone supplements, sterol/stanol products, policosanols, niacin or its
             analogues at doses &gt;50 mg/d, or others at the discretion of the Investigator within
             the four weeks prior to visit 1, week -2 or during the study. If a subject needs to
             discontinue a lipid-altering supplement(s), he/she will washout for four weeks prior
             to the screening visit procedures (visit 1, week -2).

         14. Use of any weight-loss medication (prescription or over-the counter) including, but
             not limited to, lipase inhibitors [orlistat (alli™)], within four weeks prior to visit
             1, week -2 and throughout the study.

         15. Use of any weight loss supplement or program within four weeks of visit 1, week -2 and
             throughout the study.

         16. Known allergy or sensitivity to study products or any ingredients of the study
             products (study products may contain milk, soy or wheat).

         17. Subject has a history or presence of cancer in the prior two years, except for
             non-melanoma skin cancer (e.g., basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin).

         18. Females who are pregnant, planning to be pregnant during the study period, lactating,
             or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to commit to the use of a
             medically approved form of contraception throughout the study period. The method of
             contraception must be recorded in the source documentation.

         19. Current or recent history of (within 12 months of visit 1, week -2) or strong
             potential for alcohol or substance abuse. Alcohol abuse will be defined as &gt;14 drinks
             per week (1 drink = 12 oz beer, 5 oz wine, or 1 ½ oz distilled spirits).

         20. Exposure to any non-registered drug product within 30 days prior to the screening
             visit (visit 1, week -2).
