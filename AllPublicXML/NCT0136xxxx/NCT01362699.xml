    <textblock>

      This study will evaluate whether JNJ 31001074 reduces the urge to drink alcohol in non
      treatment seeking, adult study participants with current alcohol dependence. Individuals who
      meet criteria for study participation will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      groups (tablets containing JNJ 31001074 or placebo tablets with no active ingredients) in a
      1:1 ratio. Treatment group assignment will not be known by study participants or study staff.
      Baseline assessments will be recorded and participants will return to the clinic for testing
      on the last day of taking their assigned study medication for 7 days at home. Alcohol use is
      not allowed for 3 days prior to this end-of-dosing testing. During this test, their urge to
      drink alcohol and their mood will be measured while they view various computer images and
      then are presented with (but do not drink) either a favorite alcoholic beverage or water.
      Other measures will be collected during the study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      the study medication, including potential effects on sleep, as well as measures of thinking
      and cigarette smoking. Participants will return for a follow-up visit approximately 1 week
      after finishing the study medication and completing the clinic assessment above. Study
      participants will take one 3-mg tablet of JNJ-31001074 or matching placebo in the morning,
      preferably with food, for 7 days.
