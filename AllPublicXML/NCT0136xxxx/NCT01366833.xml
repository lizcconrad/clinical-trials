  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Canadian Cancer Society there are approximately 1700 new cases of esophageal
      cancer per year in Canada. As most of these patients are diagnosed in advanced stages of the
      disease, 1800 deaths are estimated from this cancer annually . Progressive dysphagia is the
      most common presenting symptom and impacts not only the patient's quality of life but the
      ability to tolerate life prolonging treatments such as systemic chemotherapy.

      Although there are several therapeutic modalities to alleviate malignant dysphagia including
      laser, photodynamic therapy and cryotherapy , the use of stents and radiotherapy are the most
      commonly employed. However, the optimal approach to effective, timely treatment of malignant
      dysphagia remains a challenge. The investigators conducted a preliminary retrospective review
      to investigate such palliation procedures and found that a multi-modality approach may yield
      the most favourable results .

      Therefore, our clinical trial will examine the effectiveness of adding a single dose of
      brachytherapy to patients with severe dysphagia who have already been treated with a
      endoscopically placed self-expanding metallic stent.
