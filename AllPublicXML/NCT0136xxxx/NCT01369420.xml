    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the NanoKnife Low
      Energy Direct Current (LEDC) System when used to treat unresectable pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. Safety will be reviewed by means of analysis of adverse events, including
      serious adverse events, laboratory data, physician exam findings, and vital signs.
