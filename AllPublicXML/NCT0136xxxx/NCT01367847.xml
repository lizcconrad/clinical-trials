  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to determine whether a technology-enhanced version of an
      established behavioral treatment protocol, Helping the Noncompliant Child (HNC; McMahon &amp;
      Forehand), enhances the engagement and treatment outcomes of lower income parents of 3 to 8
      children with externalizing problems in treatment. It is predicted that families in both the
      HNC and technology-enhanced HNC (TE-HNC) programs will evidence significant improvement in
      parenting behavior and child externalizing problems; however, it is predicted that
      parent-child dyads in the TE-HNC program will require fewer sessions, will be more likely to
      be retained in the program, will be more likely to remain engaged in the program (e.g.,
      practicing skills between sessions etc.), and will be more likely to have active involvement
      from their coparenting partners (i.e., other adults and family members who participate in
      childrearing).In turn, it is expected that the TE-HNC program will boost treatment outcomes.
