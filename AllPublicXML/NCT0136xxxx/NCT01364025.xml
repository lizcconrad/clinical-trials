      Is routine uterosacral ligament suspension an appropriate clinical adjunct at the time of
      hysterectomy?

      The answers to these questions will facilitate the treatment of many American women. With the
      results of this study, the investigators would anticipate a reduction in the number of
      surgeries for pelvic organ prolapse. In addition, if uterosacral ligament suspension was
      shown to be ineffective, it would not be used routinely in the setting of hysterectomy and
      women will be spared the additional procedure and possibility of side effects or
      complications.

      The relative risks and benefits of adding a prophylactic uterosacral ligament suspension at
      the time of hysterectomy in women without symptomatic prolapse symptoms have never been
      studied prospectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligibility for primary procedure (hysterectomy either total or supracervical,
             performed either vaginally or abdominally, via laparoscopic or open approach)

          -  Eligibility for secondary procedure (uterosacral ligament suspension colpopexy)

          -  Prolapse in any compartment not extending beyond the hymen as measured by Pelvic Organ
             Prolapse Quantitative system

          -  No subjective complaints of Pelvic Organ Prolapse as determined by answer &quot;no&quot; to
             questions #3 of the short form of Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory: #3. Do you usually
             have a bulge or something falling out that you can see or feel in the vaginal area?

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication for uterosacral ligament suspension colpopexy. (Surgeon's judgment
             that a contraindication to uterosacral ligament suspension colpopexy exists).

          -  Anticipated geographic relocation within the 12 months after surgery

          -  Inability to provide informed consent or to complete testing or data collection.
