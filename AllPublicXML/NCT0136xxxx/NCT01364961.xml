  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although much effort has been done to lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations, there is still a
      substantial risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Another strategy to lower the risk for CVD
      is elevating the HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C). Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that
      elevating HDL-C or apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) levels protect against CVD. However, despite
      many initiatives, no new widely applicable intervention strategies with proven efficacy have
      been developed.

      Epidemiologic studies have shown that a higher polyphenol intake is associated with a lower
      risk for CVD. Resveratrol, a polyphenol, could, through several beneficial mechanisms, exert
      a positive effect on formation of atherosclerotic plaques and thus on developing CVD. It has
      been shown in animals that resveratrol elevates PPAR-alpha activity. This may lead to
      elevated apo A-I and HDL-C levels in the blood. However, these effects are not shown in human
      intervention studies.
