      The purpose of this study is to compare two different combination anti-HIV therapies over 48
      weeks and to assess if differences in improvement in the function of the brain are observed
      over this period.

      The study will compare anti-HIV therapy combinations which are currently in use.

      The patients will not have had any previous treatment for their HIV infection.

    <textblock>
      Impairment in neurocognitive(NC) function in HIV-infected subjects in the current
      anti-retroviraltreatment (cART) era has been associated with poor compliance with cART,
      reduced quality-of-life and increased mortality. Reported factors associated with the
      development of NC function impairment in HIV disease and risks associated with progression of
      such impairment include degree of immune suppression related to HIV infection, other chronic
      viral infections (such as chronic hepatitis C co-infection), age and central nervous system
      (CNS) antiretroviral drug exposure.

      One modifiable factor which may be associated with the evolution of NC function impairment is
      the direct effect of cART on the central-nervous-system (CNS). Certain antiretroviral drugs
      such as zidovudine, lamivudine, abacavir, nevirapine, efavirenz and indinavir are known to
      achieve optimal exposure in the cerebro-spinal-fluid (CSF) whereas other drugs, such as the
      majority of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors penetrate less effectively. Studies to date suggest
      different cART regimens may have differing effects on NC performance. In the EuroSIDA study,
      the use of nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase inhibitors was found to specifically protect
      against the development of HIV related brain disease. More recently, in a small prospective
      study, ALTAIR, different effect on cerebral function was reported in subjects randomised to
      commence three different cART regimens.

      The investigators propose, in a prospective, randomised study to assess the effects of two
      different antiretroviral regimens on NC function in HIV infected subjects commencing
      antiretroviral therapy for the first time.

    <description>When commencing antiretroviral therapy (anti-HIV therapy) for the first time, improvements in the function of the brain are frequently observed. For example memory and concentration may improve. However, whether these improvements may differ between different anti-HIV therapies is largely unknown.
The purpose of this study is to compare two different combination anti-HIV therapies over 48 weeks and to assess if differences in improvement in the function of the brain are observed over this period.</description>

    <measure>brain function</measure>
    <time_frame>48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will assess the brain functions at each visit. Also the blood will be monitored for efficacy of treatment in the two study limbs at all visits (this is part of normal care). Likewise the results of the MRI scans will be compared. The lumbar puncture performed at the final visit will obtain samples of CSF and certain test will be performed on this to examine the differences between the two study treatments. The comparison of the scan and lumbar puncture results will indicate how the brain is differently effected with different treatments.</description>
