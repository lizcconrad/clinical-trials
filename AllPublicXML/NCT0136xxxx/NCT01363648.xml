  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no approved treatments for vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and the
      main therapeutic efforts are aimed at controlling vascular risk factors for countering VCI
      development or progression. Several studies have reported cholinergic deficits in brain and
      cerebrospinal fluid of patients with VCI. The effect of choline alphoscerate in clinical
      studies of Alzheimer's disease and VCI improved memory and attention impairments. The purpose
      of our study is to determine effectiveness of choline alphoscerate vs placebo in improving
      cognition in post-stroke patients with VCI-non dementia (VCI-ND).

    <textblock>
      Impaired brain cholinergic neurotransmission has a key role in the deterioration of cognitive
      functions in Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). These deficits,
      although are of different degree than those found in Alzheimer's disease, were suggested to
      be associated with VCI.To date, there are no approved treatments for vascular
      dementia(VaD)and the main therapeutic efforts in this field are aimed at controlling vascular
      risk factors for countering VaD development or progression.

      There have also been several trials of cholinesterase inhibitors for treatment of VCI.
      Available data suggest some evidence of benefit of cholinesterase inhibitors in subcortical
      vascular dementia and vascular cognitive impairment.

      Treated patients had modest benefits in cognition, attention, executive functioning and
      ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living, but the effect is too limited due
      to the small numbers of subjects examined and it is complex to establish the clinical
      relevance of these effects. The majority of clinical studies available on the effect of
      choline alphoscerate in neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disorders were reviewed. A
      comparison of Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale(ADAS-Cog)analysis with
      the results obtained on the same item in 4 trials with the cholinesterase inhibitor revealed
      a more positive trend with the cholinergic precursor choline alphoscerate than with this
      cholinesterase inhibitor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were outpatients (age 25 to 84 years) with vascular cognitive impairment that
             does not fulfill dementia criteria (vascular cognitive impairment, no dementia(CIND)),
             had been stroke free for 90 days, together with clinical and radiological evidence of
             stroke and can perform K-TMT-e A. Cognitive impairment did not meet the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition (DSM-III-R) criteria for
             dementia (ie, they did not have both memory impairment and other cognitive impairment
             that caused functional deficits).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria included clinical or radiological evidence of neurodegenerative
             disorders other than VCI. Patients with major depression or other psychiatric
             disorders (according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
             Disorders, Fourth Edition) were excluded. Patients who had experienced a myocardial
             infarction within 3 months of enrollment were excluded (although these patients could
             be reconsidered for inclusion once 3 months had elapsed), as were those with
             clinically relevant hepatic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or life-threatening disease.
             Additional reasons for exclusion included pregnancy, a history of alcohol or drug
             abuse, and contraindications for MRI studies. Medications that affect the cognitive
             function were not permitted within the last 30 days. Patients were not permitted to
             receive anticholinergic drugs or cholinergic agents other than gliatilin during the
             study period.
