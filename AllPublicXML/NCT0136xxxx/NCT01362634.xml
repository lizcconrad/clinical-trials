  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a three-armed randomized clinical trial. A total of 750 clients will be
      randomly assigned (using a random number table) to the interviewer-administered intervention,
      the self-administered intervention, and waitlist control conditions upon completion of
      screening, informed consent, HIV pretest counseling and test administration, and collection
      of baseline risk behavior data. Outcomes will be measured at 3, 6 and 12 months.

      The specific aims of the 5-year study are to:

        1. identify the covariates of baseline substance abuse and sexual risks (including
           demographics, social risk measures, peer norms, abuse history, and mental health status)
           among a sample of 750 heterosexually active, not-in-treatment, club and prescription
           drug users ages 18 to 39 in Miami, Florida.

        2. evaluate, through random assignment, the relative effectiveness of two intervention
           conditions and a waitlist control in reducing sex risks and drug use, as measured at 3-,
           6- and 12-month follow-ups:

             -  Arm 1, an interviewer-administered comprehensive health and social risk assessment
                intervention (CAPI Intervention) similar to the baseline instrument used in the
                parent grant;

             -  Arm 2, an identical self-administered comprehensive assessment intervention (ACASI
                Intervention); and

             -  Arm 3, a waitlist control condition (Control). Outcome measures, including past
                90-day counts of unprotected sex acts and days' drug use, will be obtained from
                brief risk behavior inventories at baseline and follow-ups.

        3. conduct qualitative process evaluation research with 40 participants in each study arm
           to contextualize the study findings and intervention outcomes.
