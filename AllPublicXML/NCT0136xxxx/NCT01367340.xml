    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a 6-month physical activity
      intervention program on mobility and participation after the termination of a 6-week
      functional strengthening program for school-age children with spastic diplegia cerebral
      palsy. The primary outcomes are gross motor function, participation, and physical activity
      behavior.

    <description>The intervention is based on the social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model. There are two principle components, the individual consultation and the small group PA activities. In the individual consultation, assessment of current stage of readiness for PA will be performed first. Then, individualized, stage-matched feedback will be sent to the participants. Small group PA activities will be held every 2 weeks in order to increase learning opportunity by peer interaction, make exercise fun, and introduce a role model.</description>
