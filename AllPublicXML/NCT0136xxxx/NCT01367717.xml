  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Creatinine (Crn) concentration is used to assess renal function via calculation
      of GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate). By RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End Stage Kidney
      Disease) criteria, acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute renal failure (ARF) are defined by a
      two-fold and three-fold increase in serum Crn, respectively. Crn is a breakdown product of
      proteins and circulating creatine, and it is generally a benign product present in serum.
      Creatine is a nutritional supplement that has been available since 1993, and it is widely
      used among athletes today.

      Methods: In an IRB approved, blinded crossover trial, 25 human volunteers ingested 2 creatine
      supplements to determine any associated statistically significant increase in serum Crn and
      clinically significant increase in serum Crn to a degree associated with AKI or ARF. Urine
      samples were also collected to examine excretion patterns after an ingested sample.
      Participants ingested 10 gm of creatine ethyl ester (CEE) or creatine monohydrate (CrM) and
      had serum Crn assayed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 24 hours. Urinary Crn levels were assayed at 0,
      1.5, 3, 5 and 24 hours. Exclusion factors were any history of renal disease or use of
      creatine within the last month. Statistical analysis was performed by Wilcoxon Matched-Pair
      Signed Ranks Test and descriptive summary statistics were performed.
