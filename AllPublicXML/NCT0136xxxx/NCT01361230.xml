    <textblock>
      The Pilot Clinical Investigation planned is a prospective, unblinded randomized pilot trial
      comparing sedation management using a protocol based on responsiveness with standard sedation
      management. The hypothesis is that responsiveness will improve a range of patient-based and
      economic outcomes, including the duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of coma in
      the ICU. The purpose of the pilot study is to gather information for designing a full study
      that might show the validity of the outcome hypothesis.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients mechanically ventilated via an endotracheal tube and receiving intravenous
        sedation with a hypnotic agent (midazolam or other benzodiazepine) or propofol by
        continuous infusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary intracerebral disorder (includes cardiac arrest with probable hypoxic brain
             injury; intrac-ranial haemorrhage; head injury causing reduced conscious level prior
             to intubation)

          -  Patient who is already awake at the time of enrolment defined as RASS Â³ -1

          -  Age &lt;16 years

          -  Patient not expected to survive the next 24 hours

          -  Patient receiving long term ventilation prior to ICU admission

          -  Patient with a long term tracheostomy prior to ICU admission

          -  Patient transferred sedated and mechanically ventilated from another ICU unless
             recruitment is possible within 24 hours of first ICU admission

          -  Patient receiving continuous neuromuscular blocking agent at the time of screening for
             enrolment

          -  Previously enrolled in the trial during a separate ICU admission during this hospital
             stay

          -  Status epilepticus

          -  Confirmed meningitis or encephalitis at the time of screening for enrolment

          -  Chronic neurological disease interfering with normal neuromuscular function, e.g.
             motor neurone disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome or inherited neuromyopathies
