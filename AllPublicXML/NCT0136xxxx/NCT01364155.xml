  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary research suggests that LIM-0705 improves insulin sensitivity with neutral effects
      on weight in obese and diabetic rodent models. Results from a Phase 1b clinical study,
      conducted in healthy volunteers, indicate that LIM-0705 and a major metabolite may be
      potential insulin sensitizers by OGTT.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LIM-0705
      administered for 28 days in adult males and females with impaired glucose tolerance or
      abnormal HOMA-IR.

      Secondary Objectives include:

        -  examine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LIM-0705

        -  explore the pharmacodynamics (PD) of LIM-0705 in obese adult males and females with
           impaired glucose tolerance (defined as two-hour plasma glucose levels of ≥140 to ≤199 mg
           per dL [7.8 to 11.06 mmol/L] on the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) or abnormal
           HOMA-IR (HOMA-IR value ≥ 2.5) as measured by change in response to hyperinsulinemic
           clamp, mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) between Days -2 and 27

        -  explore the effect of LIM-0705 on fasting lipid, insulin and glucose profiles compared
           to baseline levels

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  males and females, age 18-75 years old, able and willing to provide written informed
             consent to participate in the study

          -  obesity-induced impaired glucose tolerance or abnormal HOMA-IR

          -  waist circumference of 40 inches or greater (men) or 35 inches or greater (women)

          -  good physical health based on EKG, electrolytes, LDH, creatinine, urea, AST, ALT,
             alkaline phosphatase, and renal function

          -  male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing age must
             agree to use of 2 effective methods of contraception, including the use of a condom,
