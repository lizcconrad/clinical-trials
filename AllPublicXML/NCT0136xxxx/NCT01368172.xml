  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first evidence-based physical activity guidelines for people with spinal cord injury were
      released in March, 2011. This project will evaluate the implementation of the new physical
      activity guidelines in a community exercise setting in Hamilton, Ontario. The investigators
      hypothesize that persons who follow the guidelines will experience increased aerobic fitness
      and muscle strength. The investigators also hypothesize that participants will find the
      guidelines easy to follow and that their self-efficacy for participating in physical activity
      will be improved following the study period.
