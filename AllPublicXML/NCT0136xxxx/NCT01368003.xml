  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine the safety and efficacy of
      an investigational drug, STA9090 alone and in combination with dutasteride for the treatment
      of castrate resistant prostate cancer. STA9090 may cause the growth of cancer to slow down or
      shrink by targeting proteins required for the cancer to grow. The investigators are also
      looking to determine whether the use of dutasteride to lower male hormone levels will enhance
      the effect of STA9090 in the treatment of castrate resistant prostate cancer.

      Subjects will have a tumor biopsy before treatment begins. Subjects who are randomized to Arm
      A will receive infusions of STA9090 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle. Subjects
      randomized on Arm B will receive daily oral dutasteride for 2 weeks prior to beginning
      STA9090 treatment. They will continue to receive dutasteride while on study.

    <description>The primary objective is to determine whether STA-9090, or the combination with dutasteride further suppresses AR transcriptional activity. AR transcriptional activity will be assessed based on expression of a series of AR regulated genes, in baseline and on therapy tumor biopsies in CRPC patients treated with STA-9090 +/- dutasteride.</description>
