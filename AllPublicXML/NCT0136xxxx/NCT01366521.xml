    <textblock>
      A multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, repeat dose study in asthma patients
      with elevated eosinophils. Eligible subjects will receive 3 doses (28 days apart) of
      mepolizumab given intravenous (IV) or subcutaneously (SC). Blood samples for safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and immunogenicity analysis, as well as
      safety/tolerability assessments will be collected throughout the study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mepolizumab (SB-240563) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks human interleukin 5
      (IL-5) from binding to its receptor. Mepolizumab is currently under development for severe
      refractory asthma and a Phase IIB dose-ranging study using the IV route of administration is
      currently on-going. This study will be a multi-center, randomized, open-label,
      parallel-group, repeat dose study conducted in approximately 65 subjects with established
      asthma and elevated blood eosinophil levels. Dosing will occur on three occasions, every four
      weeks [Day 1, Day 28 (+/- 3 days) and Day 56 (+/- 3 days)]. Blood samples for safety,
      pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity analysis, as well safety and
      tolerability assessments will be collected/assessed throughout the study. Each subject will
      participate in the study for up to approximately 22 weeks, including screening, dosing and
      follow-up.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Blood Eosinophil Levels at Week 12 (Day 84)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in blood eosinophils was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The change from Baseline in log-transformed blood eosinophil levels at Week 12 was analyzed using both a linear and non-linear (Imax) dose response models. The dose response was found to be non-linear and hence only the results of the non-linear model are presented. Mepolizumab 75mg IV assumed to equate to 100 mg SC within model. Prior to log10-transformation, zero values were imputed with half the minimum value across all dose groups and time points. An adjustment for Baseline eosinophil count was also incorporated into the model.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were collected at Days 1, 3, 7, 28, 56, 70, 84, 112 and 140 to assess the maximum reduction from Baseline in blood eosinophils between Day 1 pre-dose and last quantifiable study measurement.

    <measure>Mean Area Under the Plasma-concentration Time Curve (AUC) Following SC and IV Administration of Mepolizumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 3, 7, 28, 56, 70, 84, 112 and 140</time_frame>
    <description>AUC of mepolizumab was estimated by population modeling techniques using non-linear mixed effect methods for the individual and population pharmacokinetic parameters from the sparse sampling. Individual cumulative plasma of mepolizumab AUC to Day 84 (cumAUC(0-day 84)), is the sum of the AUCs over each dosing interval after each of the three doses administered, for those participants with data up to Day 84. Individual cumulative plasma of mepolizumab AUC to Day 140 (cumAUC(0-day 140) is the sum of the AUCs over each dosing interval after each of the three doses administered plus the AUC post the last dose interval up to Day 140 (i.e. from Day 84 to Day 140). Blood samples for PK analyses were collected on dosing days (Days 1, 28 and 56) at pre-dose and 0.5 hour (h), 1 h and 2 h post-dose (time was relative to the end of infusion in the IV cohort) as well as on Days 3, 7, 70, 84, 112 and 140 (follow-up visit).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Blood Eosinophil Levels at Week 12 (Day 84)</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline in blood eosinophils was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The change from Baseline in log-transformed blood eosinophil levels at Week 12 was analyzed using both a linear and non-linear (Imax) dose response models. The dose response was found to be non-linear and hence only the results of the non-linear model are presented. Mepolizumab 75mg IV assumed to equate to 100 mg SC within model. Prior to log10-transformation, zero values were imputed with half the minimum value across all dose groups and time points. An adjustment for Baseline eosinophil count was also incorporated into the model.</description>

        <description>AUC of mepolizumab was estimated by population modeling techniques using non-linear mixed effect methods for the individual and population pharmacokinetic parameters from the sparse sampling. Individual cumulative plasma of mepolizumab AUC to Day 84 (cumAUC(0-day 84)), is the sum of the AUCs over each dosing interval after each of the three doses administered, for those participants with data up to Day 84. Individual cumulative plasma of mepolizumab AUC to Day 140 (cumAUC(0-day 140) is the sum of the AUCs over each dosing interval after each of the three doses administered plus the AUC post the last dose interval up to Day 140 (i.e. from Day 84 to Day 140). Blood samples for PK analyses were collected on dosing days (Days 1, 28 and 56) at pre-dose and 0.5 hour (h), 1 h and 2 h post-dose (time was relative to the end of infusion in the IV cohort) as well as on Days 3, 7, 70, 84, 112 and 140 (follow-up visit).</description>

        <title>Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration (Tmax) From Pre-dose (Day 1) to Day 140 for Mepolizumab</title>
        <description>Time to maximum plasma concentration was estimated by population modelling techniques using non-linear mixed effect methods for the individual and population pharmacokinetic parameters from the sparse sampling. Blood samples for PK analyses of mepolizumab were collected on dosing days (Days 1, 28 and 56) at pre-dose and 0.5 h, 1 h and 2 h post-dose (time was relative to the end of infusion in the IV cohort) as well as on Days 3, 7, 70, 84, 112 and 140 (follow-up visit).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected for the determination of anti-mepolizumab antibodies by antibody detection (AD) and antibody neutralisation (AN) assay. For participants who prematurely withdrew from the study and had been dosed, immunogenicity testing occurred (if possible) at the time of premature withdrawal and at 16 weeks after dosing (or the end of the study, whichever came first). Serum was tested for the presence of anti-mepolizumab antibodies using the currently approved analytical methodology incorporating screening, confirmation and titration steps. Samples confirmed positive for the presence of anti-mepolizumab antibodies in the original assay were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies.</description>

        <title>Mean AUC to Assess the Absolute Bioavailability of SC Mepolizumab</title>
        <description>Population modelling techniques using non-linear mixed effect methods were used to estimate individual and population pharmacokinetic parameters from the sparse sampling. Log-transformed individual clearance estimates were analysed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The absolute bioavailability for each SC dose group and across SC doses will be estimated from the model together with associated 90% confidence intervals. Blood samples for PK analyses were collected on dosing days (Days 1, 28 and 56) at pre-dose and 0.5 h, 1 h and 2 h post-dose (time was relative to the end of infusion in the IV cohort) as well as on Days 3, 7, 70, 84, 112 and 140 (follow-up visit).</description>
