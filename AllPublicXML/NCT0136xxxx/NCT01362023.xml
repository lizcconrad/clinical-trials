  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that a regular systematic educational intervention in primary school
      improves lifestyle choices and reduces obesity. As such, the aim of the study is to evaluate
      the effects of a 3-year school-based program of lifestyle improvement, including diet and
      physical activity, implemented by university students acting as &quot;health promoting agents&quot;
      (HPA) on the prevalence of obesity.

    <description>Primary outcomes include obesity (BMI ≥95th percentile) and overweight (BMI ≥85th percentile) We will analyzed obesity and overweight and a measure of thinness according to the Cole criteria as well as other measures of adiposity such as BMI z score and waist circumference.

Classroom practice by HPA to highlight healthy lifestyle habits
Teaching practice by HPA using books designed to include the nutritional objectives
Parental activities included with their children
In each of 12 activities (1 h/activity), the classroom practice consisted of three components:
Experimental development of activities regarding each healthy lifestyle habit
Assessment of activity performed in classroom
An activity developed for use at home</description>
