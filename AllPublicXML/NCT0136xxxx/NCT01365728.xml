    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the results of LASIK surgery when using two versions
      of a femtosecond laser in patients with nearsightedness with and without astigmatism.

      The patients will have a comprehensive eye examination once they express an interest in the
      study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated
      fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. If there is any pathology noted that would
      exclude the patient from the study, then we will inform the patient and make an appropriate
      referral. if the patient is deemed appropriate for the study after a comprehensive
      examination included computerized videokeratography, then they can be enrolled. The patient
      will undergo bilateral simultaneous eye surgery. Which eye is treated with the Intralase FS
      60 and which eye is treated with Intralase IFS will be randomized so there is a 50% chance
      for either eye to receive one treatment. The patients will be seen on the day of surgery,
      post op day one, one month, three months, six months and one year. The patient will receive
      topical antibiotics in each eye for one week following the procedure. The patient will
      receive pred forte 1% ophthalmic drops for one week after treatment. The patient will also
      receive vigamox ophthalmic drops for four days after treatment. All of this is within the
      usual and customary standard of care for the treatment of patients undergoing LASIK surgery.

    <description>Patients will undergo bilateral simultaneous LASIK surgery for myopia. One eye will have a LASIK flap created with the Intralase FS60 and the fellow eye will have a LASIK flap created with the Intralase iFS. Both eyes will undergo wavefront-guided LASIK surgery with the Visx CustomVue excimer laser.</description>
