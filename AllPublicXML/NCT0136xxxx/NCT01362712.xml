      This trial will be the first trial for the IP, [F-18]CP-18, and will be conducted as an
      exploratory Phase I trial designed to collect information as this IP is administered and
      evaluated for the first time in humans. The trial will evaluate safety, biodistribution and
      dosimetry data in normal subjects and the trial will evaluate safety, biodistribution and
      tumor to background imaging data, and correlate image data with caspase 3 activity level on a
      surgical specimen analyzed by immunohistochemistry in the cancer subjects. All study results
      will be evaluated and analyzed in order to consider the design for future clinical trials.
      The information collected under this exploratory, Phase I study will not be used for
      diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical management
      of the subject.

      The Sponsor intends to conduct this exploratory investigation of [F-18]CP-18 in human
      subjects. In this study of [F-18]CP-18, it is intended to assess its biodistribution, PET
      scan resolution, signal to background ratio in tumor, and any adverse events. This
      exploratory Phase I study will be used to obtain the necessary safety and dosimetry data in
      normal subjects and to collect drug biodistribution data, and tumor to background imaging
      data in breast cancer subjects. The information collected from this study will not be used
      for diagnostic purposes, to assess the subject's response to therapy, or for clinical
      management of the subject.
