  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the context of male osteoporosis, we hypothesize that regional changes in trabecular bone,
      as well as changes in cortical porosity will play a major role, and thus also affect bone
      strength. In developing therapeutics the response of individual compartments, regional
      variations post-therapy will have considerable impact on selecting the therapies as well as
      monitoring response to therapy. This study, a precursor to other therapeutic trials, will lay
      the ground-work for the future.

      We will recruit 80 subjects who will be stratified into groups based on their T-scores. All
      subjects will be imaged at Baseline and 12 months. Measures of bone micro-architecture in the
      tibia and radius using peripheral computed tomography, bone strength measures through finite
      element analysis will be obtained at all time points. DXA measures at the spine, femur and
      forearm will be obtained as reference measures. In addition whole body DXA scans will be
      performed for assessment of body composition.
