  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unstable chest injuries are common in poly trauma patients. They can lead to severe pulmonary
      restriction, loss of lung volume, difficulty with ventilation and can render the patient to
      require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Traditionally these injuries have been treated
      non-operatively, however in the past decade there has been numerous studies suggesting
      improved outcomes with surgical fixation. Surgical fixation can significantly decrease time
      spent in ICU as well as day on mechanical ventilation. The investigators aim is to conduct a
      randomized control trial of these injuries, to compare non-operative treatment with surgical
      fixation. The investigators' hypothesis is that surgically treated patient will have
      significantly improved outcomes compared to those treated non-operatively.

    <description>The fractures will be reduced and stabilized by use of plates and screws
Attempt will be made to stabilize ribs 3-7, as these are surgically accessible and most important in maintaining integrity of the chest cavity.
Goal is not to fix all the fractures, but to fix sufficient fractures to create an internal splint and allow chest wall motion to occur as a unit. In case of fibs fractured at numerous locations, as many fragments will be reduced and stabilized as necessary to ensure movement as a unit.
Chest tube(s) will be placed at the discretion of the treating surgeon in patients with pre-operative or intra-operative violation of the pleural cavity (ie pre-op pneumothorax/haemothorax, iatrogenic pleural injury). No post-operative drains will be inserted.</description>

    <description>Mechanical ventilation: Patients in respiratory distress will receive endotracheal intubation, and placed on mechanical ventilation. PEEP will be utilized as needed, at the discretion of the ICU and respiratory therapy team.
Other conservative means/Pulmonary toilet:Patients will receive aggressive pulmonary toilet (suctioning of ET tube as needed), chest physiotherapy (as per standard local protocol), and will have the head of the bed elevated to 30° unless contraindicated (ie unstable C-spine injury).
Pain control:Epidural catheters, intercostal nerve block, PCA, IV/PO pain medication</description>
