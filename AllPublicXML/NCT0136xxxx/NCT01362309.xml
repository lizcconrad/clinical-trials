    <textblock>
      There is considerable evidence that Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) can be understood as a form
      of dysregulated learning and are influenced by classical conditioning. This is based on
      numerous studies indicating that conditioned contextual cues influence craving for alcohol
      consumption. As a result, there has been considerable interest in extinction-based treatments
      for AUDs (i.e., treatments that focus on extinguishing the associations between alcohol cues
      and motivation to drink), referred to as cue exposure treatment To date, extinction-based
      treatment for AUDs has resulted in disappointing outcomes in clinical trials and there is
      considerable interest in improving this form of treatment. One novel strategy is the use of
      pharmacological adjuncts to enhance extinction. Medications that maximize extinction may
      minimize subsequent reactions to alcohol cues and, in turn, subsequent clinical outcomes.
      This study is examining whether the medication d-cycloserine (DCS) can enhance extinction to
      alcohol cues. Recent basic research has revealed that DCS enhances extinction to fear cues
      and several lines of evidence suggest that DCS may also enhance extinction to alcohol cues.
      Therefore, DCS may serve as a useful pharmacological adjunct to extinction-based treatment
      for AUDs. Our primary aim is to examine whether, compared to placebo, DCS (50 mg) will
      enhance extinction to alcohol cues under controlled laboratory conditions in
      treatment-seeking individuals with alcohol use disorders. We hypothesize that DCS will
      generate greater extinction compared to placebo during the subsequent extinction session as
      measured by attenuated craving in response to alcohol cues. Furthermore, we hypothesize that
      DCS will generate greater extinction compared to placebo at follow-up assessments. This study
      is a proof-of-concept test of whether DCS can reduce reactions to alcohol cues under
      controlled laboratory conditions. It is a preliminary study using a subclinical number of
      extinction sessions and medication administrations to establish whether or not DCS improves
      extinction in the laboratory. If proof-of-concept is supported, it will suggest that a
      clinical trial is warranted. A clinical sample and clinical context are used to maximize the
      potential generalizability from this exploratory study.

          2. At least 14+/7+ drinks/week for males/females.

          3. Alcohol cue reactivity.

          4. 9th grade education or greater.

          2. Mandated to treatment.

          3. Significant withdrawal symptoms (i.e., Clinical Institute Withdrawal Scale - Revised
             score of 15+, history of previous withdrawal-related hospitalizations, or
