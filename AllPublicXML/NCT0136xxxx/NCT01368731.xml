  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that prophylactic coagulation therapy with coagulation
      forceps to visible vessels within the mucosal defect for colonic Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
      (EMR) will reduce the rate of delayed bleeding when compared with current established
      standard EMR technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delayed bleeding from the site of the resection remains one of the most common complications
      following EMR, occurring in up to 12% of patients. The purpose of the study is to prevent
      such bleeding with the use of a technique known as: &quot;coagulation therapy.&quot; This therapy
      involves using a small dose of heat energy that results in clotting(coagulation) of a blood
      vessel. It is already used widely in the stomach and we intend using this on a lower setting
      to blood vessels that are exposed after the resection.
