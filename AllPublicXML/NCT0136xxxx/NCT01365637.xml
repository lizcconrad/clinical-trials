    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is primarily to determine the safety and toleration and
      pharmacokinetics of PF-05089771 following escalating multiple doses lasting for 14 days.
      Dosing will either be administered twice or three times daily. Secondary objectives will be
      to investigate the PK of an alternative formulation of PF-05089771 and the effect of food on
      the PK of PF-05089771.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects or female subjects of non-child bearing potential between the
             ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive.

        Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

        An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject

        Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
        laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 21 drinks/week (1 drink = 5 ounces
             (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor)
             within 6 months of screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 60 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at screening.

          -  If QTc exceeds 450 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more times and the average of
             the three QTc values should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          -  Females of child bearing potential.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Herbal
             supplements must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication.
             As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of 1 g/day. Limited
             use of non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or
             the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following
             approval by the sponsor.

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
