      The purpose of this study is to determine whether high porous membranes are effective in the
      treatment of cardiovascular events in chronic dialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of the increased mortality rate of chronic
      dialysis patients. It is believed that increased micro-inflammation plays an important role
      in the pathophysiological process of cardiovascular disease. High porous dialysis membranes
      can better eliminate inflammatory mediators as compared to standard dialysis membranes. In
      this study, the high porous dialysis membrane HCO1100 is investigated for its potential
      capability to improve the cardiovascular status of chronic dialysis patients.

    <description>Weekly evaluation of albumin plasma levels (g/l) during the study. Patients with albumin plasma levels below 35g/l will terminate study product (HCO1100 dialyzer) treatment phase and switch to study phase with control standard dialyzer treatment and will be further monitored for 6 weeks. Number of patients with decreased albumin levels below 35g/l , Number of patients with requirement for albumin substitution and absolute albumin drop (g/l) will be evaluated.</description>
