  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Xerecept® in
      children with central nervous system tumors and to identify appropriate doses of Xerecept® to
      be used in subsequent pediatric clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Steroid-related side effects are much more severe in a pediatric population than they are in
      adults. The side effects appear more quickly and are often apparent in as few as 14 days.
      Dexamethasone side effects in children include rounding of the face, acne, increased body
      hair, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, mood changes, weight gain, fluid retention, glucose
      instability, high blood pressure, increased susceptibility to infection, stunted growth and
      aseptic necrosis of the hip joints14-16.

      Although extensive studies have been performed with Xerecept® in adults, no studies have been
      performed with Xerecept® in pediatric subjects. Therefore, this study is being conducted to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of Xerecept® in children with central nervous system
      tumors and to identify appropriate doses of Xerecept® to be used in subsequent pediatric
      clinical trials. The study will also explore if Xerecept®, when administered to pediatric
      patients, is effective in allowing decreases in dexamethasone dosing

          2. Have been taking dexamethasone (or equivalent) at a dose of ≥1 mg/day for a minimum of
             14 days and have had a stable dose for at least 7 days.

          3. Have one or more steroid-associated side effects at Screening (See Appendix A1 for a
             list of qualifying events)

          4. Capable of self-administration of subcutaneous injections twice daily or availability
