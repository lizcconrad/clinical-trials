  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the analgesic efficacy of a single dose of a
      fixed combination of 500 mg Aspirin (Acetylsalicylic Acid) and 4 mg Lidocaine in adult
      patients with sore throat associated with a common cold in comparison to a single treatment
      with 500 mg Aspirin or 4 mg Lidocaine alone as well a Placebo (treatment without any active
      ingredient). The combination of Aspirin and Lidocaine in a single lozenge is expected to
      provide relief from sore throat pain by sequential action. A very fast inset of action will
      be achieved by the locally acting Lidocaine and a long duration of action will be achieved by
      the systemically acting Aspirin.
