      The objective of this study is to investigate corneal confocal microscopic findings, ocular
      signs and symptoms in patients on treatment with the preserved prostaglandin analogue
      latanoprost 0.005% eye drops (Xalatan®) and after the switch to preservative-free
      prostaglandin analog tafluprost 0.0015% eye drops (Taflotan®). Patients who have been using
      latanoprost as their prior medication (at least 6 months) and who fulfil all the inclusion
      criteria including the specified ocular symptoms and signs, will switch from latanoprost
      0.005% eye drops to the assigned preservative-free tafluprost 0.0015% eye drops for twelve
      (12) months.

      Primary outcome measures:

        1. Change from screening in corneal confocal microscopic findings at month 12

        2. Change from screening in ocular symptoms upon non-instillation at month 12

        3. Change from screening in ocular signs at month 12

           Safety and QoL variables:

        4. Descriptive statistics, identification of change(s) from screening
