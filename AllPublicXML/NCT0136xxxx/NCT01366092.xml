  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic GVHD is a medical condition that may occur after a bone marrow, stem cell or cord
      blood transplant. The donor's immune system may recognize the your body (the host) as foreign
      and attempt to 'reject' it. This process is known as graft-versus-host-disease. It is thought
      that IL-2 may help control chronic GVHD by stopping the donor's immune system from
      'rejecting' your body. In this research study, we are looking to see how IL-2 can be used in
      combination with steroids to treat cGVHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      You will give yourself or be given IL-2 daily through an injection under your skin. You
      should rotate the injection site, if possible. You will do this once every day for 12 weeks.
      You will then have 4 weeks off of IL-2. During the first 6 weeks of IL-2, you will continue
      to take steroids without changing the dose your doctor has set for you while you are on IL-2.
      After 6 weeks of IL-2 therapy, your doctor may reduce the amount of steroids you take.

      While you are on study, a member of the study team will examine you to evaluate your cGVHD.
      These assessments may include examination of your skin, joints/muscles, eyes, mouth, lungs
      and gastrointestinal system.

      You will have clinic visits for evaluation of toxicity and clinical benefit approximately
      every 4 weeks. You will also have immunologic assays approximately every 8 weeks. Immunologic
      assays will measure the effect of IL-2 on immune cells.

      You will be on the study for about 16 weeks. You may continue on study treatment for longer
      if you experience a clinical benefit.

    <measure>Overall Response Rate of Low-dose Daily SC IL-2 in Steroid-refractory cGVHD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were evaluated according to the cGVHD NIH Consensus criteria at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks on study. Per cGVHD NIH Consensus criteria, cGVHD involved organ systems are given a grade 0-3 and an overall cGVHD score, from 0-10, is given. Complete Response is defined as resolution of all reversible manifestations in each organ or site of cGVHD. A partial response is defined as an improvement in measure at least one organ or site, or decrease in global ratings by at least a 2-point change on the 10-point scale, without progression measured at any other organ or site. Non-responders have no change in cGVHD meeting criteria for either partial response or disease progression. Progressive disease is defined as an increase in organ or site scales (1-point change on a 3-point scale) or 2- to 3-point increase on the global cGVHD ratings. Clinical worsening of cGVHD is not synonymous with progressive cGVHD per NIH criteria.</description>

    <time_frame>End of treatment after 16 weeks or most recent follow-up date for patients on extended</time_frame>

    <measure>Overall Survival and Progression-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years from start of IL-2</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS was defined as from the study entry to death from any cause. Patients who were alive or lost to follow-up were censored at the time last seen alive. PFS was defined from the study entry to disease relapse or progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first.</description>

        <title>Overall Response Rate of Low-dose Daily SC IL-2 in Steroid-refractory cGVHD</title>
        <description>Participants were evaluated according to the cGVHD NIH Consensus criteria at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks on study. Per cGVHD NIH Consensus criteria, cGVHD involved organ systems are given a grade 0-3 and an overall cGVHD score, from 0-10, is given. Complete Response is defined as resolution of all reversible manifestations in each organ or site of cGVHD. A partial response is defined as an improvement in measure at least one organ or site, or decrease in global ratings by at least a 2-point change on the 10-point scale, without progression measured at any other organ or site. Non-responders have no change in cGVHD meeting criteria for either partial response or disease progression. Progressive disease is defined as an increase in organ or site scales (1-point change on a 3-point scale) or 2- to 3-point increase on the global cGVHD ratings. Clinical worsening of cGVHD is not synonymous with progressive cGVHD per NIH criteria.</description>

        <population>33 of 35 patients were evaluable for response criteria. To be evaluable, patients had to receive at least 6 weeks of daily IL-2 and had their disease re-assessed.</population>
