    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine the impact of P-552 oral rinse
      on salivary volume after administration of a single dose of P-552and versus vehicle rinse.
      Changes in oral mucosal wetness will be assessed via collection of salivary output and via
      measurement of oral wetness using the Periotron 8000 instrument.

          2. Male subjects must be either not sexually active, surgically sterilized, or agree to
             use an appropriate &quot;double-barrier&quot; method (such as a diaphragm and condom) during
             study participation and for at least 30 days after the completion of dosing.

          3. Non-pregnant female subjects must be either not sexually active, postmenopausal, or
             surgically sterilized; or agree to use an appropriate &quot;double-barrier&quot; method (such as
             a diaphragm and condom); or are currently using a prescribed transdermal, injection,
             implant, or oral contraceptive for at least 30 days before receiving the first dose of
             study drug during study participation and at least 30 days after the completion of
             dosing.

          4. Are in good health, as determined by a medical history, a physical examination, a
             detailed oral examination, and results of clinical chemistry, hematology and
             urinalysis.

          5. Has minimal level of unstimulated whole mouth salivary flow (greater than or equal to
             0.05 milliliters [i.e., 0.05 grams] per 5 minutes) at the screening visit.

          6. Have a diagnosis of primary Sjogren's syndrome consistent with the revised version of
             the European criteria proposed by the American-European Consensus Group European
             Cooperative Community Classification Criteria for Sjogren's Syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Regularly uses antihistamines that have been started or the dose adjusted within the
             last 30 days.

          2. Has started using systemic cholinergic secretagogues or tricyclic antidepressant drugs
             within 12 weeks before Screening, is not on a stable dosing regimen for at least 14
             days prior to the Screening visit, or is unable to maintain stable dosing throughout
             the study.

          3. Is unable to withhold the use of systemic cholinergic secretagogues and oral comfort
             agents (e.g., OraMoist, MouthKote, Biotene products, etc.) on the morning of each
             study visit and until 2 hours after dosing at study visits; and is unable to take the
             last nighttime dose at a standard time throughout the study.

          4. Is unable to maintain a stable dosage regimen of any concomitant medication throughout
             the duration of the trial.

          5. Shows evidence of a significant active or ongoing oral infection or other oral
             conditions (e.g., lichen planus) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             affect the safety of the subject or might exacerbate during study participation.

          6. Has acutely infected salivary glands (with or without pain) or suspected closure of
             the salivary glands.

          7. Has received an investigational drug within the past 30 days.

          8. Has a history of allergy to any medicine chemically related to the study drug (e.g.,
             amiloride, Moduretic, Midamor, triamterene).

          9. Has a present history of any clinically significant and uncontrolled neurologic,
             gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular (including hyper/hypotension and
             tachy/bradycardia), psychological, pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, or hematological
             disorder or disease, or any other major disorder or disease, in the opinion of the
             investigator.

         10. Has viral hepatitis or tested positively for the hepatitis B surface antigen or
             hepatitis C (nonA, non-B) antibody, or a positive result for human immunodeficiency
             virus antibodies.

         11. Has a positive serum pregnancy test or is nursing (female subjects only).
