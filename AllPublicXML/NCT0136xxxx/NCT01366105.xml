  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose using negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) to aid
      in wound healing along the lines of closure for lower extremity amputation and complex
      abdominal wounds. This study is designed to be a prospective, randomized clinical trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness of NPWT versus accepted standard surgical dressings on these
      wounds. Study participants will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups (NPWT vs.
      standard dressing) prior to surgery, and will be followed in the post operative period to
      monitor the effects on their surgical closures. The experimental group will consist of
      participants receiving NPWT and will have a Vacuum Assisted Closure (V.A.C., KCI inc.) device
      placed intra-op along the line of closure. The control group will receive a standard surgical
      dry sterile dressing. The surgical closures will be assessed after three days of treatment as
      well as the first outpatient post-op visit and any subsequent visits through the following 6
      months. By doing so, the investigators hope to demonstrate the utility of NPWT on difficult,
      at risk surgical closures. Additionally, the investigators hope to show a difference in
      clinical outcome of incisions treated by NPWT over our current standard technique.

      All patients in the principal and co-investigators practice who are scheduled to undergo
      lower extremity amputation or complex abdominal closure will be eligible for enrollment in
      this prospective randomized study. There are no exclusion criteria. Informed consent will be
      obtained pre-operatively. Data collection will include basic demographic data, disease
      history, past medical and social history as well key data relating to wound healing
      (infection, wound dehiscence or breakdown) and hospital course (length of stay, operative
      complications). The investigators will use simple statistical methods (ANOVA and chi-squared
      analysis) to compare surgical wound healing between the two populations. The only deviation
      from current standard of care in these populations includes utilizing a V.A.C. system on the
      closure line of the experimental group versus the standard dry sterile dressing.
