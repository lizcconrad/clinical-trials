  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this investigation is to better understand factors contributing to the
      high incidence of prone sleep positioning in African-American infants. In addition, the
      investigators are interested in investigating other races and ethinicities to understand
      their beliefs and perceptions and determine differences socioeconomically and socioculturally
      within and between groups. The investigators will address the following specific aims:

      (-) To compare knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding infant sleep position in parents
      of higher and lower SES.

      (-) To identify risk factors for non-use of recommended supine sleep position in families
      with higher and lower SES (-) to develop a phenomenologic understanding of the decisions made
      by parents of higher SES and lower SES who do nt use recommended supine sleep position, using
      qualitative techniques.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated prone position to be a major risk factor for SIDS.
      Studies have consistently demonstrated an increased rate of prone positioning in African
      American infants, but very little is known about the reasons why African American parents use
      the prone position more often than other racial groups. Furthermore, no studies have taken
      advantage of the observed socioeconomic status associated variablility in SIDS and prone
      sleeping within the African American community. By examing within-group differences, it is
      possible to move beyond comparative racial descriptions (i.e. comparisions of white and
      African American) to identification of potentially modifiable factors that might respond to
      culturally acceptable interventions within a disadvantaged group.
