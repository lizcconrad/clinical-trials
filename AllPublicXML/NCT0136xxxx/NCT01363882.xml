  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV, also known colloquially as &quot;Bipap&quot;) has been associated
      in some studies with improvement in pulmonary function, quality of life and survival. NIV is
      typically applied during sleep, and without the benefit of sleep study to determine the
      optimal settings. The investigators have shown that when NIV is used in this fashion, failure
      of nocturnal oxygenation and ventilation is prominent. This study is randomizing patients to
      standard application of NIV vs application guided by use of sleep study data to determine the
      effect of titrated therapy on pulmonary function, quality of life and survival.

    <description>Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) will be initiated and managed as per current standard of practice guided by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Practice Parameters (updated in 2009), in all subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and a forced vital capacity of &lt;50% predicted. Sleep studies will be performed at baseline, 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6 months, but will not influence management of the NIV.</description>

    <description>ALS subjects in this arm, who are offered NIV for Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &lt;50% as per AAN Practice Parameters, will have their initial level of NIV determined polysomnographically. They will be followed with sleep studies at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months to reassess NIV efficacy and NIV will be adjusted as necessary to optimize parameters of oxygenation and ventilation.</description>
