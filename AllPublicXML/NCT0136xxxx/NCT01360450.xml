  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thousands of critically ill infants (and children) are exposed to opioids and benzodiazepines
      to achieve sedation and analgesia as part of routine care in neonatal and pediatric intensive
      care units. While the use of these agents are undisputedly beneficial in reducing pain and
      anxiety, improving ventilation, reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and improving
      outcomes; the consequence is often the development of tolerance and physiologic dependence -
      similar to prenatal exposure from these same classes of drugs. The investigators have
      recently reported the results of randomized placebo control trial showing that the addition
      of clonidine (central alpha 2 agonist) to tapering doses of opioids was efficacious and safe
      in treating opioid dependence in infants who had moderate to severe neonatal abstinence
      syndrome from prenatal drug exposure to opioids. Currently, the investigators propose to
      perform a double-blind, randomized placebo control trial in a cohort of critically ill
      infants without prenatal drug exposure at Johns Hopkins Hospital to test the overall
      hypothesis that early addition of clonidine to a cohort of critically ill neonates on
      mechanical ventilation who are receiving opioids and benzodiazepines for analgesia and
      sedation will be efficacious and safe in reducing both the incidence and severity of
      withdrawal symptoms (NICU-NAS); as well as, reducing the time to complete sedative and
      analgesic drug detoxification. The hypothesis will be tested by addressing 2 specific aims
      that will determine: 1) the efficacy and safety of clonidine in critically ill infants, and
      2) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics using population-based pharmacokinetics in this
      vulnerable infant population who have only been exposed to these drugs as part of their
      routine care. Many &quot;standard of care practices&quot; are incorporated in neonatal and pediatric
      care prior to evidence based studies. This proposal will fill a much needed gap in
      translating what the investigators have learned about basic mechanisms mediating dependence
      and withdrawal to proven therapies for vulnerable pediatric populations.

      The study will test the following 2 specific aims:

      Specific Aim 1

      To determine the efficacy and short-term safety of clonidine in reducing the severity of
      iatrogenic neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) by decreasing the time required for complete
      sedative and analgesic drug detoxification. The investigators will enroll 88 neonates at risk
      for having moderate to severe NAS in a randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial
      comparing opioid/benzodiazepine administration combined with a placebo (control) vs.
      opioid/benzodiazepine combined with clonidine. Principal outcome measure will be the
      difference in length of treatment for complete detoxification. Early safety of clonidine will
      be determined by monitoring for cardiorespiratory side effects that might be associated with
      clonidine use in this high risk population.

      Specific Aim 2

      To determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clonidine in this critically ill
      infant population. The investigators will estimate the dose-exposure-response relationship of
      clonidine in neonates at risk for developing iatrogenic by using nonlinear mixed-effects
      population pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis.

    <description>Time to complete detoxification is defined as 48 hrs off all opioids/benzodiazepines and study drug with acceptable withdrawal scores of &lt;9 (on average we expect the infant to be enrolled in the study for 2-4 weeks). The scale used to assess withdrawal was the Modified Finnegan Neonatal Withdrawal Scale, which ranges from 0-41, 0 represents no withdrawal and 41 represent maximum withdrawal.</description>

        <description>Time to complete detoxification is defined as 48 hrs off all opioids/benzodiazepines and study drug with acceptable withdrawal scores of &lt;9 (on average we expect the infant to be enrolled in the study for 2-4 weeks). The scale used to assess withdrawal was the Modified Finnegan Neonatal Withdrawal Scale, which ranges from 0-41, 0 represents no withdrawal and 41 represent maximum withdrawal.</description>

Clonidine HCL: At day 5 on opioid and/or benzodiazepine (BZD), the infant will be randomized to receive either placebo (normal saline) or clonidine 1μg/kg/q 4 hrs to a maximum dose of 2μg/kg/q 4. Weaning from the study drug: When the opioid is no longer required, 24 hrs later the study drug (placebo or study drug) will be reduced by 50% and then discontinued 24 hours later provided that the Modified Finnegan scores remain between &lt; 9.</description>
