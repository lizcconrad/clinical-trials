  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The modern warfighter faces numerous physiological challenges including sleep deprivation,
      sustained intense physical activity, and caloric restriction, the combined effects of which
      may result in the loss of lean body mass and decreased physical performance. Dietary
      interventions may help preserve lean body mass and facilitate recovery from periods of
      intense physical demand. For example, dietary strategies that increase amino acid
      availability have been shown to stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle following
      resistance exercise. Because military tasks also incorporate endurance exercise components,
      studies regarding the effects of increasing dietary amino acids following endurance exercise
      are warranted. The objectives of this study are to characterize the effect of endurance
      exercise on protein synthesis and breakdown as well as the ability of an essential amino acid
      supplement to influence skeletal muscle protein metabolism and its cellular and molecular
      regulation following endurance exercise.
