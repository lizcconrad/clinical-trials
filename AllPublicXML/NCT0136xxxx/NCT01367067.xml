    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to search for possible predictors for claustrophobia during
      magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. A claustrophobic event shall be defined by an incomplete
      examination, or a complete examination that requires coping actions by the staff. Coping
      actions may consist of the administration of sedatives, prism glasses, an MR imaging test run
      with the patient, a pause, the prone position, an escort in the scanner room, and supportive
      communication. The investigators hypothesize that there is a difference between patients with
      and without events in their scores on the Claustrophobia Questionnaire and several further
      psychometric questions. Other factors may also favour events like patient characteristics,
      examined region, duration of the examination and scanner type. Therefore, predictors could
      identify patients who are likely to experience claustrophobia during MR imaging so that they
      can receive the appropriate support by the staff to complete their examination. Thus a larger
      patient population could benefit from MR imaging.
