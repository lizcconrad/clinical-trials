    <textblock>
      Metformin is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide for the treatment of Type 2
      Diabetes. It has been currently used for the treatment of: polycystic ovary syndrome,
      gestational diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity. In patients with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS) the adverse side effects are a frequent cause for treatment discontinuation.
      In every day medical practice lower doses of Metformin are administered searching for the
      continuation of the treatment.

      However, there is no clinical study to support this assertion. The objective of this study is
      to monitor and correlate the therapeutic effect of Metformin on patients with PCOS taking
      daily doses of 1500mg and 1000mg.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with PCOS diagnosis and that are able to attempt the inclusion criteria are divided
      in two groups: administration of metformin 500 mg tablet three times/day as well 1500 mg/day
      (group A)and administration of metformin 500 mg tablet twice/day or 1000 mg/day (group B).
      Blood samples were collected to the pharmacokinetic evaluation from first day of
      administration until 3 months after beginning of treatment. The patients are monitored during
      3 months and all side effects are register. The efficacy of both treatment are analyzed by
      biochemical and physical evaluation.
