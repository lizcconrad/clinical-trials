  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This randomised trial will compare outcomes and acceptability of an alternative
      medical abortion follow-up protocol using standardised text messaging, on-line questionnaire,
      or a phone interview and a low sensitivity pregnancy test with the current standard of care
      which consists of either a clinic visit and ultrasound scan or a telephone call and high
      sensitivity pregnancy test.

      Hypothesis: The use of &quot;alternative&quot; methods to assess outcomes after early medical abortion
      will achieve a higher rate of follow-up than women undergoing &quot;standard&quot; follow-up

      Primary aim: To determine the follow-up rate after early medical abortion with an alternative
      protocol as compared to a standard follow-up protocol

      Secondary aims:

        -  To assess complication rates and receipt of further treatment among women in the two
           study arms

        -  To ascertain women's preferences for mode of communication regarding their post-medical
           abortion status

        -  To determine provider opinions and preferences for different follow-up modalities
