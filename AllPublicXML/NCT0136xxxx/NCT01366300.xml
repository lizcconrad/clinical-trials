  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the interaction of lidocaine
      infusion initiated and maintained during surgery, on propofol requirements during general
      anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Use of intravenous lidocaine as a coadjuvant agent during general anesthesia has increased.
      Lidocaine infusion during and after abdominal surgery decreases postoperative pain and
      reduces ileus duration, reducing patient´s hospital stay and opioid consumption. Intravenous
      lidocaine´s effect on other intravenous anesthetics is unclear, and there are no present
      studies evaluating its interaction on hypnotic anesthetic requirements when using a BIS
      (Bispectral Index) monitor to maintain an adequate depth of anesthesia. We therefore decided
      to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the interaction of systemic lidocaine
      infusion, initiated and maintained during surgery, on propofol requirements and anesthetic
      depth as measured by BIS.

    <description>Propofol is administered according to a widely-accepted pharmacokinetic model, initially dosed to a target controlled infusion (TCI) of 4.5 micrograms/ml, and titrated by step increases of 0.5 every minute until loss of conscience is obtained and BIS values are less than 50. During the maintenance phase of anesthesia propofol TCI is actively titrated to maintain BIS values between 40 and 50. If BIS is out of this range for more than 10 seconds, propofol is adjusted in 0.5 ug/mc to maintain BIS values in the predetermined limits.</description>

    <description>An arterial line was placed in the anesthetised patient´s right arm by the investigator and arterial samples were obtained every 10 minutes since initiation of the study infusion to determine plasmatic lidocaine and propofol levels (if the infusion was saline the samples were not analyzed). The arterial line was removed before the end of surgery.</description>
