    <textblock>
      The parameter that best correlates with 5 years disease-free survival (DFS ) in patients
      (pts) with localized rectal cancer (RC) is the pathological TNM staging (ypTNM) after
      chemo-radiotherapy (Ch-RT). DFS is 97% in pts with ypT0N0M0 = ypCR and 42% in pts with ypN +.
      Standard 5-FU Ch-RT achieves 15% of ypCR. The use of IMRT achieves a high proportion of ypCR
      . This study aimed to demonstrate in a prospective manner the feasibility of personalizing Ch
      regimen base in TT in combination with IMRT in patients with RC. Secondary objectives
      included the number of ypCR and safety.

      The parameter that best correlates with DFS in patients (pts) with localized rectal cancer
      (RC) is the pathological TNM staging (ypTNM) after chemo-radiotherapy (Ch-RT).Tumor
      regression grading (TRG) after Ch-RT has been correlated with DFS , 86% for TRG 4, 75% for
      grouped TRG 2 + 3, and 63% for grouped TRG 0 + 1 but this is not as good as ypTNM to predict
      pts outcome.

      Standard 5-FU or capecitabine Ch-RT achieves 15% of ypCR with diarrhea and proctitis as the
      main grade 3 toxicities in the range of 10-15% . With the combination of oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine pCR rates are the same but the toxicity is the range of 25%. IMRT studies
      reported 30% ypCR but with 30-40% grade 3 toxicities Last years strategies have explored ways
      to integrate additional chemotherapeutic agents as capecitabine , oxaliplatin, irinotecan,
      bevacizumab and cetuximab in Ch-RT regimens and to find biomarkers of their effectiveness ,
      but always in a retrospective way.

      Our hypothesis is that with the actual knowledge and technology, a prospective tailored
      chemotherapy selection in combination with IMRT is feasible and could improve the outcome of
      patients with rectal cancer.

    <description>All pts were treated with Capecitabine (Cap) 625-825 mg/m2/12h M-F.
Ch combination schema was customized based on:
Top- 1 +: Irinotecan (I) 50mg/m2 / in weekly. Top-1 - and ERCC-1 - : Oxaliplatin (O) 50gm/m2/ weekly. Top- 1 - and ERCC-1 + : Neither I nor O. K-Ras or b-Raf mutated (m) : Bevacizumab (B) 5mg/kg every two weeks. K-Ras and B-Raf native (n): Cetuximab (C) 400/250mg/m2 weekly or B (investigator option). Figure 1.
When Cap was in combination with O or I the 625mg/m2 dose was chosen. When Cap was the only chemotherapy agent in combination with B or C the 825mg/m2 dose was chosen</description>
