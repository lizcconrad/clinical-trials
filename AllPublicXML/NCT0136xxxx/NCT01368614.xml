  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using of the Average Volume
      Assured Pressure Support (AVAPS-AE) mode versus Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
      and bilevel pressure support ventilation (PSV) modes of ventilation in patients diagnosed
      with Obesity Hypoventilation syndrome.

      The investigators believe the use of the AVAPS-AE mode of ventilation after 6 weeks will
      yield daytime gas exchange values which are equivalent or no worse when compared to using
      CPAP and bilevel PSV modes of ventilation in the OHS population.
