  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this investigation will be to quantify the increase in tear film
      break-up time (TFBUT) associated with the instillation of a single eyedrop of an Ocular
      Emulsion in dry eye sufferers.

      The secondary objective of this investigation will be to compare the tear film break up time
      measured with two different techniques.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must be 18 years of age or older;

          2. The subject must have a best corrected visual acuity of 0.6 LogMAR (~6/24) or better
             in each eye

          3. The subject must not have used any topical ocular drops for approximately 24 hours
             prior to the enrolment/screening visit

          4. The subject must be classified as dry eye at enrolment/screening visit according to
             the following criteria:

               -  Subjects' self-assessment of dry eye status (answer of at least &quot;some of the
                  time&quot; to the question, &quot;How often have your eyes felt dry enough to want to use
                  eye drops?&quot;);

               -  TFBUT measured with DET ≤ 5 seconds in at least one eye;

               -  Grade 1 for meibomian gland expression in both eyes;

               -  Evidence of missing meibomian glands in both eyes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or evidence of ocular or intraocular surgery in either eye within the past six
             months.

          2. History or evidence of serious ocular trauma in either eye within the past six months.

          3. Current punctal occlusion of any type (e.g., collagen plugs, silicone plugs).

          4. History or evidence of epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis);
             vaccinia; active or recent varicella viral disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva;
             chronic bacterial disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva and/or eyelids;
             mycobacterial infection of the eye; and/or fungal disease of the eye.

          5. Use of any concomitant topical ocular medications during the study period.

          6. Ocular conditions such as conjunctival infections, iritis, or any other ocular
             condition that may preclude the safe administration of either drop under
             investigation.

          7. Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days of entering
             this study.
