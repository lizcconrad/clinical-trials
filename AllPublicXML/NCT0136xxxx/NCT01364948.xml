  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The skin of newborn infants is immature and ineffective as a barrier. Preterm skin exhibits
      even more vulnerability to the environment due to poor self regulatory heat mechanisms,
      paucity of fatty tissue and its thinness. Most preterm babies lose up to 13% of their weight
      as water loss from their skin during the first week of life. Many strategies have been
      utilized by neonatologists to decrease this water loss. Oil application on the skin can act
      as a non permeable barrier and can help in reducing water loss from the skin. Edible coconut
      oil, often used for traditional massage of babies by Indian communities, is culturally
      acceptable and Hence the investigators decided to undertake this study to objectively assess
      the reduction in water loss from skin after oil application

    <description>The oil (coconut oil) was applied by the trained nurse to the entire body surface of infant except the face two times a day starting at 12 hrs of life. Four ml of coconut oil was applied using both hands of the caregiver in four strokes. First stroke was from the clavicles over the chest and abdomen till the groin, second from the front of thighs over the knee and leg upto the sole, the third one from the shoulders over the arm and forearm till the palm continuing medially over the forearm and arm till the axilla and the final stroke was used for the back, starting from the upper back, continuing over the back of the thighs till the heel. Just prior to the first application, and thereafter prior to the subsequent applications the TEWL was recorded using the portable closed chamber evaporimeter. The oil application was continued twice daily (every 12 hrs at the same time as the hour of birth e.g. 11 am and 11pm) till the completion of the seventh day (168 hrs of life).</description>
