    <textblock>
      The provision of HIV care and prevention services in resource-limited settings (RLS) entails
      substantial challenges due to a human resource crisis.[1] One strategy to address this human
      resource crisis is task shifting—the redistribution of tasks from higher trained providers to
      health workers with less training. Peer supporters, a group of community health workers who
      are people living with HIV (PLHIV), are an underutilized cadre to whom tasks can be shifted.
      Peers have been used extensively and effectively in HIV/AIDS programs in RLS, typically as
      peer educators who provide HIV prevention and education services.[2] Peers may be a potential
      source for not only providing care, but also impacting patient behaviors through peer
      counseling, education, and psychosocial support.

      With the scale up of HIV counseling and testing in RLS, increasing numbers of PLHIV know
      their serostatus and could potentially be engaged in care and prevention services. While
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a critical component of care which has been a source of much
      attention, PLHIV who are not yet on ART can also benefit from being engaged in care and
      utilizing other evidence-based health interventions besides ART. Also, many HIV/AIDS care
      programs have difficulty both retaining PLHIV in care prior to ART and initiating ART in a
      timely fashion. Additionally, many PLHIV not yet on ART still engage in risky sexual
      behaviors and do not fully utilize a proven basic preventive care package (BCP) set of
      interventions (cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, bed nets, and safe water systems). Peers may be
      able to impact PLHIV not yet on ART by improving linkages to care, facilitating timely
      initiation of preventive interventions and ART, and decreasing risky sexual behaviors.
      However, well-designed and evaluated operations research is needed to assess peer support
      effects on these care and behavioral outcomes.

      The objective of this study is to assess the impact of a peer support home visit intervention
      on patient engagement in care, utilization of a basic care package (BCP) of preventive care
      interventions, and risky sexual behaviors among people living with HIV (PLHIV) not on
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) through an individually randomized, operations research,
      community-based trial. We will compare outcomes between PLHIV who receive the peer-led
      intervention to those who do not. The primary outcomes will be engagement in care, BCP
      adherence, and condom use. The study hypotheses are as follows: (1) PLHIV who receive the
      peer intervention will have improved engagement in care compared to PLHIV not receiving the
      intervention; (2) PLHIV who receive the peer intervention are more likely to adhere to a BCP
      of interventions to prevent illness compared to PLHIV not receiving the intervention; (3)
      PLHIV who receive the peer intervention will have less risky sexual behaviors compared to
      PLHIV not receiving the intervention.
