      Conduct a comparative effectiveness clinical trial of medication treatment for behavioral
      symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in a group of real-world memory care clinics with enhanced
      access to the Indiana Network for Patient Care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this proposal is to enhance the existing information technology
      infrastructure in Central Indiana to improve the nation's capacity to conduct comparative
      effectiveness research (CER). Consistent with the instructions in RFA-HS-10-005, the
      investigators propose to apply these new capacities to a novel CER project evaluating
      treatment for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease has been identified as a first
      quartile CER priority. This proposal represents collaboration between the Medical Informatics
      Program at the Regenstrief Institute, Inc (a world leader in health information technology)
      and two Indiana University research programs: the Center for Aging Research and the Division
      of Clinical Pharmacology. These programs have an established track record in research
      relevant to under-served populations. Thus, this proposal combines considerable investigator,
      environment, and research strengths to continue to build a novel CER infrastructure in
      support of the nation's evidentiary CER priorities.

      Throughout this proposal, the investigators use the AHRQ definition of CER: the conduct and
      synthesis of research comparing the benefits and harms of different interventions and
      strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat and monitor health conditions in real world settings.&quot;
      The investigators also refer to a clinical trial of medication treatment for behavioral
      symptoms of Alzheimer's disease as the specific CER proposed to demonstrate the potential of
      our new infrastructure. However, the investigators stress that the enhancements proposed to
      existing infrastructure would support a broad portfolio of CER across an array of priority
      conditions. The investigators are also proposing enhancements in our privacy and
      confidentiality technology that would allow researchers from across the country to access
      de-identified data in support of CER. In summary, the investigators are proposing to add new
      CER knowledge on Alzheimer' disease and thereby field test new information technology
      capacities important to a wide range of CER projects while also increasing our capacity to
      provide data and opportunities for nationwide CER.

      The derivation of meaningful and actionable evidence from CER ultimately depends on capturing
      relevant, comprehensive and accurate data about treatment decisions, patients' clinical
      status, their care processes and environment, and the health outcomes they experience and
      value. Such data must be tracked longitudinally in order to determine temporal relationships,
      cause-effect paradigms, and the efficacy of specific clinical interventions in the context of
      other conditions, interventions, and goals of care. At Indiana University and the Regenstrief
      Institute, the investigators have four decades of experience and a well-documented,
      world-class clinical informatics and research infrastructure for capturing, storing, querying
      and analyzing treatment patterns and patients' clinical outcomes.

      The maturation of this health information technology is now embodied within the Indiana
      Network for Patient Care (INPC), a fully-operational regional health information exchange.
      The investigators are well positioned to expand and leverage this infrastructure in support
      of local and national multi-site clinical trials in comparative effectiveness. The specific
      aims of this proposal are to:

      1.0 PROSPECT STUDY: Enhance our existing information technology infrastructure to:

        1. provide de-identified access to the INPC database for CER work

        2. capture, store, and track a broader array of health care outcomes important to patients
           and their caregivers (e.g. behavioral symptoms due to dementia);

        3. support providers' and caregivers' and researchers' increasing need to work in teams by
           providing new tools for communication and co-management (e.g. collaborative care and
           research)

      2.0 COMET-AD STUDY: Conduct comparative effectiveness clinical trial of medication treatment
      for behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in a group of real-world memory care clinics
      with enhanced access to the Indiana Network for Patient Care.

    <time_frame>6, 12, and 18 week interviews from enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>We are not seeking to establish efficacy of these three medications for the indication of Alzheimer's disease. Each of these medications already has FDA-approval for Alzheimer's. The primary outcome measure is the discontinuation rate among the three medications. Based on previous systematic reviews, these rates are reportedly in the range of 30% by 12 weeks compared with placebo. We will determine the approximate date of discontinuation by self-reports from the caregiver through the telephone-based interview at 6, 12, and 18 weeks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6, 12, 18 week interviews from enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is based on a structured interview administered to an informal caregiver and has been adopted by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Studies Group to obtain information on the presence of psychopathology in behavioral areas including delusions, apathy, hallucinations, disinhibition, agitation, depression, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, night-time behavior, and euphoria.9 For each of 12 symptoms, if the caregiver reports the presence of psychopathology, a frequency and severity score are multiplied to yield a possible item score range of 0-12, and a possible total score range of 0-144. The NPI can be used to assess changes in the patient's behavior over the past month. The NPI also assesses the level of caregiver distress attributable to each of the 12 patient behaviors, with a possible total caregiver distress score range of 0-60. Higher scores indicate higher severity of psychopathology and caregiver disress. The NPI has excellent reliability and validity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthy Aging Brain Care (HABC)-Monitor</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6, 12, and 18 week interviews</time_frame>
    <description>The current HABC-Monitor includes 30 items covering four clinically relevant domains of dementia, ie, cognitive, functional, behavioral, and psychological symptoms, and caregiver quality of life. For brevity and practical use in the clinical setting, each item on the four scales was designed to have the same item response options consisting of four categories that use the frequency of the target problem in the past 2 weeks. The HABC- Monitor took approximately 6 minutes to complete. The scores of the four scales are summed to create the total scores which were used in this analysis.The higher the total score, the higher the level of self reported caregiver burden. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 90.</description>

        <description>We are not seeking to establish efficacy of these three medications for the indication of Alzheimer’s disease. Each of these medications already has FDA-approval for Alzheimer’s. The primary outcome measure is the discontinuation rate among the three medications. Based on previous systematic reviews, these rates are reportedly in the range of 30% by 12 weeks compared with placebo. We will determine the approximate date of discontinuation by self-reports from the caregiver through the telephone-based interview at 6, 12, and 18 weeks.</description>

        <title>Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)</title>
        <description>The NPI is based on a structured interview administered to an informal caregiver and has been adopted by the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Studies Group to obtain information on the presence of psychopathology in behavioral areas including delusions, apathy, hallucinations, disinhibition, agitation, depression, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, night-time behavior, and euphoria.9 For each of 12 symptoms, if the caregiver reports the presence of psychopathology, a frequency and severity score are multiplied to yield a possible item score range of 0–12, and a possible total score range of 0–144. The NPI can be used to assess changes in the patient’s behavior over the past month. The NPI also assesses the level of caregiver distress attributable to each of the 12 patient behaviors, with a possible total caregiver distress score range of 0–60. Higher scores indicate higher severity of psychopathology and caregiver disress. The NPI has excellent reliability and validity.</description>

        <title>Healthy Aging Brain Care (HABC)-Monitor</title>
        <description>The current HABC-Monitor includes 30 items covering four clinically relevant domains of dementia, ie, cognitive, functional, behavioral, and psychological symptoms, and caregiver quality of life. For brevity and practical use in the clinical setting, each item on the four scales was designed to have the same item response options consisting of four categories that use the frequency of the target problem in the past 2 weeks. The HABC- Monitor took approximately 6 minutes to complete. The scores of the four scales are summed to create the total scores which were used in this analysis.The higher the total score, the higher the level of self reported caregiver burden. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 90.</description>

Donepezil: The study is open-label and the memory care practice physicians will make determinations about initial drug dosage and any dosage changes and the timing of those changes. These physicians will also make the determination about whether to switch to a different anti-dementia drug, add memantine, or any other agent. We will, of course, monitor the frequency and content of such changes in the natural course of patient care.</description>
