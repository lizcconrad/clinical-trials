    <textblock>
      Comparative study to determine whether several fertility monitoring products - the
      DuoFertility monitor, the LadyComp/Babycomp monitor and Clearblue Ovulation tests - are
      substantially equivalent in performance, and secondarily to determine the appropriateness of
      labeling information for the DuoFertility monitor.

      The investigators plan to recruit 30 women who are currently trying to conceive, and ask them
      to use the 3 fertility monitors for duration of 3 menstrual cycles. Additionally, during the
      study the women will be asked to fill in online questionnaires to assess the usability of the
      monitors. As the spouse is often a critical partner in the purchase decision and compliance,
      the investigators will also ask the spouse to complete similar online questionnaires.
