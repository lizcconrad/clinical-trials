      The purpose of this prospective, multi-center, single treatment study is to evaluate the
      clinical outcomes associated with the non-invasive treatment to reduce wrinkles around the
      eyes utilizing the Ulthera® System to deliver focused ultrasound energy below the surface of
      the skin.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Sixty-eight subjects were enrolled at two aesthetic medical facilities. Study recruitment was initiated on March 3, 2011, and concluded on July 13, 2011. Forty-five subjects were enrolled at one study site; 23 subjects were enrolled at the second study site.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects presenting with rhytids and skin laxity in the periorbital region, Fitzpatrick Wrinkle Classification Scale (FWCS)of 3 to 7, qualified for study participation. Note: A protocol amendment restricting enrollment to FWCS scores of 3-7 occurred after 19 subjects with FWCS = 2 had been enrolled.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Treated Subjects</title>
          <description>The FWCS, a 9 point scale used to classify wrinkle severity, was used to qualify subjects for study participation.
Score 1-3 = Fine wrinkles; 4-6 = Fine to moderate-depth wrinkles, moderate number of lines; 7-9 = Fine to deep wrinkles, Numerous lines with or without redundant skin folds.
All study subjects received an Ulthera treatment to the upper face.</description>

        <population>Primary endpoint: Three masked assessors reviewed pre- and 90 days post-treatment photos, assessing each eye separately. 41 right, 42 left eye photos were found to be usable.
