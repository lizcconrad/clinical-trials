    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572) is a next-generation integrase inhibitor (INI) currently in
      phase 3 clinical trials for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fixed-dose combinations
      (FDCs) have greatly simplified the treatment of patients with HIV. While Atripla (an FDC of
      tenofovir (TDF), emtricitabine (FTC) and efavirenz (EFV)) has become the preferred first line
      regimen due in large part to its convenient presentation as a full treatment regimen in a
      single product, other options are needed. A fixed-dose combination of DTG/abacavir
      (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) is one such opportunity.

      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, 3-period crossover study in healthy adult
      subjects to evaluate the single-dose relative bioavailability of two experimental oral DTG 50
      mg/ABC 600 mg/3TC 300 mg FDC tablet formulations compared to co-administration of the
      separate tablet formulations (DTG 50 mg tablet and EPZICOM), with each dose administered in
      the fasted state. Approximately 18 subjects will be enrolled and randomized to one of 6
      different treatment sequences. There will be a screening visit within 30 days prior to the
      first dose of study drug and a follow up visit within 7-14 days after the last dose. There
      will be a 7 day washout between doses in each treatment period.

      The following PK parameters for DTG, ABC and 3TC will be measured: area under the
      concentration curve from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time
      (AUC(0-infinity)), Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to the
      time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC (0-t)), maximum observed concentration
      (Cmax), lag time before observation of drug concentrations (tlag), time of occurrence of Cmax
      (tmax), terminal phase half-life (t½), apparent clearance following oral dosing (CL/F) and
      apparent terminal phase volume of distribution (Vz/F).

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy, peptic ulceration, inflammatory bowel disease or pancreatitis
             should be excluded.
