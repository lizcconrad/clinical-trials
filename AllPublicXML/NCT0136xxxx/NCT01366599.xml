      Patients were not recruited for nor enrolled in this study. This study is a retrospective
      observational study. Data from medical records or insurance claims databases are anonymised
      and used to develop a patient cohort. All diagnoses and treatment are recorded in the course
      of routine medical practice.

        IHCIS, 2005-2007. The Impact National Managed Care Benchmark Databaseâ„¢ (formally known as
        Integrated Healthcare Information Services - IHCIS - prior to its purchase by Ingenix, Inc
        and referred to as IHCIS within GSK) is a comprehensive, de-identified U.S. healthcare
        claims database that is representative of the non-elderly, insurance-carrying population in
        the U.S. The database contains inpatient/outpatient and pharmacy claims, lab results and
        enrollment information on over 82 million lives from 1997 to 2007. Over 75 percent of all
        patients in the database have both medical and pharmacy benefits and, on average, 23.4
        months of enrollment/claims information; the annual attrition rate is roughly 15-25
        percent. The data are collected from over 45 different healthcare plans serving members
        across nine census regions. The database is HIPAA compliant and features encrypted member
        and provider IDs.
