  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical trial evaluates the clinical outcomes associated with the non-invasive treatment
      to obtain lift and tightening of the cheek tissue and improve jawline definition and
      submental skin laxity utilizing the Ulthera™ System which delivers ultrasound energy in a
      focused manner below the surface of the skin
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Ulthera™
      System for the non-invasive dermatological treatment to obtain lift and tighten the cheek
      tissue.

      The secondary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Ulthera™
      System for the non-invasive dermatological treatment for improvement in jawline definition
      and submental skin laxity at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline based on the consensus of
      the three masked reviewers.

    <measure>Change in Overall Lifting and Tightening of Treated Tissue on the Lower Face and Submental Regions.</measure>
    <time_frame>90D</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants assessed to have improvement in skin laxity, i.e., lifted and tightened skin in the areas treated with the Ulthera System, as determined by three masked assessors comparing pre-treatment and 90-days post-treatment photos from 70 subjects who returned for their 90-day follow-up visit.</description>

    <measure>Change in Submental and Neck Skin Laxity by Quantitative Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>90D</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants assessed as having an improvement in tissue lift, i.e., &gt;20mm2 in submental and neck skin laxity, at 90 Days post-treatment compared to baseline based on quantitative analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>90D</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects indicated whether they saw improvement, i.e., providing a Yes/No response, in face and neck characteristics at three months (D90) post Ulthera treatment. Pre-treatment and Day 90 post-treatment photographs were available for viewing during the assessment. Subjects also had a mirror in hand for real time assessment. Subjects' Yes/No responses were tabulated.</description>

    <description>Subject assessment of pain using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), 0-10, where 0 = no pain and 10=worse pain possible. Subjects' sensory responses to the treatment exposures were recorded using the NRS for each anatomical region.</description>
