      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of calcium (Ca) and vitamin D (D)
      supplemented orange juice (OJ) on weight loss and visceral fat mass in overweight and obese
      adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity and levels of overweight is rising worldwide. In the United States,
      63% of men and 55% of women are now overweight or obese. Recent epidemiological data and
      clinical trials have shown that a small daily increase in calcium or dairy products may
      result in annual losses in body weight and body fat. Data from clinical studies suggest that
      a 1000 mg per day increase in calcium intake is associated with an 8 kg difference in mean
      body weight and that calcium intake explains about 3% of the variance in body weight.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of calcium (Ca) and vitamin D (D)
      supplemented orange juice (OJ) on weight loss and visceral fat mass in overweight and obese
      adults.

      Otherwise healthy overweight and obese men and women ages 18 to 65 years with a BMI between
      25 and 35 kg/m2 will be randomized into one of the following experimental groups (36 in each
      group):

        1. Regular OJ: one 8 fluid oz serving three times/day (control)

        2. Regular OJ fortified with Calcium (350 mg/8 fluid oz serving) and Vitamin D3 (100 IU/8
           fluid oz serving): one 8 fluid oz serving three times/day (treatment)

      Subjects will receive either orange juice (OJ) (control) or OJ fortified with calcium and
      vitamin D3 (treatment) for 16 weeks. The study will involve 6 outpatient study visits to the
      study center.

      Primary endpoint: Change in body weight after 16 weeks Secondary endpoint: Visceral fat
      change after 16 weeks as measured by single slice CT scan

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women, between 18 and 65 years of age, who are capable of providing informed
             consent.

          -  BMI of 25 to 35 kg/m2

          -  Non-smoker (for at least 6 months).

             and physical examination.

             interfere with the study or increase risk to the subject.

          -  Participation in any other investigational diet study within 90 days prior to study
             entry.

          -  History of a medical or psychological condition or social circumstances that would
             impair the subject's ability to participate reliably in the study.

          -  Use within the last six months of medications that can result in significant weight
             gain or weight loss, including antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake
             inhibitors, anti-epileptic drugs, appetite-suppressants such as phentermine and
             sibutramine, and the lipase-inhibitor orlistat.

             supplements &gt; 3x/wk ) for 1 month prior to study start date and for duration of study.
             (If participant is taking calcium supplement &gt; 3x/wk or more than 2 servings of dairy
             products per day, they are eligible to participate if they agree to stop for 1 month
             prior to study start date and for the duration of the study. Participants will
             similarly be asked to stop multivitamins as the majority of these supplements contain
             calcium.)
