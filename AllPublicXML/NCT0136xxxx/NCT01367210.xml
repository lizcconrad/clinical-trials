      Objectives of the study:

        1. To verify the safety and the efficacy of the study treatment, defined as the persistent
           control of the virus' replication at 48 weeks after the simplification to maraviroc +
           darunavir with ritonavir in patients with R5 tropism by viral DNA genotyping.

        2. To collect relevant information about the safety, the immunologic and the economic
           impact of this strategy.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Because a higher rate of virological failures in study versus control arm.
