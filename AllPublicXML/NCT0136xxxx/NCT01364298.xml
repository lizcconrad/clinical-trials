    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel, Phase 4 clinical trial to compare
      efficacy and safety of gabapentin/B-complex versus pregabalin in diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy pain (DPNP) management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To compare the efficacy of gabapentin/B-complex versus pregabalin administered for 12 weeks
      in the treatment of pain in mild to moderate diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) of acute or
      chronic presentation.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To determine the safety and tolerability of gabapentin/B-complex versus pregabalin
      administered for 12 weeks in the treatment of pain in mild to moderate DPN of acute or
      chronic presentation.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive gabapentin/B-complex or pregabalin.

      The duration of treatment per subject will be 12 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Numeric Pain Intensity Scale (NPIS) Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>An average NPIS pain score (daily average records of the past seven days) was evaluated. Numeric pain intensity scale (NPIS) is a 11-point scale, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst possible pain. The participants were asked to mark the number that best represents the current level of pain they have experienced during the previous 24 hours. Change from baseline data has been calculated as value at baseline minus value at Day 84.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) Scale Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The LANSS scale score is 7-item pain scale that consists of grouped sensory description and sensory examination with simple scoring system. Evaluations in two main areas: pain and sensorial exploration. The ﬁrst 5 questions asks for presence of unpleasant skin sensations (pricking, tingling, pins and needles), appearance of skin (mottled, red, or pink), increased sensitivity of skin to touch, sudden bursts of electric shock sensations, and hot or burning skin sensations. Last 2 questions involve sensory testing for the presence of allodynia and altered pinprick threshold. Different numbers of points, relative to their signiﬁcance to neuropathic pain, are given to positive answers for maximum of 24 points. A score less than 12 makes unlikely that participant's symptoms are neuropathic in nature, whereas score more than 12 make neuropathic mechanisms likely to be contributing to participant's pain. Change from baseline data has been calculated as value at baseline minus value at Day 84.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score at Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is used to rate the pain as per 10 centimeter (cm) line. The pain intensity score ranges from '0=no pain' to '10=worst possible pain'. Change from baseline data has been calculated as value at baseline minus value at Day 84.</description>

    <measure>Profile of Mood States (POMS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 84 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>POMS is a rating scale, which comprises of 65 items that are evaluated in a 0-4 scale, where 0 means &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 &quot;extremely&quot;. The scores for the 65 items are added in various combinations to throw six validated factors which are used to calculate total POMS score: (tension-anxiety) + (depression-dejection) + (anger-hostility)+ (fatigue-Inertia) + (confusion-bewilderment) - (vigor-activity). Score range (-40 to 192). Score -40 denotes the best score and score 192 denotes the worst score.</description>

    <description>CGIC is an assessment that the physician performs to assess the participant's global change in health condition from start of the study on a 7-point scale (1 = extremely improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse 6 = much worse, 7 = extremely worse).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 84 (Week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>NPIS is a 11-point scale, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst possible pain. The participants were asked to mark the number that best represents the current level of pain they have experienced during the previous 24 hours.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 up to Day 84 (+7 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal laboratory findings, or diseases that emerges or worsens relative to Baseline during a clinical study with an investigational medicinal product (IMP), regardless of causal relationship and even if no IMP has been administered.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) Scale Score at Day 84</title>
        <description>The LANSS scale score is 7-item pain scale that consists of grouped sensory description and sensory examination with simple scoring system. Evaluations in two main areas: pain and sensorial exploration. The ﬁrst 5 questions asks for presence of unpleasant skin sensations (pricking, tingling, pins and needles), appearance of skin (mottled, red, or pink), increased sensitivity of skin to touch, sudden bursts of electric shock sensations, and hot or burning skin sensations. Last 2 questions involve sensory testing for the presence of allodynia and altered pinprick threshold. Different numbers of points, relative to their signiﬁcance to neuropathic pain, are given to positive answers for maximum of 24 points. A score less than 12 makes unlikely that participant's symptoms are neuropathic in nature, whereas score more than 12 make neuropathic mechanisms likely to be contributing to participant's pain. Change from baseline data has been calculated as value at baseline minus value at Day 84.</description>

        <description>POMS is a rating scale, which comprises of 65 items that are evaluated in a 0-4 scale, where 0 means &quot;not at all&quot; and 4 &quot;extremely&quot;. The scores for the 65 items are added in various combinations to throw six validated factors which are used to calculate total POMS score: (tension-anxiety) + (depression-dejection) + (anger-hostility)+ (fatigue-Inertia) + (confusion-bewilderment) - (vigor-activity). Score range (-40 to 192). Score -40 denotes the best score and score 192 denotes the worst score.</description>
