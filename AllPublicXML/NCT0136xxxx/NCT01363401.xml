  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous bone
      marrow-derived stem cells(&quot;HYNR-CS inj&quot;), through intrathecal delivery for the treatment in
      patients with ALS.

      This study consists of 2 steps. First step is a safety study of the intrathecal(IT) injection
      of &quot;HYNR-CS inj&quot; in 8 patients with ALS. In this phase 1 study, AE, laboratory test, physical
      examination, vital signs, Electrocardiogram, and Chest X-Ray examination were evaluated in
      terms of safety.

      Second step is to compare the efficacy and safety between test group and control group of
      total 64 patients with ALS.

    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by
      motor neuron loss. Despite of many trials for disease-modifying, no treatment has so far
      changed natural course of disease.

      We have performed the pre-clinical and clinical studies using autologous bone marrow-derived
      stem cells in ALS. We could get the evidence that autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells
      have dose-dependent effects on SOD1 mice via intrathecal injection. In our results of
      clinical trial, intrathecal injection of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells could slow
      down disease progression and might be used as a disease modifying strategy in patients with
      ALS.

      This study was designed as a single center, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 2-stage
      study, and targeted at patients diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(Lou Gehrig's
      disease). The study consisted of Stage-1 study for safety evaluation and Stage-2 study for
      efficacy and safety evaluation of the study drug, and at Stage 1, 7 subjects eligible for the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria received safety evaluation for 28 days of study drug
      administration in twice under the protocol, and then followed Stage 2. To decide whether the
      study can be proceeded in 2 stages, ADR(CTCAE Version 3.0, ≥grade 3) should not appear in
      initial 7 subjects.

      Data obtained from subjects of this study were analyzed into three: Safety Analysis,
      ITT(Intent-To-Treat) Analysis, and PP(Per Protocol) Analysis. However, in case of phase 1,
      only safety analysis was conducted, and in case of phase 2, all of safety, ITT, and PP
      analyses were conducted.

      For ITT Analysis, all the subjects whose data on primary efficacy endpoint could be obtained
      following the administration of investigational drug were analyzed in analysis among subjects
      who were administered the investigational drug once at least. Also, Modified ITT Analysis,
      including 7 subjects at Stage 1, was carried out.

    <measure>The Difference in the Changes of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) Between Treatment Groups and Control Groups.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline(Visit 5) and week 16(Visit 9)</time_frame>
    <description>ALSFRS-R is ordinal rating scale questionnaire (rating 0-4 for each question, 4 is most functional, 0-48 total) of 12 functional activities. The most functional total score is 48. ALSFRS-R was evaluated at baseline and week 28.(The first injection was performed at 0 week) ALSFRS-R total score variation baseline(Visit 5) and week 16(Visit 9)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Appel Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline(Visit 5) and week 16(Visit 9)</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the disease change, Appel scale will be assessed. Appel scale is a test tool, which is devised to evaluate the functional condition and variation of ALS(Lou Gehrig's disease) patients (rating 6 to between 30 and 36 points for each of 5 functional conditions, 30-164 total).
The higher the total score presents more severe disability. This was done at Visit 1, Visit 5 and Visit 9 (week -12,0,16). The first injection was performed at 0 week(Visit 5) Appel scale total score variation baseline(Visit 5) and week 16(Visit 9)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) (Percent of Predicted Normal)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline(Visit 5) and week 16(Visit 9)</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary efficacy was measured by comparing the rate of decline of mean FVC by treatment group.
FVC which is a clinical scale to observe variation in patient's respiratory competence, was conducted at Visit 1, Visit 5 and Visit 9. (week -12,0,16) The first injection was performed at 0 week. FVC variation baseline(Visit 5) and week 16(Visit 9)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SF-36 (The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36 Item)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline(Visit 5) and week 16(Visit 9)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score presents more severe disability. The higher the score presents less disability.
This was measured at Visit 5 and Visit 9. (week 0,16) The first injection was performed at 0 week.
