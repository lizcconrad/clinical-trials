      Background:

      - Osteoporosis is a condition where the bone becomes more brittle and more likely to break as
      a person ages. The drugs that people take to treat this condition have prevented many common
      hip fractures. But these drugs may be associated with problems in the shape and structure of
      the hip bone after many years of use. These changes in the hip bone may lead to an unusual
      kind of hip fracture. These fractures are very rare, so it is hard to study them. Researchers
      want to learn more about these fractures.

      Objectives:

      - To compare hip x-rays of three groups: people who have been taking osteoporosis drugs for
      several years, those who have just started taking them, and those who have never taken these
      drugs.

      Eligibility:

        -  People at least 50 years of age who have been taking osteoporosis drugs for at least 5
           years.

        -  People at least 50 years of age who have been taking these drugs for less than 1 year.

        -  People at least 50 years of age who have never taken these drugs.

      Design:

        -  All participants will have three total visits over 3 years.

        -  At the first visit, those taking part will have a medical history and physical exam.
           They will complete a questionnaire about medication use and bone health. They will also
           have an x-ray of the hips and pelvis, and have a bone density scan (the kind used to
           test for osteoporosis) of the hips.

      Those in the study will repeat these exams and medical history questions at followup visits.
      These visits will take place 18 months and 36 months after the first study visit.

        -  At any of these visits, participants who may have a hip fracture that does not show up
           on the x-rays will have an imaging study to examine the bone more closely.

        -  Participants who receive a hip replacement or suffer from a broken bone at any time
           should inform the study researchers as soon as possible.

      Objective:

      Bisphosphonates are a class of medications that treat osteoporosis and prevent fractures, and
      have been available for more than a decade. However, there have been recent studies that have
      shown that, on rare occasions, they may be associated with an atypical hip fracture after
      long-term use. Radiographic features such as beaking and thickening along the side of the hip
      bone have been frequently observed with these atypical femur fractures, but most of the
      studies to date have only been focused on finding the fractures, not the x-ray features. It
      is not known how common these x-ray features and pain symptoms are amongst bisphosphonate
      users that have not yet experienced a fracture. If there is a difference between users and
      non-users, these features may be a valuable finding to help catch fractures before they
      happen. A recent hypothesis has emerged that a genetic condition, hypophosphatasia, may play
      a role.

      Study population:

      This study will evaluate the presence of these features in users of bisphosphonates and the
      general population. Individuals from the community who have taken bisphosphonates for five or
      more years (and still taking or have since stopped) will be compared with individuals
      recently starting bisphosphonate treatment and individuals without osteoporosis and not
      taking bisphosphonates but similar in age. Another cohort of patients who have sustained
      atypical femur fractures will also be recruited.

      Design:

      This study will be look at the frequency of subtrochanteric beaking and cortical thickening
      between three groups of people: long-term users, short-term users, and non-users. Thorough
      medication usage history, physical examination of the hip and radiographs (x-rays) will be
      taken three times over the course of three years, and a one time bone density scan will be
      performed upon enrolling. We will also perform genetic testing for hypophosphatasia in long
      term asymptomatic users and patients who have sustained the atypical femur fracture.

      Outcome measures:

      We will be looking for the presence of these &quot;beaks&quot; and measuring the thickness of the hip
      bone at a certain spot. We are interested in seeing if there is a difference between our
      three groups of people at first and also if these two features change over three years. We
      will also monitor for thigh pain, a feature of impending fracture, and if any fractures are
      found on x-rays. We will compare the prevalence of hypophosphatasia mutations in asymptomatic
      bisphosphonate users and subjects who have sustained the atypical femur fracture.

        The following information pertains to individuals in the Longitudinal Group.

        Individuals who currently have thigh pain will not be excluded from this study. As the goal
        of this study is to correlate medication usage with a radiographic feature, individuals
        concurrently with thigh pain will still be considered, but we will take note of the
        duration of medication usage and the start of thigh pain per participant history. Duration
        of thigh pain prior to fracture will likewise be considered. If a current fracture is found
        on radiographs or suspicion is high for a fracture, selected participants will be sent for
        MRI of bilateral femurs and participant will be referred back to their primary provider for
        additional evaluation and treatment.

        Individuals who have previously had a unilateral hip fracture or arthroplasty will also not
        be excluded. As several previous studies have shown, bilateral fractures are not uncommon.
        We will continue to monitor the progress on the contralateral hip. We will query for
        details regarding history of first fracture and medication usage. These participants will
        be subanalyzed for medication usage and time between fractures. Individuals with bilateral
        (but not unilateral) fractures and bilateral arthroplasty initially will be excluded.
        However, individuals who are found to have unilateral or bilateral fractures during
        radiographic studies or undergo unilateral or bilateral arthroplasty during their three
        years of participation will be allowed to remain in the protocol, and we will assess for
        change in their anatomy.

        Individuals who are being treated with corticosteroids or other types of medications will
        not be excluded from this study. These variables will be considered confounders and will be
        analyzed by univariate analysis.

        Individuals with anatomical variations such as coxa vara or coxa valga will not be
        excluded. We will assume that they will be equally distributed into control and treatment
        groups. These individuals may be at higher risk for atypical fractures, and will be
        subanalyzed with appropriate femoral-angle matched controls.

        Controls that choose to begin bisphosphonate during the study will not be excluded from the
        study, but will be included in a subanalysis of individuals with less than 3 years of
        bisphosphonate exposure. Likewise, participants who choose to discontinue bisphosphonate
        usage will also not be dropped from the study. Analysis will be carried through with groups
        designated by intent to treat. Users who have taken the drug for 5 years and more who are
        currently on a drug holiday are eligible (because the drug stays in the bone for so long).
