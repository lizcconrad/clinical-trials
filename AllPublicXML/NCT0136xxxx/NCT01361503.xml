  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to conduct magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) and
      imaging (MRI) scans to assess the structural and neurochemical profile of the brain in 20
      children and adolescents, 6-17 years old with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). For comparison,
      MRS and MRI will also be obtained from 10 healthy control subjects, matched to the 20
      subjects with ASD in age, sex, dexterity, and IQ. All eligible subjects will be administered
      a detailed assessment battery consisting of cognitive assessments (neuropsychological battery
      including subsets of the DANVA2 and the CANTAB) and measures of psychosocial functioning
      (SAICA and M-FES). The study includes 1-3 visits for the screening period at Massachusetts
      General Hospital (approximately 4 hours of assessments) and one scanning visit at McLean
      Hospital (approximately 1.5 hours).

      The investigators hypothesize that youth with ASD versus controls will exhibit increased
      glutamate concentrations, reflecting glutamatergic overactivity, and increased Cho
      concentrations, suggesting neuronal abnormality. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize
      that compared to neurotypical controls, the structural integrity of white mater tracts will
      be disrupted in ASD.

        Subjects will be recruited from current patients of The Alan and Lorraine Bressler Clinic
        for Autism Spectrum Disorders. We propose to contact by letter (via regular mail or email)
        or telephone patients who have been identified by clinicians as expressing interest in the
        study. Subjects who have participated in previous protocols in our program may also be
        eligible to participate in this study. We propose to contact by letter or telephone past
        study participants who have expressed interested in being contacted about future studies
        they may be eligible for in our office. If a potential subject's clinician ascertains that
        the patient has an interest in study participation, the clinician will only offer contact
        information for the study to the patient and/or the patient's parents. The patient and/or
        parent can then contact the study coordinator for more information on the actual study.
