    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this feasibility study are to determine the safety of spinal cord
      stimulation (SCS) as a therapy in patients with systolic heart failure and to gather
      observational information for potential efficacy markers
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients remain relatively high, even with recent
      advances in therapies. Previous studies show that the autonomic nervous system plays an
      important role in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF)and sudden cardiac death.

      SCS is a neurostimulation therapy, which involves the stimulation of selected nerve fibers
      and intends to create end-organ responses characterized by changes in blood flow, decrease of
      catecholamines and reduction in inflammation. These changes that occur due to SCS are shown
      to be effective in reducing the symptoms of chronic angina and pain secondary to peripheral
      vascular disease where both situations are characterized by decreased blood flow and
      inflammation.

      The SCS system consists of an implantable pulse generator(IPG) and lead(s). Each lead has
      electrodes on the distal end. Electrical impulses travel from the IPG through the leads to
      the electrodes positioned at the selected nerve fibers to provide the therapeutic
      stimulation. By virtue of its potential in augmenting blood flow, decreasing catecholamines
      and reducing inflammation, SCS may further benefit patients with heart failure (HF).
