  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is ancillary. Participants will be recruited as part of a separate clinical trial
      on effects of two intensive behavioral training programs that evaluates feasibility and
      efficacy of a behavioral treatment that includes mindfulness techniques (MT) in comparison to
      traditional behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation. The investigators propose to
      compare the effect of MT to that of traditional CBT on a physiological marker of stress,
      salivary cortisol concentration, and physiological responses to smoking cues in tobacco
      smokers. The investigators will use electrophysiological reactivity to smoking cues in the
      form of audio recordings of personalized scripts describing the scenarios associated with the
      strongest urges to smoke that will provide a physiological validation to a behavioral
      intervention. The investigators will also explore correlations between these biological
      markers and self report of stress, craving and negative affect to supplement self report and
      behavioral outcome measures with biological and physiological markers to represent
      improvement attributed to the intervention.

    <description>Wk 0: development of scripts based on participant's descriptions of the most salient aspects of the smoking experience that triggers craving.

Wk 4: After the last MT or CBT session, participants will undergo post-treatment psychophysiological activation to smoking-related cues using the script driven imagery technique, in vivo cues and salivary cortisol testing.</description>

    <description>60 smokers will enter a separate 4 wk group sessions trial that evaluates efficacy of MT in comparison to CBT for smoking cessation. During the parent study, participants will receive bi-weekly sessions of either MT or CBT, for 4 weeks and to set a quit date at the end of the 2nd week. In this context, we will examine participants at two points:
Week 0-1 of MT/CBT: development of smoking scripts based participant's descriptions of situations that trigger tobacco craving.
Then participants will undergo pre-treatment (week 0-1) and post treatment (week 4) psychophysiological activation to smoking-related cues using the script driven imagery technique, in vivo cues, salivary cortisol testing and to complete a computerized SST protocol.</description>
