  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and the risks of using talimogene
      laherparepvec in patients who already received treatment with talimogene laherparepvec in
      study 005/05 (NCT00769704), and to see if extended treatment with talimogene laherparepvec
      can destroy melanoma tumors.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first administration of study drug in the extension period until 30 days after last dose. Median duration of treatment was 50 weeks in the GM-CSF group and 36 weeks in the talimogene laherparepvec group.</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0 based on the following guideline:
Grade 1: Mild AE; Grade 2: Moderate AE; Grade 3: Severe AE; Grade 4: Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5: Death related to AE.
Treatment-related AE refers to AEs that have possible or probable relation to study treatment as determined by the investigator.
A serious AE is one that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is an important medical event.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization in study 005/05 until the data-cut-off date for the extension period of 08 August 2014; median treatment duration for 005/05 and 005/05-E studies combined was 88 weeks for talimogene laherparepvec and 100 weeks for GM-CSF.</time_frame>
    <description>Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator. Best overall response for a patient is the best overall response observed across all time points and is cumulative (ie, includes responses during the parent study 005/05 and during Study 005/05-E).
Disease assessments were performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle and assessed in accordance with modified World Health Organization criteria.
CR: Disappearance of all clinical evidence of tumor (both measurable and non-measurable but evaluable disease); PR: ≥ 50% reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable tumors at the time of assessment as compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Durable Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization in study 005/05 until the data-cut-off date for the extension period of 08 August 2014; median treatment duration for 005/05 and 005/05-E studies combined was 88 weeks for talimogene laherparepvec and 100 weeks for GM-CSF.</time_frame>
    <description>Durable response rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator, initiating at any time while receiving talimogene laherparepvec or GM-CSF therapy on the 005/05 or the 005/05-E study and maintained continuously for at least 6 months from response initiation. This reflects all new sites of disease as well as disease sites identified at baseline.
Disease assessments were performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle in accordance with modified World Health Organization criteria.
CR: Disappearance of all clinical evidence of tumor (both measurable and non-measurable but evaluable disease); PR: ≥ 50% reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable tumors at the time of assessment as compared to baseline.</description>

               1. received the maximum number of talimogene laherparepvec treatment injections or

Grade 1: Mild AE; Grade 2: Moderate AE; Grade 3: Severe AE; Grade 4: Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5: Death related to AE.
Treatment-related AE refers to AEs that have possible or probable relation to study treatment as determined by the investigator.
A serious AE is one that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is an important medical event.</description>

        <title>Objective Response Rate</title>
        <description>Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator. Best overall response for a patient is the best overall response observed across all time points and is cumulative (ie, includes responses during the parent study 005/05 and during Study 005/05-E).
Disease assessments were performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle and assessed in accordance with modified World Health Organization criteria.
CR: Disappearance of all clinical evidence of tumor (both measurable and non-measurable but evaluable disease); PR: ≥ 50% reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable tumors at the time of assessment as compared to baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>From randomization in study 005/05 until the data-cut-off date for the extension period of 08 August 2014; median treatment duration for 005/05 and 005/05-E studies combined was 88 weeks for talimogene laherparepvec and 100 weeks for GM-CSF.</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set for the extension study is defined as all participants who received at least one dose of extension treatment.</population>

          <title>Objective Response Rate</title>
          <description>Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by the investigator. Best overall response for a patient is the best overall response observed across all time points and is cumulative (ie, includes responses during the parent study 005/05 and during Study 005/05-E).
Disease assessments were performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle and assessed in accordance with modified World Health Organization criteria.
CR: Disappearance of all clinical evidence of tumor (both measurable and non-measurable but evaluable disease); PR: ≥ 50% reduction in the sum of the products of the perpendicular diameters of all measurable tumors at the time of assessment as compared to baseline.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
