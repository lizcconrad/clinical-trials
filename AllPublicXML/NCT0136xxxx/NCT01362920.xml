  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved procalcitonin in conjunction with
      other laboratory markers to aid in the risk assessment of critically ill patients with severe
      infection (sepsis). Although considerable literature exists regarding the usefulness of
      Procalcitonin (PCT) as a marker of sepsis, there are still potential uses for PCT
      measurements that are not yet explored and its value among the critically ill patients
      remains unclear. This study seeks to better understand the usefulness of measuring PCT values
      in patients admitted to the Medical ICU for a variety of reasons and in particular with
      severe infection (sepsis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Procalcitonin (PCT) is a 116 amino acid peptide that has an approximate MW of 14.5 kDa and
      belongs to the calcitonin (CT) superfamily of peptides. Transcription of the CALC-1 gene for
      PCT is usually suppressed in the non-neuroendocrine tissue, except in the C cells of the
      thyroid gland where its expression produces PCT, the precursor of CT in healthy individuals
      and in the absence of infection.

      In the presence of microbial infection, circulating levels of calcitonin precursors (CTpr),
      including PCT, increase up to several thousand-fold.1 In addition to being a marker of
      microbial infection, PCT also acts as a modulator of the host inflammatory reaction. In an
      animal model of sepsis, administration of exogenous human PCT worsened outcome, whereas
      neutralization of endogenous PCT improved survival.

      There are several inflammatory laboratory markers, like tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,
      interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), but they are non- specific for
      infection and can be caused by conditions like pancreatitis, burns, trauma or acute lung
      injury. The non-specific nature of clinical and laboratory parameters for microbial infection
      makes it difficult to evaluate patients with potential infection. In addition to the lack of
      specificity, traditional laboratory and clinical indicators of sepsis are not temporally
      concordant with the course of illness. As a result, these tests are not reliable to evaluate
      the response to therapeutic interventions in real time.
