  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening of nutritional status is unsolved problem in cardiac surgery. Applicability of such
      criteria as body mass index and albumin and screening scales (MNA, NRS-2002, SGA, SNAQ) in
      cardiac surgery is controversial and insufficiently studied. Furthermore, there is some known
      predictors of poor outcome, which closely related to nutritional status (C-reactive protein,
      total lymphocyte count). The aim of this study is assessment of several nutritional screening
      scales, objective nutritional criteria and predictors for the purpose of detection of most
      informative one or its combination.
