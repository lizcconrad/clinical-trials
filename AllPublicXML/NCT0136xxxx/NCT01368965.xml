    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center, single treatment clinical trial evaluates the clinical
      outcomes associated with non-invasive treatment to obtain lift and tightening of facial
      tissue and improve jawline definition in subjects with darker skin color utilizing the
      Ulthera® System to deliver focused ultrasound energy below the skin surface.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
      Ulthera® System for the non-invasive treatment to obtain overall lift and tightening of
      facial tissue and jawline definition improvement.
