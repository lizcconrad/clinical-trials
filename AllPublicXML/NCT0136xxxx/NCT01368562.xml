      This is an open label compassionate use study of subcutaneously administered MNTX in subjects
      with advance medical illness and opioid-induced constipation. Eligible subjects were to
      initially receive a single dose of MNTX delivered SC. Subsequent dosing could have been
      adjusted upward to achieve a desired clinical response or lowered to alleviate drug related
      adverse events (AEs).
