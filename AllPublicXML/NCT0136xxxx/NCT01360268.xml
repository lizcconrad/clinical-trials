      Rationale for this study:

      Correction of hypocholesteremia and insulin resistance after successful eradication of HCV by
      combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin has been shown in several studies. The
      majority of these studies examined genotype 1 and some genotype 3 patients, but it is not
      clear if the same results can be achieved in other genotypes of HCV.

      Moreover, clinical data of the relationships between different adipocytokines, metabolic
      profiles, and HCV and treatment is of value to further understand the mechanisms for
      HCVrelated metabolic alterations. The present proposal is designed to address the paradox of
      HCV-related metabolic alterations/adipocytokine alterations and to determine how BMI
      influences the HCV-related metabolic alteration/adipocytokine aterations by collecting and
      analyzing the samples from humans with HCV infection prior to and after combination of
      peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin

      For metabolic alternations:

      Lipid profile: After treatment, responders in both genotype I and II will experience more
      increase of cholesterol levels and LDL levels than nonresponders/ relapseres. Insulin
      resistance: After treatment, responders with both genotype I and II will experience more
      decrease of HOMA-IR than nonresponders/ relapseres; higher percentage of responders will
      achieve HOMA-IR &lt; 2 than nonresponders/ relapseres B. For adipocytokine alternation, this
      study is more of exploratory propose as there is still little well established consensus.
