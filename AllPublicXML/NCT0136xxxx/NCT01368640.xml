  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to develop prediction equations for calculating FFM, TBW, ECW and SMM
      based on the gold standard reference methods ADP, DXA, MRI, D2O and NaBr on the one hand and
      measurement data of the BIA devices on the other hand. The equations are necessary to use the
      device as a Body Composition Analyzer with an acceptable accuracy level for clinical
      practice.

Repeatability (variability across successive measurements within a short time period taken by the same operator and the same device; device is repositioned between successive measurements).
Between-operator precision (variability across measurements taken by the same device, but different operators).
