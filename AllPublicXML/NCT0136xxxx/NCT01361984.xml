  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a PI-initiated study taking place only at UCLA, sponsored by Sunovion. The
      investigators plan to enroll about 20 subjects who are at least 40 years old and have Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effectiveness of Brovana and Serevent in helping relieve COPD symptoms. Specifically, the
      investigators are looking at how much and for how long the two drugs can open up the small
      airways in the lungs. This will be done with breathing tests on all subjects, and with high
      resolution CT scans on subjects who agree to this optional part of the study. Half of
      subjects will take Brovana (arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution) for 2 weeks and then
      Serevent (salmeterol xinafoate inhalation powder) for 2 weeks; the other half will take
      Serevent the first two weeks and Brovana the second two weeks. All subjects will also take
      Spiriva (tiotropium) and will be provided with albuterol for immediate relief of symptoms.
      After a Screening Visit to determine eligibility, subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive Brovana or Serevent for the first 2 weeks, complete Test Visit 1, then receive the
      other study drug for 2 weeks, and finally complete Test Visit 2. Visits will include
      questionnaires, review of health and medications, and breathing tests before and after taking
      the study drug. Subjects who agree to be in the sub-study will also undergo CT scans before
      and after taking the study drug at both test visits.
