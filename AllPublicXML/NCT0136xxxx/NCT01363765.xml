  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is a challenge because sputum smear, the most rapid and
      inexpensive test, often fails to detect the disease, in around 20 to 30% of cases. Culture of
      sputum yields a correct diagnosis in up to 90% of cases, but results are only available in 4
      to 8 weeks, depending on the method. A new test (Xpert MTB/Rif) based on a rapid technique,
      named polymerase chain reaction (PCR), detects TB in less than 2 hours over 95% of cases, in
      addition to identification of cases resistant to certain drugs used to treat TB. The test is
      expensive, but several studies have demonstrated its accuracy, and since most steps are
      automatized, savings can be expected from human resources work. The aims of our study are (1)
      to evaluate this tool as a substitute test for sputum smears in routine conditions; (2)
      evaluate if it is cost-effective, meaning that effectiveness of the test may outweigh the
      extra cost, and (3) evaluate the acceptability of the test among patients and health care
      workers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main study consisted of a group-randomized pragmatic trial following a stepped-wedge
      design. The GeneXpert machines will be installed in laboratories of the basic health units in
      Rio de Janeiro and Manaus, two cities with a high burden of the disease in Brazil. Doctors
      will prescribe routine tests in the clinics. When sputum specimens arrive in the laboratory,
      instead of performing smears, the Xpert MTB/Rif will be performed during the intervention
      period. If positive, a sputum smear will also be performed. The intervention period will be
      preceded by an observation period during which routine will be kept unchanged, i.e., only
      smears will be performed. The observation period will serve as a comparator (control). The
      investigators will then see how many more cases were detected during the intervention period,
      and in particular, how many smear-negative cases were detected, compared to the observation
      period.

      A total of 35,000 specimens are expected to be tested with the new technology in 14
      laboratories. Laboratories, not individuals, will be randomized.

    <description>The notification rate (NR, i.e., number of notifications/100,000 population/year) ratio (NRR) is defined as the NR in the intervention period/NR in the observation period, and is presented in the statistical analysis section.
Numbers are participants in the notification database who were not in the lab (all tests done) database; denominators are population taking into account growth of the population during the study period, adjusted for variations in monthly number of opening days (by weighing the number of person-months for the proportion of suspects with samples examined each month out of the total number examined by the laboratory during the whole study period), stratified by sex and age group.
Routine practices were not changed; patients with a high suspicion of TB were, as prior to the study, notified regardless of a confirmatory test.</description>

      <recruitment_details>From Feb 4 to Oct 4 2012, all 11 primary care laboratories in Rio de Janeiro and 3 labs covering 70% of PTB diagnosis in Manaus participated. Over the same period, 4,660 patients were notified with PTB to SINAN (disease information database). Of these, 2,745 (59%) could be linked to test results in GAL (lab information system).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Samples (and not patients) were included if it was a first diagnostic sample in the intervention arm. Follow up (non diagnostic) samples were excluded for both arms, as were inadequate samples (insufficient material, blood stained-specimens) in the intervention group.</pre_assignment_details>

Numbers are participants in the notification database who were not in the lab (all tests done) database; denominators are population taking into account growth of the population during the study period, adjusted for variations in monthly number of opening days (by weighing the number of person-months for the proportion of suspects with samples examined each month out of the total number examined by the laboratory during the whole study period), stratified by sex and age group.

    <limitations_and_caveats>The design has potential for bias, due to delayed treatment effects or to conditions that change over time. Both are unlikely: outcome (notification) was shortly after test and adjustment for time in multilevel mixed model confirmed primary analysis.</limitations_and_caveats>
