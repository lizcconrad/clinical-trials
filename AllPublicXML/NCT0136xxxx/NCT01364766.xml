      The purpose of this study is to find the impact of continuous blood glucose sensors use in
      the classroom/school environment. We will be asking the subject,subject's parent and
      subject's teachers to complete a short survey/questionnaire. The survey will take
      approximately 10-15 minutes.

      The purpose of this study is to find the impact of continuous blood glucose sensors use in
      the classroom/school environment. Recent technological advancements in diabetes management
      have resulted in increased use of devices during class/school. Although many studies have
      examined the quality of life and the impact on the family and subject of these devices, to
      our knowledge this is the first study that will examine the impact of the continuous glucose
      monitor during class/school. To our knowledge, this is first study to involve the teachers.
      The results of this study is particularly important since the future of diabetes therapy will
      be to use continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps to develop a closed loop system of
      insulin therapy or &quot;artificial pancreas.&quot;
