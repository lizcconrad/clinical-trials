      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioavailability of total testosterone through
      pharmacokinetic profiles obtained following (a) single administration of three doses of TBS-2
      b) multiple administration TBS-2.

      In addition, assessing the bioavailability of free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, SHBG
      and estradiol through pharmacokinetic profiles will also be conducted.

      This is a 2 Period study that requires overnight stays in clinic. Blood samples are required
      at all visits including sampling at predefined time periods during the overnight stays.

      Period I

      Subjects will be checked-in on Day 1 Period I to start their baseline testosterone
      measurement (dependant on menstrual cycle, preferably within 48hr of start of the menstrual
      cycle). They will remain institutionalized until Day 4 morning, and will be checked out after
      the 48 hour blood draw and study close-out for those that do not continue with Period II.

      Period II (Multi-Dose)

      Subjects will be institutionalized starting on Day 1 of Visit 3 until Day 5 morning of Visit
      3, and will be checked out after the 48 hour blood draw and study close-out.
