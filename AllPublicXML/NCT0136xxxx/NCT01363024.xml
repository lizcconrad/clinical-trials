    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy &gt;/= 12 weeks

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Histologic or cytologic documentation of locally advanced, or metastatic solid
             malignancy that has relapsed after or failed to respond to at least one prior regimen
             or for which there is no standard therapy

          -  Evaluable or measurable disease. Prostate cancer patients with non-measurable disease
             are eligible if they have two rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (5 ng/mL
             measured 2 weeks apart) that meet the PSA Working Group criteria for progression prior
             to initiation of study treatment. Ovarian cancer patients with non-measurable disease
             are eligible if they have two rising CA-125 levels greater than the ULN (2 weeks apart
             prior to initiation of study treatment).

          -  Adequate hematologic and end organ function

          -  For female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of
             childbearing potential, agreement (by patient and/or partner) to use an effective form
             of contraception and to continue its use until 90 days after the last dose of study
             treatment

          -  Consent to provide archival tissue

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior use of any monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks before Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Experimental therapy within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Prior anti-cancer therapy within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  Major surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. All wounds
             must be fully healed on Cycle 1, Day 1.

          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases which could affect
             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant
             cardiovascular disease or pulmonary disease

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection
             (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at screening or any major episode of
             infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (relating to the
             completion of the course of antibiotics) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1

          -  History of other malignancy which could affect compliance with the protocol or
             interpretation of results. Patients with a history of curatively treated basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix are allowed.
             Patients with a malignancy that has been treated with curative intent will also be
             allowed if the malignancy has been in remission without treatment for &gt;/= years prior
             to Cycle 1, Day 1.

          -  Presence of positive test results for Hepatitis B (Hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             and/or total HB core antibody [anti-HB-c]) or Hepatitis C (Hepatitis C virus [HCV]
             antibody serology testing). Patients positive for anti-HB-c are eligible only if PCR
             is negative for HBV DNA.

          -  Known history of HIV seropositive status

          -  Primary CNS malignancy, or untreated/active CNS metastases

          -  Pregnancy, lactation or breastfeeding

          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications
