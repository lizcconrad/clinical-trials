      The study aims to:

        1. Achieve molecular imaging of MG7 antigen in patients with gastric cancer in vivo using
           confocal laser endomicroscopy.

        2. Compare the results of in vivo MG7-specific molecular imaging with CLE and ex vivo
           immunohistochemistry .

      Gastric cancer remains the world's second leading cause of cancer-related death. Improved
      prognosis essentially depend on earlier diagnosis. Gastric monoclonal antibody MG7 has been
      validated as a specific antibody in gastric cancerous tissue. Conventional evaluation of MG7
      antigen expression is immunohistochemistry, which is time-consuming, and the immunoreactivity
      can be affected by storage and fixation of tissue. Confocal laser endomicrosopy enables
      visualization of the cellular and subcellular structures in vivo. Thus this study aims to
      achieve molecular imaging of MG7 antigen in gastric cancer in vivo using confocal laser
      endomicroscopy.
