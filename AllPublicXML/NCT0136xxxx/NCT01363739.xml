  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -1498C/T VEGF polymorphism, as suggested by a recent retrospective analysis, seems to have a
      role in predicting the efficacy of Bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI in first-line treatment of
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients. The present study aims to prospectively evaluate the
      predictive role of this polymorphism in metastatic colorectal patients receiving the same
      treatment.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as time from study entry until progression of disease (according to RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause. Patients who are alive without having progressed at the end of the study will be censored at their last radiological assessment</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <description>Response Rate (RR) is defined as the fraction of treated patients who achieve a response as defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overal survival</measure>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from study entry until death from any cause. Patients who are alive at the end of the study will be censored at that point</description>
