  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy and tolerability
      of SSP-004184AQ. The study consists of two phases: the pharmacokinetic phase, using a single
      16 mg/kg dose of SSP-004184AQ; and the chronic dosing phase, during which patients will
      receive an additional 48 weeks of SSP-004184AQ dosing. Two age groups will be studied: 6-&lt;12,
      and 12-&lt;18 years old. The study is designed to initially assess the pharmacokinetics and
      safety of SSP-004184AQ in older children (adolescents, 12-&lt;18 years old) and then if deemed
      safe, in younger children (6-&lt;12 years old).

      Pharmacokinetic Phase: Patients will receive a single 16 mg/kg dose of SSP-004184AQ in
      capsule form.

      Chronic Dosing Phase: Patients will receive SSP-004184AQ capsules daily for 48 weeks. Doses
      may range from 8-60 mg/kg/d.

    <description>The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of SPD602 were measured in plasma of all patients following a single capsule dose of SPD602 at 16 mg/kg at start of treatment on Day 1 and at the clinic visit on Day 2. PK blood samples were collected as follows: Pre-dose on Day 1 (within 60 minutes prior to investigational product administration) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 hours (±3 minutes) and 24 hours (±30 minutes) post-dose. Plasma concentrations of SPD602 were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Parents willing and able to sign the approved informed consent for their children and
             subjects between the ages of 6 and &lt;18 years willing and able to provide their assent

          -  Transfusion-dependent subjects who have transfusional iron overload requiring chronic
             treatment with deferoxamine, deferasirox, or deferiprone. A transfusion dependent
             subject is defined in this study as one with a minimum transfusion history totaling
             more than 20 units of packed red blood cells OR a calculated iron load based on
             transfusion history of 200mg/kg AND a transfusion requirement of 7 or more
             transfusions per year; or, in subjects with sickle cell anemia, be iron overloaded but
             can be receiving transfusion exchange therapy in lieu of transfusions.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator (and in consultation with the subject's parents),
             the subject is able to discontinue all existing iron chelation therapies for a minimum
             period of 1-5 days prior first dose of SSP-004184AQ, for the initial pharmacokinetic
             period of 8 days (if applicable), and for up to 49 weeks if continuing into the
             chronic dosing phase.

          -  Subjects able to have an MRI must have:

               2. cardiac MRI T2* &gt;10ms (Note: Subjects not able to have an MRI will be considered
                  iron overloaded on the basis of serum ferritin only.)

             use a medically acceptable method for birth control from screening until 30 days after
             the last dose of the study drug. Females of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative serum beta-HCG pregnancy test at the Screening Visit and a negative urine
             pregnancy test at the Baseline Visit. Females of child-bearing potential must agree to

          -  Evidence of significant renal insufficiency, eg, serum creatinine above the upper
             limit of normal or proteinuria greater than 1 gm per day.

             Screening.

          -  ALT &gt;180 IU/L at Screening.

          -  Use of any investigational agent within the 30 days prior to Baseline testing.

             range in the 12 months prior to screening by echocardiography or MRI or &lt;50% at
             Baseline testing by MRI (echocardiograph is acceptable for LVEF if MRI information is
             not available).

      <pre_assignment_details>The study consisted a pharmacokinetic (PK) phase and a chronic dosing (CD) phase. A sufficient number of participants were screened to enroll 16 participants into the PK phase (8 participants per age cohort). These participants could consent to participate in the CD phase. Additional participants also participated in the CD phase.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of SPD602 were measured in plasma of all patients following a single capsule dose of SPD602 at 16 mg/kg at start of treatment on Day 1 and at the clinic visit on Day 2. PK blood samples were collected as follows: Pre-dose on Day 1 (within 60 minutes prior to investigational product administration) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 hours (±3 minutes) and 24 hours (±30 minutes) post-dose. Plasma concentrations of SPD602 were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The PK parameters were determined from plasma concentration-time data for SPD602 (total) by non-compartmental analysis.</description>

        <description>The pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of SPD602 were measured in plasma of all patients following a single capsule dose of SPD602 at 16 mg/kg at start of treatment on Day 1 and at the clinic visit on Day 2. PK blood samples were collected as follows: Pre-dose on Day 1 (within 60 minutes prior to investigational product administration) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 hours (±3 minutes) and 24 hours (±30 minutes) post-dose. Plasma concentrations of SPD602 were determined using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The PK parameters were determined from plasma concentration-time data for SPD602 (total) by non-compartmental analysis.</description>
