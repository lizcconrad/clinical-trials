      Genzyme will evaluate/monitor the off label transplant use of plerixafor using data in the
      European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry. Off-label use of
      plerixafor will be collected for data entered over a 5 year time span (i.e., data entered
      into the registry between the date of European Union (EU) marketing authorization [31 July
      2009] and 31 July 2014).

      The EBMT is a non-profit, scientific society representing more than 600 transplant centers
      mainly in Europe. The EBMT promotes all activity aiming to improve stem cell transplantation
      or cellular therapy, which includes registering all the activity relating to stem cell
      transplants. Data are entered, managed, and maintained in a central database with internet
      access; each EBMT center is represented in this database.

      The collection by the EBMT registry of reasons for the off-label transplant use of plerixafor
      shall provide information of a substantial number of patients who are representative of the
      patient population receiving plerixafor off-label.

          -  Routes of plerixafor administration other than subcutaneous

          -  Patients whose cells do not mobilize poorly

          -  Other

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults diagnosed with lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM) and have been treated with
             plerixafor according to the European Union (EU) label.
