  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most individuals with major depressive disorder manifest clinically significant agitation.
      Concurrent agitation in a depressed individual is associated with an intensification of mood
      symptoms, decreased probability of recovery, increased recurrence risk, suicidality, and
      increased medical-service utilization. The occurrence of anxiety/agitation phenomenology in
      the depressed patient often invites the need for augmentation strategies (e.g. atypical
      antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, etc.) and complicated polypharmacy regimens. Moreover,
      individuals with major depressive disorder often report worsening of symptom severity,
      irritability, hostility, dysphoria, and significant subjective distress (This response
      pattern is similar to individuals with bipolar disorder).

      Results from large research studies provide evidence indicating that quetiapine is capable of
      offering clinically significant multidimensional symptom relief in bipolar depression.
      Moreover, results from several trials in major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety
      disorder have established the efficacy of quetiapine therapy for unipolar depression and
      anxiety syndromes. So far, no atypical antipsychotic agent has been evaluated specifically
      for the treatment of agitated depression.

      In this study, it is hypothesized that persons with major depressive disorder and prominent
      agitation (i.e. agitated depression) will exhibit a more favourable response and tolerability
      profile to quetiapine XR when compared to escitalopram.
