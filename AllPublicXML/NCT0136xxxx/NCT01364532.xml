  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transradial route is increasingly used as an access site in percutaneous coronary
      interventions, as it is considered equivalent to transfemoral approach in terms of efficacy
      but with a decreased vascular complication risk. Information concerning the efficacy and
      safety of transulnar approach is sparse. This is a prospective, randomized,
      investigator-initiated study to compare transradial versus transulnar approach as a default
      strategy for coronary angiography, ad-hoc or elective percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI). Consecutive eligible patients with an indication for coronary angiography, will be
      randomized after written informed consent in a 1:1 ratio to either transradial or transulnar
      access. Assessment of angiographic and procedural characteristics(including amount of
      contrast medium, arterial access, fluoroscopy and procedural time), as well as any vascular
      or other peri-procedural complications of the cases enrolled, will be performed. After
      hospital discharge, all patients will return at Day 60 ±5 days for Doppler ultrasound
      assessment of the forearm vessels and documentation of major adverse cardiovascular events
      (defined as death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization and stroke.
      Coronary angiography patients will be additionally randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 2500
      or 5000 IU of unfractioned heparin.

    <description>MACEs are considered both vascular and coronary ischemic complications. Vascular complications include arterial occlusion, local arterial perforation, compartment syndrome, pseudoaneurysm, fistula formation, major bleeding, hematoma of at least 10cm length, or any vascular damage requiring prolonged hospitalization or intervention.
Coronary ishcemic complications include cardiac death, non fatal myocardial infarction, urgent repeat revascularization and stroke.</description>
