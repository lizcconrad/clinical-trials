  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive condition that harms nerve cells of the brain
      (neurodegeneration). Current treatments for Parkinson's disease (including levodopa and deep
      brain stimulation) improve certain symptoms but are not thought to improve the underlying
      neurodegenerative disease process (they are not a &quot;cure&quot;). The cause of Parkinson's disease
      is unknown. However, some evidence suggests that tiny structures in the investigators cells
      called &quot;mitochondria&quot; might be involved. Mitochondria are the powerhouses that produce fuel
      for the investigators cells. Failure of these 'powerhouses' to supply the energy needs of
      certain nerve cells might lead to Parkinson's disease. Preliminary evidence suggests that a
      food called 'ketones' might be able to enhance the function of mitochondria and improve
      Parkinson's disease symptoms and possibly even the neurodegenerative process. In this study,
      the investigators would like to investigate this possibility by giving patients with
      Parkinson's disease dietary supplements of 'ketone esters' in a drink. The investigators will
      then assess if this improves symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

      The study design is a prospective, double blinded, randomised, controlled trial.
