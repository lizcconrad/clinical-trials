    <measure>Change From Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) to Week 14 in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score for the Efficacy Sample.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS consists of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the &quot;best&quot; rating and 6 being the &quot;worst&quot; rating. The MADRS total score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60. The MADRS total score will be un-evaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items are recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items are recorded, the MADRS total score will be the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded to the first decimal place.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS is a self-rated instrument used to measure the effect of the patient's symptoms on work/school, social life, and family/home responsibilities. For each of the three items, scores range from 0 through 10. The number most representative of how much each area was disrupted by symptoms is marked along the line from 0 = not at all, to 10 = extremely. For the work/school item, no response was to be entered if the patient did not work or go to school for reasons unrelated to the disorder and a response therefore not being applicable. The Mean SDS Score will be calculated over the three item scores. All three item scores need to be available with the exception of the work/school item score when this item is not applicable.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14</time_frame>
    <description>The IDS-SR consists of 30 items, all rated on a 0 to 3 scale with 0 being the &quot;best&quot; rating and 3 being the &quot;worst&quot; rating. Besides item 9, two sub-items 9A and 9B exist, with possible scores of 1, 2 or 3 for item 9A, and 0 or 1 for item 9B. The scores for these two sub-items are not included in the calculation of the total score. Item 11 or item 12 should be completed but not both, and similarly, item 13 or item 14 should be completed but not both. Should items 11 and 12 be rated both, then the maximum of the two scores will be used. The same approach will be used for handling items 13 and 14.
The IDS-SR total score is the sum of ratings of 28 item scores. The possible IDS-SR total score ranges from 0 to 84.</description>

            <groups_desc>The primary analysis was performed on the Efficacy Sample by fitting a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analysis with an unstructured variance covariance structure in which the change from the end of Phase A (Week 8) in MADRS Total Score (at Weeks 9 to 14) was the dependent variable. The model included fixed class effect terms for treatment, trial site, visit week, and an interaction term of treatment by visit week.</groups_desc>

        <description>The MADRS consists of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the &quot;best&quot; rating and 6 being the &quot;worst&quot; rating. The MADRS total score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60. The MADRS total score will be un-evaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items are recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items are recorded, the MADRS total score will be the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded to the first decimal place.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) to Week 14 in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Score for the Efficacy Sample.</title>
        <description>The SDS is a self-rated instrument used to measure the effect of the patient’s symptoms on work/school, social life, and family/home responsibilities. For each of the three items, scores range from 0 through 10. The number most representative of how much each area was disrupted by symptoms is marked along the line from 0 = not at all, to 10 = extremely. For the work/school item, no response was to be entered if the patient did not work or go to school for reasons unrelated to the disorder and a response therefore not being applicable. The Mean SDS Score will be calculated over the three item scores. All three item scores need to be available with the exception of the work/school item score when this item is not applicable.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) to Week 14 in MADRS Total Score by Trial Week for the Efficacy Sample Per the Final Protocol.</title>
        <description>The MADRS consists of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the &quot;best&quot; rating and 6 being the &quot;worst&quot; rating. The MADRS total score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60. The MADRS total score will be un-evaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items are recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items are recorded, the MADRS total score will be the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded to the first decimal place.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) to Week 14 in Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Scale Score for the Efficacy Sample.</title>
        <description>Items on CGI-S scale are: 0 = not assessed, 1 = normal, not at all ill, 2 = borderline mentally ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, 7 = among the most extremely ill patients. The score 0 (= not assessed) will be set to missing. The CGI-S is therefore a 7-point scale from 1 through 7.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) to Week 14 in the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (Self-Report) (IDS-SR) Total Score for the Efficacy Sample.</title>
        <description>The IDS-SR consists of 30 items, all rated on a 0 to 3 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 3 being the “worst” rating. Besides item 9, two sub-items 9A and 9B exist, with possible scores of 1, 2 or 3 for item 9A, and 0 or 1 for item 9B. The scores for these two sub-items are not included in the calculation of the total score. Item 11 or item 12 should be completed but not both, and similarly, item 13 or item 14 should be completed but not both. Should items 11 and 12 be rated both, then the maximum of the two scores will be used. The same approach will be used for handling items 13 and 14.
The IDS-SR total score is the sum of ratings of 28 item scores. The possible IDS-SR total score ranges from 0 to 84.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) to Week 14 in the IDS-SR Total Score for the Efficacy Sample Per the Final Protocol.</title>
        <description>The IDS-SR consists of 30 items, all rated on a 0 to 3 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 3 being the “worst” rating. Besides item 9, two sub-items 9A and 9B exist, with possible scores of 1, 2 or 3 for item 9A, and 0 or 1 for item 9B. The scores for these two sub-items are not included in the calculation of the total score. Item 11 or item 12 should be completed but not both, and similarly, item 13 or item 14 should be completed but not both. Should items 11 and 12 be rated both, then the maximum of the two scores will be used. The same approach will be used for handling items 13 and 14.
The IDS-SR total score is the sum of ratings of 28 item scores. The possible IDS-SR total score ranges from 0 to 84.</description>

        <description>The SDS is a self-rated instrument used to measure the effect of the patient’s symptoms on work/school, social life, and family/home responsibilities. For each of the three items, scores range from 0 through 10. The number most representative of how much each area was disrupted by symptoms is marked along the line from 0 = not at all, to 10 = extremely. For the work/school item, no response was to be entered if the patient did not work or go to school for reasons unrelated to the disorder and a response therefore not being applicable. The Mean SDS Score will be calculated over the three item scores. All three item scores need to be available with the exception of the work/school item score when this item is not applicable.</description>

The Mean SDS Score will be calculated over the three item scores. All three item scores need to be available with the exception of the work/school item score when this item is not applicable.</description>

Eight items are rated on a 0 to 2 scale (items 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17), while nine items (items 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 15) are rated on a 0 to 4 scale (twice the weight of the other items). For all of these items, 0 is the “best” rating and the highest score (2 or 4) is the “worst” rating. The sum of the scores from the first 17 items; 0-7 =Normal; 8-13 =mild depression; 14-18 =moderate depression; 19-22 =severe depression; ≥23 =very severe depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 52, with higher score indicating worse depressive symptoms.</description>

        <description>The HAM-A is utilized for the evaluation of anxiety symptoms. The HAM-A consists of 14 items. Each item is rated on a 0 to 4 scale. For all of these items, 0 is the “best” rating and 4 is the “worst” rating. If no item scores are missing, then the HAM-A total score is the sum of all 14 item scores. The possible total scores are from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating worse anxiety symptoms.</description>
