      The goal of this study of this study is to test the acceptability and usefulness of certain
      home-based health care devices for people who have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer or
      other abnormal growth of tissue in the pancreas.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 50 patients who are scheduled to have pancreatic
      surgery will take part in the pancreas study. The pancreas study is one of many smaller
      studies that, when added together, will enroll up to 290 participants at MD Anderson.

    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete physical fitness tests,
      questionnaires, and training sessions at 4 different time points:

        -  Before surgery, either during your clinic visit or by phone (Baseline). This session
           will take about 75 minutes.

        -  During your post-discharge clinic visit following surgery (time point 2), the study
           staff will meet you at your clinic appointment. This session will take about 30 minutes.

        -  During your first appointment after surgery (time point 3), the study staff will meet
           you at your clinic appointment. This session will take about 45 minutes.

        -  During your second appointment after surgery (time point 4), the study staff will meet
           you at your clinic appointment. This session will take about 45 minutes.

      If you are physically able, you will also take part in nutrition and exercise programs that
      include strengthening exercises and walking. Additionally, you will wear 2 activity monitors;
      and at night, you will use a weight scale and an electronic reporting system to provide
      information about your physical activity, symptoms, and appetite.

      A study staff member will get approval from your doctor or a doctor specializing in physical
      medicine and rehabilitation before you begin either exercise program (walking or strength)
      described in this study.

      At-Home Device Use and Electronic Reporting System:

      Below is more information about the devices and reporting system you will use or wear during
      the study:

        -  You will wear a Fitbit monitor on your wrist all day and night starting from the day you
           receive the monitor (up to 4 weeks before your surgery) until your final study visit
           (Time point 4). You authorize the research staff to receive the data from your Fitbit
           starting at the date of your study enrollment and ending once you have completed the
           study. When you complete the study, this Fitbit will be yours to keep.

        -  You will receive a second activity monitor to wear on your waist for 7 days beginning at
           your post-discharge clinic visit following surgery. After the 7 days, you will return
           this monitor using a postage-paid envelope provided to you.

        -  You will receive a weight scale to weigh yourself each day starting the day after your
           post-discharge clinic visit following surgery and ending with your final study visit
           (time point 4). You will return the scale to us at the final study visit.

      At the end of each day and before you go to bed, you will weigh yourself and use an
      electronic reporting system to report your physical activity, symptoms and desire to eat. You
      will choose 1 of 2 ways to report this information to us: by email or by using an application
      that is uploaded to your personal phone. This should take about 3 minutes each day.

      Nutrition:

      A registered dietitian (RD) will be monitoring responses from your daily electronic reports.
      If any report indicates that your appetite is unusually poor, the RD will contact you to
      provide nutrition counseling aimed at improving your food and nutrient intake. The length of
      each session will be determined by your need for this counseling.

      At-Home Exercise Program:

      A rehabilitation specialist and other study staff will teach you about your exercise program.
      An MD Anderson rehabilitation doctor will oversee this training.

      At your first clinic visit after you are discharged from the hospital, research staff will
      discuss your walking program with you. The program will consist of walking briskly for 20-30
      minutes per day at least 5 times each week until your final study visit (time point 4). If
      you are unable to walk at a brisk pace, you will be asked to walk at a slower pace.

      During the post-op visit 1 (time point 3), research staff will discuss your strengthening
      exercise program with you. The strengthening exercises will be done using resistance bands.
      You will be asked to perform these exercises for 30 minutes at least 2 times a week. You also
      will be asked to perform an additional 5 minutes of stretching exercises each time to help
      prevent soreness. Strengthening certain muscle groups will help with upper body control and
      balance, which the study team believes may help with your ability to move before and after
      surgery. Also, strengthening the shoulder, back, and leg muscles is important for activities
      like getting into and out of bed, which is important after pancreas surgery.

      Physical Fitness Tests:

      Your strength will be checked using a hand-held grip test. Your walking speed will be checked
      with a 6-minute walking test. You will perform 3 other tests to check the function of your
      lower body. Those tests will check your balance, walking speed, and your ability to stand
      from a seated position. All of these tests will be done 3 times: (1) Baseline, (2) time point
      3, and (3) time point 4.

      Questionnaires:

      You will be asked to complete questionnaires about your physical ability, health, and
      quality-of-life 3 times: (1) Baseline, (2) time point 3, and (3) time point 4. Answering
      these questionnaires should take about 20 minutes each time. About 1 week after you leave the
      hospital for your surgery, you will again complete the physical ability and quality-of-life
      questionnaires. This should take about 10 minutes. You will be asked to re-take the
      quality-of-life questionnaire 7-10 days after 3 of the 4 time-points noted above (you will
      not retake that questionnaire after the first time point). This will take about 7-10 minutes
      each time.

      You will also asked to complete a questionnaire about the usefulness of the devices you use
      at home. You will complete this questionnaire 2 times: the first will be 1 week after you
      start using the weight scale and the second will be at time point 4.

      Lean Body Mass Assessment:

      If computerized tomography (CT) scans are performed as part of your routine medical care, the
      study staff will look at 3 of those scans to estimate your lean body mass. If available, the
      study staff will also look at your CT scans at 3 time points: (1) Baseline, (2) time point 3,
      and (3) time point 4.

      Equipment Provided to You:

      During the study, you will be issued a Fitbit wrist monitor, a second activity monitor, a
      weight scale, and exercise bands. When you complete the study, you will keep the Fitbit wrist
      monitor and the exercise bands. You will return the second activity monitor to the study team
      about 7 days after it is issued to you. You will return the weight scale to study team at the
      end of the study.

      Other Medical Information:

      Information from your medical record will be collected and stored in an electronic
      password-protected research database, which will be accessible only by research staff.

      Length of Study:

      You will begin this study prior to your pancreas surgery, which may be up to 4 weeks before
      that surgery. You will continue the device use, exercise and nutrition programs, and
      evaluations for up to 3-7 months after your surgery. If you have a side effect or the disease
      gets worse, the study team will decide if continuing the exercise program is in your best
      interest.
