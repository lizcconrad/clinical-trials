  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to provide novel information on the feasibility of yoga interventions for
      secondary symptoms related to severe vision loss, such as sleep disturbances, negative mood
      states, fall risk and balance. This information will be important for determining safe,
      cost-effective and reliable practices for the benefits of yoga as an alternative means for
      improved health and well-being. A yoga intervention that is integrative and evidence-based
      will benefit the blind population through effective treatments and prevention of secondary
      symptoms as well as serve to inform rehabilitation specialists, educators, and clinicians in
      the future.
