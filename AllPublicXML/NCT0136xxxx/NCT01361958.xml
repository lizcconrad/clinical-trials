  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of several doses of NOMAC in
      combination with E2 to inhibit ovulation and to assess changes in the gonadotropin and
      ovarian hormone profiles, in comparison to a control cycle in healthy-volunteer premenopausal
      women.

      The study was also designed to check whether the combined administration of E2 and NOMAC at
      the dose of 2.5 mg daily induces any changes in the effects of the progestin compared to when
      it is given alone.
