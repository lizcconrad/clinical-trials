      This study is being done to evaluate the use of a new technology (urine proteomics) - the
      study of proteins in the urine to identify urine markers of overactive bladder (OAB) from a
      simple voided urine specimen.

      The objectives of the study are:

        1. to improve the diagnosis of overactive bladder using a non-invasive technology (urine
           proteomics) and

        2. to study how potential urine biomarkers changes with overactive bladder symptoms after
           patients have been treated with fesoterodine, an FDA approved drug for the treatment of
           overactive bladder.

    <measure>Bladder Diary to Assess Urinary Frequency at Baseline and at End of 6-week Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome measure was assessed at baseline and at the end of the 6-week treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Overactive bladder subjects filled out a 3-day bladder diary before starting Fesoterodine and another 3-day bladder diary at the end of taking 6 weeks of Fesoterodine. The bladder diary was used to assess urinary frequency. The average number of urinations (frequency) per day over a period of 3 days before the start of medication and at the end of 6 weeks of medication were compared for each subject and then as a group.</description>

    <measure>Bladder Diary (Using Urinary Sensation Scale Found in Bladder Diary) to Assess Urinary Urgency at Baseline and at 6-week Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome measure was assesses at baseline and at the end of the 6-week treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>The Urinary Sensation Scale found in the bladder diary given to subjects was used to assess urinary urgency. The Urinary Sensation Scale was filled out by the subject for 3 days before starting Fesoterodine and filled out again for 3 days at the end of taking 6 weeks of Fesoterodine. The scale ranges from 1 (no feeling of urgency), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe) to 5 (unable to hold; leak urine). The urgency scale with the most check marks per day over a period of 3 days before start of medication was averaged for each subject. The urgency scale with the most check marks per day over a period of 3 days at the end of taking 6 weeks of medication was averaged for each subject. Then, the average before start of medication for all subjects and the average at the end of taking 6 weeks of medication for all subjects were compared.</description>

    <measure>Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) to Assess Bother From Urinary Frequency at Baseline and at 6 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome measure was assessed at baseline and after the 6 week visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Overactive Bladder subjects answered the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) before starting Fesoterodine and at the end of taking 6 weeks of Fesoterodine. The OAB-q consists of 8 questions asking how bothered subject was in the past 4 weeks. Questions # 1 (Frequent urination during the daytime hours?); #5 (Nighttime urination?) and #6 (Waking up at night because you have to urinate?) are asking about frequency. Choices of answers are: 1 (Not at all); 2 (A little bit); 3 (Somewhat); 4 (Quite a bit); 5 (A great deal) 6 (A very great deal). Multiple responses to the questionnaire were averaged for each participant at baseline and at 6 weeks and then all participants' answers were totaled and averaged at baseline and at 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>Overactive bladder subjects answered the Overactive Bladder questionnaire (OAB-q) before starting Fesoterodine and at the end of taking 6 weeks of Fesoterodine. The OAB-q consists of 8 questions asking how bothered subject was in the past 4 weeks. Questions #2 (An uncomfortable urge to urinate?); #3 (A sudden urge to urinate with little or no warning?); #4 (Accidental loss of small amounts of urine?); #7 (An uncontrollable urge to urinate?); #8 (Urine loss associated with a strong desire to urinate?) are asking about urgency. Choices for answers are: 1 (Not at all); 2 (A little bit); 3 (Somewhat); 4 (Quite a bit); 5 (A great deal); 6 (A very great deal). Multiple responses to the questionnaire was averaged per participant at baseline and at 6 weeks and then all participants answers were totaled and then averaged at baseline and at 6 weeks.</description>

        <title>Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) to Assess Bother From Urinary Frequency at Baseline and at 6 Weeks.</title>
        <description>Overactive Bladder subjects answered the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) before starting Fesoterodine and at the end of taking 6 weeks of Fesoterodine. The OAB-q consists of 8 questions asking how bothered subject was in the past 4 weeks. Questions # 1 (Frequent urination during the daytime hours?); #5 (Nighttime urination?) and #6 (Waking up at night because you have to urinate?) are asking about frequency. Choices of answers are: 1 (Not at all); 2 (A little bit); 3 (Somewhat); 4 (Quite a bit); 5 (A great deal) 6 (A very great deal). Multiple responses to the questionnaire were averaged for each participant at baseline and at 6 weeks and then all participants' answers were totaled and averaged at baseline and at 6 weeks.</description>

        <description>The Urinary Sensation Scale found in the bladder diary given to subjects was used to assess urinary urgency. The Urinary Sensation Scale was filled out by the subject for 3 days before starting Fesoterodine and filled out again for 3 days at the end of taking 6 weeks of Fesoterodine. The scale ranges from 1 (no feeling of urgency), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe) to 5 (unable to hold; leak urine). The urgency scale with the most check marks per day over a period of 3 days before start of medication was averaged for each subject. The urgency scale with the most check marks per day over a period of 3 days at the end of taking 6 weeks of medication was averaged for each subject. Then, the average before start of medication for all subjects and the average at the end of taking 6 weeks of medication for all subjects were compared.</description>
