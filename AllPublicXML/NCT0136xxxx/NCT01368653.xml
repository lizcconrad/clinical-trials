  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trials tests whether a new treatment designed to help smokers prepare to quit
      smoking by practicing quitting several times helps more smokers quit and stay quit than
      standard treatment with nicotine patch and smoking cessation counseling. The practice
      quitting treatment being tested involves quitting for progressively longer periods of time
      tailored to individual patterns of smoking. This clinical trial will also test whether
      non-nicotine cigarettes can help smokers become smoke free after slipping during a stop
      smoking attempt.

      -  Participants in this study are randomized to one of two treatments conditions prior to a
           target quit date.

             -  One-half of participants will be randomly assigned to receive standard smoking
                cessation treatment comprising a 6-week supply of 21-mg nicotine patches and 4
                individual smoking cessation counseling sessions.

             -  The other one-half of participants will be randomly assigned to receive standard
                treatment (patch and counseling, as above) plus to practice quitting 7 times over
                the 2.5 weeks leading up to a quit attempt. Practice quitting will involve not
                smoking for a period of time tailored to each individual's smoking pattern.

        -  All participants are asked to attend a 2-hour orientation session, complete 8 brief
           (5-minute) telephone calls and 9 longer(20-minute) telephone surveys over 3.5 weeks,
           attend a 30-minute office visit, and complete two 15-minute follow-up calls.

        -  All participants are also asked to report on their emotions, thoughts, and behaviors 3
           times per day for 24 days using cellular telephones.

        -  Participants receive compensation for office visits, study telephone calls, cellular
           telephone reports, and follow-up interviews.

        -  All participants will receive nicotine patches and one-on-one counseling (delivered over
           the phone and in person).

        -  Some participants will be eligible for a second phase of treatment after a 4-week
           follow-up interview.

             -  One-half of people eligible for this phase of the study will be randomly assigned
                to receive a supply of non-nicotine cigarettes to smoke for up to 6 weeks. The
                non-nicotine cigarettes are designed to help break the habit of smoking and to help
                smokers return to being smoke-free after smoking regular cigarettes.

             -  The other one-half of eligible smokers will be randomly assigned to not receive
                these non-nicotine cigarettes.

             -  All smokers eligible for this phase of the study will be asked to complete cellular
                telephone reports about their mood, thoughts, and behaviors for 14 days beginning
                4.5 weeks after a target stop-smoking date. Compensation will be provided for
                completing these cellular telephone phone reports.

    <measure>4-week Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>7-day point prevalence abstinence captures whether participants have used tobacco in the past 7 days at the 4-week post-quit follow-up (i.e., whether any tobacco use occurred in the 4th week of the quit attempt).</description>

    <measure>10-week Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This captures whether any tobacco use occurred in the past 7 days at the 10-week follow up (i.e., whether any tobacco use occurred in the 10th week of the quit attempt), as reported by participants in a timeline follow-back telephone interview and confirmed by a follow-up expired carbon monoxide reading less than or equal to 8 parts per million.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mediators of Treatment Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week post-quit and 6 weeks post-quit</time_frame>
    <description>Emotional, mental, and behavioral measures that may help explain treatment effects on tobacco use outcomes will be assessed intensively in the three weeks leading up to a quit attempt and the first week of a quit attempt to examine mediators of the first phase treatment. Additional analyses of reports of emotions, thoughts, and behaviors will explore mediators of non-nicotine cigarette effects on smoking. These measures will be analyzed to see if treatment affects them and if they predict smoking behavior.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prolonged Abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measures whether regular smoking (7 days in a row) occurred between the 4th and 10th weeks of the quit attempt.</description>

Additional analyses of reports of emotions, thoughts, and behaviors will explore mediators of non-nicotine cigarette effects on smoking. These measures will be analyzed to see if treatment affects them and if they predict smoking behavior.</description>

In this condition, smokers received a 6-week supply of cigarettes that contained tobacco with very low levels of nicotine (in regular or menthol flavors) to smoke instead of regular cigarettes containing nicotine. This treatment was designed to help people stop smoking after slipping (returning to smoking) during an attempt to stop smoking
Very low nicotine cigarettes: Tobacco cigarettes containing very low levels of nicotine (.016-.019 mg in smoke from the cigarettes). These were to be smoked no more often than a smoker normally smokes regular cigarettes and for no longer than 6 weeks.</description>
