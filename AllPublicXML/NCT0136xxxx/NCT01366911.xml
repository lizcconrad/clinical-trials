  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to provide preliminary data of the association between bone mineral
      denity adjacent to acetabular implants, as measured by quanitative computed tomography (QCT),
      at least 2 years post Total Hip Arthoplasty (THA) surgery with Mesechymal stem cell assays,
      obtained at time of surgery, and to begin to evaluate if stem cells can predict orthopaedic
      surgical outcomes.

      Subjects who have undergone a THA and who previously consented to &quot;Stem Cell Quality Assays:
      Correlation with Aging/Health&quot; study which used excess bone marrow and blood samples to
      complete stem cell assay labs will be invited back at least 2 years post THA to complete
      bilateral hip x-rays, if not already completed as part of routine medical follow up plus a
      QCT bone density testing and to complete a questionnaire regarding smoking, alcohol and
      exercise history along with recording BMIs.

      This ability to identify older individuals with compromised stem cell function could offer
      opportunities to develop and test new preventative and therapeutic strategies to improve
      outcomes.

    <description>Bone mineral density adjacent to acetabular implants will be evaluated using QCT which can show early bony changes, which can provide information about the quality of implant fixation and surrounding bone adaption. X-rays will evaluate component loosening, wear, alignmet and osteolytis. Patient characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Spearman correlation coefficients will be used to assess the association of Mesenchymal stem cell assays and bone density findings.</description>
