  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute pain management is challenging in patients after spinal fusions, particularly since
      most have taken analgesics for prolonged periods before choosing the surgical alternative.
      Many of these patients are either preoperatively or become after surgery narcotic dependent.
      In addition, the narcotic based anesthetic required for the procedure, may induce a
      postoperative hyper-analgesia which may be partially responsible for the acute postoperative
      pain which is refractory to traditional doses of narcotics. Both the persistent nociceptive
      and neuropathic pain which these patients experience and narcotic-induced hyper-analgesia is
      mediated via non-conventional neural pathways. It is for these reasons, that in these
      patients postoperative pain is refractory to narcotic treatment. Postoperative pain in this
      situation is best managed using a multimodal approach. This technique allows the application
      of a number of treatment modalities which maximize pain reduction and minimize treatment side
      effects.

      Pregabalin (Lyrica) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
      Pregabalin has a similar mechanism of action as gabapentin. Notably it has a rapid consistent
      absorption, linear pharmacokinetics, and a low potential for pharmacokinetic drug
      interactions. Hence, pregabalin should be a beneficial addition to the multi-modal pain
      regimen after spinal surgery; particularly in narcotic tolerant patients who respond poorly
      to conventional narcotic analgesics after surgery.

      The treatment of postoperative pain continues to be a challenge, particularly after posterior
      spinal fusions. Many of these patients have been treated with analgesics or other modalities
      for prolonged periods before choosing the surgical alternative. In addition, the
      narcotic-based anesthetic required for the procedure may induce postoperative
      hyper-analgesia. Inadequate treatment of this pain can result in prolonged hospitalization,
      cardiopulmonary complications, and poor surgical outcome. However, the narcotic treatment of
      pain is often associated with multiple adverse effects. Multimodal postoperative analgesia
      has been instituted to reduce pain while limiting the adverse side effects of opioids.
      Pregabalin has been shown to be efficacious in the management of chronic pain syndromes with
      limited adverse side effects. Hence, multiple studies have attempted to demonstrate the
      benefits of including pregabalin in multimodal postoperative pain management. These studies
      have yielded conflicting results with regard to reduced pain, opioid consumption, and
      improved outcome. We propose that the addition of pregabalin to acute pain regimen after
      posterior spinal fusions should reduce narcotic requirements and hence improve outcome by
      reducing narcoticinduced side effects. Although recent studies have also examined the
      administration of pregabalin after spinal fusions, this study was conducted with a uniform
      anesthetic regimen and similar procedure performed by two spine surgeons at one institution.
      Pain scores were controlled as well as physical therapy milestones to assess whether changes
      in the pain regimen would affect narcotic consumption, narcotic induced side effects, and
      length of hospitalization.

          <description>Patients in the control group will receive a placebo tablet with a sip of water one hour prior to surgery and a placebo tablet twice a day for a total of two weeks.
Postoperative pain will be assessed daily until discharge using a verbal Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at rest and during physical therapy, by both physical therapists and blinded research assistants.
All narcotics (i.v. PCA, oral or IM/SQ rescue doses) will be tabulated during their hospital stay, and patients will be asked to document their oral narcotic use after discharge.
On the day of discharge, patients will be given a self report data sheet, in which they will be asked to record their daily pain level at rest, with movement, and whether their pain interfered with sleep.
Placebo: Patients will first receive two capsules of the placebo drug (with no active ingredients per dose) one hour before surgery. Patients will continue taking two capsules per day until POD 14.</description>
