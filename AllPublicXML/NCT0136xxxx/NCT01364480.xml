  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using two
      NeuroPort Arrays (electrodes) for long-term recording of brain activity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with tetraplegia (paralysis caused by illness or injury that results in partial
      or total loss of use of the arms and legs) have intact brain function but are unable to move
      due to injury or disease affecting the spinal cord, nerves or muscles. Brain-machine
      interface (BMI) technology is based on the finding that with intact brain function, neural
      signals are generated even though they are not sent to the arms, hands and legs. By
      implanting electrodes in the brain, individuals can be trained to send neural signals which
      are interpreted by a computer and translated to movement which can then be used to control a
      variety of devices or computer displays.
