  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess health-related Quality of Life (QoL) changes in
      participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT)
      undergoing hemodialysis and receiving paricalcitol intravenous (iv).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The scientific purpose of this study is to obtain data on the use of paricalcitol iv in
      real-life clinical practice and the effect it has on participant health-related QoL. In this
      study, paricalcitol iv will be prescribed on an on-label basis in an everyday setting. The
      RAND 36-Item Health Survey results will be collected for a 6-month period (every 3 months) in
      order to assess the effect of paricalcitol iv on participant health-related QoL.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 6 Months Post-enrollment in RAND 36-Item Health Survey 'Physical Functioning' Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey questionnaire is self-completed by the participant and includes 36 questions that assess 8 different scales, including physical functioning. The scores for each scale range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the worst possible state of physical functioning and 100 representing the best possible state of physical functioning. Baseline was 10 to 35 days prior to starting treatment with paricalcitol iv; enrollment was at least 1 month after starting treatment with paricalcitol iv. The change from baseline to the 6-month post-enrollment visit was calculated as the 6-month post-enrollment visit score minus the baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 6 Months Post-enrollment in RAND 36-Item Health Survey 'Physical Functioning' Scale Scores</title>
        <description>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey questionnaire is self-completed by the participant and includes 36 questions that assess 8 different scales, including physical functioning. The scores for each scale range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the worst possible state of physical functioning and 100 representing the best possible state of physical functioning. Baseline was 10 to 35 days prior to starting treatment with paricalcitol iv; enrollment was at least 1 month after starting treatment with paricalcitol iv. The change from baseline to the 6-month post-enrollment visit was calculated as the 6-month post-enrollment visit score minus the baseline score.</description>

          <description>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey questionnaire is self-completed by the participant and includes 36 questions that assess 8 different scales, including energy/fatigue. The scores for each scale range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the worst possible score and 100 representing the best possible score. Baseline was 10 to 35 days prior to starting treatment with paricalcitol iv; enrollment was at least 1 month after starting treatment with paricalcitol iv. The change from baseline to the 6-month post-enrollment visit was calculated as the 6-month post-enrollment visit score minus the baseline score.</description>

        <description>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey questionnaire is self-completed by the participant and includes a single question pertaining to the participant's health change over the last year. The scores range from 0 to 100, with 100: much better than 1 year ago; 75: somewhat better than 1 year ago; 50: about the same; 25: somewhat worse than 1 year ago; 0: much worse than 1 year ago. Baseline was 10 to 35 days prior to starting treatment with paricalcitol iv; enrollment was at least 1 month after starting treatment with paricalcitol iv. The change from baseline to the 6-month post-enrollment visit was calculated as the 6-month post-enrollment visit score minus the baseline score.</description>

        <description>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey questionnaire is self-completed by the participant and includes 36 questions that assess 8 different scales (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, bodily pain, general health perception, health change). Baseline was 10 to 35 days prior to starting treatment with paricalcitol iv; enrollment was at least 1 month after starting treatment with paricalcitol iv. The change from baseline to the enrollment and post-enrollment visits was calculated as the visit score minus the baseline score. Linear models based on Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to assess the effect of time on change from baseline through enrollment, 3 months post-enrollment, and 6 months post-enrollment.</description>
