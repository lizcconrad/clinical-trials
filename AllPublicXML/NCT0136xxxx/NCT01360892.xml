  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center cohort study in which the Real-time Tissue Elastography® measurements
      will predict prospectively the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, the incidence and
      severity of gastroesophageal varices ascites and decompensated cirrhosis in hepatitis B or C
      patients.

      The aim of this study is to validate the predictive value of Real-time Tissue Elastography®
      by comparison with serum marker or FibroScan® in chronic hepatitis B or C patients.

      Every year and for three years, we performed Real-time Tissue Elastography®, blood sampling,
      gastrointestinal endoscopy. If in the hospital they can perform FibroScan®, FobroScan® also
      be performed.

      Subjects were also performed ultrasonography (US), computed sonography (CT) or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) evry four or six months.

      The time between the Real-time Tissue Elastography®, blood sampling, gastrointestinal
      endoscopy and FiroScan® must not exceed four weeks.

        Subjects with chronic hepatitis B or C will be eligible for the study. Subjects with other
        infectious viral diseases or chronic liver disease are excluded for study enrollment.

        Real-time Tissue Elastography®, serum maker and gastrointestinal endoscopy are performed.
        If in the hopsital they can perform FibroScan®, FobroScan® also be performed.

        The time between the Real-time Tissue Elastography®, blood sampling, FiroScan® must not
