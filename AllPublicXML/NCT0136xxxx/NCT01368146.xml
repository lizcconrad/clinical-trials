    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether contact sensitization occurs to the skin of
      normal healthy human subjects, by repetitive application of IV Clear™, Tegaderm CHG™ and
      Silicone Vehicle Control dressings.

      A single center, within-subject randomized study design in healthy adult subjects. Qualified
      subjects will complete three phases of the study (induction, rest and challenge).

      Data for irritation, adhesion and pain upon removal will be collected from the individual
      patch sites.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Irritation</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at induction phase (evaluated before reapplication; 9 applications over 3 weeks, reapplied after every 48 or 72 hrs) and challenge phase (single 48-hr application of test article to naive sites and evaluation 30 mins, 24 and 48 hrs post-removal</time_frame>
    <description>Irritation assessed at the induction phase will be scored on a Berger and Bowman Scale. Irritation assessed at the challenge phase will be scored on a defined scale measuring erythema reactions, ranging from no reaction to strong erythema.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adhesion</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at each 72 hour evaluation over three weeks, and once for a single 48-hour challenge application</time_frame>
    <description>Adhesion was scored as follows:
0 = no lift from skin (≥90% adherence)
= some edges only lifting from skin (≥75% to ˂90% adherence)
= less than half of the test article lifing (≥50% to ˂75% adherence)
= more than half of the test article lifing but not detached (≥25% to ˂50% adherence)
= test article detached (0% adherence)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain upon removal</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed by subjects at 72 hour evaluations over three weeks and a single 48-hour challenge application</time_frame>
    <description>Any pain experienced during removal will be rated on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain.</description>
