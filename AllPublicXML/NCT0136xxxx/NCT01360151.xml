  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, comparative control analysis. The investigators want to evaluate the
      aqueous humor levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in polypoidal choroidal
      vasculopathy and the effect of photodynamic therapy and combination treatment of photodynamic
      therapy and Lucentis (Ranibizumab)on the level of vascular endothelial growth factor.

  <detailed_description>

      To compare the effect of combination therapy of intravitreal injection of Lucentis™ and
      photodynamic therapy versus only photodynamic therapy on aqueous humor vascular endothelial
      growth factor level in polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy patients to establish the vascular
      endothelial growth factor expression after photodynamic therapy and the direct effect of
      Lucentis™ on this increased vascular endothelial growth factor level. Additionally the
      investigators want to examine the vascular endothelial growth factor , tumor necrosis factor
      alpha, interleukin-2, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 level of aqueous humor in symptomatic,
      active polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy patients.
