  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide patients who have received at least one islet
      transplant as a previous participant in a Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium (CIT)
      clinical trial with maintenance immunosuppressive medications and to collect information
      about the safety of the medications and islet function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After islet-cell transplantation in the CIT studies*, each subject receives maintenance
      immunosuppressive medications.

      The purpose of this protocol is to collect additional follow-up for safety and efficacy from
      CIT subjects with graft function after their completion in their CIT parent study. It is
      expected that most subjects will retain measurable islet function and, in the islet-alone
      studies, continue to receive immunosuppressive medications at the time of completing their
      CIT parent study.

      *CIT parent studies: CIT02 (NCT00464555), CIT03 (NCT00434850), CIT04 (NCT00468403), CIT05
      (NCT00468442), CIT06 (NCT00468117), and CIT07 (NCT00434811)

    <description>Subjects who received an islet-cell transplant for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) while enrolled in one of the Clinical Islet Transplantation (CIT) parent studies and continue to have islet graft function. All subjects will continue immunosuppressive medications under CIT08. Detailed follow-up evaluations including but not limited to islet function will occur on an annual basis.
The immunosuppressive medications (e.g., tacrolimus, sirolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], mycophenolic sodium) in this study are obtained by prescription unless provided by the study through the drug distributor. Generic brands are allowed, when available. Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis, insulin therapy, and other standard therapies will be provided per site-specific practices.</description>
