      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of treatment using a
      combination of drugs (entecavir and pegylated interferon) in children ages 3-&lt;18 years old
      with immunotolerant chronic hepatitis B.

      This multicenter, randomized, controlled study will be conducted by the pediatric centers
      within the National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)-sponsored
      Hepatitis B Research Network (HBRN). Children age 3-&lt;18 years with immunotolerant chronic
      hepatitis B (CHB) infection who fulfill the entry criteria will receive entecavir as
      monotherapy for 8 weeks and then combination therapy with entecavir and pegylated interferon
      by weekly subcutaneous injection until week 48. Children will be followed for 96 weeks which
      is 48 weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

      Assessment will be undertaken at baseline, weeks 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, &amp; 16, then every 4 weeks
      until week 48, and then at week 52, 56, 60, 72, 84 and 96. Data collected will describe
      baseline demographics, symptoms of liver disease, intercurrent illnesses, and findings on
      physical examination. Blood work will be drawn to measure markers of viral and liver disease
      status, assessment of drug adverse effects, and for research biospecimen banking.

      Participants will continue on therapy until week 48 and complete the full study follow-up
      protocol thereafter, including those who undergo seroconversion to anti-HBe or anti-HBs
      before reaching week 48. Participants who experience a sustained elevation of ALT will be
      eligible to receive treatment as recommended by their hepatologist and will continue to
      complete the study follow-up protocol. Participants who exhibit adverse effects of therapy
      will undergo dose adjustment or discontinuation of therapy as detailed in the protocol, and
      will continue to complete the study follow-up protocol.
