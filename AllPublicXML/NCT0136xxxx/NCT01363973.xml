  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD, swallowing dysfunction) is a major complaint following stroke.
      Despite its enormous impact on functional capacity, quality of life, and survival, OD is both
      underestimated and underdiagnosed as a cause of major nutritional and respiratory
      complications in stroke patients. A recent systematic review on the effects of rehabilitation
      therapy on OD concluded that although some positive effects were found, the number of studies
      was small, many of them had methodological problems and there was a need for further research
      using randomized controlled trials. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation was approved by the
      FDA as a treatment of dysphagia in June 2001 and is traditionally used to activate pharyngeal
      muscles through stimulation of peripheral motor nerves (neuromuscular electrical
      estimulation, NMES). However, their real effectiveness and safety in the treatment of
      dysphagia is still matter of discussion (Logemann Dysphagia 2007, Ludlow dysphagia 2007) and
      studies evaluating NMES therapy, present discordant results. On the other hand, in recent
      years, transcutaneous electrical stimulation is beginning to use as a sensory strategy
      (Gallas 2010), avoiding muscle contraction during the treatment.Our research strategy
      includes the assessment of the therapeutic effect of these two main strategies using
      transcutaneous electrical stimulation on swallow physiology and clinical outcomes of
      post-stroke dysphagic patients.
