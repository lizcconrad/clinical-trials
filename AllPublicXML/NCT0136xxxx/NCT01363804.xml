      This Phase 1, open-label, two-period, single-sequence study is designed to evaluate the
      effect of steady-state rifampin on the PK profile, safety, and tolerability of a single
      1.5-mg tivozanib dose. On Day 1 of the first period, subjects will receive a single 1.5 mg
      dose of tivozanib, and remain at the unit for at least 48 hours postdose followed by
      outpatient visits for PK sampling and safety assessments up to 3 weeks postdose. For Period
      2, subjects will be administered 600 mg of rifampin once daily (QD).for 6 days. On the 4th
      day of Period 2, 1.5mg of tivozanib will be administered with 600mg of rifampin. PK sampling
      will continue for 3-weeks postdose while the subjects continue to receive 600mg of rifampin
      daily. An end of study visit will be completed 1-week after the last dose of rifampin.

    <description>Tivozanib is a novel and potent pan-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against all 3 VEGFRs (VEGFR-1, -2, and -3). In nonclinical models and studies performed in humans, tivozanib has shown strong antiangiogenesis and antitumor activity.</description>
