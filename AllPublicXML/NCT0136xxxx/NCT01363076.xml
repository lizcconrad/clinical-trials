  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label PK study in pediatric subjects who had undergone general surgery. Each
      subject's study participation consisted of a screening visit, a single-dose treatment with
      intranasal ketorolac (IN) tromethamine, and a follow-up visit.

      Following surgery, subjects received IN ketorolac 15 mg (weight &lt; 50 kg) or 30 mg (weight &gt;
      or = 50 kg) when pain relief was indicated. For pain not relieved by the study drug, the
      subjects had access to an opioid analgesic administered by patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained at specified time points
      following the dose of ketorolac.

    <description>Pharmacokinetic analysis by standard model independent methods was performed by a pharmacokineticist using WinNonlin Professional.

Actual blood sampling times for ketorolac assay were converted to a time from dosing (elapsed time).
