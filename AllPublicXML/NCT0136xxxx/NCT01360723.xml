  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators previously pointed out the significant association between urinary arsenic
      profiles and urothelial carcinoma (UC) risk through a 12-year follow-up study. Further, the
      investigators observed the increased UC risk in people with lower plasma folate and higher
      homocysteine than those with higher plasma folate and lower homocysteine in 2010.
      S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is one factor included in one-carbon metabolism pathway and is the
      main donor of methyl group in cells. The ratio of SAM and its metabolite
      S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) not only reflected the intake level of dietary folate but also
      demonstrated the extent of global DNA methylation. These factors might play important roles
      in UC carcinogenesis. The investigators would expect to take three years to explore the
      interactions among global DNA methylation, one-carbon metabolic pathway factors, urinary
      arsenic profiles, the polymorphisms and haplotype of Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) and
      UC. In the first year, the investigators would measure the levels of plasma folate,
      homocysteine, SAM and SAH and evaluate the associations between these factors and UC risk. In
      the second year, the investigators would set up the method of immunohistochemistry stain and
      compare the differences between the global DNA methylation from bladder tissues and blood. In
      the last year, this investigators would analyze the GNMT gene polymorphism and haplotype
      variation. At the same time, the investigators would explore the impact of GNMT genetic
      variation and global DNA methylation on UC risk. Based on the results from our research, the
      investigators might propose that the decreased ratio of SAM/SAH resulted in UC risk
      increased. This mechanism might be through the changed levels of urinary arsenic profiles and
      global DNA methylation.

        This is a hosital-based case-control study. Patients with urothelial carcinoma are
        recruited by pathological verification of UC was done by routine urological practice
        including endoscopic biopsy or surgical resection of urinary tract tumors followed by
        histopathological examination by board-certified pathologists. Healthy controls without
        evidence of UC or any other malignancy were recurited including those receiving adult
        health examinations at China Medical University Hospital.
