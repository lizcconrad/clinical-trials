        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Body weight &gt;100 lbs. (&gt; 45 kg), and body mass index (BMI) between 18-38 kg/m2,
             inclusive (BMI 18-30 for the matched reference group)

          2. For patients/subjects requiring pharmacotherapy, a stable drug regimen, defined as not
             having started a new drug or changed dosage within three (3) days or five (5)
             half-lives (whichever was longer) prior to administration of MNTX concomitant
             medication must either have conformed to the list of approved drugs and dosage or have
             been approved by the sponsor.

          3. Patients with normal renal function, demographically comparable to the patients with
             impaired renal function weights and ages were within the range of chronic kidney
             disease (CKD) group and the average for the matched reference group was within 10
             years and 10 kg of the average for the CKD

          4. Patients with impaired renal function, good general health except for those illnesses
             associated with CKD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects/patients with any conditions possibly affecting drug absorption (eg.
             Gastrectomy or clinically significant diabetic gastroenteropathy)

          2. Methadone use

          3. Consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice within seven (7) days prior to
             administration of study medication.

          4. Patients requiring hemodialysis.
