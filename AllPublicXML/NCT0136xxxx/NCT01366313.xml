      The aim of our study is to define the median effective analgesic doses (ED50) of paracetamol,
      morphine, and their combination and determination the nature of their interaction
      administered IV for postoperative pain after moderate painful surgery using up-and-down and
      isobolographic methods.

      Ninety patients scheduled to undergo moderately painful surgery were included in one of three
      groups. Determination of median effective (ED50) doses was performed by the Dixon and Mood
      up-and-down method. Initial doses were 1.5g and 5mg, with dose adjustment intervals of 0.5g
      and 1 mg, in the paracetamol and morphine groups, respectively. The initial doses of
      paracetamol and morphine were 1.5g and 3mg, respectively in the paracetamol-morphine
      combination group with dose adjustment intervals of 0.25g for paracetamol and 0.5mg for
      morphine. Analgesic efficacy was defined as a decrease to less than 3 on a 0-10 numeric pain
      scale, 45 min after the beginning of drug administration. Isobolographic analysis was used to
      define the nature of their interaction.
