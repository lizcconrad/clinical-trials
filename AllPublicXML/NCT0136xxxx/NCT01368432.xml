  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to see if a drug called escitalopram (Lexapro) is helpful to
      people who are suffering from depression after traumatic brain injury (TBI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite it's high prevalence, little is known about the pharmacological treatment of
      depression following Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). This is because of a lack of randomized
      controlled studies in the treatment of post-TBI depression. This study is designed to examine
      the safety and effectiveness of escitalopram in the treatment of post-TBI depression. It will
      also investigate metabolic changes and neural pathways associated with post-TBI depression
      and metabolic alterations after treatment through neuroimaging.

    <measure>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>MADRS score at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assesses the range of symptoms most frequently observed in patients with major depression. This measure will be used to assess the difference in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline and 12 weeks. The scores range from 0-60.
0 to 6 - normal; 7 to 19 - mild depression; 20 to 34 - moderate depression; &gt;34 - severe depression.
In this study the score was used as a continuous variable.</description>

        <title>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at Baseline</title>
        <description>This scale assesses the range of symptoms most frequently observed in patients with major depression. This measure will be used to assess the difference in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline and 12 weeks. The scores range from 0-60.
0 to 6 â€“ normal; 7 to 19 â€“ mild depression; 20 to 34 â€“ moderate depression; &gt;34 â€“ severe depression.
In this study the score was used as a continuous variable.</description>
