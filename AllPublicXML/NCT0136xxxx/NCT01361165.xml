  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to analyze the data to meet the primary objective of the study:

      To characterize the change in bone mineral density (BMD), as measured by lumbar spine DEXA,
      during and following treatment with tenofovir DF-containing antiretroviral therapy in
      HIV-infected children.

      In addition, we plan to analyze the data to meet 2 secondary objectives of the study:

        1. To study and monitor markers of bone metabolism - calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid
           hormone (PTH), vitamin D levels, bone resorption markers (urinary collagen cross-linked
           N-telopeptide and free deoxypyridinoline), bone formation markers (bone specific
           alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin) - in HIV-infected children treated with tenofovir
           DF-containing antiretroviral therapy.

        2. To study immunologic, virologic and clinical effects of tenofovir DF administered to
           HIV-infected children in combination with other antiretroviral therapies.
