      The purpose of this study is to compare the Monica AN24 fetal monitor to previously FDA
      approved devices for Fetal Heart Rate and Uterine Contractions in labor for Multiples and pre
      term labor.

      Clinical Investigation for a non-inferiority/equivalence study that aims to determine the
      acceptable performance of the Monica AN24 during the first and when possible the second
      stages of labor by determining whether the Monica AN24 fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine
      contractions (UC) monitoring device is non-inferior/equivalent to Doppler FHR and
      tocodynamometer UC using direct fetal scalp electrode (FSE) FHR and intrauterine pressure
      catheter (IUPC) UC as a reference, either collected simultaneously with the Monica and
      Doppler FHR/tocodynamometer UC data, or from previous studies to define the expected accuracy
      and success rate when comparing Monica FHR and UC with Doppler FHR and tocodynamometer UC
      respectively

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  She is &gt;=24weeks 0days but less than 36 completed weeks, with a singleton pregnancy or
             &gt;=34weeks 0days with a multiple pregnancy and has been admitted to the Labor and
             Delivery Unit

          -  She is in the latent phase of spontaneous labor, or has been admitted for induction of
             labor

          -  She has given her informed consent to participate as a subject

          -  She has none of the exclusion criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known major fetal malformation or chromosome abnormality

          -  Involvement in another clinical trial currently or previously in this pregnancy

          -  Medical or obstetric problem that would preclude the use of abdominal electrodes
             (e.g., skin eruptions, sensitivity to adhesives)

          -  Significant medical or obstetric problem that in the investigator's opinion would make
             the woman incapable of taking part in the study
