  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic Central Cord Syndrome (TCCS) was until recent recognized as a separate clinical
      entity. The most characteristic feature is the disproportionate more motor impairment of the
      arms and especially the hands than the legs, bladder dysfunction and sensory.

      Recently, it has been shown that the distinction of TCCS with an incomplete cervical spinal
      cord lesion (ICSCL) is artificial. It is the most frequent incomplete traumatic spinal cord
      lesion. It accounts for up to 70 % of all incomplete cervical spinal cord lesions. The exact
      incidence is not known.

      Uncertainty about the treatment exists. A good recovery has been described after conservative
      treatment. Conservative treatment was usually considered when a fracture or dislocation of
      the spine were absent. It is often seen in hyperextension trauma in the elderly with
      degenerative spondylotic stenotic cervical spine. However, some reports suggest a better
      outcome after surgical decompression. Randomized trials have not been performed. To avoid
      discussion about possible confounding or effect modification related to the mechanism of
      trauma, this study will focus on ICSCL in patients without fracture or instability of the
      cervical spine on radiological examination. Also the problem of crossover from the
      conservative group to the surgical one due to the nature of spinal instability will be
      reduced.

      Goal of the study: To compare the efficacy of early decompressive surgery to improve
      functional outcome in patients with ICSCL without a fracture or instability of the cervical
      spine compared to those receiving conservative treatment.

      Definition of ICSCL in this study: ICSCL is an incomplete spinal cord lesion due to a
      cervical spine trauma. At CT scanning with reconstruction and at MRI signs are not seen that
      could indicate a fracture of the cervical spine or instability. An overt sequestrated
      herniated disc should not be present since this will always necessitate immediate surgery.
      Involvement of the cervical spinal cord should be established at physical examination
      (symptomatic arm or hand dysfunction is obligatory).
