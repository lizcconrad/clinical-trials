      PURPOSE Physical exercise is beneficial for patients with ischemic heart disease and chronic
      heart failure, while little is known about the effect in atrial fibrillation (AF). The
      investigators studied the effect of physical exercise on cardiac output (CO), max. exercise
      capacity, biomarkers and quality of life (Qol) in patients with AF in a randomised study of
      physical exercise training three times weekly for twelve weeks.

      HYPOTHESIS Exercise training improves cardiac output (CO), max. exercise capacity, biomarkers
      and quality of life (Qol) in patients with AF.

      METHODS Assessment of exercise capacity, CO, Qol, body composition, six minute walk test and
      muscular strength was performed before and after 12 weeks.

      Resting echocardiography was done at baseline. CO was measured using impedance cardiography
      at rest and during maximal exercise testing on an ergometer bicycle. Body composition,
      muscular strength and six minutes walking capacity were measured before and after the
      training period. Qol was evaluated by the use of the standardized validated questionnaires
      Short Form 36 (SF-36) and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHF-Q).

      Training consisted of aerobic exercise at 70 percent of max. capacity estimated by
      Borg-scale.
