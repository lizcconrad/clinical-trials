  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to identify and quantify inflammatory and
      genetic markers from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum in patients with a history
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergoing elective coronary
      revascularization (CABG) to determine the risk of developing post operative respiratory
      failure. To achieve this objective, this proposal outlines the following specific aims:

      Aim #1. To identify from BALF and serum, the change in inflammatory and genetic markers in
      patients with a history of COPD undergoing CABG. BALF and serum samples will be obtained at
      the time of intubation immediately prior to surgery and again upon skin closure immediately
      after the surgical procedure.

      Aim #2. To determine the extent to which inflammatory and/or genetic markers correlate with
      post-operative pulmonary complications defined as prolonged mechanical ventilation (&gt; 24
      hours), pneumonia, and/or tracheostomy.

      Aim #3. To inform the development and implementation of a large pivotal trial which may
      impact clinical decision-making during the initial pre-operative outpatient assessment of
      COPD patients undergoing CABG.
