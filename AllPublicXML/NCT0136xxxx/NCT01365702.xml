      The aim of this study to evaluate clinical efficacy of tiotropium in patients with airflow
      obstruction due to Tuberculosis (TB) destroyed lung.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis can cause lung parenchymal destruction, volume loss, secondary bronchiectasis.
      Patients with TB destroyed lung complain chronic respiratory symptoms, such as chronic cough,
      sputum, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and acute exacerbations. Some of them have chronic
      airflow obstructions on pulmonary function tests, similar to those of smokers.

      Previous large randomized controlled trials, targeting patients with smoking related moderate
      to severe COPD,demonstrated that tiotropium improved quality of life and respiratory symptom
      with tolerable long-term safety. The investigators want to evaluate whether tiotropium can
      improve chronic respiratory symptom,an lung function in patients with COPD due to TB
      destroyed lung.

        Patients with TB destroyed lung visiting Seoul National University Bundang Hospital
        Respiratory center for chronic respiratory symptoms will be screened for study
        participants. Among the patients, those with definite pulmonary TB histor with airflow
        obstruction on their PFT were entrolled.
