  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to modify behavior therapy so that it is optimized for children
      with conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits by emphasizing reward components and
      de-emphasizing punishment components.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have demonstrated that standard behavioral treatments do not appear to be
      sufficient for children with conduct problems (CP) and callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Other
      research suggests that children with CPCU are less responsive to punishments as evaluated
      using controlled laboratory tasks. Based on these two sets of findings, it was hypothesized
      that behavioral treatment modified to emphasize reward and de-emphasize punishments would be
      advantageous when used to treat children with CPCU. This hypothesis was tested in a treatment
      development study that had three phases. During phase 1, which occurred in 2010, the
      intervention was planned and treatment procedures and manuals were developed. During phase 2,
      which occurred in 2011, a pilot study was conducted in which the intervention was tested in
      an iterative manner in a group of 12 children with conduct problems and callous-unemotional
      traits. In phase 3, a larger trial was conducted using a cross over design, with one-half of
      participants getting standard behavioral treatment for four weeks followed by modified
      behavioral treatment for four weeks and remaining participants receiving treatments in the
      reverse order.Treatments were evaluated using parent ratings, counselor ratings, and
      frequency counts of behavior during treatments.

          <description>Summer treatment program: Intensive behavioral treatment delivered in a summer camp setting. During one block of four weeks, participants received modified behavioral treatment (MBT) that emphasized rewards and de-emphasized punishments. During another block of four weeks, participants received standard behavior treatment (SBT) that balanced reward and punishment. Order of treatment blocks was counter-balanced across participants, and primary analyses were within-subject comparisons. Therefore, we report demographics for the full sample.</description>

        <description>At the end of each treatment week counselors rated each child's overall inattentive-overactive-impulsive behavior during the week. Rating were completed using Likert scales that ranged from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;very much&quot;). Items were summed to compute a scale score with a theoretical range of 0 to 15.</description>

            <description>Summer treatment program: Intensive behavioral treatment delivered in a summer camp setting. During one block of four weeks, participants received modified behavioral treatment (MBT) that emphasized rewards and de-emphasized punishments. During another block of four weeks, participants received standard behavior treatment (SBT) that balanced reward and punishment. Order of treatment blocks was counter-balanced across participants, and primary analyses were within-subject comparisons. Therefore, we report demographics for the full sample.</description>

          <title>IOWA Inattentive/Overactive Scale - Counselor</title>
          <description>At the end of each treatment week counselors rated each child's overall inattentive-overactive-impulsive behavior during the week. Rating were completed using Likert scales that ranged from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;very much&quot;). Items were summed to compute a scale score with a theoretical range of 0 to 15.</description>
          <population>Three children excluded from analyses; two excluded because of medication changes during treatment. One excluded because he was mistakenly enrolled (after collecting treatment data we learned that he did not meet all inclusion criteria).</population>

        <description>At the end of each treatment week counselors rated each child's serious conduct problems during the week. Rating were completed on the Weekly Problem Rating Form (Haas et al, 2011) using Likert scales that ranged from 1 (&quot;no problem&quot;) to 7 (&quot;serious problem&quot;). Items were averaged to compute a scale score with a theoretical range of 1 to 7, with high scores indicating more serious problems.</description>

Rating were completed on the Weekly Problem Rating Form (Haas et al, 2011) using Likert scales that ranged from 1 (&quot;no problem&quot;) to 7 (&quot;serious problem&quot;). Items were averaged to compute a scale score with a theoretical range of 1 to 7, with high scores indicating more serious problems.</description>

During one block of four weeks, participants received modified behavioral treatment (MBT) that emphasized rewards and de-emphasized punishments. During another block of four weeks, participants received standard behavior treatment (SBT) that balanced reward and punishment. Order of treatment blocks was counter-balanced across participants, and primary analyses were within-subject comparisons. Therefore, we report demographics for the full sample.</description>

          <title>WPRF Overall Problems - Parent</title>
          <description>At the end of each treatment week parents rated each child's overall problems during the week. Rating were completed on the Weekly Problem Rating Form (Haas et al, 2011) using Likert scales that ranged from 1 (&quot;no problem&quot;) to 7 (&quot;serious problem&quot;). Items were averaged to compute a scale score with a theoretical range of 1 to 7, with high scores indicating more serious problems.</description>
