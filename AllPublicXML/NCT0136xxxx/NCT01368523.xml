      The purpose of this study is to provide patients with imatinib resistant/intolerant chronic
      myeloid leukemia - in blast crisis, accelerated phase and chronic phase, who have been
      previously enrolled to CAMN107A2109 and benefit from the treatment, with access to nilotinib
      (AMN107) in Poland until such time as the treatment with this drug is financed by the
      National Health Found in Poland (via 'therapeutic program') or for a period of 18 months,
      whichever comes first.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Imatinib - resistant or - intolerant Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML in chronic
             phase, accelerated phase or in blast crisis patients previously enrolled to
             CAMN107A2109 trial in Poland and continuing the treatment with nilotinib at the time
             of enrollment for this trial.

          2. In the opinion of the investigators would benefit from the further treatment with
             nilotinib

          3. No evidence of extramedullary leukaemic involvement, with the exception of liver and
             spleen

          4. Males or females ≥18 years of age

          5. WHO Performance Status of ≤ 2

          6. QTc ≤ 450 msec on the average of three serial baseline ECG (using the QTcF formula).

          7. Patients must have the following laboratory values:

               -  Potassium within normal limits or corrected to within normal limits with
                  supplements prior to the first dose of study medication

               -  Total calcium (corrected for serum albumin) within normal limits or correctable
                  with supplements

               -  Magnesium within normal limits or corrected to within normal limits with
                  supplements prior to the first dose of study medication

               -  Phosphorus ≥ LLN or correctable with supplements

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN or ≤ 5.0 x ULN if considered due to tumour

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN unless considered due to tumour

               -  Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or 24-hour creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min

               -  Serum amylase ≤ 1.5 x ULN and serum lipase ≤ 1.5 x ULN

          8. Written signed and dated informed consent prior to any study procedures being
             performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known T315I mutations

          2. Impaired cardiac function including any one of the following:

               -  LVEF &lt; 45% or below the institutional lower limit of the normal range (whichever
                  is higher) as determined by echocardiogram

               -  Inability to determine the QT interval on ECG

               -  Complete left bundle branch block

               -  Use of a ventricular-paced pacemaker

               -  Congenital long QT syndrome or a known family history of long QT syndrome

                  formula). If QTcF &gt; 450 msec and electrolytes are not within normal ranges,
                  electrolytes should be corrected and then the patient re-screened for QTc.

                  uncontrolled hypertension).

          3. Known cytopathologically confirmed CNS infiltration (in absence of suspicion of CNS
             involvement, lumbar puncture not required)

          4. Severe or uncontrolled medical conditions (i.e. uncontrolled diabetes, active or
             uncontrolled infection)

          5. History of significant congenital or acquired bleeding disorder unrelated to cancer

          6. Previous radiotherapy to ≥ 25% of the bone marrow

             prior surgery

          8. History of non-compliance to medical regimens or inability to grant consent

          9. Use of therapeutic coumarin derivatives (i.e., warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon)

             ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir,
             mibefradil) and the treatment cannot be either discontinued or switched to a different
             medication prior to starting study drug or who are within 5 half-lives of the last
             dose of this medication prior to starting study drug.
