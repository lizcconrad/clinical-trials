  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in technology have resulted in the development of scanners that can image the
      heart blood vessels within 10 to 20 minutes but without the need for admission to hospital or
      insertion of catheters. Further advances in technology allow the visualisation of both the
      blood vessels and the supply of blood to the heart muscle. Here we propose to assess the
      latest and most powerful computed tomography scanner and compare it to magnetic resonance and
      conventional coronary angiography.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Myocardial perfusion defects defined qualitatively by trained observers and quantitatively by computer software</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure is to establish whether 320-multidetector computed tomography can identify myocardial perfusion defects as compared to the gold standards of 3Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and fractional flow reserve measured during invasive coronary angiography.</description>

    <measure>Identification of regional wall motion abnormalities qualitatively by trained observers</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Our secondary outcome measures are to assess the performance of 320-multidetector computed tomography in the detection of regional wall motion abnormalities in comparison to those obtained with 3Tesla cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.</description>
