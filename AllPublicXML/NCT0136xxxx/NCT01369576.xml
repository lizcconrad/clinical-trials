  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical population targeted will be newly diagnosed patients with polysomnographically
      diagnosed OSA who are not currently taking hypnotics for concomitantly diagnosed insomnia.
      Outpatients who are also judged to be capable to follow the study procedures (consent,
      timelines, visits, questionnaires) and who do not have any concurrent disease that in the
      view of the investigator will interfere with participation in the trial to completion will be
      included. Approximately 160 subjects were recruited (80 per treatment arm) in the recent
      trial of eszopiclone. This size is expected to be able to discern an important difference of
      80 minutes per night. In the current clinical population newly prescribed CPAP at Mount Sinai
      Hospital, the average compliance after 4 weeks of initiation of nCPAP was 4:01 (SD 2:59)
      hours per night. To be able to discern a difference of at least 1 hour (60 minutes) in usage
      per night, including entirely non-adherent patients who do not use treatment at all as 'zero
      hour' users, would require randomization of 264 patients (132 per group).

      Our hypothesis for this study is that initial titration of CPAP treatment of OSA may be
      improved by initial prescription of a common hypnotic, zopiclone. To answer this question we
      intend to recruit 264 consecutive consenting subjects with OSA confirmed by a physician (ABSM
      or by a respirologist with extensive sleep medicine experience) with supportive
      polysomnography results who are willing to initiate long-term CPAP treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep breathing disorder that is
      associated with serious complications. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the
      treatment of choice for most patients but its use in the real world is limited by low patient
      adherence which may result in sub-optimal outcomes for some patients. A single hypnotic with
      low risk of adverse effects is a cost-effective intervention to augment the currently low
      adherence to CPAP, especially if only prescribed for a limited time. The hypnotic is generic
      zopiclone 3.75-7.5 mg at bedtime for up to 14 doses.

      The clinical population targeted will be newly expert physician-diagnosed patients
      polysomnographically supported OSA who are not currently taking hypnotics for concomitantly
      diagnosed insomnia. Outpatients who are also judged to be capable to follow the study
      procedures (consent, timelines, visits, questionnaires) and who do not have any concurrent
      disease that in the view of the investigator will interfere with participation in the trial
      to completion will be included.
