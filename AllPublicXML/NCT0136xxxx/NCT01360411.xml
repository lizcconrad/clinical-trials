  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single centre study we study the use of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) combined
      with elastography in order to separate malignant tissue from benign tissue in and adjacent to
      the upper gastrointestinal tract.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) with strain based
      elastography to identify strain traits separating malignant from benign lesions. We are
      registering feasibility of endoscopic strain imaging and compare diagnostic accuracy of EUS +
      elastography with previous data on EUS alone.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Group 1: Focal subepithelial lesions in esophageal, ventricular or duodenal wall
           discovered by endoscopy or other imaging modality.

        -  Group 2: Pancreatic lesion discovered by other imaging modality.

        -  Group 3: Mediastinal or retroperitoneal lymph node or tumor discovered by other imaging
           modality.

      Histology of lesions should not be known at the time of examination. EUS elastography
      findings are evaluated shortly after the examination and categorised by different methods;
      categorical score, VAS, Strain Ratio. The result is then compared to histology or cytology
      results. Patients who do not undergo tissue sampling are followed up to discover disease
      progress.

    <time_frame>Jan 2007 - September 2011 + 6 months( if no tissue sample)(4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Imaged lesions are sampled, surgically removed or followed up &gt; 6 months to conclude on their nature. Images are evaluated, measured and categorised shortly after examination and compared to histological, cytological or follow up result. Elastography results do not interfere with surgical or oncological treatment planning in this study.</description>

    <time_frame>2007 - September 2011 (4 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Strain ratio provides opportunity to compare strain in user selected areas of the elastogram. This is a semi-quantification of strain differences and may be useful for a better distinction between malignant ond non-malignant lesions.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the use of a simple 100 mm Visual analog scale to classify if lesion appears softer, equal to or harder than the surrounding tissue is useful for creating semiquantitative cut-off levels between malignant and benign lesions.</description>
