      This is a pilot study of a novel disposable transnasal esophagoscope for feasibility, safety
      and tolerance.

    <textblock>
      A disposable, transnasal esophagoscope, E.G. ScanTM was developed by IntroMedic Co. Ltd.
      (Seoul, Korea). This device was designed to allow patient to undergo endoscopy with minimum
      pain without sedation. This endoscopy system consists of thin probe with a CMOS camera,
      controller and simple display system. This system is light enough to carry and does occupy
      much space, and thus, it can be used at patient bed sides in intensive care units, in
      emergency rooms, and even in doctor's offices.
