      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that appendicular lean body
      mass (aLBM) will increase after 12 weeks of LY2495655 treatment versus placebo in older
      participants undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty (eTHA).

          -  The planned surgical procedure will preclude weight bearing for at least 4 weeks
             postoperatively (for instance, the planned procedure will involve extensive bone

             therapy, or any history of spontaneous or induced sustained ventricular tachycardia
             (heart rate &gt;100 bpm for 30 seconds) despite medical or device therapy, or any history
