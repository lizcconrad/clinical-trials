      The objective is to the amount of protein infants require after cardiopulmonary bypass
      surgery.

      Postoperative neonates are susceptible to the adverse effects of surgery that is
      characterized by a breakdown of body stores. Without appropriate nutritional consideration
      this process can lead to increased physiological instability. It has been extensively
      documented that critically ill patients are typically catabolic. This results in body
      nitrogen losses from the breakdown of somatic protein to fuel metabolic processes such as,
      gluconeogenesis. The evaluation of this catabolic response is particularly crucial in infants
      due to their limited fat and lean body mass reserves. Quantifying the amount of protein
      needed to maintain body composition and to meet the demands of surgical stress is of clinical
      importance when considering factors associated with postoperative morbidity, such as delayed
      wound healing, impaired growth and prolonged hospital stay.

      The results obtained from this study will assist with determining an appropriate level of
      protein for the development of optimal nutrition prescriptions that are aimed at reducing
      catabolism of body stores.

    <description>After an initial adaptation period of approximately 12 hours receiving parenteral nutrition the first 24-hour urine collection for nitrogen balance will be started; following this two successive 24-hour urine collections will be performed in order to obtain a three-day collection for nitrogen balance analyses.</description>
