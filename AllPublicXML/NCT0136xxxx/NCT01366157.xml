      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors identify and learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers
      related to cancer. It may also help doctors predict how patients will respond to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This research trial is studying protein biomarker levels in tissue samples from
      young patients with low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To investigate the variability of expression of human geminal-center-associated lymphoma
           (HGAL) protein in pediatric low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  To assess the variability of HGAL staining between risk groups by comparing samples from
           subjects enrolled in the low-risk study AHOD0431 with subject samples enrolled in
           AHOD0031 for intermediate-risk classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL).

        -  To assess the variability of HGAL staining by evaluating a tissue array created from
           subjects with intermediate-risk cHL.

        -  To correlate rapid or slow early-response in the intermediate-risk group with HGAL
           protein expression.

      OUTLINE: Paraffin-embedded tissue samples and tissue microarrays are analyzed for protein
      expression by IHC.
