  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IV observational trial is intended to identify patients who are failing GnRH
      agonist therapy as evidenced by a rising PSA and who have yet to initiate secondary
      manoeuvres involving antiandrogens. This group may include both non-metastatic as well as
      metastatic patients. The trial will determine if these patients will benefit from switching
      to Degarelix. It will assess the effect of Degarelix's direct mode of action on androgen
      levels and whether continuous use of Degarelix improves disease progression.

      As per the CUA Guidelines for the Management of CRPC, because the androgen receptor remains
      active in most patients who have developed castration resistant disease, it is recommended
      that ADT should be continued (LEVEL 3, GRADE C). Therefore, it is logical to continue
      patients on Degarelix throughout the castrate resistant period. This will allow for the
      gathering of data that is currently unknown within this setting, such as the effect of
      combined treatment with antiandrogens as well as chemotherapy and other castrate resistant
      treatments.

      This trial will include hormone sensitive prostate cancer patients switched to Degarelix
      therapy after failing on GnRH agonists but prior to use of secondary hormonal treatments such
      as antiandrogens. The purpose of this trial is to determine the effect of Degarelix's direct
      mode of action on androgen levels and whether continuous use of Degarelix improves disease
      progression.

      This is an open-label, multi-centre, Phase IV observational trial with s.c. injections of
      Degarelix one-month depot in patients with advanced prostate cancer.

      The visit frequency is once a month (28-day intervals), with eCRF data entry at every 4
      months. All patients will be treated with a one-month starting dose followed by 23 monthly
      maintenance doses for a duration of 672 days. The primary endpoints will be evaluated after
      24 treatment months.

      In total, 25 visits are scheduled for all patients.
