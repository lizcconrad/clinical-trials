      The lung cancer is the most has the life minacity in all kinds of cancers, and it also
      remains the most common cause of cancer-related death in the world. The group of lung cancer
      patients are suffer from huge disease impact that came from high mortality. Not only the
      course of treatment that patients has been diagnosis through operation is more faster, but
      also those who could be capable of operated are stabilized to keep follow-up at out-patient
      clinic. But in the next following five years after operation, they may take different
      dysfunctional level or some kinds of symptom distress. The effect has a great influence on
      those patients that have to face extended emotional impact, symptom distress and life style
      change. In addition, most of them concern about recurrent all the time in the remission.
      These situation needs us to place importance on it.

      The purposes of this study are to investigate psychological and physical distress and care
      needs in operable lung cancer patients receiving surgery. This survey includes two parts of
      physical and mental condition. First, the investigators are scoring their symptom severity
      and quality of life to check physical condition. Seconded, the mental condition will use
      validated questionnaires to realize the relationship of anxiety, depression, uncertainty,
      fear of recurrence, self-efficacy and needs. Final, compare all of the data to patients'
      needs.

      This study is a cross-sectional designs with convenience sampling that conform to the
      investigators recruited requirements. The investigators will recruit from the clinic of
      thoracic surgery in one medical center in Taipei and take five structured requirements. And
      the investigators are going to collect data from January, 2011 to December, 2012. Also expect
      results are lung cancer outpatients after surgery that more physical dysfunction or more
      depress of mental condition, it will lead patients' needs increased or significant
      difference. In conclusion, this study analyzes their needs in the remission that consequences
      can be medical professionals' reference material.
