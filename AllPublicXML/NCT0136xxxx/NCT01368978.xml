      This study is a prospective, single-center, open label, randomized; two-arms cross over
      study.

      This is the test protocol for the InsuPatch device, whose purpose is to improve insulin
      delivery into the blood when the insulin is infused using an insulin-infusion pump by
      controlled heating of the area surrounding the point of infusion.

      Twenty(20) type 1 children with Type 1 Diabetics Mellitus (TIDM) who are meeting the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria as outlined below and who provide written Informed Consent will
      be enrolled in the study.

      The study will consist of an outpatient enrollment visit and two admissions(One clamps with
      the InsuPatch and one clamp without the InsuPatch) . Each Subject will thus serve as his/her
      own control.
