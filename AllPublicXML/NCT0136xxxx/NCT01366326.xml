    <textblock>
      MNTX 1109 is a single center, open label study, composed of normal healthy adult subjects to
      evaluate the PK of MNTX and its metabolites administered once daily as a subcutaneous (SC)
      injection for a period of seven days. Blood samples will be obtained at screening and for
      drug concentration data.
