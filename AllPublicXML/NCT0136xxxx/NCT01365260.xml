  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the commonest form of joint disease, characterized by articular
      cartilage degradation with an accompanying periarticular bone response and a synovial
      membrane inflammation. Clinical manifestations of OA in the knee include pain in and around
      the joint, stiffness of the joint after rest, crepitus on motion and limited joint. MM-II
      medical device was designed to reduce wear and lower friction in knees of osteoarthritis
      patients by creating a lubricating layer onto cartilage surfaces upon injection. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether a medical device MM-II is effective in the treatment of
      osteoarthritis, in direct comparison with an approved hyaluronic acid preparation.
