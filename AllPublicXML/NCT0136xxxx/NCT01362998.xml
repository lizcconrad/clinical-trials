  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For post-Cesarean analgesia, the investigators will compare the efficacy of single-shot
      epidural preservative free morphine with a continuous epidural fentanyl infusion. The
      investigators will be comparing the patient's pain level and satisfaction with the two
      techniques, as well as the side effects that the patients experience, such as itching,
      nausea, back pain and respiratory depression.

      Included in the study will be all healthy (ASA I or II) woman having elective Cesarean
      sections who are candidates for regional anesthesia. Exclusion criteria include morbid
      obesity (BMI &gt; 40), age less that 18 years, history of sleep apnea, and abuse of or
      intolerance to opioid analgesics.

      All patients will also receive 100 micrograms of fentanyl once epidurally during the Cesarean
      section, and they will receive ibuprofen every six hours for the first 24 hours after the
      Cesarean section. The patients will be visited twice a day postoperatively for two days. The
      epidural morphine will be expected to last only approximately 20 hours, while the fentanyl
      infusion will be kept in place for two days after the procedure. Additional analgesics, such
      as intravenous morphine or PO oxycodone and tylenol, will be available for breakthrough pain.
