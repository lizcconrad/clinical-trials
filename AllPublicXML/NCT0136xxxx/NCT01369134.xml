      Study hypothesis: Etching the enamel followed by use of a self-etching adhesive on enamel and
      dentin is as effective as a one-step etch and rinse approach.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is scant evidence available on the performance of self-etching dental adhesive systems.
      This study aims to clinically evaluate a self-etch adhesive used either with an extra enamel
      etching step, or in a self-etch stand alone technique with no extra enamel etch.
