  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the risk of myocardial infarction (MI)/coronary
      death associated with use of monotherapy low dose ASA (single antiplatelet) as well as
      concomitant use of monotherapy low dose ASA and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in first- time
      users of low dose ASA for secondary prevention using a UK primary care database.
