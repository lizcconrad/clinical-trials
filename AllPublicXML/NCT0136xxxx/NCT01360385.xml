  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown a remarkably positive effect of 6 monthly injections of Ranibizumab
      on eyes with CRVO. The disease may cause severe sight threatening complications, partly due
      to restrictions in blood flow and oxygenation . Although Ranibizumab has been shown affective
      to reduce oedema of the retina, it is not known whether the drug ameliorates or aggravates
      restrictions in oxygenation.

      The Oxymap oximeter allows a non-invasive measurement of the oxygen saturation in retinal
      vessels and thus the state of retinal oxygenation.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of injections of Ranibizumab on
      the retinal oxygen saturation in eyes with newly diagnosed central retinal vein occlusion
      (CRVO),

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of injections of Ranibizumab on visual
      acuity and retinal oedema in eyes with different degree of ischemia.

      Background and objectives

      The CRUISE study has shown a remarkable positive effect of 6 monthly injections intravitreal
      Ranibizumab on visual function in eyes with macular edema secondary to CRVO. Eyes with CRVO
      are at risk of severe complications to retinal ischemia, particularly proliferative
      retinopathy and neovascular glaucoma. It is not known whether intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy
      ameliorates or aggravates retinal ischemia and thus the risk of ischemic complications is
      unknown. Since complications to retinal ischemia take time to develop, and are relatively
      infrequent, the CRUISE study was not designed, or powered, to investigate the impact of
      intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment on these complications.

      The Oxymap oximeter allows objective non-invasive measurement of the oxygen saturation in
      retinal vessels and thus the degree of retinal ischemia. The rationale behind the present
      study is to use this instrument in order to obtain preliminary information on the effects of
      intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment on retinal ischemia in CRVO eyes without having to wait for
      ischemic complications to arise in a large study population.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of treatment with intravitreal
      Ranibizumab on the retinal oxygen saturation in eyes with newly diagnosed central retinal
      vein occlusion (CRVO),

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the effects of intravitreal Ranibizumab on visual
      acuity and central retinal thickness in eyes with different degree of ischemia.

      Study design

      The research project is a case-series study of CRVO-patients with three monthly injections of
      Ranibizumab and a 3 month follow-up period, during which Ranibizumab injections are provided
      as needed.
