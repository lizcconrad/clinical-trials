      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of ALKS33-BUP when
      administered to opioid-experienced cocaine abusers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no currently available pharmacologic treatments for cocaine abuse and/or dependence
      and the unmet medical need is growing. In collaboration with the National Institute on Drug
      Abuse (NIDA), Alkermes, Inc. is investigating a fixed-dose combination product consisting of
      ALKS 33 (also referred to as RDC-0313) and buprenorphine (ALKS 33-BUP) for the treatment of
      cocaine abuse and/or dependence (Grant Number R01DA031000).

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design inpatient study.
      Eligibility will be established which includes responses to cocaine infusions at baseline,
      prior to study drug administration. Approximately 30 opioid-experienced cocaine abusers will
      be randomized 1:1:1 to receive study drug. Study drug will be administered once daily for 10
      consecutive days. Pharmacodynamic assessments and drug-drug interactions will be closely
      monitored during the study. Following study drug administration, subjects will receive
      cocaine infusions to evaluate the effect of treatment on the subjective effects and the PK/PD
      of cocaine. Subjects will be discharged from the clinical research unit 2 days after the last
      infusion of cocaine. Subjects will return for follow-up between 7 and 14 days after
      discharge. The full study will take subjects approximately 28 days, with 17 days of inpatient
      stay.
