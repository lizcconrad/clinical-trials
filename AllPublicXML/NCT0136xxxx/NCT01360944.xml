        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients between 18 and 75 years of age with a diagnosis of stable
             plaque-type psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris) for at least 12 months

          -  Psoriatic plaques that are suitable to be defined as target area lesions by the
             following criteria:

        oPsoriatic plaques must be located on the trunk and/or extremities. Plaques that are
        located on the head (incl. scalp), palms, sole of the feet, intertriginous or genitoanal
        areas are not suitable as target areas

          -  Comparable psoriatic plaques with at least &quot;2&quot; in each score (range 0-4) for the three
             distinct signs: scaling, erythema and induration

          -  No more than 3 points difference in total score (= sum of scores for scaling, erythema
             and induration; Range 0-12) of the chosen comparable psoriatic plaques

          -  Enough surface area to the psoriatic plaque to define eight clearly distinguishable
             (minimum distance between test areas: 1cm) test areas of at least 1 cmÂ² size -
             Effective contraceptive methods for the duration of the study and for the 4 weeks
             after study drug discontinuation, for a patient of childbearing potential.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Too small a body surface area covered with psoriasis plaques that meet the specified
             inclusion criteria

          -  Any condition that may interfere with the study assessments or ultrasound measurements
             of the skin and/or may have an influence on the skin immune response (incl. open
             wounds)

          -  Current diagnosis of guttate, erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis

          -  Patients who have received any topical anti-psoriatic drug in the test area within the
             last 2 weeks before treatment with the IMP.

          -  Patients who have received topical products in the test area containing DEET
             (N,N-diethyl-m-polyamide), a common component of insect repellent products within 1
             week before treatment with the IMP.

          -  Patients who have received systemic biologics within the last 6 months before
             treatment with the IMP or any systemic antipsoriatic treatment (corticosteroids,
             ciclosporin, methotrexate, fumaric acid esters, acitretin etc)within the last 3 months
             before treatment with the IMP.

          -  Significant skin diseases other than plaque-type psoriasis (psoriasis vulgaris),
             including but not limited to: skin disease due to tuberculosis or syphilis, rosacea,
             perioral dermatitis, acne vulgaris, skin atrophy, striae distensae, increased
             fragility of skin blood vessels, ichthyosis, ulcers, wounds and reaction after
             vaccination

          -  Significant skin infections (including but not limited to: herpes, varicella, mycotic
             skin infections, bacterial skin infections or parasitic skin infections)

          -  Excessive sunlight exposure within 28 days prior to study entry and during the conduct
             of the study

          -  Usage of any topical formulation (incl. cosmetics, emollients, etc) on the designated
             target areas during the course of the study

          -  Vitamin A intake &gt; 15,000 IU/day
