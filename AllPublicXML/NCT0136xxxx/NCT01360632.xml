    <measure>Mean Change From the End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) to Phase B (Week 14 Visit) in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale for the Efficacy Sample Set</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 14</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS was utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of a participant's level of depression. The MADRS consisted of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the &quot;best&quot; rating and 6 being the &quot;worst&quot; rating. The MADRS total score were to be unevaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items were recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items were recorded, the MADRS total score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded of to the first decimal place. The MADRS Total Score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>

        <description>The MADRS was utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of a participant's level of depression. The MADRS consisted of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 6 being the “worst” rating. The MADRS total score were to be unevaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items were recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items were recorded, the MADRS total score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded of to the first decimal place. The MADRS Total Score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) in MADRS Total Score for Every Study Week Visit in Phase B Other Than Week 14 Visit for the Efficacy Sample Set</title>
        <description>The MADRS was utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of a participant's level of depression. The MADRS consisted of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 6 being the “worst” rating. The MADRS total score were to be unevaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items were recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items were recorded, the MADRS total score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded of to the first decimal place. The MADRS Total Score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) in MADRS Total Score for Every Study Week Visit in Phase B Other Than Week 14 Visit for the Efficacy Sample Per Final Protocol</title>
        <description>The MADRS was utilized as the primary efficacy assessment of a participant's level of depression. The MADRS consisted of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 6 being the “worst” rating. The MADRS total score were to be unevaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items were recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items were recorded, the MADRS total score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded of to the first decimal place. The MADRS Total Score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) to End of Phase B (Week 14 Visit) in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Mean Scores for the Efficacy Sample Set</title>
        <description>The SDS was a self-rated instrument used to measure the effect of the participants symptoms on work/school, social life, and family/home responsibilities. For each of the three items, scores ranged from 0 through 10. The number most representative of how much each area was disrupted by symptoms was marked along the line from 0= not at all to 10= extremely. For the work/school item, no response was to be entered if the participant did not work or go to school for reasons unrelated to the disorder and a response therefore not being applicable. The Mean SDS score were calculated over the three item scores. All three item scores were needed to be available with the exception of the work/school item score when this item was not applicable.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) in SDS Item Scores for the Efficacy Sample Set</title>
        <description>The SDS is a self-rated instrument used to measure the effect of the patient’s symptoms on work/school, social life, and family/home responsibilities. For each of the three items, scores range from 0 through 10. The number most representative of how much each area was disrupted by symptoms is marked along the line from 0 = not at all, to 10 = extremely. For the work/school item, no response was to be entered if the patient did not work or go to school for reasons unrelated to the disorder and a response therefore not being applicable. The Mean SDS Score will be calculated over the three item scores. All three item scores need to be available with the exception of the work/school item score when this item is not applicable.</description>

          <description>The SDS is a self-rated instrument used to measure the effect of the patient’s symptoms on work/school, social life, and family/home responsibilities. For each of the three items, scores range from 0 through 10. The number most representative of how much each area was disrupted by symptoms is marked along the line from 0 = not at all, to 10 = extremely.

        <title>Change From Baseline (End of Phase A [Week 8]) in SDS Item Scores for the Efficacy Sample Set Per Final Protocol</title>
        <description>The SDS is a self-rated instrument used to measure the effect of the patient’s symptoms on work/school, social life, and family/home responsibilities. For each of the three items, scores range from 0 through 10. The number most representative of how much each area was disrupted by symptoms is marked along the line from 0 = not at all, to 10 = extremely. For the work/school item, no response was to be entered if the patient did not work or go to school for reasons unrelated to the disorder and a response therefore not being applicable. The Mean SDS Score will be calculated over the three item scores. All three item scores need to be available with the exception of the work/school item score when this item is not applicable.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) to Phase B by Study Week in Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) for the Efficacy Sample Set</title>
        <description>The severity of illness for each participant was rated using the CGI-S. To perform this assessment, the study physician had to answer the following question: “Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?” Response choices included: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) for Every Study Week Visit in Phase B in Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (Self-Report) IDS-SR Total Score for the Efficacy Sample Set</title>
        <description>IDS-SR was a 30-item self-report measured to assess core diagnostic depressive symptoms and atypical and melancholic symptom features of major depressive disorders. The IDS-SR consists of 30 items, all rated on a 0 to 3 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 3 being the “worst” rating. Besides item 9, two sub-items 9A and 9B exist, with possible scores of 1, 2 or 3 for item 9A, and 0 or 1 for item 9B. The scores for these two sub-items were not included in the calculation of the total score. The IDS-SR Total Score was the sum of ratings of 28 item scores. The possible IDSSR Total Score ranged from 0 to 84. The IDS-SR Total Score was un-evaluable if less than 23 of the 28 items were recorded. If the number of items recorded was at least 23 and at most 27, the IDS-SR Total Score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 28, and was then rounded off to the first decimal place.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) for Every Study Week Visit in Phase B in IDS-SR Total Score for the Efficacy Sample Per Final Protocol</title>
        <description>The IDS-SR was a 30-item self-report measured to assess core diagnostic depressive symptoms as well as atypical and melancholic symptom features of major depressive disorders. The IDS-SR consists of 30 items, all rated on a 0 to 3 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 3 being the “worst” rating. Besides item 9, two sub-items 9A and 9B exist, with possible scores of 1, 2 or 3 for item 9A, and 0 or 1 for item 9B. The scores for these two sub-items were not included in the calculation of the total score. The IDSSR Total Score was the sum of ratings of 28 item scores. The possible IDSSR Total Score ranged from 0 to 84. The IDS-SR Total Score was un-evaluable if less than 23 of the 28 items were recorded. If the number of items recorded was at least 23 and at most 27, the IDS-SR Total Score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 28, and was then rounded off to the first decimal place.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) to End of Phase B (Week 14 Visit) Hamilton Depression Scale 17 Item Version (HAM)-D17 Total Score for the Efficacy Sample Set</title>
        <description>The HAM-D17 was utilized as a secondary assessment of a participants level of depression. The HAM-D (17-Item) consisted of 17 items. Eight items were rated on a 0 to 2 scale (items 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17), while nine items (items 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 15) were rated on a 0 to 4 scale (twice the weight of the other items). For all of these items, 0 was the “best” rating and the highest score (2 or 4) was the “worst” rating. The possible total scores were from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) to End of Phase B (Week 14 Visit) in HAM-D17 Total Score for the Efficacy Sample Set Per Final Protocol</title>
        <description>The HAM-D17 was utilized as a secondary assessment of a participants level of depression. The HAM-D (17-Item) consisted of 17 items. Eight items were rated on a 0 to 2 scale (items 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 16 and 17), while nine items (items 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 15) were rated on a 0 to 4 scale (twice the weight of the other items). For all of these items, 0 was the “best” rating and the highest score (2 or 4) was the “worst” rating. The possible total scores were from 0 to 52, with higher score indicating more severe depression.</description>

          <title>Mean CGI-I Score at Each Trial Week Visit in Phase B for the Efficacy Sample Set</title>
          <description>The efficacy of study medication was rated for each participant using the CGI-I. The study physician would rate the participant's total improvement whether or not it is due entirely to drug treatment.
Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>
          <population>The Efficacy Sample Set included all participants who had received at least one dose of study treatment and had both an end of Phase A (Week 8) value and at least 1 post randomization efficacy evaluation for MADRS Total Score in Phase B.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a MADRS Response During Phase B Relative to the End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) for the Efficacy Sample Set</title>
        <description>MADRS response was defined as &gt;=50 percent reduction in MADRS Total Score from end of Phase A (Week 8). The MADRS was utilized as an efficacy assessment of a participant's level of depression. The MADRS consisted of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 6 being the “worst” rating. The MADRS total score were to be unevaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items were recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items were recorded, the MADRS total score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded of to the first decimal place. The MADRS Total Score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a MADRS Response During Phase B Relative to the End of Phase A (Week 8 Visit) for the Efficacy Sample Per Final Protocol</title>
        <description>MADRS response was defined as &gt;=50 percent reduction in MADRS Total Score from end of Phase A (Week 8). The MADRS was utilized as an efficacy assessment of a participant's level of depression. The MADRS consisted of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 6 being the “worst” rating. The MADRS total score were to be unevaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items were recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items were recorded, the MADRS total score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded of to the first decimal place. The MADRS Total Score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With a MADRS Remission During Phase B Relative to the End of Phase A (Week 8) for the Efficacy Sample Set</title>
        <description>MADRS remission was defined as a &lt; or equal to 10 and &gt; or equal to 50% reduction in MADRS Total Score from end of Phase A (Week 8). The MADRS was utilized as an efficacy assessment of a participant's level of depression. The MADRS consisted of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 6 being the “worst” rating. The MADRS total score were to be unevaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items were recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items were recorded, the MADRS total score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded of to the first decimal place. The MADRS Total Score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>

        <description>MADRS remission was defined as a &lt; or equal to 10 and &gt; or equal to 50% reduction in MADRS Total Score from end of Phase A (Week 8). The MADRS was utilized as an efficacy assessment of a participant's level of depression. The MADRS consisted of 10 items, all rated on a 0 to 6 scale with 0 being the “best” rating and 6 being the “worst” rating. The MADRS total score were to be unevaluable if less than 8 of the 10 items were recorded. If 8 or 9 of the 10 items were recorded, the MADRS total score was the mean of the recorded items multiplied by 10 and then rounded of to the first decimal place. The MADRS Total Score is the sum of ratings for all 10 items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 60, with higher values indicating worse outcome.</description>
