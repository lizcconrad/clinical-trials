  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase 1, open label, multiple dose study in healthy male and female volunteers.
      Subjects received intranasal ketorolac tromethamine (30 mg) three times daily (t.i.d.) for
      three days (seven doses in total). Doses were administered every eight hours.

      The objective of this study in healthy volunteers was to determine the safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of intranasal ketorolac tromethamine.

        <description>PK analysis by standard model independent methods was performed by a pharmacokineticist using WinNonlin Professional. Actual blood sampling times were converted to a time from dosing (elapsed time). Elapsed times were listed by subject for each treatment, together with the individual plasma concentrations of ketorolac.</description>
        <time_frame>Blood samples for determination of plasma concentration of ketorolac were taken immediately prior to each dose and every hour for 8 hours post-dose on Day 3 (morning doses)</time_frame>
