  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open label, two way crossover study in healthy male subjects. Two treatments were
      administered to each subject, one treatment per study period, in a randomized manner.
      Subjects remained resident in the Clinical Unit from the evening of Day 1 until the morning
      of Day 2 of each period and there was a washout period of at least 2 days between treatments.
      A post study medical examination was performed prior to discharge in Period 2.

      The objective of this study was to assess the effects of a single dose of intranasal
      oxymetazoline hydrochloride on the pharmacokinetics of intranasal ketorolac in healthy male
      subjects.
