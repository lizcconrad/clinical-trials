  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a non-randomized, open label study in healthy male and female volunteers. A single
      intranasal dose of 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine was administered to all subjects on Days 1
      and 6; in addition, subjects received a daily intranasal dose of 200 Âµg fluticasone
      propionate on Days 2-6. Subjects remained resident in the Clinical Unit from the evening of
      Day 1 until the morning of Day 2 and from the evening of Day 5 until the morning of Day 7,
      and made ambulatory visits to the Clinical Unit on the morning of Days 3-5. A post study
      medical was performed within 7 days of study completion.

      The objective of this study was to assess the effects of chronic administration of
      fluticasone propionate on the pharmacokinetics of intranasal ketorolac in healthy male and
      female subjects.
