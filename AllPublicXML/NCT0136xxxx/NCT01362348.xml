  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MD7114987 is a Phase 2a study designed to determine whether pazopanib eye drops have the
      potential to reduce retinal edema and maintain or improve visual acuity in persons with a
      previously untreated subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesion secondary to
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to further characterize the safety and
      tolerability of pazopanib eye drops administered over a 12-week period.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Lesion Thickness (CRT) as Measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>CRT was the distance between the inner limiting membrane of the retina and the inner border of the retinal pigment epithelium/choriocapillaris band, inclusive of sub retinal fluid, measured in the central 1 millimeter (mm) of the Cube scan. OCT assessments were performed using SPECTRALIS spectral domain OCT. Images were evaluated by investigator for safety monitoring, and by a central reading center for eligibility determination and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects. Observed case (OC) data set was used for analysis in this analysis dataset, a missing assessment at any scheduled time point was considered unevaluable, was not imputed and was not included in data analysis. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Best Correct Visual Acuity (BCVA) as Measured by the Number of Letters Determined by Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy [ETDRS] Study Visual Acuity (EVA) at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -3 to -1) and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA was measured in the study eye using the EVA chart starting at a test distance of 4 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the participant. A decrease in the BCVA score indicates a worsening of vision while higher scores indicates improvement of VA. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Lesion Thickness (CRLT) Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week -3 to -1) Up to Follow-up (Day 102)</time_frame>
    <description>CRLT was the manual measurement of the distance between the inner limiting membrane of the retina and the inner border of the choriocapillaris, inclusive of subretinal or sub-retinal pigment epithelium fluid collections and of the thickness of any observable choroidal neovascular membrane or scar tissue, evaluated in the central 1 mm of the Cube scan. OCT assessments were performed using SPECTRALIS spectral domain OCT. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Intraretinal (IR) or Subretinal (SR) Fluid Thickness, Intraretinal Cysts or Serous Retinal Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED Thickness) Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week -3 to -1) Up to Follow-up (Day 102)</time_frame>
    <description>OCT was used for the determination of retinal morphology changes in the study eye which included assessments of SR fluid (an exudate between the retina and choroid from various sources including the vitreous cavity, subarachnoid space, or abnormal vessels) and PED (retinal pigment epithelium separates from the underlying Bruch's membrane due to the presence of blood, serous exudate, drusen, or a neovascular membrane). Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in BCVA Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week -3 to -1) Up to Follow-up (Day 102)</time_frame>
    <description>BCVA was measured in the study eye using the EVA chart starting at a test distance of 4 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the participant. A decrease in the BCVA score indicates a worsening of vision while higher scores indicates improvement of VA. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Area of Choroidal Neovascular (CNV) Size and CNV Total Lesion Complex Size as Measured by Fluorescein Angiography (FA) at Day 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -3 to -1) and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>CNV was the measurement of the combined classic and occult neovascular lesion including areas of classic neovascularization, late staining of undetermined origin and fibrovascular PED. CNV total lesion complex size was the measurement of the entire lesion including classic and occult neovascular components as well as contagious blood and/or blocked fluorescence and/or serous PED. FA uses fundus photography (FP) to capture images of injected dye circulating throughout the retinal blood vessels to assess leaking, swelling/circulation problems caused by various eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy and wet macular degeneration. A fluorescein angiogram was obtained at Day 29. Images were evaluated by investigator for eligibility and by a central reading center for determination of PD effect. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Change in Charactertsics (Atrophy, Pigment, SR Hemorrhage, IR Hemorrhage, SR Fluid and Fibrosis) as Measured by FP</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Fundus photography involves capturing of images of the center of the very back inner wall of the eye — the retina, optic nerve, macula and main retinal blood vessels. The parameters assessment were heme SR hemorrhage (absence or presence at the location), heme IR hemorrhage (absence or presence at the location), SR fluid (absence or presence at location), fibrosis (absence or presence at location), atrophy (absence or presence of atrophic changes) and pigment (absence or presence at location). A protocol set of fundus photographs were obtained at Day 29. Images were read by the investigator for eligibility determination, and by a central reading center for determination of PD effect. Data has been presented for number of participants with changes in eye characteristics in the study eye at Day 29.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Received Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to follow-up (Day 102)</time_frame>
    <description>At any time during the study, including the follow-up period, rescue treatment (standard of care) was given based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. Rescue treatment was to be strongly considered for participants whose center subfield thickness had increased by &gt;50 microns from the lowest value on study or whose BCVA decreased by more than 5 letters compared to baseline and who also had persistent fluid by OCT. Data has been reported for the number of participants with their percentages who required any rescue medication administration until follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Ocular Adverse Events (AEs), Non-ocular AEs, Serious Ocular AEs and Serious Non-ocular AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Until Follow-up (Day 102)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Lesion Thickness (CRT) as Measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) at Day 29</title>
        <description>CRT was the distance between the inner limiting membrane of the retina and the inner border of the retinal pigment epithelium/choriocapillaris band, inclusive of sub retinal fluid, measured in the central 1 millimeter (mm) of the Cube scan. OCT assessments were performed using SPECTRALIS spectral domain OCT. Images were evaluated by investigator for safety monitoring, and by a central reading center for eligibility determination and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects. Observed case (OC) data set was used for analysis in this analysis dataset, a missing assessment at any scheduled time point was considered unevaluable, was not imputed and was not included in data analysis. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>

        <description>BCVA was measured in the study eye using the EVA chart starting at a test distance of 4 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the participant. A decrease in the BCVA score indicates a worsening of vision while higher scores indicates improvement of VA. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Lesion Thickness (CRLT) Over Time</title>
        <description>CRLT was the manual measurement of the distance between the inner limiting membrane of the retina and the inner border of the choriocapillaris, inclusive of subretinal or sub-retinal pigment epithelium fluid collections and of the thickness of any observable choroidal neovascular membrane or scar tissue, evaluated in the central 1 mm of the Cube scan. OCT assessments were performed using SPECTRALIS spectral domain OCT. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in BCVA Over Time</title>
        <description>BCVA was measured in the study eye using the EVA chart starting at a test distance of 4 meters. The BCVA score is the number of letters read correctly by the participant. A decrease in the BCVA score indicates a worsening of vision while higher scores indicates improvement of VA. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Area of Choroidal Neovascular (CNV) Size and CNV Total Lesion Complex Size as Measured by Fluorescein Angiography (FA) at Day 29</title>
        <description>CNV was the measurement of the combined classic and occult neovascular lesion including areas of classic neovascularization, late staining of undetermined origin and fibrovascular PED. CNV total lesion complex size was the measurement of the entire lesion including classic and occult neovascular components as well as contagious blood and/or blocked fluorescence and/or serous PED. FA uses fundus photography (FP) to capture images of injected dye circulating throughout the retinal blood vessels to assess leaking, swelling/circulation problems caused by various eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy and wet macular degeneration. A fluorescein angiogram was obtained at Day 29. Images were evaluated by investigator for eligibility and by a central reading center for determination of PD effect. Baseline was defined as the assessments performed between Day -3 to -1. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-randomization value at Day 29.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Change in Charactertsics (Atrophy, Pigment, SR Hemorrhage, IR Hemorrhage, SR Fluid and Fibrosis) as Measured by FP</title>
        <description>Fundus photography involves capturing of images of the center of the very back inner wall of the eye — the retina, optic nerve, macula and main retinal blood vessels. The parameters assessment were heme SR hemorrhage (absence or presence at the location), heme IR hemorrhage (absence or presence at the location), SR fluid (absence or presence at location), fibrosis (absence or presence at location), atrophy (absence or presence of atrophic changes) and pigment (absence or presence at location). A protocol set of fundus photographs were obtained at Day 29. Images were read by the investigator for eligibility determination, and by a central reading center for determination of PD effect. Data has been presented for number of participants with changes in eye characteristics in the study eye at Day 29.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.</description>
