  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated pharmacological
      study with a crossover design. Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ST-elevation myocardial
      infarction, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, unstable angina) and presenting high
      on-clopidogrel platelet reactivity as assessed with the VerifyNow assay (platelet reactivity
      units PRU≥235) 24 hours post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), will be randomized
      after informed consent in a 1:1 ratio to either prasugrel 10mg/d or ticagrelor 90mg twice a
      day for 15 days. Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed at Day 15±2 days and then a
      crossover directly to the alternate treatment group for an additional 15 days period, without
      an intervening washout period will be carried out. Patients will return at Day 30±2 days for
      platelet reactivity assessment.
