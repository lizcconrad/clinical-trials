    <textblock>
      The sponsor electively terminated the study because the risk mitigation measures, deemed
      necessary after an unforeseen safety event, could not be effectively implemented within this
      protocol while maintaining study timelines within a reasonable time frame.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate atacicept's effects in subjects who have lupus nephritis, at least 2
      g/day of protein in the urine, and are already taking mycophenolate mofetil. The evaluations
      will include the concentrations of atacicept in the blood, the effects of atacicept on
      immunoglobulins (antibodies), and any side effects. The first subjects will be given a low
      dose. Following periodic reviews of the trial data, subsequent subjects are planned to
      receive one of 2 progressively higher doses of atacicept.
