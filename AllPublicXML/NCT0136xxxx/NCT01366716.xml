  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contingency management (CM) is a demonstrably efficacious intervention for substance abuse
      and dependence. Although CM protocols have employed a variety of reinforcers, they have
      almost exclusively relied upon non-cash privileges (e.g., take-home methadone doses), prizes,
      or vouchers that can be exchanged for goods or services. Despite the strong empirical support
      for CM, our research suggests that concerns relating to its cost and safety (e.g., potential
      for harm caused by rewards undermining intrinsic motivation or being sold to purchase drugs)
      have hindered its transfer to real-world practice. The exclusive use of non-cash CM likely
      stems from the untested assumption that clients will use cash incentives to buy drugs or
      engage in other high-risk behaviors. This assumption is problematic for two reasons. First,
      the use of non-cash incentives may add substantial costs and complexity to CM protocols.
      Second, the use of non-cash incentives may reduce the efficacy of CM interventions, as
      research suggests that cash may be a more effective reinforcer than vouchers. This study
      examines both practical and ethical issues relating to cash-based CM procedures. This study
      consists of three phases; a main experiment, a &quot;Cash Bowl&quot; pilot, and a &quot;Thinning&quot; Pilot.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the main phase of the study, we used a 3-group randomized study to compare the efficacy,
      cost-effectiveness, and ethics of a (1) voucher-based CM intervention, (2) cash-based CM
      intervention, and (3) non-CM intervention. Two hundred thirty seven consenting
      cocaine-dependent clients were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. In this main
      we examined outcomes related to (1) efficacy, including UDS-confirmed abstinence and
      counseling attendance; (2) cost-effectiveness; and (3) ethics, including the effects on
      intrinsic motivation, drug use, and other high-risk behavior. This investigation addressed
      practical issues pertaining to the transfer of CM interventions into community-based
      treatment programs, and provided empirical evidence refuting ethical criticisms that have
      been levied against the use of cash and CM interventions.

      The second phase expanded on the main study with a pilot examination of a probabilistic
      reinforcement CM schedule. Probabilistic methods are considered less expensive to implement
      yet equally efficacious, as a reward is not provided each time target behaviors are
      exhibited, yet similar outcomes result. In this pilot study, an additional 70 participants
      were randomized into either a traditional voucher-based probability reinforcement CM
      schedule, (&quot;FishBowl&quot; CM), a cash-based probability reinforcement CM schedule (&quot;CashBowl&quot;
      CM), or a standard non-CM intervention. As in the main study, we examined these conditions in
      terms of efficacy, associated costs and cost-effectiveness, and potential ethical risks.

      The third phase of this study is a pilot that seeks to examine the efficacy of a traditional
      &quot;thinning&quot; reinforcement schedule compared to an escalating reinforcement schedule or a
      treatment-as-usual (non-contingency management control) condition in improving the
      during-treatment and post-treatment outcomes of cocaine dependent outpatients in
      community-based treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment
      conditions: Escalating CM Condition (n = 15), Traditional (&quot;thinning&quot;) CM Condition (n = 15),
      and Non-CM Control Condition (n = 15). The intervention will last a total of 16 weeks.
      Participants assigned to each of the experimental conditions will receive different
      contingency and reward procedures during study weeks 1-12; they will receive identical
      contingency and reward procedures during study weeks 13-16. Participants assigned to the
      control condition will not receive any contingencies or rewards during the entire 16 week
      study. As in the main study, we will examine these conditions in terms of efficacy,
      associated costs and cost-effectiveness, and potential ethical risks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be a new intake to the Parkside treatment program.

          2. Meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for current cocaine dependence as assessed by the
             Substance Use Disorders section of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV
             (SCID-I). (In our past studies at this same facility, 60% of the clients met DSM-IV
             criteria for current cocaine dependence).

          3. Be capable of providing valid contact information. We have found that a small
             proportion of participants may provide false contact information, and we consider this
             to be a passive strategy for refusing research participation. Therefore, the RA will
             immediately attempt to verify the contact information.

          4. Be capable of providing informed consent.

          5. Be willing and capable of fulfilling the requirements of the research protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to provide informed consent

          2. Not currently receiving treatment at Parkside Treatment facility.
