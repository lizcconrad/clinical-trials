  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether early exercise in critically ill patients will decrease
      inflammatory markers, increase pro-inflammatory markers and prevent loss of muscle mass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of an early targeted rehabilitation program on
      inflammatory markers and muscle mass in patients with sepsis syndromes in intensive care.

      The Primary Hypothesis is that an early targeted rehabilitation ICU patients with sepsis
      syndromes over 7 days will Prevent loss of lean muscle mass by within 7 days of recruitment
      to the study. Decrease pro-inflammatory and increase anti-inflammatory cytokines within 7
      days of recruitment to the study.
