      The primary aim of the study is to derive and validate risk scores for vascular endpoints
      (recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and other complications of stroke) and for death
      following an incident stroke. For this purpose patients with an incident stroke will be
      followed for 36 months with additional assessments at 3, 12, 24 and 36 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Risk of vascular disease including stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death is high
      after stroke but there are only few prognostic models for long term risk up to 3 years. About
      850 patients with an incident stroke will be followed for 3 years with assessments at
      baseline and at 3, 12, 24, and 36 months. Factors that have already been reported to be
      significant predictors of vascular diseases in previous studies as well as new biomarkers
      (e.g. neuroimaging, blood based biomarkers) identified in this cohort will be considered. The
      improvement of discrimination including these new variables in the models will be
      investigated. Several measures of improving predictive properties (e.g. calibration,
      discrimination, net reclassification) will be used to compare predictive models with
      different complexity. The model will be validated using the bootstrap method (internal
      validation) and an independent external sample in cooperation with the prospective CSB-stroke
      cohort.
