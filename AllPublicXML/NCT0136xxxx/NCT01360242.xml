      In the setting of primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), the investigators
      hypothesize that a 24-48 hour delay strategy of stenting after successful thrombus aspiration
      and establishment of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI)-3 flow with optimal
      antithrombotic therapy may decrease the risk of MicroVascular Obstruction (MVO) as assessed
      by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI).

    <textblock>
      Primary PCI is the reperfusion therapy of choice in patients with acute ST-elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) [Van de Werf et al. 2008; Kushner et al. 2009]. The first
      objective in primary PCI is to restore TIMI-3 flow. However, despite restoration of TIMI-3
      flow, myocardial reperfusion remains suboptimal in a significant proportion of patients,
      predominantly as a consequence of the so called &quot;myocardial non-reperfusion phenomenon&quot;,
      &quot;low/no-reflow phenomenon&quot; or MVO. This, in turn, is associated with significant morbidity
      and mortality [Brodie et al. 2005; Bruder et al. 2008; Hombach et al. 2005; Nijveldt et al.
      2008; Thiele et al. 2008; Wu et al. 1998]. Although TIMI flow is well assessed by
      angiography, contrast-enhanced CMRI remains the gold standard in the assessment of MVO.
      Indeed, the presence and extent of hypoenhanced areas have been shown to be associated with a
      poor outcome [Bruder et al. 2008; Hombach et al. 2005; Nijveldt et al. 2008; Wu et al. 1998].

      There is now a large body of evidence to suggest that even in patients with TIMI-3 flow on
      angiography, as many as 60% of these patients will subsequently exhibit MVO with CMRI [Brodie
      et al. 2005; Bruder et al. 2008; Hombach et al. 2005; Nijveldt et al. 2008; Thiele et al.
      2008; Wu et al. 1998]. Our knowledge of the mechanisms of MVO occurrence as well as measures
      to reduce MVO has been considerably enhanced by recent publications. For instance, Sianos et
      al. [2007] demonstrated that the thrombus burden at the time of angiography is an independent
      predictor of MVO extension and 2-year mortality. Furthermore, Isaaz et al. [2006] recommended
      a two-step strategy as a means of minimising the risk of MVO, with the first step consisting
      of TIMI-3 flow restoration, followed 2-6 days later by further angiography to determine the
      therapeutic strategy of choice (PCI, cardiac surgery, or medical treatment: 67%, 25%, and 8%
      respectively). Meneveau et al. [2009] also adopted a two-step strategy in a small cohort of
      STEMI patients with TIMI-3 flow and ST-segment regression at the time of the procedure. They
      demonstrated that a 24-hour delay in stent implantation led to a higher rate of procedural
      success than immediate stenting. Isaaz et al. [2006] and Meneveau et al. [2009] also reported
      a decreased thrombus burden and no culprit-artery re-occlusion between the first and the
      second procedure.

      Both the Thrombus Aspiration during Percutaneous coronary intervention in Acute myocardial
      infarction Study (TAPAS) [Svilaas et al. 2008] and the thrombectomy with EXPort catheter in
      Infarct-Related Artery during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (EXPIRA) [Sardella
      et al. 2009] studies demonstrated the benefits of thrombus aspiration as the first step in
      primary PCI prior to either ballooning or direct stenting. However, as the effects of
      stenting upon MVO in the setting of acute STEMI remain poorly understood, we propose a
      randomized study to evaluate the benefits of a 24-48-hour delay in stent implantation
      compared to immediate stenting in patients presenting with acute STEMI who will undergo
      primary PCI.

    <description>Thrombus aspiration is performed to achieve TIMI-3 flow. Once TIMI-3 flow is restored and sustained for &gt; 10 minutes, the initial procedure is stopped regardless of the presence of any residual stenosis. A second coronary angiogram is performed 24-48 hours later and the physician is free to decide on the best treatment, i.e. surgery, medical treatment, or stent implantation (drug-eluting stent if indicated for on-label patients). If stenting is required and the thrombus is still too large (greater than twice the artery width), the physician could postpone stent implantation for days or weeks.</description>
