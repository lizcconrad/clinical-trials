  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center cross-sectional study in which the Real-time Tissue Elastography®
      measurements will be collected prospectively from patients with chronic hepatitis B or C
      virus presenting for liver biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to validate the diagnostic value of Real-time Tissue Elastography®
      by comparison with liver histology, serum marker or FibroScan® in chronic hepatitis B or C
      patients.Real-time Tissue Elastography®, biopsy and serum maker are performed.

      If in the hospital they can perform FibroScan®, FobroScan® also be performed. The subjects
      must be scheduled for liver biopsy either prior to treatment (treatment naïve) or, if
      previously treated, they must have been off treatment for at least six months. The time
      between the Real-time Tissue Elastography® , biopsy, blood sampling and FiroScan® must not
      exceed four weeks.

    <description>To evaluate the correlation between Real-time Tissue Elastography® index and histological diagnosis (the gold standard for liver fibrosis), we calculate sensitivity and specificity, ROC curves.
Sensitivity, specificity and ROC curves obtained under below stiations:
liver fibrosis index diagnose of histological diagnosis F4
liver fibrosis index diagnose of histological diagnosis F3 or greater
liver fibrosis index diagnose of histological diagnosis F2 or greater</description>
