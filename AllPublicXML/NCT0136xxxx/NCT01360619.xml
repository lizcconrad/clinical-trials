      The researchers believe that the multifunction Keito devices shares with TANITA TBF-300
      (K014009) the same efficacy on the body fat measurement. Even if the body contact points are
      not the same, the researchers deeply believe that the tetrapolar BIA used by the predicate
      gives results as similar as the multifunction keito does.

      177 volunteers were enrolled in this clinical Study. Before taking the fat measurement by the
      devices under test, the observers measured the weight and height of each volunteer prior to
      measure the body fat. This was done to configure a preliminary idea about the body
      composition of the subject.

      Both devices are designed by the same technology to emit a low current through the body, and
      finally make a measurement of the impedance found between the body contact points. We
      expected the results to be very similar.

        To include the maximum types of patients, the selection was opened to all the general
        public who could use the multifunction Keito in a public site, where is is intended to be
        placed. The test was carried out following the user's manual rules about who can use the
        device.
