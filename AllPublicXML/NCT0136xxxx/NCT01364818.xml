  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed research is to study the potential changes in biomarkers of
      patients with neurodevelopmental disorders in response to treatment in clinical trials or in
      private psychiatry practice utilizing non-invasive psychophysiological measurements. The
      investigators plan to obtain psychophysical measurements throughout several periods of
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will employ a non-invasive custom-built four-point vertical displacement
      stimulator. This is used to deliver sinusoidal vibrations at very low amplitudes (0-400
      microns) to the tips of the fingers. The forearm of the subject rests on the stimulator, the
      finger tips are vibrated, and the subject answers questions prompted by a computer monitor
      about their perception of the stimuli. Research staff may explain questions and prompts in a
      way that may be better understood by the subjects if the subjects experience any difficulty.

      This device will be used to obtain objective psychophysical measurements as subjects undergo
      treatment. The investigators hope that this study will eventually assist in the long term
      goal of studying ways to develop diagnostic methods, based on changes in cortical information
      processing capabilities that occur with neurodevelopmental disorders. This would enable
      clinicians to more objectively determine prognosis and the best course of intervention for
      their patients.

      This study will consent up to 60 subjects who are have initiated or changed pharmacologic
      treatment as either a participant in a clinical trial or as a private patient of one of the
      study doctors. Subjects who are a participant in another clinical trial may be one an active
      medication or a non-active medication(placebo). Subjects will have 7 visits in this study (w0
      prior to initiating new treatment, and 4,8, 26 52,78 and 104 weeks after starting the the new
      treatment. The latter visits may occur either while the individual is taking the medication
      or after the individual has stopped treatment (in order to assess persistence of
      treatment-related changes).
