      The drug being tested in this study is called Lu AA21004. Lu AA21004 is being tested to treat
      people who have major depressive disorder (MDD). This study will look at sexual function in
      people who take Lu AA21004.

      The study will enroll approximately 440 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Lu AA21004 10 to 20 mg

        -  Escitalopram 10 to 20 mg - This is a comparator drug that is also used to treat MDD.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to answer questionnaires at each study visit.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in the United States and Canada. The overall time
      to participate in this study is 14 weeks. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic, and
      will be contacted by telephone 21 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short-Form (CSFQ-14) Total Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The CSFQ-14 is a structured self reported questionnaire designed to measure illness- and medication-related changes in sexual functioning consisting of 14 items that measure sexual functioning as a total score (14 items) and on the subscales of pleasure (1 item), desire/frequency (2 items), desire/interest (3 items), arousal (3 items), and orgasm (3 items), rated on an 5 point scale from 1 to 5 with a total score range from 14 to 70. Higher scores reflect higher sexual functioning. A positive change from Baseline indicates that symptoms have improved. The primary analysis was based on a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) analysis of covariance with treatment, center, week, treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects, Baseline CSFQ-14 total score-by-week as covariate, and a completely unstructured covariance matrix.</description>

    <description>The CSFQ-14 is a structured self reported questionnaire designed to measure illness- and medication-related changes in sexual functioning consisting of 14 items that measure sexual functioning as a total score (14 items) and on the subscales of pleasure (1 item), desire/frequency (2 items), desire/interest (3 items), arousal (3 items), and orgasm (3 items), rated on an 5 point scale from 1 to 5 with a total score range from 14 to 70. Higher scores reflect higher sexual functioning. Normal sexual functioning is defined as a CSFQ-14 total score of &gt;41 for women and &gt;47 for men. Abnormal sexual functioning is defined as a CSFQ-14 total score of ≤41 for women and ≤47 for men. All subjects entered the study with abnormal sexual functioning. A shift to normal indicates that symptoms have improved.</description>

          <title>Profile of Mood States (POMS) Brief Total Score</title>
          <description>POMS brief is a rating scale, which comprises of 30 items that are evaluated in a 0-4 scale (0=not at all and 4=extremely). The scores for the 30 items are added in various combinations to throw six validated factors which are used to calculate total POMS score: (tension-anxiety) + (depression-dejection) + (anger-hostility)+ (fatigue-Inertia) + (confusion-bewilderment) - (vigor-activity). Score range (-40 to 192). Score -40 denotes the best score and score 192 denotes the worst score. The number of participants with available data were 224 and 219 in each treatment arm respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire Short-Form (CSFQ-14) Total Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>The CSFQ-14 is a structured self reported questionnaire designed to measure illness- and medication-related changes in sexual functioning consisting of 14 items that measure sexual functioning as a total score (14 items) and on the subscales of pleasure (1 item), desire/frequency (2 items), desire/interest (3 items), arousal (3 items), and orgasm (3 items), rated on an 5 point scale from 1 to 5 with a total score range from 14 to 70. Higher scores reflect higher sexual functioning. A positive change from Baseline indicates that symptoms have improved. The primary analysis was based on a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) analysis of covariance with treatment, center, week, treatment-by-week interaction as fixed effects, Baseline CSFQ-14 total score-by-week as covariate, and a completely unstructured covariance matrix.</description>
