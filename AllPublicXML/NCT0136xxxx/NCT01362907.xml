    <measure>Corrected Distance Monocular Visual Measurement Reported as Visual Acuity (VA)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of wear, replacing lenses daily</time_frame>
    <description>As tested for each eye individually while wearing study lenses. VA was measured using a Snellen chart, which was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equated to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and was considered normal distance eyesight. Positive logMAR values indicated poorer vision, and negative values denoted better visual acuity.</description>

    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of wear, replacing lenses daily</time_frame>
    <description>As interpreted by the participant and recorded on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of 1 week of wear time. Overall comfort was evaluated binocularly and rated on a 10-point scale, with 1 being poor and 10 being excellent.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week of wear, replacing lenses daily</time_frame>
    <description>As assessed for each eye individually by the investigator using a biomicroscope, which magnifies the appearance of the contact lens on the participant's eye. Lens fit is reported on a 5-point scale, with 2=unacceptably loose, 1=acceptably loose, 0=optimal, -1=acceptably tight, and -2=unacceptably tight.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anterior segment infection, inflammation, or abnormality.

          -  Any active anterior segment ocular disease that would contraindicate contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any use of systemic medications for which contact lens wear could be contraindicated
             as determined by the investigator.
