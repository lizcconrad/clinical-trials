  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Competence Centre for Transcultural Psychiatry is a clinic specialised in the treatment
      of traumatised refugees. There is a lack of studies on treatment effect in traumatised
      refugees. There are several studies indicating an effect of cognitive behavioural therapy
      (CBT) in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). A few studies point to that CBT could be
      effective in traumatised refugees. There are no studies examining if some methods used in CBT
      are more useful than others in traumatised refugees. The aim of this study is to examine the
      effect of CBT with focus on Stress Management versus cognitive restructuring. Patients
      included in this study will be randomised to either Stress Management or cognitive
      restructuring. All referred patients will receive medical treatment as usual (described in
      the clinic's manual for medical doctors, 2011). All patients that fulfill the inclusion
      criteria will be included in the study. Hopefully this study will contribute to improve the
      psychotherapeutic treatment offered to traumatised refugees.
