    <textblock>
      PBA is a neurologic condition that is estimated to impact over a million patients and their
      families in the United States. PBA occurs secondary to an otherwise unrelated neurologic
      disease or injury, and manifests as involuntary, frequent, and disruptive outbursts of crying
      and/or laughing. Progress has been made in better understanding this debilitating condition,
      but much more needs to be done. That's why a new PBA patient registry, PRISM (Pseudobulbar
      Affect RegIstry Series), has been initiated.

      The goal of PRISM is to establish the prevalence and quality of life (QOL) impact of PBA in
      patients with underlying neurologic conditions including

        -  Alzheimer's disease

        -  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

        -  Multiple sclerosis

        -  Parkinson's disease

        -  Stroke

        -  Traumatic brain injury

      Because this is an observational registry, it doesn't require you to intervene with any
      specific treatment or procedure. Your participation allows the PRISM registry to collect and
      analyze data from your site and also compare it to national numbers captured in the PRISM
      registry about PBA across all of the major at-risk neurologic populations.

    <description>The objective of the registry is to determine the prevalence of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) in patients with certain underlying neurologic conditions: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's Disease (PD), Stroke (STR), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Presence of PBA symptoms was defined as CNS-LS score &gt;=13.</description>
