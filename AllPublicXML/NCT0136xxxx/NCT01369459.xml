  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to develop and test a brief protocol designed to systematically
      integrate pharmacological interventions for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
      into behavioral treatment services for adolescent substance users with co-morbid ADHD in
      everyday care. Primary study aims will yield proof-of-concept data on MIP feasibility and
      fidelity in usual care and evidence of MIP impact on psychiatric and behavioral services
      utilization, medication acceptance and compliance, and satisfaction with treatment services.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Version 5.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up in 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>MINI is a structured diagnostic interview that assesses DSM-IV diagnoses in adolescents and is designed for administration by lay interviewers. Adolescents and caregivers will complete the Inattentive and Hyperactive/Impulsive scales.</description>

    <measure>Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up at 3-months</time_frame>
    <description>The BRIEF is a parent-report measure of behavioral problems linked to executive functioning and commonly observed in ADHD youth. The BRIEF has been validated on ADHD outpatient samples and teens with mixed clinical diagnoses. This study will use 4 scales: Inhibition, Behavioral Shift, Emotional Control, Plan/Organize.</description>

    <description>We intend for MIP to be a 5-session, family-based protocol delivered during the early portion of ASU treatment. MIP will contain three elements deemed essential for integrating pharmacological interventions into outpatient behavioral treatment for youth: (1) standardized psychiatric assessment and family-focused psychoeducation about the target problem; (2) an approved medication regimen with demonstrated efficacy for comorbid populations; (3) family-based interventions for medication acceptance and coordination of psychiatric and behavioral services. MIP will incorporate research-proven interventions from each of these core areas.</description>
