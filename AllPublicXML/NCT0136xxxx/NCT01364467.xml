  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 14-day, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, masked clinical trial of
      oral guaifenesin for the therapy of Chronic Rhinitis in 36 children between the ages of 7 and
      18 years. The study investigates the effectiveness of guaifenesin in the relief of nasal
      symptoms in children with CRS using the sinonasal 5 survey (SN-5) in comparison to nasal
      airway volume, and biophysical properties of nasal secretion. The investigators hypothesize
      that Guaifenesin use over a period of 14 days improves subjective nasal complaints in
      pediatric patients with chronic rhinitis and nasal congestion, as measured by the SN-5 survey
      compared to use of placebo. There will be an observed improvement in nasal volume and
      cross-sectional area following use of guaifenesin, and nasal secretions will have more
      favorable mucociliary and sneeze clearability compared to use of placebo.
