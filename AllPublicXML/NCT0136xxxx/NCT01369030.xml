      This study will be an observational study in which patients who have been prescribed Deplin®
      are invited to participate in surveys regarding their experiences with Deplin®. The purpose
      of this study is to increase the understanding of the role of L-methylfolate among patients
      who are candidates for Deplin®, provide patients with personalized education and support, and
      contribute to the overall understanding of the needs and concerns of patients being treated
      for depression.

      Surveys used to conduct this study will be administered via telephone or online by
      InfoMedics, Inc., a company with a system for developing such patient-physician feedback
      programs. Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program
      after Deplin® has been prescribed and provide them with a brochure containing an introduction
      to the program and instructions on how to enroll. Patients self-enroll, take a brief survey
      before starting their Deplin® prescription, and then a follow-up survey after 90 days of
      treatment with Deplin®. As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will
      receive individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and
      progress. Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to
      continue taking Deplin® as directed. Patients will also receive educational materials about
      managing their depression.

    <measure>Change in Depression Severity as Measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Endpoint (90 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a depression scale used to assess brief depression severity by rating symptoms and functional impairment experienced in the last two weeks. The questionnaire contains a total of 9 questions, and each question is scored on a range from 0-3. The minimum value &quot;0&quot; represents not at all, &quot;1&quot; several days, &quot;2&quot; indicates more than half the days, and the maximum value &quot;3&quot; stands for nearly every day. The total possible range is 0-27. The total number of each 0, 1, 2, 3 is added and multiplied by its value (0=0, 1=1, etc.) to produce a total score generated from the subtotal sum. The PHQ-9 total score is interpreted as follows: 0-4 represents minimal depression, 5-9 as mild depression, 10-14 as moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, and 20-27 severe depression.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Between November 2010 and January 2012, patients of at least 18 years of age who had been prescribed Deplin® by their physician for the treatment of major depression were offered to participate in the study by their prescibing physician, consisting of about 550 participating physicians located at various clinical sites country-wide.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants may have excluded themselves from the overall study after self-enrolling in the program if they did not complete the designated surveys prior to using Deplin® (Baseline) or at the 90-day time point post-treatment initiation.</pre_assignment_details>
