    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to develop a patient reported outcome tool specific to small airways
      disease, which assesses symptoms and signs of small airways disease and may help in addition
      to FEF50% to discriminate between asthmatic patients with and without small airways disease.

      Inflammation of the small airways contributes to the severity of the disease and affects the
      quality of life of patients with asthma. However, the exact role and relevance of small
      airways disease in asthma is still unclear. This is partly due to the difficulty of measuring
      small airways pathology with a sensitive and specific parameter. The most commonly used
      variable as an indicator of small airway obstruction is the FEF50%. Currently, it is not
      known which clinical symptoms are associated with small airways disease and how a patient
      will perceive small airway abnormalities. This knowledge is important to assess small airways
      disease in patients with asthma and adjust therapy to improve quality of life.The primary
      purpose of this study is to develop a questionnaire for patients with asthma with and without
      small airways disease for general and specialist practice.
