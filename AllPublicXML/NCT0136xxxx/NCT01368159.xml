      The trial objectives are to compare efficacy relative to pain, along the route of the vein
      following echoguided endovenous injection of sclerotherapeutic foam into the Great Saphenous
      vein, of class III microfibre compression (centred at 25 mm Hg) versus class I (10-15 mm Hg)
      versus class III cotton compression (20 to 36 mm Hg) over 21 days. The main contrast will be
      the comparison between the first two groups mentioned. All other contrasts will be secondary.
      The &quot;Class I compression&quot; versus &quot;The two class III compressions&quot; contrast will also be
      studied.

      Efficacy will be measured by totalling the VAS scores for maximum pain experienced since the
      morning and evaluated by the patient at the end of the day.

      Consumption of analgesics or the number of days of analgesic treatment necessary for the 3
      compression types used will be compared.

      One of the trial objectives is also to show that regular use of a class III compression
      product leads to a reduction in complications following sclerosis (by reducing the number of
      non-serious/serious complications specific to sclerosis: matting, pigmentation, inflammation,
      development of sclerosis requiring drainage, DVT, pulmonary embolism, etc.). The trial also
      aims to compare the rate of successful sclerosis between the three devices, success being
      defined by complete or partial occlusion of the great saphenous vein, leading to the
      disappearance of reflux at the crural level.

      The other secondary objectives will be patient evaluation of comfort, ease of putting on and
      taking off the compression hose and a global appreciation of the procedure for echoguided
      endovenous injection of sclerotherapeutic foam into the great saphenous vein, followed by
      wearing compression hose.
