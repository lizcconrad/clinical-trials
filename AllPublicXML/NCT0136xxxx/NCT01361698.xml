      program for people diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in according to their
      level of functioning.

      Background: Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) is a curriculum-based psychosocial
      intervention designed as structured program with a recovery-oriented approach. The aim of IMR
      is to rehabilitate people with severe mental illnesses by helping them acquire knowledge and
      skills in managing their illness and achieve personal recovery goals. Previous randomised
      clinical trials indicate that IMR can be implemented with a good effect and a high fidelity
      though further trials are crucial to demonstrate the potential effectiveness of IMR.

      Methods/Design: The trial design is a randomised, assessor-blinded, multi-centre, clinical
      trial of the IMR program compared with treatment as usual for 200 participants diagnosed with
      schizophrenia or bipolar disorder under the care of two community mental health centres in
      the Capital Region of Denmark. The primary outcome is level of functioning at the end of
      treatment and at follow-up 21 months after baseline. The secondary outcomes are disease
      symptoms; use of alcohol/drugs; individual meaning of recovery; hope; hospital admissions and
      out-patient psychiatric treatment at the end of treatment and at follow-up 21 months after
      baseline.

    <description>The program is organised into 11 curriculum topic areas: recovery strategies, practical facts about mental illness, the stress-vulnerability model, building social support, using medication effectively, drug and alcohol use, reducing relapses, healthy lifestyle, coping with stress, coping with problems and symptoms, and getting your needs met in the mental health system. In this Danish trial IMR will be implemented in group format with 10 patients assigned to each group and two IMR facilitators, and the IMR program will require nine months of weekly sessions to complete.</description>
