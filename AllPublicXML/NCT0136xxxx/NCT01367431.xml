    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of xanthohumol (XN).
      Small amounts of xanthohumol occur naturally in hops, used to make beer, and XN is also found
      in beer itself. Studies in animals have shown that XN can lower blood sugar and blood lipids
      such as triglycerides, which can contribute to heart disease. The purpose of this study is to
      see how much of the XN is absorbed into the blood and how fast it leaves the body when taken
      by mouth. Once the PK study has been done, the investigators' long-term goal is to learn if
      xanthohumol can lower risk factors for heart disease and type-2 diabetes in humans.

    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measures will be the levels of xanthohumol and its metabolites in blood and urine following a single dose of 20 mg, 60mg, or 180 mg of xanthohumol over a course of six days. These levels will be used to determine the pharmacokinetics of xanthohumol in humans.</description>

        -  BMI 18-32 kg/m2 (to avoid confounders with extreme obesity).

          -  Smoking or non-smoking.

          -  Having normal or clinically acceptable physical examination and clinical laboratory
             tests.

          -  Willing to abstain from beer consumption for four days prior to and during the study
             because beer contains XN and related prenylated (PN) flavonoids, such as IX, 8-PN and
             6-PN.

          -  Not currently taking prescription drugs.

          -  Not having had acute medical conditions, such as hospitalizations or surgeries, at
             least three months prior to entry into the study.

          -  If female, not pregnant (as confirmed by urine pregnancy test), breastfeeding, or
             planning to become pregnant before completing the study, and using effective method of
             contraception (hormonal methods NOT permitted).

          -  If male with a partner of childbearing potential, willing to inform their partner of
             their participation in this clinical study and use highly effective methods of birth
             control during the study.

          -  Not currently following an extreme diet, such as Atkin's, Zone or Ornish, and willing
             to maintain their current diet without extreme changes for the duration of the study.
