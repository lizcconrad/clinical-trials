      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether upper limb ischemic postconditioning can
      improve renal function and decrease ischemic-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing living
      donor kidney transplantation.

    <textblock>
      Ischemic reperfusion injury after kidney transplantation is a common clinical problem
      associated with a high morbidity and mortality. To reduce the adverse effect of ischemic
      reperfusion injury after organ transplantation, various strategies including ischemic
      preconditioning or postconditioning. Remote ischemic postconditioning is one of such
      strategies where brief ischemic reperfusion injury of one organ protects other organs from
      sustained ischemic reperfusion injury. Remote ischemic postconditioning of the limb with a
      tourniquet is a safe and convenient method of postconditioning organs against ischemic
      reperfusion injury. However, the efficacy of remote ischemic postconditioning in patients
      undergoing living donor kidney transplantation needs to be established. Therefore, we
      investigate the efficacy of remote ischemic postconditioning of the upper limb with a
      tourniquet in recipients of kidney transplantation by measuring the markers of acute kidney
      injury.

    <description>Remote ischemic postconditioning consists of three 5-min cycles of upper limb ischemia, which was induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the upper limb free of arteriovenous fistula and inflated to 250 mm Hg, with an intervening 5 min of reperfusion during which the cuff was deflated.</description>
