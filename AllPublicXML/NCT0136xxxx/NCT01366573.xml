      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of GSK1521498 in combination
      with alcohol and to determine the amount of GSK1521498 and alcohol in your blood after you
      have been given these together. The study will also determine whether GSK1521498 will have an
      effect on alcohol liking and consumption.

      The study is to test a new drug which may be used for treating alcohol addiction. The drug
      works by inhibiting the effects of messenger molecules called opioids. These opioids are
      naturally produced within the human body, and are involved in controlling how much alcohol we
      drink and the pleasure we get from drinking alcohol. We believe that GSK1521498 might be
      effective in the treatment of alcohol addiction because it is well known that drugs working
      on similar binding sites in the brain reduce the pleasure we get from drinking alcohol. As
      alcohol can effect the way that a drug is metabolised in the body, The investigators need to
      determine that it is safe to take GSK1521498 in combination with alcohol. and to determine
      the amount of GSK1521498 and alcohol in your blood after you have been given these together.
      The study will also determine whether GSK1521498 will have an effect on alcohol liking and
      consumption.
