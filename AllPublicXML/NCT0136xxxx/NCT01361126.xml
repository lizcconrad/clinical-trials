  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of a Recombinant Coagulation Factor IX
      Albumin Fusion Protein (rIX-FP) for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes in
      subjects who have previously received factor replacement therapy for hemophilia B. The study
      consists of a screening period, a pharmacokinetic (PK) period, followed by approximately a 5
      month treatment period. Subjects will receive weekly routine prophylactic therapy and
      on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes. In addition, subjects who are not on routine
      factor replacement therapy prior to the study will receive only on-demand treatment for
      bleeding episodes.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 10 and Weeks 4, 12 and 20</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of inhibitors against FIX was assessed by the central laboratory by a FIX potency assay. To quantify anti-FIX neutralizing antibodies, the Bethesda assay with the Nijmegen modification was used, and the results expressed as Bethesda Units per mL (BU/mL). A positive inhibitor test is &gt;=0.6 BU/mL.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose and up to 14 days after rIX-FP infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>The plasma concentrations of rIX-FP were measured as FIX activity using a validated, 1-stage assay in a central laboratory for a quantification range from 0.25 to 150% (or 0.25 IU/dL to 150 IU/dL). The PK population comprised all subjects who received at least 1 dose of rIX-FP and for whom a sufficient number of analyzable PK samples had been obtained in order to permit the evaluation of the PK profile of rIX-FP, and who did not receive a dose of rIX-FP or any other FIX product for the treatment of a bleed during the PK sampling period.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 17 subjects were screened and enrolled in the study. Fifteen subjects participated in the pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation period and were administered a dose of 25 IU/kg rIX-FP.
