      Hepatitis A vaccine is the most frequently used traveller's vaccine, yet data on its ability
      to induce protective immunity in immunosuppressed travellers are scarce. The investigators
      assess the hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibody response in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) treated with Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) - inhibitors and/or methotrexate (Mtx).

      Methods: Parameters registered at baseline were: age, sex, duration of disease, medications,
      activity of disease (Visual Analogue Scale=VAS, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability
      Index = HAQ, Disease Activity Score =DAS-28, CRP and total IgG in plasma). Hepatitis A
      vaccine (Epaxal or Havrix) were given at 0 and 6 months. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibodies
      is measured before vaccination and at month 1, 6 (before dose 2), 7 and 12 with quantitative
      HAV IgG, using the HAVAb-IgG Architect System, and by the HAVAB 2.0 assay on the AxSYM
      machine from Abbott. The level of protective immunity to HAV is defined as HAV IgG &gt;
      10mIU/mL.
