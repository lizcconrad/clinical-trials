  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few efficient drugs for malaria treatment are available so far. Due to increased exposure of
      these drugs and due to the high risk of development of drug resistant strains of Plasmodium
      falciparum, new drug combinations have to be actively investigated. The investigators will
      test the efficiency, safety and tolerance of combined fosmidomycin and clindamycin treatment
      in acute uncomplicated malaria in children aged 3-10 years.

      Few efficient drugs for malaria treatment are available so far. Due to increased exposure of
      these drugs and due to the high risk of development of drug resistant strains of Plasmodium
      falciparum, new drug combinations have to be actively investigated. The goal of this study is
      to assess a new drug combination, fosmidomycin-clindamycin. The primary objective of the
      study is to assess and compare the efficacy, safety and tolerance (between sites) of
      fosmidomycin and clindamycin when co-administered orally over three days in the treatment of
      acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in children in Mozambique and Gabon.

      The secondary objective is to differentiate between recrudescent parasitaemia and reinfection
      in the event of recurrent parasitaemia developing within the 28-day follow-up period, to
      determine the population pharmacokinetics of fosmidomycin when co-administered orally with
      clindamycin and to compare the in vitro sensitivity of isolates of Plasmodium falciparum to
      fosmidomycin.

      The trial will include 100 children aged 3-10 years, divided between clinical sites of Gabon
      and Mozambique.
