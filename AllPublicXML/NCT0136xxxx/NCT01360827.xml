  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of EMD 1201081, a
      novel immunomodulatory agent that is an agonist of TLR9, in combination with 5-FU/cisplatin
      and cetuximab in first line treatment of patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck, and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) among the
      dose levels.

    <description>3-6 subjects per cohort will receive EMD 1201081 as a weekly subcutaneous injection on Days 1, 8, and 15 in 3-week cycles at dose levels of 0.16, 0.32, and 0.48mg/kg, respectively until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or subject refusal to continue in the trial. EMD 1201081 will always be given after (within 1 hour) completion of the cetuximab infusion and before the start of chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>Part 2 seeks to enroll 12 subjects at the MTD of EMD 1201081 in combination with 5-FU/cisplatin + cetuximab; furthermore, an additional 3 to 6 subjects for a total of 9 subjects will be accrued at the 0.16 mg/kg low dose level in Part 2a once the Part 1 0.16 mg/kg dose cohort has been accrued and it is deemed safe to proceed to the 0.32 mg/kg dose cohort. EMD 1201081 will always be given after (within 1 hour) completion of the cetuximab infusion and before the start of chemotherapy.</description>
