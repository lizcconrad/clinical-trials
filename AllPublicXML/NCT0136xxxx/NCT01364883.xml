    <textblock>
      This is an open label phase I study, to assess the safety and immunogenicity of novel
      schedules for vaccination with the candidate malaria vaccines AdCh63 ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP.
      These vaccines have been evaluated previously in a number of clinical trials proved to be
      safe and capable of inducing protective cellular immune response following challenge with the
      parasite. All volunteers recruited will be healthy adults. They will be primed with AdCh63
      ME-TRAP administered intramuscularly and boosted several times with AdCh63 ME-TRAP and MVA
      ME-TRAP according to various schedules.. Safety data will be collected for each of the seven
      regimens. Secondary aims of this study will be to assess the immune responses generated by
      each of these regimes.
