  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi-center, single treatment clinical trial evaluates the clinical
      outcomes associated with a non-invasive treatment to obtain lift and tightening of facial and
      neck tissue utilizing the Ulthera® System to deliver ultrasound energy in a focused manner
      below the surface of the skin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
      Ulthera® System to obtain improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin.

    <measure>Improvement in Overall Lifting and Tightening of the Jowls and/or Neck Laxity</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin as determined by masked, qualitative assessment of photographs at 90 days post-treatment compared to baseline. Efficacy was based on the number of treated subjects assessed as improved in skin laxity, horizontal neck folds, neck sagging, texture and/or ptosis.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in Overall Lifting and Tightening of the Jowls and/or Neck Laxity - RE-ANALYZED GROUP</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin as determined by masked, qualitative assessment of photographs at 90 days post-treatment compared to baseline. Efficacy was based on the number of treated subjects assessed as improved in skin laxity, horizontal neck folds, neck sagging, texture and/or ptosis.
A data set of 42 of the 61 participants were re-analyzed. Data were removed for 19 participants whose pre-treatment and/or post-treatment photos were of poor photo quality, i.e., poor lighting, poor focus, poor positioning, creating the potential for biasing the masked assessment results.</description>

    <time_frame>60 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>At 60 days post-treatment, a PGAIS and SGAIS were completed based on a live assessment of the subject and a photographic assessment comparing post-treatment photos to baseline photos, to assess overall aesthetic improvement. The GAIS is a 5-point scale (1-5) describing an overall assessment as follows:
- Very Much Improved
- Much Improved
- Improved
- No Change
- Worse &quot;Any Improvement&quot; includes participants assessed in categories 1-3</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction 90 Days Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>90 Days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction was determined by scores on a patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) completed at 90 days post-treatment. Subjects indicated on a PSQ whether they saw improvement in the areas treated, i.e., providing a Yes/No response, and how satisfied they were with their Ulthera treatment, i.e., Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied. Pre-treatment and Day 90 post-treatment photographs were available for viewing during the assessment. Subjects also had a mirror in hand for real time assessment, comparing pre-treatment and 90 day post-treatment photos. Proportions of subjects reporting Improvement, and Very Satisfied and Satisfied are included.</description>

Neck sagging (Grades 0-7);
Texture (Female grades 0-5; male grades 0-7);

        <description>Improvement in overall lifting and tightening of skin as determined by masked, qualitative assessment of photographs at 90 days post-treatment compared to baseline. Efficacy was based on the number of treated subjects assessed as improved in skin laxity, horizontal neck folds, neck sagging, texture and/or ptosis.
A data set of 42 of the 61 participants were re-analyzed. Data were removed for 19 participants whose pre-treatment and/or post-treatment photos were of poor photo quality, i.e., poor lighting, poor focus, poor positioning, creating the potential for biasing the masked assessment results.</description>

        <title>Patient Satisfaction 90 Days Post-treatment</title>
        <description>Patient satisfaction was determined by scores on a patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) completed at 90 days post-treatment. Subjects indicated on a PSQ whether they saw improvement in the areas treated, i.e., providing a Yes/No response, and how satisfied they were with their Ulthera treatment, i.e., Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied. Pre-treatment and Day 90 post-treatment photographs were available for viewing during the assessment. Subjects also had a mirror in hand for real time assessment, comparing pre-treatment and 90 day post-treatment photos. Proportions of subjects reporting Improvement, and Very Satisfied and Satisfied are included.</description>

          <description>At 90 days post-treatment, the Principal Investigator (PI) assessed the subjects' horizontal neck folds, neck sagging, and texture and ptosis changes using the L'Oreal Photographic Scales. The L'Oreal scales include the following categories, with a higher grade denoting an increased severity in each category:
Horizontal neck folds (Grades 0-6)
Neck sagging (Grades 0-7);
Texture (Female grades 0-5; male grades 0-7);
Ptosis (Female grades 0-5; males grades 0-7).</description>
