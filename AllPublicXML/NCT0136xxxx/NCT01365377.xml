  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depression are symptoms frequently met in ICU patients and relatives. Risk
      factors are known: disease severity, age, gender. Another risk factor is lack of information
      from the medical staff and nurses.

      Anxiety and depression can be measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
      Other scales are used in the psychiatric field : the Impact Event Score - Revisited (IES-R)
      is relevant to detect Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), The Short Form Health Survey
      (SF-36) is an assessment of life quality.

      In the following study, the investigators will evaluate the impact of a &quot;brochure&quot; as
      complement of oral information on Anxiety developed by relatives and family of ICU patients.

      The medical and surgical ICU is composed by two different units (different medical and nurse
      team, different location in the same hospital) of 12 beds on one side, 14 beds on the other
      side.

      During a year, in the first unit, the investigators will use the booklet as support and
      complement of oral information : &quot;booklet arm&quot;. The information process will be as usual in
      the other unit : &quot;control arm&quot;. During the second year, the booklet will be used in the
      second unit while the first unit will return to the usual oral information (cross-over).

      For each included patient, one relative or family member is pointed to be the referring
      family member or &quot;referent&quot;. This &quot;referent&quot; receives the HADS questionnaire at Day 3 after
      admission, at day of discharge if the patient is alive, at one month after discharge. The
      IES-R questionnaire is delivered at discharge of the living patient and at day 30. The SF-36
      questionnaire is given to the &quot;referent&quot; and the living patient at day 30. The day 30
      questionnaires are send by mail at the &quot;referent&quot; address.
