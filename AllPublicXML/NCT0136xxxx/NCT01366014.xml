      This is a Phase 2 study, involving a 4-week treatment period, designed to test the ability of
      investigational study drug ARRY-371797 to reduce pain in patients with moderate to severe
      pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, and to further evaluate the drug's safety.
      Approximately 150 patients from the US will be enrolled in this study.
