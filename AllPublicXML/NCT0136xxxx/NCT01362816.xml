  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rising incidence of cancer and the rapidly increasing number of people living longer with
      incurable disease, accentuates the need for optimal symptom management throughout the disease
      trajectory. Thanks to the medical and technological development, and the increased interest
      in palliative care research, palliative medicine has gradually become more evidence based.
      Patients with advanced cancer experience multiple symptoms at the time with fluctuating
      intensity and severity. Pain, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, dyspnea, loss of appetite and
      depression are among the most common and experienced by more than 50%. However, the
      prevalence rates of these symptoms vary considerably across studies, with a range from 35 to
      90 % for pain as an example. These differences may in part be explained by different
      assessment tools, study methods and design and population characteristics. There is also lack
      of agreed-upon, common criteria to describe the main characteristics of a palliative care
      cancer population and few standardized tools for assessment and classification of symptoms
      exist. These shortcomings limit the possibility to design randomized controlled treatment
      trials in palliative care; the optimal way to improve clinical symptom management. To do
      this, a better understanding of how symptoms evolve and how they should be assessed and
      classified throughout the palliative care disease trajectory is important, supplemented with
      registrations of the treatment provided. The primary aim of this international research
      project the European Palliative Care Cancer Symptom study (EPCCS) is to extend the knowledge
      about and gain new insight in the prevalence and development of the most frequent cancer
      related symptoms during the course of disease, in a large sample of palliative care cancer
      patients. The clinical usefulness of the new assessment and classification system developed
      by the European Palliative Care Research Collaborative (EPCRC) / European Association for
      Palliative Care Research Network (EAPC RN) will be examined and data on the organization and
      delivery of palliative care at participating centers will be collected. The project also aims
      to further develop and consolidate international research collaboration through the European
      Palliative Care Research Centre (PRC). Taken together, these efforts will increase the
      understanding of the palliative disease trajectory and provide necessary knowledge and
      structure for future randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

        The popuation consists of patients with incurable cancers who are enrolled in a palliative
        care programme. They will be identified upon referral for non-curative cancer
        treatment/palliative care to the centre, department, out-patient clinic, daycare centre,
        hospice, or home-based care, depending on the palliaitve care organization model at the
        participating centres. Patients will be followed every 4 weeks (3-5) for at least 6 months,
        or until death
