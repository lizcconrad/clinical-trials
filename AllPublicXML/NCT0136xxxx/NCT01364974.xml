    <textblock>
      Subjects will be confined to the clinical research unit for 19 days. Subjects will receive a
      follow-up phone call to asses safety 1 to 5 days after being discharged from the study.

      Subjects will receive study drug twice per day (BID) on days 1 to 13 of the 14 day treatment
      period, and will receive a single dose of study drug on the morning of day 14 of the
      treatment period.
