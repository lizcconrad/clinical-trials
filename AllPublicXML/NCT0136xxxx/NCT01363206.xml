      The study is an open-label, single arm single Center Phase II study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the combination of Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF,

      malignant melanoma.

      The study is an open-label, single arm single Center Phase II study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the combination of Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF,
      Leukine) and Ipilimumab (Yervoy) as therapy for patients with unresectable metastatic
      malignant melanoma. The patient sample will be approximately 43 evaluable individuals, males
      and females 18 years of age or older with measurable metastatic melanoma. Immunologic testing
      will be done to evaluate correlation with clinical outcome.

      Patients will be treated with 4 courses of GM-CSF and ipilimumab administered every 3 weeks.
      GM-CSF will be administered subcutaneously daily for 14 days in a dose of 125 µg/m2 beginning
      on D1 of each 21-day cycle. Ipilimumab intravenously in a dose of 10 mg/kg, with appropriate
      stopping/de-escalation rules. After the initial 3 months (4 cycles) of treatment, GM-CSF
      administration will continue for 4 additional cycles on the same schedule and dose without
      ipilimumab for 14 days every 21 days until month 6. Maintenance therapy will begin at month 6
      and will consist of ipilimumab in the same dose administered at the end of cycle 4 combined
      with 14 days of GM-CSF. Administration of this combination will be repeated every 3 months
      for up to 2 years or until disease progression, whichever occurs first. During the
      maintenance phase, GM-CSF will only be administered for 14 days in conjunction with
      ipilimumab and will not be administered in the intervening time period.
