  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-blinded randomized study aims to compare two methods of manual hyperinflation
      (protective - moderate tidal volumes with positive end expiratory pressure) and
      non-protective (large tidal volume and no positive end expiratory pressure) in ventilated
      acute trauma patients, to investigate the effect on inflammatory markers, lung compliance,
      oxygenation and sputum volume.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence in mechanical ventilation supports a &quot;protective lung strategy&quot; that is,
      smaller tidal volumes and prevention of loss of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).
      There is concern that manual hyperinflation (MHI) may conflict with this strategy and cause
      volutrauma and atelectrauma potentially leading to biotrauma.

    <measure>PaO2/FiO2 Oxygenation ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Chnge between baseline and 15 minutes and 40 minutes post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ratio between the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood and the fraction of inspired oxygen which is delivered to the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Static lung compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between Baseline and 15 minutes and 70 minutes post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Static lung compliance is the change in volume for any given applied pressure. The formula is Compliance = Change in volume/change in pleural pressure.
An inspiratory hold will be dialled on the mechanical ventilator and the static lung compliance value will be recorded from the screen.</description>

    <measure>Mean arterial blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>the change between baseline and every minute during intervention for 10 minutes will be compared</time_frame>
    <description>The mean blood pressure will be recorded from the arterial catheter in situ. This is displayed continuously on the Phillips Intellivue Monitor and will be recorded for the time of intervention</description>

    <measure>Sputum volume</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately at end of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum will be suctioned at the end of the manual hyperinflation technique by an inline suction catheter using sterile technique into a closed sample jar. This will be weighed on an Acculab Pocket Scale PP401</description>
