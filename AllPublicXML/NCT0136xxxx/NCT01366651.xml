      The purpose of this study is to characterize the penetration of doripenem in the cerebral
      spinal fluid in pediatric patients &lt;1 year of age who are hospitalized and have a documented
      or suspected infection and are planning to, or undergoing treatment with intravenous (IV)
      antibiotics.

      This is a multicenter, open-label (identity of treatment is known to patient's parent/legal
      guardian/caregiver and to all study staff) study to characterize the penetration of doripenem
      in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in pediatric patients &lt;1 year of age who are hospitalized
      but medically stable, and who have a documented or suspected infection and are planning to,
      or undergoing treatment with antibiotics administered intravenously (in a vein, abbreviated
      as &quot;IV&quot;). Doripenem will not replace the patients' prescribed antibiotic(s). The study
      includes 3 phases: a pretreatment phase consisting of an up to 24-hour screening period; a
      2-day open-label treatment period when doripenem will be administered, and CSF and blood
      samples will be collected, and a follow-up visit approximately 1 week after administration of
      the last dose of doripenem. The total duration of the study is approximately 10 days. During
      the study, patients &lt;12 weeks of age will receive a 10 mg/kg doripenem 1-hour IV infusion via
      a central or peripheral venous line (a catheter inserted in a large vein) every 8 hours;
      patients 12 weeks to &lt;1 year of age will receive a 30 mg/kg doripenem 1-hour IV infusion
      every 8 hours. A total of 5 doses of doripenem will be administered over a 2-day period while
      the patient is in the hospital.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is expected to require hospitalization for the entire open-label phase of the
             study.

          -  Patient must be scheduled to have cerebral spinal fluid obtained via a lumbar puncture
             (referred to as a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) or ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt tap within 3 days
             of enrollment into this study.

             treatment with IV antibiotics.

          -  Parent or the patient's legally acceptable representative must have signed an informed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology or clinical chemistry at
             screening that, at the option of the investigator, are not consistent with the

          -  Any condition at screening that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere

          -  History of clinically significant allergies to medications, especially known
             hypersensitivity or intolerance to carbapenems, penicillins, or other Beta-lactam
             antibiotics.

          -  Known allergy to heparin or history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, if an
             in-dwelling cannula (e.g., heparin lock) or central line is used.

          -  Patients concomitantly treated with or having received imipenem/cilastin within 48
             hours before study drug administration.
