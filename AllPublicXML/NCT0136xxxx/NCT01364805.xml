  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, approximately 30,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed each
      year and an almost equal number of deaths are related to this cancer. Different types of
      chemotherapeutic treatments are used that target different parts of the cancer cell with some
      success, but there is room for other treatment options.

      It is known that people with cancer are using high doses of intravenous vitamin C also known
      as ascorbate, as a cancer treatment and this is occurring frequently. When Vitamin C is given
      in this manner, it is not taken by mouth; instead, it enters your body through an IV
      (intravenous) site, or tube that is inserted through a needle into your vein. If you have a
      port-a-cath in place, the IV will be given using your port. When Vitamin C enters your body
      through an IV site, it is known that it acts like a drug and not a vitamin. It produces a
      substance around the cancer cells called hydrogen peroxide. It has been seen in animal
      research studies that hydrogen peroxide kills the cancer cells while leaving the normal cells
      unharmed.

      Currently the FDA does not approve the use of high-dose intravenous Vitamin C as a cancer
      treatment. The use of intravenous Vitamin C in this study is experimental. Furthermore, it is
      important to know that we do not expect the intravenous Vitamin C given in this study to be
      healing for the treatment of your cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if it is safe to give Vitamin C by the vein at high
      doses to people with pancreatic cancer and if Vitamin C interferes with how well the
      chemotherapy works on cancer cells. This study will also look at how the body processes of
      Vitamin C. This study will also help researchers to learn more about long Vitamin C stays in
      the blood stream, and how rapidly it is used by the body.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine safety of combined gemcitabine chemotherapy with IV ascorbate.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be accomplished by enrolling up to 14 participants fitting inclusion criteria into the Phase I portion of the trial: 7 participants will be enrolled at the determined dose levels and if no significant adverse event is identified, then 7 additional participants will be enrolled. Safety will be assessed by obtaining the following evaluations: toxicity graded by the NCI CTCAE v 4.0, urinalysis pre- and post-infusion, ECG, basic metabolic panel, bicarbonate (pH surrogate marker), CBC, and osmolality.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions when adding IV AA to front-line gemcitabine chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer not eligible for surgical resection.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>By measuring PK data when combining gemcitabine chemotherapy along with IV ascorbate on the same day, it will be determined if there are reduced gemcitabine levels in the presence of ascorbate. Initially 7 participants will be enrolled and if no significant interaction defined, an additional 7 will be enrolled.</description>

    <description>Week 1: 2 visits for escalating doses of intravenous ascorbic acid (IV C). First dose 25 gm followed by 50 gm 2nd visit. Week 2: 3 visits escalating doses of IV C, 75 grams, 100 grams, and 125 grams. Week 3: 2 visits pharmacokinetic evaluation of intravenous ascorbic acid alone at 125 grams; return to the infusion clinic the following morning for a 24 hour blood draw; 2nd visit receive the first infusion of gemcitabine chemotherapy for PK evaluation of gemcitabine alone. Week-4: gemcitabine and IV C co-administered for pharmacokinetics of both drugs to assess for PK variability related to drug-drug interactions. Subjects will return to the infusion clinic the following morning for 24 hour blood draw.</description>

    <description>The first 5 study visits will all take place in the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). During these visits you will receive IV doses of Vitamin C. The dose of Vitamin C will be started at 25 grams and may be increased up to 125 grams over a two week period. There may be changes in the amount of Vitamin C that you receive based on your blood test levels. The study staff will go over this in more detail with you. The amount of fluid you receive depends on the dose and can be from 2 1/3 cups to 5 cups.</description>

    <description>Participants receive dexamethasone 10 mg as pretreatment antiemetic; may be given ondansetron, granisetron, or dolasetron, per oncologist. Gemcitibane 1,000mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes Q 21 days. Cycle of treatment: infusions once weekly for 2 consecutive weeks followed by 1 week of rest to continue treatment schedule until they experience disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. CR, PR or SD: treatment will be continued for at least 6 cycles. Discontinuation of therapy may be considered if agreed upon by the participant and oncologist. Dose Modifications: If the patient experiences more than one toxicity, each requiring a dose reduction, follow the guidelines that give the largest dose reduction for the drug. Subsequent doses can be adjusted to as low as 500 mg/m2 for gemcitabine.</description>
