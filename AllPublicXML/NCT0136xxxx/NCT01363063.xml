  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1, double blind, two part study in healthy male and female volunteers. Each
      subject participated in only one part of the study. In Part A subjects received one dose of
      15 mg ketorolac tromethamine with a lidocaine hydrochloride free formulation in one nostril
      and one dose of 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine containing 6% lidocaine hydrochloride in the
      other nostril, in a randomized manner. In Part B subjects were randomized to receive a single
      intranasal dose of 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine containing 0% lidocaine hydrochloride into
      one nostril and either placebo or a single intranasal dose of 15 mg ketorolac tromethamine
      containing 0%, 4% or 6% lidocaine hydrochloride into the other nostril. During the study,
      subjects remained resident from the morning of Day 1 until the afternoon of Day 1, when a
      post-study medical was performed prior to discharge.

      The objective of this study was to compare the tolerability of formulations of ketorolac
      tromethamine with differing concentrations of lidocaine hydrochloride (0% and 6% in Part A
      and 0%, 4%, 6% and placebo in Part B) following intranasal administration to healthy
      volunteers.

    <description>Following administration of each treatment, subjects completed a visual analogue scale (VAS) (ranging from &quot;no discomfort&quot; to &quot;severe discomfort&quot;) at 1, 5, 10 and 15 minutes post-dose. If after the 15 minute VAS assessment discomfort was still present the subject was asked to complete further VAS assessments, at 5 minute intervals, until the discomfort had dissipated.</description>
