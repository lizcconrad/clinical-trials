      BACKGROUND Many patients in the trauma intensive care unit (TICU) require mechanical
      ventilation and sedation or anxiolysis. Mechanical ventilation means that a machine is
      helping a patient breathe if he can't breathe on his own. Because of the mechanical
      ventilation, these patients also require some medication to help keep them calm. These are
      called sedatives or anxiolytics.

      The purpose of this study is to see if acupuncture can lower the amount of sedation and
      anxiolysis needed by a subject during mechanical ventilation in the TICU. Acupuncture is a
      medical procedure. Hair-thin sterile needles are inserted at specific points on the body.

      PROCEDURES Some subjects will get acupuncture and others will get 'fake' acupuncture. By
      using 'fake' acupuncture, no one other than the acupuncturists will know which group a
      subject is in. Subjects and the team do not get to pick which subject is in which group.
      Instead, the groups are picked randomly. Subjects will get real or fake acupuncture twice a
      day for five days.

      Standard of care - Both groups will receive the standard of care while in the study. They
      will be mechanically ventilated and given sedatives and analgesics based on the TICU
      protocol.

      Real acupuncture group - This group will receive real acupuncture with real needles. These
      are stainless steel, one time use, needles. This group will also receive &quot;ear tacks&quot; which
      are like little needles that can stay on the ear for a few days. The ear tacks will be
      covered with a bandage so no one can tell which group the subject is in.

      Sham acupuncture group - This group will receive sham needles. These needles retract into
      themselves much like a 'magic sword' rather than poking the skin. Subjects in this group will
      not get ear tacks. In order to hide the group the subject is in, a bandage will be used to
      cover part of the ear.

      HYPOTHESIS Real acupuncture will decrease subject's sedation requirements by 30% when
      compared to the sham acupuncture group.
