  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a two-week, single-blinded, double-dummy, randomized, active-controlled,
      parallel group design, with a follow-up period up to a total study duration of 6-month,
      non-randomized, open-label phase to monitor safety, tolerability and, in responders, flare.
      It is a multicentric, multinational study. The protocol will seek to enroll a total of 30
      patients, who will be randomized to the 3 arms at a ratio of 1:1:1.

      Patients will have a maximum screening period of 7 days with randomization at D1 for a dosing
      period of 15 days followed by a follow up-period of 154 days, or 4 months (112 days) after
      their last biologic dose, whichever is greater, and followed by unblinded re-dosing in the
      case of a disease flare.

    Data did not show that the two biologic treatments impacted PMR disease activity to the same

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of a single dose of AIN457 and ACZ885 (canakinumab) was measured by the polymyalgia rheumatica activity score. A composite PMR-AS was developed from the following components: measure of C-reactive protein (CRP), measure of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), assessment of early morning stiffness, assessment of the patient's elevation on upper limbs, patient's assessment of pain, and physician's global assessment of disease activity. Treatment effect was measured by the percent reduction in PMR-AS. N=3 for the ACZ885 arm because CRP values at Day 15 were missing for 2 participants.</description>

    <measure>Time to Partial Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The time to partial clinical response was assessed in patients who received a single dose of AIN457 or ACZ885 (canakinumab). Daily monitoring (home-based) of CRP was performed. This outcome shows the percentage of patients who achieved a partial clinical response at Day 15. A participant was defined as a partial responder if the participant had:
&gt;50% reduction in patient global assessment visual analogue scale (VAS) compared with baseline and morning stiffness &lt; 60 minutes.</description>

    <description>The time to complete clinical response was assessed in patients who received a single dose of AIN457 or ACZ885 (canakinumab). Daily monitoring (home-based) of CRP was performed. This outcome shows the percentage of patients who achieved a complete clinical response at Day 15. A participant was defined as a complete responder if the participant had: &gt;70% reduction in patient global assessment VAS compared with baseline, morning stiffness &lt; 30 min, CRP &lt; 1.0 mg/dL and/or ESR &lt; 30 mm/1st hr.</description>

        <description>The efficacy of a single dose of AIN457 and ACZ885 (canakinumab) was measured by the polymyalgia rheumatica activity score. A composite PMR-AS was developed from the following components: measure of C-reactive protein (CRP), measure of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), assessment of early morning stiffness, assessment of the patient’s elevation on upper limbs, patient’s assessment of pain, and physician’s global assessment of disease activity. Treatment effect was measured by the percent reduction in PMR-AS. N=3 for the ACZ885 arm because CRP values at Day 15 were missing for 2 participants.</description>
