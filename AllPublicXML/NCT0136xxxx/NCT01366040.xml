  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, survey-based study to determine subject satisfaction with
      using the single-use autoinjector for the delivery of AVONEX PS. Enrollment will consist of
      200 subjects in a single cohort who have been prescribed AVONEX PEN in accord with its
      Product Monograph. All subjects must be experienced AVONEX PS users (i.e., using it for at
      least 12 weeks without any support person to help with the injections administered in the
      vastus lateralis) and enrolled in MS AllianceTM program (hereinafter, MS Alliance). The
      clinic nurse investigator will instruct the patient on the correct method of using AVONEX PEN
      and the first injection with Autoinjector, using the subject's own supply, will be completed
      in the clinic, with the clinic nurse investigator present. All further injections of AVONEX
      PEN will be self-administered at home. The subjects will complete the first set of
      questionnaires, including Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire, Ease of Use Grading Scale and
      the Autoinjector Instructions Grading Scale, within 10 minutes after the first injection at
      the clinic, and will be given another set of questionnaires to be completed at home within 10
      minutes following the last study injection 2 months later, provided the subjects still
      continue to self-administer their AVONEX PEN. The first set of questionnaires will be left
      with the clinic nurse investigator to be sent to the CRO by fax or e-mail, while the second
      set will need to be mailed to the CRO by study subjects using the provided self-addressed,
      postage-paid envelope.
