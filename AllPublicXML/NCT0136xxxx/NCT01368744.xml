    <textblock>
      The study will determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive
      predictive value of the OSNA Breast Cancer System by comparing its performance to an
      extensive intraoperative frozen section protocol for Sentinel Lymph Nodes removed during
      standard Sentinel Lymph Node biopsy procedures from breast cancer subjects.

    <description>For in vitro diagnostic use only.
The OSNA Breast Cancer System is an automated semi-quantitative, in vitro diagnostic test for the rapid detection of greater than (&gt;) 0.2 mm metastases in nodal tissue removed from sentinel lymph node biopsies of breast cancer patients. Results from the assay can be used to guide the intra-operative or post-operative decision to remove additional lymph nodes and to aid in patient staging. An assay positive + or ++ result indicates the presence of metastasis (&gt; 0.2 mm). An assay positive ++ result predicts the presence of macrometastasis (&gt; 2 mm).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female;

          -  18 years of age or older;

          -  Diagnosed pre-surgically with T1 or T2 breast cancer without clinical evidence of
             axillary lymph node involvement and scheduled for surgery including sentinel lymph
             node dissection;

          -  Subjects (or the subjects' legal representatives) who have read, understood to the
             best of their ability and signed the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects diagnosed pre-surgically with large or locally advanced (T3 &amp; T4) breast
             cancer;

          -  Pregnant subjects, confirmed by interview with either subject or treating physician;

          -  Subjects diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer;

          -  Subjects diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) when breast conservation is to
             be done;

          -  Subjects with clinically suspicious, palpable axillary lymph nodes;

          -  Subjects previously treated for or previously diagnosed with another type of invasive
             cancer. Subjects with skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) may be
             included, except for subjects diagnosed with melanoma; Subjects with non-invasive
             carcinoma of the Cervix may also be included in this study.

          -  Subjects who have received pre-operative systemic therapy;

          -  Subjects who are incapable of providing written informed consent;

          -  Subjects who have been judged to be an inappropriate candidate by any medical care
             provider (e.g., surgeon, oncologist or pathologist).

          -  Subjects participating in other clinical studies where the SLN evaluation will be
             negatively impacted by this study.
