  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the impact of a presurgical endocrine therapy, consisting of
      goserelin with letrozole or anastrozole on the treatment of premenopausal patients with stage
      II-III estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2)-negative breast cancer. Endocrine therapy reduces the amount of estrogen in the body.
      E+ breast cancer require estrogen, so lower levels of estrogen may slow or stop cell growth.
      Giving goserelin together with letrozole or anastrozole before surgery may enhance the
      effectiveness of, or eliminate the need for, chemotherapy

    <description>In patients with Ki67 &gt;10% and &lt;= 15 pg/ml at 4 weeks.
The pCR rate for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is defined as 100 times the number of eligible patients with no histologic evidence of invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen and the axillary or sentinel lymph nodes divided by the total number of eligible patients who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.</description>

    <measure>Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index Score (PEPI Score)</measure>

    <description>To obtain the PEPI score, risk points for relapse-free survival (RFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) are assigned depending on the hazard ratio (HR) from the multivariable analysis. The total PEPI score assigned to each patient is the sum of the risk points derived from the pT stage, pN stage, Ki67 level, and estrogen receptor status of the surgical specimen. A HR in the range of 1 to 2 receives one risk point; a HR in the 2 to 2.5 range, two risk points; a HR greater than 2.5, three risk points. The total risk point score for each patient is the sum of all the risk points accumulated from the four factors in the model, ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 12 (worst possible outcome).</description>

        <description>To obtain the PEPI score, risk points for relapse-free survival (RFS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) are assigned depending on the hazard ratio (HR) from the multivariable analysis. The total PEPI score assigned to each patient is the sum of the risk points derived from the pT stage, pN stage, Ki67 level, and estrogen receptor status of the surgical specimen. A HR in the range of 1 to 2 receives one risk point; a HR in the 2 to 2.5 range, two risk points; a HR greater than 2.5, three risk points. The total risk point score for each patient is the sum of all the risk points accumulated from the four factors in the model, ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 12 (worst possible outcome).</description>
