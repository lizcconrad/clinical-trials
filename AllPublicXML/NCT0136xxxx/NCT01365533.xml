  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the efficacy of
      roflumilast on airway inflammation and function in patients with allergen-induced asthma.

      Individuals with stable, mild to moderate allergic asthma, with a history of episodic wheeze
      and shortness of breath, were eligible for enrollment.
