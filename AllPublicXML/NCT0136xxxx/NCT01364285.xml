  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators know little about how patients feel following radiosurgery treatment of
      trigeminal neuralgia. Patient satisfaction may ultimately be one of the most important
      outcome measures for an individual patient; however, this has not been adequately assessed or
      followed. Multiple questions remain unanswered, including whether there is a correlation
      between patient satisfaction, the level of their current pain score, and the presence and
      degree of facial numbness, a possible side effect after radiosurgery. Therefore, the goal of
      this study is to gather this information from the patients who received radiosurgery for
      trigeminal neuralgia at Stanford and evaluate post-treatment patient satisfaction, the degree
      of facial numbness, and current pain score. This data will help the investigators understand
      outcomes that are important for patient satisfaction following treatment of a chronic pain
      syndrome.
