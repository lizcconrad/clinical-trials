  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the overall incidence of gastric cancer has steadily declined in many Western
      countries during the last few decades, it is still one of the most common tumors in China. It
      is now well recognised that combination chemotherapy regimens improve patient outcomes, but
      there is no accepted global standard regimen for advanced gastric cancer.

      The ToGA study was the first randomized, prospective, multicenter, phase III trial to show
      the efficacy and safety of Trastuzumab in HER2- positive GC. Trastuzumab reduced the risk of
      death by 26% (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0∙60, 0∙91; p=0∙0046) when combined with a reference
      chemotherapy (Capecitabine plus Cisplatin) and prolonged the median survival by nearly 3
      months (from 11.1 to 13.8 months) in patients with HER2-positive(FISH+ or IHC3+) advanced GC.

      Oxaliplatin has been shown to be as effective as cisplatin, and exhibits a favorable toxicity
      profile with a substantially lower rate of nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and myelosuppression.

      In the current study, the efficacy and safety of Trastuzumab in combination with
      Oxaliplatin/capecitabine chemotherapy will be evaluated in Chinese patients with HER2
      positive advanced or recurrent gastric cancer.
