    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a new laser for the
      removal of unsightly spider veins on the legs. The device used in this study is the Cutera
      Excel V laser, which is a dual wavelength 532 nm potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and 1064
      nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. The Excel V laser has received
      510(k) clearance from the FDA, which means the FDA has approved the laser for dermatological
      and vascular conditions, like spider veins.

      Each subject will receive 532 nm KTP laser treatment for their lower extremity spider veins
      in at least 2, and up to 4, separate areas. Subjects will receive 2 laser treatments spaced
      12 weeks apart. Subjects will be followed for 24 weeks (12 weeks after the final laser
      treatment). Efficacy will be evaluated by blinded independent physician assessment of
      improvement in treated spider veins using digital photographs taken at baseline and the final
      follow-up visit by a third-party medical photography service. In addition, efficacy will be
      evaluated by the Investigator's mean global assessment of improvement and the subject's mean
      assessment of improvement. Safety will be evaluated by continuous monitoring of adverse
      events (AEs) and measuring pain associated with laser treatment.

    <description>A panel of independent physicians will assess before and after digital photographs of each treated area. The physicians will be blinded to the treatment parameters and to the temporal order of the before and after photographs. Each independent physician will be asked to select the baseline photograph for each treated area and then rate the degree of improvement using the following scale:
0 = No Improvement (0%)
1 = Mild Improvement (&lt; 25%)
2 = Moderate Improvement (26 to 50%)
