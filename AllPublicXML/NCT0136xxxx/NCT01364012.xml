  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of bevacizumab (Avastin) versus placebo in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel in
      participants with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who have not
      received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease. Participants will be randomized to receive
      either bevacizumab 15 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenously (IV) or placebo on Day 1
      of each 3 week cycle, plus up to 6 cycles of carboplatin/paclitaxel. Anticipated time on
      study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. After
      progression, participants in the bevacizumab arm may continue to receive bevacizumab in
      combination with approved second- and third-line treatment at the discretion of the
      investigator, up to the third progression.
