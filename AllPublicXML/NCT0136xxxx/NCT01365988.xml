      Objective- To use fMRI to compare brain activity at rest and during memory and decision
      making tasks in normal children and in children exposed in utero to drugs of abuse.

      Study population- All participants will be 14-20 year-olds enrolled in an ongoing
      longitudinal follow up study of children exposed to drugs of abuse in utero funded by NIH. A
      subgroup of this study cohort will be invited to participate based on added criteria needed
      for scanning studies, such as absence of metal in the body, no significant CNS disease, and
      ability to tolerate the scanning environment.

      Design- Participants will undergo fMRI scans while performing a memory task, a decision
      making task and at rest. Data from participants in the current study may be combined with
      those from a previous study (NIDA protocol 417) which now reside in our repository protocol,
      8002 and NIDA protocol 455.

      Outcome measures- The primary outcome measures will be the difference in BOLD fMRI activation
      between drug-exposed participants and those without prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Participants must be enrolled in the current UMB longitudinal study protocol.

               2. All participants will be between 14 and 20 years old (inclusive).

               3. All participants must be able to provide informed assent and have a
                  parent/guardian who can provide informed consent or if 18 or older, be able to
                  provide informed consent..

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Report of a history of significant medical/neurological illness that might interfere
             with imaging data such as HIV positive status, cerebral vascular accident (CVA),
             central nervous system (CNS) tumor, head trauma, multiple sclerosis (MS) or other
             demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, or movement disorders.

          2. Metallic devices in the body that preclude MRI scanning, as determined by self and
             parent (guardian) report.

          3. Current use of psychotropic medication that may alter attentional functioning (e.g.,
             Clonidine, antipsychotics, Effexor, stimulants).

          4. Currently using respiratory, cardiovascular, anticonvulsant or other medications that
             might interfere with the mechanisms producing the BOLD signal.

          5. Pregnancy, which will be assessed by history during screening and by urine testing on
             scan days.

          6. Claustrophobia by self and/or parent (guardian) report severe enough to preclude
             toleration of the scanning environment.
