  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High intraocular pressure (IOP) is a known risk factor for developing primary open-angle
      glaucoma (POAG). There is controversy in the literature regarding the degree to which
      caffeine influences IOP, with some studies reporting minimal changes in IOP while others
      report up to 4 mmHg increases. To date there are no double-masked randomized controlled
      trials that examine acute caffeinated coffee's effects on IOP in patients with or at risk for
      primary open-angle glaucoma. The investigators aim to better understand the relationship
      between acute caffeinated coffee (vs decaffeinate coffee) consumption and IOP in a
      double-masked, crossover randomized controlled clinical trial.

    <limitations_and_caveats>We gave subjects caffeinated coffee on one visit and decaffeinated coffee on the other visit. The changes in outcome parameters we observed (ie IOP changes) could be due to other non-caffeine components in the coffee.</limitations_and_caveats>
