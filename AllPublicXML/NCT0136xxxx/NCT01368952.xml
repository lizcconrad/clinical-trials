  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy of Pure Prone Positioning (PPP) treatment in improving apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)
      and nocturnal oxygen saturation was investigated in mild to moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleeping in prone position could be effective in the management of obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA) by reducing the gravity effect on the upper airway and hence collapsibility. Pure prone
      positioning (PPP) consisted of a pillow mounted on a table designed to keep the subjects
      sleeping prone with the head extended in line with the body.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were enrolled to the study among one hundred and eighty-four consecutive
             patients who were admitted to our sleep center with 6 beds in a tertiary care
             hospital, during 3 months period. Of these, 36 patients with mild to moderate OSA
             (AHI=5-30 events/h) were invited to participate in the study based on the selection
             criteria, and 29 patients with mild to moderate OSA on their baseline PSG, (17 males,
             12 females) gave informed consent and participated in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having BMI&gt;35 and/or abdominal and/or trunkal obesity that may hinder prone
             sleeping , upper airway pathology (nasal polyp, nasal turbinate hypertrophy, chronic
             sinusitis, nasal septum deviation, upper airway infection, Mallampati score and tonsil
             size grade of IV), any other concomitant sleep disorder (narcolepsy, periodic leg
             movement syndrome, insomnia, sleep related hypoventilation-hypoxemia and central sleep
             apnea syndrome), psychiatric disorder such as panic disorder, heart failure and
             coronary artery disease were not included in the study.
