  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether a computer-based intervention that delivers
      individually-tailored educational messages about the MMR vaccine increases MMR
      vaccine-hesitant parents' intentions to have their children vaccinated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized controlled intervention trial for MMR vaccine-hesitant parents of
      children ages six years and younger who have not yet received the MMR vaccine. Parents will
      complete a three-item measure that assesses their baseline intentions for having their
      children vaccinated with MMR. Participants will then fill out a short, computer-based survey
      that assesses demographic factors, prior experience with MMR, and views about a variety of
      potential barriers to MMR vaccination. Following the survey, the intervention group (40
      parents) will view a series of tailored educational messages resembling web pages that uses
      their survey data to address at an individual level their specific concerns about the MMR
      vaccine. The control group (40 parents) will view a series of generic educational messages
      resembling web pages that is similar in appearance to the intervention, but contains only
      untailored information about the vaccine. After navigating through these educational
      messages, MMR vaccination intention will be reassessed using the same three-item measure as
      for the baseline assessment of vaccination intention. The vaccine administration records of
      the children of these parents will be accessed after parents' participation in the study to
      assess whether the MMR vaccine was provided to the child.

    <description>Both the intervention and control groups will use a computer-based tailoring system to respond to survey questions. The computer-based tailoring system will generate educational messages based on participants' responses to survey questions. The intervention group will receive tailored educational messages, whereas the control group will receive generic educational messages. The tailored and generic educational messages will be presented as to look like web pages. However, the messages will only exist on the study computer, and will not be linked to any &quot;live&quot; server or website.</description>
