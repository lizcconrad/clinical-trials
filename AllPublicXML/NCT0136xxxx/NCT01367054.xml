      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in healthy volunteers, the bioavailability of two products containing
      metformine 500 mg to determine if they are bioequivalent and identify the occurrence of
      adverse events.

      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was approved by research Ethics Committee and all
      twenty-eight volunteers signed the selected IC. An open, randomized, crossover study with two
      periods of confinement and an interval of seven days between them was performed. Twenty (20)
      blood collections were performed between 30 minutes and 36 hours after drug administration.
      Plasma samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
      Statistical analysis was conducted based on pharmacokinetic parameters: maximum concentration
      (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC 0-te AUC 0-inf). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) model
      appropriate was employed for the two periods cross under the logarithmically transformed
      data.

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 24 hours. All adverse events observed are analyzed.</time_frame>
    <description>Observation of adverse events after a single dose. After administration, the volunteers need to answer the question: how are you? All complains are registered. The adverse events are going to be classified as linked ou not with the drug. The expected result is &quot;x&quot; volunteers presented adverse events, the most frequent was &quot;y&quot; event, and so one.</description>
