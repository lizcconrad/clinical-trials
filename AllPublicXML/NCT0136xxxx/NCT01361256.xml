    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the safety of the Model WA-NG telescope prosthesis in
      patients with bilateral moderate to profound central vision impairment due to end-stage
      age-related macular degeneration.

      Patients will be screened for eligibility and informed consent will be obtained from those
      who meet screening criteria and are interested in participating in the study. Eligible
      patients will be examined preoperatively to obtain a medical history and to establish a
      baseline for ocular condition. Baseline measurements will include successful use of an
      external telescope.

      Postoperatively, patients will undergo ophthalmic evaluation at regular intervals as
      specified in this protocol and will be required to return for 6 to 10 additional visits for
      vision training with a low vision specialist.

    <description>The WA-NG telescope prosthesis (Figure 1) is the next generation telescopic implantable device which, when combined with the optics of the cornea, constitutes a telephoto system for improvement of visual acuity in patients with severe to profound vision impairment due to bilateral, end-stage age-related macular degeneration. The device is implanted in one of the patient's eyes. In this way, the implanted eye provides central vision and the non-implanted eye can continue to provide peripheral vision.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Bi-lateral, stable, moderate to profound (20/80 to 20/800) central vision impairment
             due to bilateral scotoma associated with end-stage macular degeneration, defined as
             retinal finds of bilateral, geographic atrophy or disciform scar with foveal
             involvement. Phakic in the operative eye. Must achieve a 5 letter improved with
             external telescope simulator. More medical

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of active CNV or any ophthalmic pathology that compromises peripheral vision
             of fellow eye or predisposes eye rubbing. Previous intraocular of corneal surgery of
             any kind in operative eye. Retinal disease, optic nerve disease, diabetic retinopathy,
             retinal tears, or any intraocular tumor or medical or ophthalmic condition that in the
             opinion of the investigator renders the subject unsuitable for participation.
