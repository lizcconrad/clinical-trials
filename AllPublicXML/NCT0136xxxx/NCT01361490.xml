  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity may have implications on the individual's participation in working life through
      different mechanisms such as comorbidity and loss of functional level. The investigators also
      know that when exiting the working force, it is difficult to get back later. As
      rehabilitation back to working life is often not a very focused aim with weight loss
      treatment, this study sets this as a primary aim by involvement in a 4 week stay at a
      rehabilitation clinic followed by 48 weeks work practice programme at one of three different
      companies.
