  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening for ColoRectal Cancer (CRC) is widely recommended because of compelling evidence
      that it reduces mortality from CRC and that it's cost-effective. In France, there is a
      national CRC screening programme inviting people aged 50-74 years by mail to consult their
      General Practitioner (GP) for a free on charge Faecal Occult Blood test deliverance every two
      years. Participation is a key factor for the screening programs success. High levels of
      screening uptake and the continued participation to regular screening must be achieved and
      maintained in the targeted population if the enormous potential of CRC screening is to be
      realised. Screening rates of various international programs vary widely (20-52%) and the
      participation is insufficient in the most settings. Therefore, a better understanding of
      facilitating and hindering factors of patient participation can guide interventions to
      improve CRC screening rates. They include patients and physicians' factors. One issue is
      about GPs practice. GP involvement has been shown to improve the participation in the CRC
      screening. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of an intervention targeting GPs to
      increase patient participation in the CRC screening. Volunteer GPs will be randomly assigned
      to either the intervention group or to usual care (control group) and they will be followed
      one year. The intervention consists in providing every four months to the experimental group
      a list of their patients who are eligible but did not proceed yet to the screening. In both
      groups, patient participation in the screening will be measured at the end of the study.
