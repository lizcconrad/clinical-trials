        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study-specific
             procedures

          -  Females must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and on admission to the unit,
             must not be lactating, and must be of non-childbearing potential, confirmed at
             screening by fulfilling one of the following criteria:

          -  Post-menopausal defined as amenorrhea for at least 12 months following cessation of
             all exogenous hormonal treatments and with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels
             in the laboratory defined post-menopausal range

          -  Irreversible surgical sterilization by hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             bilateral salpingectomy, but not tubal ligation

          -  Volunteers must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 and weigh at
             least 50 kg

          -  Volunteers must be able to understand and be willing to comply with study procedures,
             restrictions and requirements

          -  Any clinically significant disease or disorder (eg, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic,
             malignant, psychiatric, major physical impairment) which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the healthy volunteer at risk because of participation in
             the study, or influence the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of
             drugs

          -  Current smokers, those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous 3
             months from the date of screening (Visit 1)

             during the 3 months prior to screening or intention to donate blood or blood products
             during the study or within 3 months after the completion of the study

          -  Positive screen for drugs of abuse, or cotinine (nicotine level above 400 ng/mL), at
             screening or admission and/or positive alcohol test at admission

          -  Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure, or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of investigational product
