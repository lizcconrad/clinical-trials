    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase I/II trial is to evaluate safety and tolerability of a single dose
      of GHB16L2 administered by liquid nasal spray for vaccination against seasonal influenza
      virus infection. It is also performed to assess immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics
      (shedding).

    <textblock>
      GHB16L2 intends to provide a novel vaccination for influenza virus infection. 80 healthy
      volunteers will be included at a ratio of 1:1 for GHB16L2 or placebo. GHB16L2 will be
      administered once on day 1. Follow-up visits will be performed on days 2, 8 and 29.
