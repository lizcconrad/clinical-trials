  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that by applying a validated algorithm to accomplish early
      mobilization in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients, these patients will achieve a
      higher level of mobility which translates to shorter ICU length of stay and improved
      functional status at discharge. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that genetic
      polymorphisms related to muscle strength and sleep will also explain some variance in these
      outcome variables.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trauma literature consistently shows that early mobilization improves patients' outcome
      after a localized trauma such as hip fracture, or blunt solid organ injuries. In addition, in
      critically ill patients on the medical ICU, early mobilization improves patients' functional
      outcome and decreases ICU length of stay (1). This study evaluates if critically ill patients
      in a surgical ICU can safely and effectively be mobilized early after trauma and surgery. The
      investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled study in surgical intensive care
      unit patients to evaluate the effects of mSOMS guided early mobilization. Additionally, the
      study will examine known genetic polymorphisms as related to sleep quality and muscle
      strength and how it relates to early mobilization of surgical ICU patients. In particular,
      the study will focus on the following polymorphisms: CLOCK, NPAS2, PER2 and PER3, PDE4D,MUC1,
      ATP2B1, DCDC5, TRPM6, SHROOM3, and MDS1 genes.

    <description>Since Sleep duration has a genetic component corresponding to 40% heritability, we are going to conduct an analysis of known polymorphisms that are related to different variables of sleep quality and how it relates to muscle strength and mobility. In particular we will focus on polymorphisms in CLOCK, NPAS2, PER2 and PER3, PDE4D,MUC1, ATP2B1, DCDC5, TRPM6, SHROOM3, and MDS1 genes, which are associated with sleepiness, sleep phase, inertia, and potentially with respiratory muscle weakness and duration.</description>
