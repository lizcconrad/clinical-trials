      Rationale: Heart Failure (HF) elevated prevalence in Brasil and the world; 20-30% AHF
      patients develop CardioRenal Syndrome (CRS) type 1; Worsening Renal Failure (WRF) is a
      prognostic marker of mortality in Acute HF;NGAL is a novel biomarker of Acute Kidney Injury
      released in 2 hours, and addressed in several different clinical scenarios(contrast injury,
      cardiopulmonary bypass, critical illness.

      Hypothesis: Admission NGAL predicts CRS in AHF patients admitted to the Emergency Room (ER).

      Primary goal: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and the best cutoff value of urinary NGAL
      to predict the development of CRS type 1 in patients admitted to the Emergency Room.

      Secondary goals: 1- To evaluate the prognostic impact of NGAL on in-hospital adverse outcomes
      (length of hospitalization, death, institution of renal replacement therapy, use of
      vasoactive drugs, mechanical ventilation).2- Evaluate the prognostic impact of NGAL in
      adverse outcomes in 30 days, 60 days and 6 months (death, rehospitalization, institution of
      renal replacement therapy).3- Identify clinical and hemodynamic characteristics of Acute HF
      that can influence the evolutionary behavior of NGAL levels in 48 hours.4- Identify the
      association of drugs commonly used for HF management, which might influence the evolutionary
      behavior of NGAL levels in 48 hours.5-Assess the impact of NGAL results in clinical decision
      making.

      Methods: Observational, prospective, blinded study. Population: Acute HF patients admitted to
      the ER of Hospital Pró Cardiaco and Hospital Antonio Pedro - Universidade Federal Fluminense.

      Statistics: Convenience Sample size (n=180); determination of best cut-off: ROC analysis;
      Predictive performance of the cut-off: sensibility, specificity, likelihood ratio, predictive
      value, accuracy; Identification of variables to predict CRS: logistic regression and
      square-Qui test; Correlations analysis of normally distributed variables: Pearson's linear
      correlation test; Mean values for normally distributed variables: Mann-Wittney test;
      Significance on p&lt;0,05; Intra-assay variation analysis.

      Study chronogram: Recruitment: 12 months; Results analysis and conclusions: 60 days;
      Manuscript preparation for paper submission: 30 days.

      Rationale: Heart Failure (HF) elevated prevalence in Brasil and the world; 20-30% AHF
      patients develop CardioRenal Syndrome (CRS) type 1; Worsening Renal Failure (WRF) is a
      prognostic marker of mortality in Acute HF; available biomarker shows irreversible damage,
      late in CRS evolution.(creatinine);NGAL is a novel biomarker of Acute Kidney Injury released
      in 2 hours, and addressed in several different clinical scenarios(contrast injury,
      cardiopulmonary bypass, critical illness...); Acute HF patient's risk stratification will
      allow appropriate resource allocation and establishment of criteria for hospital admission
      and discharge.
