  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study in the possibility of cardiovascular disease, caused by the duty
      loading, of physician of internal medicine. The investigators will also explore if there
      {dose response effect} between the duty loading and the stress response of physicians of
      internal medicine. Therefore, the investigators will compare the stress responses of
      physicians of internal medicine during with different duty loading ( non-duty day, one duty
      area with 3 wards, 2 duty areas with 6 wards) in a observational method. Those stress
      response will be measured by cardiovascular risk indicators, including blood pressure, heart
      rate variability, blood sampling and urine sampling.
