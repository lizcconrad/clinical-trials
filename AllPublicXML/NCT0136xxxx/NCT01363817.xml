  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify a safe and tolerable dose of BMS-906024, either
      alone or in combination with Dexamethasone in subjects with T-cell acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma who no longer respond to or have relapsed from
      standard therapies
