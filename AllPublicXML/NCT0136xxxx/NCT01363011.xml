  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to characterize the effect of cobicistat-based regimens on parameters of renal
      function in participants with HIV infection and who have mild to moderate renal impairment,
      and to assess the safety and tolerability of the regimens in order to generate appropriate
      dosing recommendations.

          <description>Main Study: Participants who had not received prior antiretroviral (ARV) treatment and who were virologically unsuppressed at baseline initiated treatment with elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Stribild®; E/C/F/TDF) (150/150/200/300 mg) single-tablet regimen (STR) once daily for up to 96 weeks.

          <description>Main Study: Participants who had received prior ARV treatment and who were virologically suppressed at baseline switched their regimen's pharmacoenhancer component from ritonavir to cobicistat (Tybost®; COBI) 150 mg, while continuing the other components of their ARV regimen (atazanavir (ATV) 300 mg or darunavir (DRV) 800 mg plus 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)) for up to 96 weeks. These 2 NRTIs may have included abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC)/zidovudine (ZDV), didanosine (DDI), emtricitabine (FTC), ABC/3TC, 3TC, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), or emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada®; FTC/TDF), administered according to prescribing information.
Extension Phase: Participants continued their treatment until all participants discontinued from the study or commercial approval of cobicistat was received in the applicable country.</description>
