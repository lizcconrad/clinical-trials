    <textblock>
      Patients in a known palliative setting and with localized symptoms due to tumor growth will
      be evaluated for their quality of life before and after a surgical intervention (primary
      endpoint). Medical outcome in terms of length of stay in hospital, length of stay on a
      intensive care unit, complications, reinterventions will be recorded (secondary endpoints).
      The investigators will also observe patients with conservative treatment.

      What is the impact on quality of life by operations in symptomatic advanced tumor disease ?
      After informed consent patients in known palliative situations and with localized symptoms
      due to tumor growth will be enrolled in our study. The investigators will assess Quality of
      life with the EORTC QLQ C30-questionnaire and collect data about the disease an the actual
      state of the patients.

      By the time of discharge out of hospital the investigators will hand out the questionnaire
      again and the investigators will collect data regarding the therapies, operations,
      complications, reinterventions, time spent on a intensive care unit, time spent in hospital.

      The questionnaire will be completed after 4 and 12 weeks as well.
