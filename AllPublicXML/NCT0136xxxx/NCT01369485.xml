    <measure>Evaluate Proportion of Responders Based on the Change From Baseline in Mean Urgency (Urinary) Incontinence Episodes (Leaks) Between the Active and Sham Treatment Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (Randomized Phase) and 12 Months (Open Label)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the randomized phase of the study is to evaluate the 12 week change from baseline in mean urgency (urinary) incontinence episodes (leaks) between the active and sham treatment groups. The mean of the number of urinary incontinence episodes over 24 hours&quot; is defined as the mean of the number of UIEs recorded per 24 hour period for three consecutive days (via a 3-day diary).
The primary objective of the open label phase of the study is to evaluate and confirm the continued efficacy of the VERV™ System for long-term use. The primary objective was assessed with rate of responders, where responder was defined as a subject who achieved a decrease of ≥50% in mean urgency urinary incontinence episodes at 12 weeks compared to baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks (Randomized Phase) and 12 Months (Open Label)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the randomized phase of the study is to evaluate the 12 week and 12 month median change from baseline in mean urgency (urinary) incontinence episodes (leaks) between treatment groups. The mean of the number of urinary incontinence episodes over 24 hours&quot; is defined as the mean of the number of UIEs recorded per 24 hour period for three consecutive days (via a 3-day diary).
Mean urinary frequency episodes calculated for each patient during time period. The median change in frequency was then calculated for each treatment group. Distribution of changes from baseline were then assessed prospectively for normality using the Kolmogorov - Smirnoff test. Since departure from normality was actually observed in the distribution, the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test was performed to compare the median change between treatment groups and the p-values for the test of equality of medians were reported along with the medians.</description>

    <measure>Measure Decrease in the Median Change From Baseline in Mean Urgency Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the 12 week change from baseline in median for mean number of urgency episodes between the active and sham treatment groups.
Patients were required to complete seven 3-day voiding diaries throughout the course of the study. The voiding diary collected the following information: amount voided (in ml); urgency associated with each toileted void , approximate time of leak, and presence of urge preceding leak.The mean number of urgency episodes over 24 hours was then calculated for each patient during the observation period. The change in median for the mean of the number of urgency episodes over 24 hours) for each treatment group was then calculated.
Distribution of changes from baseline were assessed prospectively using the Kolmogorov - Smirnoff test. The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test was performed to compare the median change between treatment groups and the p-values for the test of equality of medians were reported along with the medians.</description>

    <measure>Measure Improvement in the Median of the Mean OAB-Symptom Composite Score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>OAB Symptom Composite Score (OAB-SCS) is a composite symptom score of toilet voids, urgency severity and urge urinary incontinence combining the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS) for capture of urgency severity per toilet void with 24-hour frequency and UUI episodes.
IUSS Score/void and/or UUI is assigned an OAB-SCS Point/Void: 0(none)=1, 1(mild/easily tolerated)=2, 2(moderate discomfort interfering with activities)=3, 3(severe/extreme urgency discomfort that abruptly stopped all activity or tasks)=4, UUI without void=5.
Overall OAB-SCS Score is calculated for each day by multiplying the OAB-SCS Points/Void and/or UUIs by the number of events meeting criteria and adding the individual scores together. The minimum overall OAB-SCS score in a 24 hour period would be a 1 (representing a single mild void with a OAB -SCS Point/Void score of 0). The score would increase based upon the number voids/events and overall severity each event. Medians calculated for each treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Change in Median Total Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of OAB-q From Baseline (Screening) to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks (Randomized Phase) and 12 Months (Open Label).</time_frame>
    <description>The OAB-q is validated to measure symptom bother and life impact due to OAB. It consists of an 8-item Bother Scale to assess individual symptoms and a 25-item HRQL scale that in turn consists of 4 subscales (coping-8 items, concern-7 items, sleep-5 items and social-5 items) to assess impact on life. Responses for each item in the Bother Scale range from 1 (bothered not at all by the symptom) to 6 (Bothered A Very Great Deal). Scores are then added generating an overall Bother Score (severity) ranging from 8 to 48. For HRQL, individual responses range between 1-None of the Time to a 6-All of the Time. Subscale scores range from 8-48 (coping) 7-42 (concern), 5-30 (sleep) and 5-30 (social). Subscale scores are then added to generate the HRQL ranging between 25-150. Raw HRQL scores are transformed for standardization purposes as follows: ((Highest Possible Score-Actual Raw Score)/Range of Scores)*1 00 so that scores could range from 0 (All of the Time) to 100 (None of the Time).</description>

    <measure>Change in Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) From Baseline (Screening Period) to Week 12 as Defined as an Improvement in Severity.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks (Randomized Phase) and 12 Months (Open Label Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>PPBC is a 6-point scale (from 'no problems at all' to 'many severe problems') describing the problem level of the bladder condition at that moment. Improvement is defined as a reduction in the number and/or severity of observed problems.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Treatment Benefit Scale (TBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TBS is a patient-reported outcome comprised of a 4-point scale of checkboxes to describe the change in condition during treatment (greatly improved to worsened). Improvement was defined as a change in the patient's assessment of overall condition to improved or greatly improved over the course of treatment. Analysis was based upon the number of patients who reported an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Improvement as Measure by Overactive Bladder Satisfaction With Treatment Questionnaire (OAB-SAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall satisfaction with treatment was assessed (OAB-SAT-q) an 11 question list with multiple scaled checkboxes to allow the subject to rate the treatment with regard to satisfaction, bother from side effects, treatment endorsement, and convenience.</description>

    <measure>Change Clinical Global Impressions at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks (Randomized Phase) and 12 Months (Open Label Phase)</time_frame>
    <description>CGI is an Investigator assessment, which rates the severity of illness at baseline on a scale of 1 (normal, not ill at all) to 7 (Amongst the most extremely ill patients), and then rates improvement at 12 weeks on a scale of 1 (very much improved) to 10 (very much worse). The analysis was based upon the number of patients that &quot;much&quot; and &quot;very much&quot; improved.</description>

        <description>The primary objective of the randomized phase of the study is to evaluate the 12 week change from baseline in mean urgency (urinary) incontinence episodes (leaks) between the active and sham treatment groups. The mean of the number of urinary incontinence episodes over 24 hours” is defined as the mean of the number of UIEs recorded per 24 hour period for three consecutive days (via a 3-day diary).
The primary objective of the open label phase of the study is to evaluate and confirm the continued efficacy of the VERV™ System for long-term use. The primary objective was assessed with rate of responders, where responder was defined as a subject who achieved a decrease of ≥50% in mean urgency urinary incontinence episodes at 12 weeks compared to baseline.</description>

The primary objective of the open label phase of the study is to evaluate and confirm the continued efficacy of the VERV™ System for long-term use. The primary objective was assessed with rate of responders, where responder was defined as a subject who achieved a decrease of ≥50% in mean urgency urinary incontinence episodes at 12 weeks compared to baseline.</description>

        <description>Evaluate the 12 week change from baseline in median urinary frequency between the active and sham treatment groups.
Mean urinary frequency episodes calculated for each patient during time period. The median change in frequency was then calculated for each treatment group. Distribution of changes from baseline were then assessed prospectively for normality using the Kolmogorov – Smirnoff test. Since departure from normality was actually observed in the distribution, the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test was performed to compare the median change between treatment groups and the p-values for the test of equality of medians were reported along with the medians.</description>

Patients were required to complete seven 3-day voiding diaries throughout the course of the study. The voiding diary collected the following information: amount voided (in ml); urgency associated with each toileted void , approximate time of leak, and presence of urge preceding leak.The mean number of urgency episodes over 24 hours was then calculated for each patient during the observation period. The change in median for the mean of the number of urgency episodes over 24 hours) for each treatment group was then calculated.

        <title>Measure Improvement in the Median of the Mean OAB-Symptom Composite Score</title>
        <description>OAB Symptom Composite Score (OAB-SCS) is a composite symptom score of toilet voids, urgency severity and urge urinary incontinence combining the Indevus Urgency Severity Scale (IUSS) for capture of urgency severity per toilet void with 24-hour frequency and UUI episodes.
IUSS Score/void and/or UUI is assigned an OAB-SCS Point/Void: 0(none)=1, 1(mild/easily tolerated)=2, 2(moderate discomfort interfering with activities)=3, 3(severe/extreme urgency discomfort that abruptly stopped all activity or tasks)=4, UUI without void=5.
Overall OAB-SCS Score is calculated for each day by multiplying the OAB-SCS Points/Void and/or UUIs by the number of events meeting criteria and adding the individual scores together. The minimum overall OAB-SCS score in a 24 hour period would be a 1 (representing a single mild void with a OAB –SCS Point/Void score of 0). The score would increase based upon the number voids/events and overall severity each event. Medians calculated for each treatment group.</description>

        <title>Change in Median Total Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) of OAB-q From Baseline (Screening) to Week 12</title>
        <description>The OAB-q is validated to measure symptom bother and life impact due to OAB. It consists of an 8-item Bother Scale to assess individual symptoms and a 25-item HRQL scale that in turn consists of 4 subscales (coping-8 items, concern-7 items, sleep-5 items and social-5 items) to assess impact on life. Responses for each item in the Bother Scale range from 1 (bothered not at all by the symptom) to 6 (Bothered A Very Great Deal). Scores are then added generating an overall Bother Score (severity) ranging from 8 to 48. For HRQL, individual responses range between 1-None of the Time to a 6-All of the Time. Subscale scores range from 8-48 (coping) 7-42 (concern), 5-30 (sleep) and 5-30 (social). Subscale scores are then added to generate the HRQL ranging between 25-150. Raw HRQL scores are transformed for standardization purposes as follows: ((Highest Possible Score-Actual Raw Score)/Range of Scores)*1 00 so that scores could range from 0 (All of the Time) to 100 (None of the Time).</description>

          <title>Change Clinical Global Impressions at 12 Weeks</title>
          <description>CGI is an Investigator assessment, which rates the severity of illness at baseline on a scale of 1 (normal, not ill at all) to 7 (Amongst the most extremely ill patients), and then rates improvement at 12 weeks on a scale of 1 (very much improved) to 10 (very much worse). The analysis was based upon the number of patients that &quot;much&quot; and &quot;very much&quot; improved.</description>

        <title>Evaluate the Median Change From Baseline in Mean Urgency (Urinary) Incontinence Episodes (Leaks) Between the Active and Sham Treatment Groups</title>
        <description>The primary objective of the randomized phase of the study is to evaluate the 12 week and 12 month median change from baseline in mean urgency (urinary) incontinence episodes (leaks) between treatment groups. The mean of the number of urinary incontinence episodes over 24 hours” is defined as the mean of the number of UIEs recorded per 24 hour period for three consecutive days (via a 3-day diary).
Mean urinary frequency episodes calculated for each patient during time period. The median change in frequency was then calculated for each treatment group. Distribution of changes from baseline were then assessed prospectively for normality using the Kolmogorov – Smirnoff test. Since departure from normality was actually observed in the distribution, the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test was performed to compare the median change between treatment groups and the p-values for the test of equality of medians were reported along with the medians.</description>
