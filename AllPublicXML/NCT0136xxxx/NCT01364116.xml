      Measuring total hemoglobin(tHb) is a precious step to decide to start or to stop transfusion
      during operation. The newly developed instrument pulse CO-Cooximetry (Masimo) makes
      noninvasive monitoring of venous hemoglobin level (SpHb).

      The objective of this study

        -  to compare the simultaneous level of tHb and SpHb during operation and after volume
           expansion in children

        -  to assess the accuracy of amount of acute change of SpHb on Masimo and tHb
