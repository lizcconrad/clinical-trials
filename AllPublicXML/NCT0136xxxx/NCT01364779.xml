      The primary objective of the study is to determine the prevalence of aspirin resistance in
      chronic kidney disease patients. The secondary objectives are to determine possible risk
      factors contributing to aspirin resistance in this population.

      A cross-sectional of &quot;aspirin resistance in hemodialysis patients&quot; previously done in our
      institution showed that 23/66 (34.7%) hemodialysis patients were aspirin resistant. In a
      recent systematic review, renal impairment was associated with aspirin resistance . This
      association was seen in only two out of the twenty studies used in this meta-analysis . Both
      these studies are from the same center with a predominant Asian population. In this study we
      will try to evaluate the prevalence of aspirin resistance in CKD patient without being
      limited to a specific ethnicity.
