      extract (Nigella sativa L.) on obesity and overweight

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions mostly in low-income and
      transitional than in industrialized countries. Changes in dietary habits and sedentary
      lifestyles are known to be associated with changes in health and increased prevalence of
      chronic diseases in the population. The need to promote healthy nutrition for the population
      must be pursued vigorously, as the escalation of nutrition-related chronic degenerative
      diseases - once an urban phenomenon - has now spread to the rural population at an alarming
      rate. During the past decades efficacious strategies have been developed for prevention of
      these diseases. These strategies involve general lifestyle changes, which include, healthy
      diet, optimal weight, physical activity, moderate or no alcohol consumption, control of
      diabetes mellitus and in particular, treatment of obesity. Although the global market for
      satiety, fat burning and other weight management remedies has been grown, the awareness of
      the benefits of weight management ingredients is neither sufficient nor clearly perceived by
      consumer. Subsequently, the opportunities for scientifically-substantiated weight management
      ingredients regarding the natural and herbal dietary pattern are impressive.

      The seed of Nigella sativa (black cumin) is one of the most common traditional herbs for
      weight loss in the Middle East which is usually used as a spice as well as traditional
      medicine to treat a variety of health conditions especially inflammatory diseases and
      obesity.

      Furthermore, many of the components present in black cumin including polyphenols have been
      attributed to have anti-inflammatory and anti-obesity effect which further supports our
      hypothesis.
