  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open label, three way study in participants with symptomatic allergic rhinitis.
      The following 3 treatments were administered to each subject during dosing periods 1, 2 and
      3, respectively:

        -  Treatment A: Single intranasal dose of 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine (one 15 mg spray
           into each nostril) on Day 1 of Period 1.

        -  Treatment B: Single intranasal dose of oxymetazoline hydrochloride followed by a single
           intranasal dose of 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine (one 15 mg spray into each nostril) 30
           minutes later on Day 1 of Period 2.

        -  Treatment C: Seven days of treatment with intranasal fluticasone propionate (between
           Periods 2 and 3) followed by a single intranasal dose of 30 mg ketorolac tromethamine
           (one 15 mg spray into each nostril) on Day 1 of Period 3.

      Subjects remained resident in the Clinical Unit from Day 1 until the morning of Day 2 in each
      period and there was a washout period of 2 to 7 days between periods. A post study medical
      was performed within 7 days of Period 3.

      The objectives of this study were:

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of intranasal ketorolac in participants with
           symptomatic allergic rhinitis.

        -  To assess the effects of a single dose of intranasal oxymetazoline hydrochloride on the
           pharmacokinetics and tolerability of intranasal ketorolac in participants with
           symptomatic allergic rhinitis.

        -  To assess the effects of chronic administration of fluticasone propionate on the
           bioavailability and tolerability of intranasal ketorolac in participants with
           symptomatic allergic rhinitis.
