      This ia a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial. patients schedule
      for primary PCI or elective PCI will randomly allocated to receive either a single dose of
      EPO (Recormon, Roche, Epoetin beta) or saline intravenously before PCI.

      The investigators assume that the incidence rate of CIN will be significantly lower in the
      EPO group compared to placebo. In addition, EPO administration will result in a decrease of
      infarct size.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiological procedures utilizing intravascular contrast media are being widely applied for
      both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. This has resulted in the increasing incidence of
      procedure-related contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), which was found to be associated with
      poor outcome including higher in-hospital mortality rates. Therefore, finding ways to prevent
      CIN is a valuable clinical and research goal. However, there are no current methods for
      efficient and cost-effective prevention CIN. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to elicit
      tissue-protective effects in various experimental models and few clinical studies of acute
      kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, this prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled trial aim to evaluate, for the first time, the effectiveness of EPO in the
      prevention of CIN after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

      The potential reno-protective effect of EPO is expected to reduce the incidence of the third
      leading cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury. The above together with a
      cardio-protective effect of EPO is expected to reduce patient's morbidity, mortality and the
      high health cost associated with CIN treatment.
