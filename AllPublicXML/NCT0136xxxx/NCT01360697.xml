      In this demonstration project (JADE in Jiangsu &amp; Anhui Program, JADE-JA in short) led by key
      opinion leaders in the field of diabetes and endocrinology in Jiangsu and Anhui area and
      supported by the ADF, shall recruit 4800 type 2 diabetic patients attending medical
      out-patient clinics in the area to compare the effects of usual versus structured care
      (non-JADE vs JADE) on metabolic control, quality of life and behavioral changes. After
      explanation by trained doctors and nurses and with written informed consent, patients will be
      randomized to either the JADE or non-JADE group. The former encompasses all components of the
      structured care delivered by a trio-team of doctor, nurse and Healthcare Assistant (HCA)
      while the non-JADE group only consists of comprehensive assessments (CA) at baseline and
      12-month with patients managed in the usual manner thereafter. At the end of 12 months, all
      patients will undergo repeat comprehensive assessments for comparison of rates of attainment
      of treatment targets, behavioral changes, quality of life and default rates. The
      acceptability of the JADE-JA Program by patients and the trio-team will also be evaluated.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of state of the art information technology to
      record, manage and analyze the large amount of clinical information generated during various
      consultation visits will improve the effectiveness and efficiency in implementing these care
      protocols through decision support and regular feedback to both patients and care team.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2007, supported by an educational grant, a charitable organization named the Asia Diabetes
      Foundation (ADF) (www.adf.org.hk) was established to develop the Joint Asia Diabetes
      Evaluation (JADE) Program, which comprises a web-based disease management program to enable
      doctors, nurses and other care personnel to manage people with diabetes in an integrated and
      effective manner. The JADE electronic portal (e portal) provides a virtual platform to
      facilitate implementation of evidence-based clinical protocols with ongoing data collection,
      management and analysis to track performance for quality assurance and improvement purposes.
      The JADE Program also incorporates validated risk equations developed by the Chinese
      University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Diabetes Care &amp; Research Group to stratify patients into
      various risk levels for recommendation of triage into different care protocols with decision
      supports. This clinical information, presented in the forms of charts and time trends, can be
      communicated to patients and care providers to motivate behavioral changes, set treatment
      goals and attain targets.

      By participating in the JADE Program, the doctors will be able to create their own diabetes
      registry to benchmark their performance including adherence to procedures, recall of default
      patients and rate of attainment of treatment targets. In this regard, the implementation of
      the full JADE Program requires changes in the practice environment and deployment of
      additional manpower (e.g. a nurse and a HCA) to enter data and provide reminders to patients
      and doctors to improve adherence to protocols.

      It is anticipated that the cost-effectiveness of the structured (JADE group) versus usual
      (non-JADE group) care on rates of attainment of multiple treatment targets, which will
      translate into clinical outcomes in the long term, will eventually change practice and policy
      to make quality diabetes care more affordable, sustainable and accessible in China.

      In this 1-year multi-centre randomized study, the investigators shall use a web-based disease
      management program (JADE e portal) to facilitate implementation of structured care with the
      following objectives:

        -  To evaluate the reach, adoption and acceptability of the JADE e portal by patients and
           health care team

        -  To compare the effectiveness of the JADE versus non-JADE Program in attainment of
           treatment targets, improvement of quality of life and changes in behaviours

        -  To document the pattern of complications, risk factors, use of medications and quality
           of life in type 2 diabetic patients in Jiangsu and Anhui, China.

Whenever feasible, the nurse will arrange 2-4 hours of diabetes education in groups or on an individual basis as appropriate.
Between each follow-up (FU) visit, the nurse or HCA will contact the patient by phone or email to remind them to attend visits, adhere to medications &amp; healthy lifestyles, perform self blood glucose monitoring as appropriate.
At each FU visit, the patients will first see the nurse or HCA for record of blood pressure, body weight &amp; blood glucose (or A1c) measurement as appropriate. Compliance will also be checked using the 4-item questionnaire.
After the FU visit, the patients will see the nurse or HCA again to clarify any issues &amp; concerns, reinforce compliance &amp; record any changes in medications.
After each FU visit, the HCA will generate summary reports to be given to patients &amp; doctors to promote sharing of information.</description>
