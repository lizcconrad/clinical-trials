  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a non-contagious skin disorder affecting up to 2% of the world population. It is
      estimated that 26 million people in the U.S. and Europe suffer from psoriasis. Forty percent
      (40%) of these suffer from psoriasis of the scalp. Currently, there are three primary
      modalities for the treatment of psoriasis: topical, phototherapy and systemic treatments.
      While existing treatments provide varying degrees of relief for this illness, they do not
      provide a long-term cure. Additionally, there is evidence that some of these existing
      treatments may cause significant side effect. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate
      that DermiPsor's DPS-102 (test product) is statistically more effective for the treatment of
      psoriasis current topical treatment options. It is also intended to assess the safety of
      DPS-102.
