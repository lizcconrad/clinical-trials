    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aimed

        1. to investigate the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in elderly nursing home
           residents.

        2. to investigate whether the presence of orthostatic hypotension influences the chance of
           successful rehabilitation.

    <description>Orthostatic hypotension is defined by consensus as a fall in blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg systolic or 10 mmHg diastolic within 3 minutes in the upright position</description>

    <description>Successful rehabilitation is defined as whether the patient is able to return to his/her home or another location (but not a nursing home) after discharge from the nursing home. Unsuccessful rehabilitations implies that the patients becomes a long-stay nursing home resident.</description>
