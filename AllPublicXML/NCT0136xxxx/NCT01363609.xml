  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if endogenous Glucagon Like Peptide -1 (GLP-1) has an
      effect on brain satiety and reward systems and if there are alterations in obese patients
      with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Secondly, the aim is to investigate whether treatment with a
      GLP-1 analog, liraglutide, restores these signals in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
      Finally, also the endogenous GLP-1 effects will be investigated in obese individuals before
      and after gastric bypass surgery on brain satiety and reward systems.

      First aim will be addressed in a cross-sectional randomized study. 20 healthy, lean and 20
      obese individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) will be exposed to food cues and with
      concomitant infusion of glucagon Like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist or saline, to
      assess the involvement of endogenous GLP-1, secreted in response to a meal. Measurements
      activation of CNS circuits involved in satiety and reward will be performed using blood
      oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

      The second aim will be addressed in cross-over randomized-controlled trial (RCT) in the T2DM
      patients only. Patients will be randomly assigned liraglutide vs insulin glargine treatment,
      during a treatment period of 12 weeks each with a 12-week washout period in between. The
      investigators will perform the same fMRI protocol.

      The third aim will be addressed in a study with obese individuals who are scheduled for a
      gastric bypass surgery. The same protocol as for the first aim will be performed and this
      will be before and after the surgery in the same individuals.

- To investigate the involvement of the increased meal-related endogenous GLP-1 levels after gastric bypass surgery in these food-stimuli related CNS satiety and reward responses and to investigate whether pharmacological blocking of endogenous GLP-1 receptor activation, using a GLP-1 antagonist, differentially affects these responses before and after gastric bypass surgery in obese individuals.</description>

Patient will self-titrate the insulin glargine dosage based on self-monitored fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentrations for the previous 3 days using the following guideline: If FBG levels are above 5.6 mmol/L (100-153 mg/dL) on 3 consecutive mornings, the daily dose is to be increased by 2 IU/day. If hypoglycemia documented by glucose concentration &lt; 3.3 mmol/L (60 mg/dL) or requiring assistance occurs without an easily identifiable reason (skipped meal, excessive physical activity), the daily dose is to be downregulated, with -2 IU/day</description>
