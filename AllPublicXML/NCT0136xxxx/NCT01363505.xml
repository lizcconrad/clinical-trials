  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that more than 30% of the overall acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF)
      patients develop renal dysfunction.

      Several studies have tried to find a correlation between hemodynamic Parameters (blood
      pressure , heart rate, central venous pressure CVP) and worsening of renal function in acute
      decompensated heart failure patients.

      Results showed that there were no correlation between baseline hemodynamics or change in
      hemodynamics and worsening of renal function.

      Another study showed that intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measuring was a better corollary to
      renal failure status then measuring cardiovascular hemodynamics using pulmonary artery
      catheterization in ADHF patients.. An increased IAP was associated with worse renal function
      and that level of IAP far below abdominal compartment syndrome may adversely affect renal
      function in patients with ADHF.

        The studied group will consist of patients admitted to the ICU (intensive care unit) or
        CCU(coronary care ubnit) with evidence of ADHF. We aim in our study to find out if there is
        a linear relationship between worsening of renal function , IAP ,hemodynamic (CVP) and
        blood chemical measurements
