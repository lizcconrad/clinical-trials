  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety of topical norepinephrine in head and neck cancer patients
      who are receiving treatment with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

      The study will also provide information about whether topical norepinephrine can prevent or
      decrease the severity of the radiation-induced alopecia experienced by these patients.

    <measure>Safety of daily topical application of norepinephrine to the radiation field.</measure>
    <time_frame>Safety will be assessed during the study (6-7 weeks) and at follow-up visits approximately 2 and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety hypothesis is that there will be that there will be little or no scalp irritation associated with the application of the topical norepinephrine and that there will be no systemic effects secondary to transdermal absorption.</description>

    <time_frame>Efficacy will be assessed during the study (6-7 weeks) and at follow-up visits approximately 2 and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy hypothesis is that areas of the scalp that are treated with topical norepinephrine immediately prior to intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) will have less severe alopecia than scalp sites that are not treated with topical norepinephrine and that receive only placebo.</description>

    <description>The occipital scalp zone at risk for alopecia will be identified. The norepinephrine treatment site will be randomized to receive consistent treatment of one half of the scalp &quot;risk zone.&quot; Approximately 1.6 mL of a 400 mM norepinephrine solution will be applied topically to the norepinephrine site approximately 20 minutes prior to each radiation treatment, and placebo will be applied to the contralateral side (30-35 treatments).</description>
