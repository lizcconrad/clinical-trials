    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, associated with an
      increased risk of morbidity and mortality1. The management of AF patients is aimed at
      reducing symptoms and at preventing severe complications associated with AF. In the last
      years, two new strategies have emerged with different objectives. In the PROTECT AF study2,
      percutaneous closure of the Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) with a closure device provided an
      alternative strategy to oral anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis. The AFFIRM trial3 has
      shown that drug-based management of AF with a rhythm-control strategy conferred no advantage
      over a rate-control strategy in cardiovascular mortality and might be associated with an
      increased noncardiovascular death rate4. Catheter ablation has gained a greater place in the
      rhythm control strategy, showing superiority in maintaining sinus rhythm in comparison with
      AAD5. However, in persistent AF, repeat ablation procedures are necessary in up to 70% of
      patients to achieve sinus rhythm at a long-term follow-up6-7.

      This prospective, randomized trial will compare the percutaneous closure of the LAA combined
      with a rate-control strategy to catheter ablation in the management of patients with
      persistent AF. Patients who are eligible for catheter ablation as well as LAA closure device
      implantation and are willing to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to
      catheter ablation or percutaneous closure of the LAA by a closure device implantation in the
      relation 1:1. The primary endpoint of the study is a composite endpoint at 12 months of all
      cause death, thrombo-embolic events, major bleeding (BARC type 3), re-hospitalisation and
      severe symptoms due to arrhythmias. Secondary endpoints include a composite endpoint of
      bleeding, a composite endpoint of thrombo-embolic events, cardio-vascular mortality, total
      duration of hospitalisation, sustained discontinued anticoagulation, quality of life
      improvement, use of Antiarrhythmic Drugs (AAD), total costs, freedom from arrhythmia and
      average ventricular frequency in 7-day holter ECG at 12 months.

      The objective of the study is to assess the superiority of percutaneous closure of the LAA
      combined with rate-control to catheter ablation in patients with oligosymptomatic AF.
