  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this observational study is to gain clinical insight on the actual use of
      sildenafil citrate (Revatio™) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The
      primary objective is to assess effectiveness and safety of sildenafil at doses ≥20mg three
      times daily for the treatment of PAH.

    <textblock>
      The study design proposed is a retrospective chart review going back five years (01 April
      2006 estimate) from the time of study initiation (31 March 2011 estimate). Within this
      five-year period, study index will occur the first time an adult patient begins sildenafil
      for the treatment of PAH for a period of at least three months. The patient has to be taking
      sildenafil at doses ≥ 20mg tid for the treatment of PAH.
