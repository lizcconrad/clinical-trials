  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study that seeks to characterize data obtained from patients with a variety of lung
      diseases using ultrasound signals obtained from the lung tissue. A standard ultrasound
      instrument in the doppler mode (not the imaging mode used in examination of pregnant women
      for instance) is placed on the chest wall and the unique software the investigators have
      developed analyzes the signal reflected back from within the lung. On the basis of pilot
      studies performed previously the investigators expect to receive different signals from
      different diseases. The investigators seek to further characterize these signals to enable
      accurate diagnosis of different lung diseases using our technology.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Age 18 years or older Patients who are clinically suspected of having pulmonary, cardiac or
        Cardio-pulmonary disease preferably any one or more of the conditions listed below:

          -  Patients with CHF

          -  Patients with pulmonary hypertension with documented right heart catheterization data

          -  Patients with COPD in two subgroups:

               -  Emphysema, (evidence of emphysema on High Resolution Computed Tomography, (HRCT)
                  and airflow limitation of GOLD II severity who have had Carbon Monoxide Diffusing
                  capacity, (DLCO) and Residual Volume(RV) measured, or patients without HRCT with
                  measurements of lung volumes and diffusing capacity with Total Lung Capacity
                  (TLC) ≥1.0 predicted, RV/TLC ≥0.4, DLCO ≤ 0.7 predicted.

               -  Chronic Bronchitis (No evidence of Emphysema on HRCT and/or no evidence of
                  air-trapping or reduced DLCO.)

          -  Patients with asthma according to ATS/ERS definition,

          -  Patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) of any etiology including sarcoidosis
             diagnosed by HRCT in sub groups as follows:

               -  Mild ILD (TLC 0.71-0.79 predicted, DLCO ≥ 0.71 predicted)

               -  Moderate and severe ILD (TLC ≤ 0.7 predicted, DLCO ≤ 0.7 predicted)

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Patients with sarcoidosis without evidence of parenchymal lung disease defined as
             normal DLCO and/or HRCT.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA
