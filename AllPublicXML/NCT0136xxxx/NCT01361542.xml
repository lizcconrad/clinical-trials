  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic painful progressive inflammatory arthritis of
      unknown etiology primarily affecting the spine and sacroiliac joints. In addition to
      formation of new bone leading to syndesmophytes and ankylosis; osteoporosis is also a
      prominent feature in AS-thus showing the paradox of new bone formation at abnormal sites
      coexisting with reduced bone mass &amp; increased fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a common
      complication of AS, with an incidence between 18.7% and 62%. TNF alpha has a central role in
      disturbing this balance in bone metabolism--resulting in accelerated alveolar bone loss and
      decreased strength- i.e. osteoporosis. The investigators hypothesis that anti TNF therapy is
      effective in active AS resistant to conventional therapy and helps in improving the bone
      density and over all bone health.

    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis not responding to conventional therapy has been effectively treated
      with Anti TNF therapy. In addition studies have shown that TNF has a role in osteoporosis of
      inflammatory diseases. The hypothesis that anti TNF therapy may decrease osteoporosis and
      tilt bone metabolism to the osteoblastic side has been tested in few studies. These have not
      been studied in an Indian population. Another great issue in the usage of anti TNF therapy in
      Indian population is the high incidence of developing infective complications; especially
      tuberculosis. The investigators are thus studying these in a north Indian population at a
      tertiary centre. The results would come to important conclusions regarding treatment and in
      the important issue of tuberculosis screening and prevention.
