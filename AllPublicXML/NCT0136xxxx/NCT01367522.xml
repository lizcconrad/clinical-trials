  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, single-dose, parallel-group study. Each subject will
      receive a subcutaneous dose of MNTX. Eight subjects with normal hepatic function and eight
      subjects from each classification of hepatic impairment will be enrolled. Plasma samples will
      be collected before and at specified intervals after dosing and the concentration of MNTX
      will be analyzed.
