  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total duration per patient is up to 52 weeks, which includes a 4 week screening period
      and a 48 weeks study period.

      At the end of the study, the patient will be invited to enter in an open-label safety study
      (LTS13588) and long-term follow-up visits including ophthalmological examinations and
      recording of adverse events for up to 15 years.
