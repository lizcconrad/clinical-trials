      This study will be an observational study in which patients who have been prescribed Metanx®
      are invited to participate in surveys regarding their experiences with Metanx®. The purpose
      of this study is to increase the understanding of the role of Metanx® in managing diabetic
      neuropathy, provide patients with personalized education and support, and contribute to the
      overall understanding of the needs and concerns of patients being treated for diabetic
      neuropathy.

      Surveys used to conduct this study will be administered via telephone or online by
      InfoMedics, Inc., a company with a system for developing such patient-physician feedback
      programs. Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program
      after Metanx® has been prescribed and provide them with a brochure containing an introduction
      to the program and instructions on how to enroll. Patients self-enroll, take a brief survey
      before starting their Metanx® prescription, and then two brief follow-up surveys at 6 weeks
      and 12 weeks. As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will receive
      individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and progress.
      Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to continue
      taking Metanx® as directed. Patients will also receive educational materials about managing
      their diabetic neuropathy.
