  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall goal has been twofold: 1) to evaluate whether there are significant age-related
      changes in flight simulator performance near age 60, and 2) to assess whether there is an
      alternative model that can explain longitudinal flight simulator performance on the basis of
      measures of cognitive function and expertise.

      Our overall goal has been twofold: 1) to evaluate whether there are significant age-related
      changes in flight simulator performance near age 60, and 2) to assess whether there is an
      alternative model that can explain longitudinal flight simulator performance on the basis of
      measures of cognitive function and expertise. Such a model might be able to predict change in
      aviator performance better than what could be predicted by chronological age alone.

    <measure>Aviation-related performance over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>longitudinal</time_frame>
    <description>Participants &quot;fly&quot; in our computerized flight simulator and perform a set of brief tasks designed to measure reaction time and attention span. The study is longitudinal, collecting information about aviation-related performance over time. There is an initial training period, followed by annual visits. During the training period participants learn how to &quot;fly&quot; the simulator, and performance on certain standard maneuvers will be measured during a maximum of 6 simulated flights. At each annual visit, participants fly two 75-minute simulated flights and may be asked to perform up to four holding patterns and instrument landings.</description>
