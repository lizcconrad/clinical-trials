  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether food concentrates supplementation
      (vegetable plus fruit, fish, probiotics) are effective to alleviate drug used, asthma
      symptoms and lung function in children due to asthma.

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of asthma is increasing in Taiwan and worldwide. This could be related to
      dietary factors and their interactions with genes and the environment. Ample evidence from
      cross-sectional and case-control observational studies suggested that consumption level of
      fruits, vegetables, and potentially vitamins A, C, E from foods have negative association
      with asthma risk, and positive association with lung function. However, single nutrient
      supplementation neither improved asthma symptoms and lung function, nor reduced inflammatory
      mediators. Some studies had shown probiotics could regulate human immunity. A number of
      trials have suggested that fish oil supplement improves lung function and reduces
      inflammatory mediator. The potential interactions among multiple components in foods have
      been neglected in the past. Recently, observational studies on dietary pattern analyses or
      intervention trials modifying the overall dietary composition have caught tremendous
      scientific attentions. Therefore, the investigators will design an intervention trial with
      food-based principle to investigate the the joint effect of several beneficial dietary
      components on asthma symptoms. For practicality and efficiency, vegetable plus fruit
      concentrates, fish oil, and probiotic concentrate are considered as supplements to asthmatic
      children. The investigators hope that the study can provided a direction for dietary
      modification in asthma children.
