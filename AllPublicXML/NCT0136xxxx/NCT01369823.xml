      The purpose of this study is to examine whether pump treatment combined with the use of
      continuous glucose monitoring system is a mena to normalize glycaemic control.

      In this study, 100 subjects, users of Paradigm 522/722 Infusion Pump and Self- Monitoring
      Blood Glucose finger sticks for the control of their glucose levels for at least 3 months
      prior enrollment will participate. Moreover the subjects won't have achieved the best blood
      glucose control, with an average HbA1c above 7% and should meet all the inclusion and none of
      the exclusion criteria. The HbA1c value for screening purposes can be taken from the medical
      chart, while in the enrollment visit according to current medical practice of each
      investigational center, the sample taken for HbA1c measurement will be analyzed centrally by
      HPLC, in a lab in Germany. In all enrolled patients a continuous glucose monitoring system
      will be provided. Since this is an observational study, the provision of the glucose
      monitoring system will be based on medical justification and will not be done per protocol
      requirement. All subjects will be followed for 3 months according to the current medical
      practice of each investigational center. All other visits, e.g. patient comes into the
      hospital because of symptoms, will also be recorded as unscheduled visits. These visits are
      usually linked to Adverse Events.

        This is an observational pilot study that does not have a statistically powered primary
        hypothesis. The data collected during this study are for the purpose of accumulating
        information that may generate research ideas and lead to publications. For this reason a
        sample size of 100 subjects has been defined. The statistical analysis will be descriptive
        statistics and will be described in a separate statistical analysis plan. Moreover any
        enrolled patient that has a sensor usage % in the end of the study that is less than 65%
        will be excluded from the analysis.
