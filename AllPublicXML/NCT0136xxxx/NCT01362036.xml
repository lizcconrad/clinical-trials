      Phase 1, single-center, open-label, sequential cohort dose escalation study. This is a 3 + 3
      design study involving at least 3 subjects in ascending dose cohorts, with subjects
      participating up to 10 weeks.

      The overall study objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TXA127 in
      thrombocytopenic subjects with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS.

      Evaluation of the platelet response and the erythroid and granulocytic responses to TXA127
      will provide preliminary efficacy data.

      The hematopoietic properties demonstrated in the preclinical and clinical studies support the
      investigation of TXA127 to stimulate stem cell and progenitor cell proliferation. This is an
      exploratory study in a limited population of low or intermediate-1 MDS subjects who have
      platelet counts of ≤50 x 109/L to evaluate the effects of TXA127 on platelet response and on
      granulocytic and erythroid response.

      Platelet response will be defined as complete and major as below:

        -  Complete platelet response: increase of platelet count to &gt;100 x 109/L

        -  Major platelet response: increase of absolute platelet count by &gt;30 x 109/L Other
           responses will be according to modified IWG MDS criteria (2006). Daily subcutaneous
           dosing of TXA will be carried out both in the clinic at scheduled visits and at home
           between clinic visits for a period fo 28 days.
