  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a disabling mental disease affecting about 1% of the worldwide population.
      There is an overall heritability estimate of 68% for the underlying liability to
      schizophrenia. Molecular epigenetic studies can overcome the complexities of traditional
      genetic studies and provide a new framework for the search of etiological factors in
      schizophrenia.

      DNA methylation provides an example of an epigenetic process that affects gene expression.
      Several postmortem experiments have found that increased DNA methylation at the glutamic acid
      decarboxylase (GAD67) and reelin promoter, and hypomethylation of membrane-bound
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (MB-COMT) promoter gene in prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia
      patients.

      Because it is impossible to obtain brain tissue from schizophrenia patients clinically, the
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) can partly represent the brain gene expression. It
      has been reported to use PBMC as biomarkers for epigenetic abnormalities, such as histone
      acetylation and methylation, in schizophrenia. To the investigators best knowledge, gene
      promoter DNA methylation abnormalities in schizophrenia have been limited to postmortem
      study. It warrants to studying the DNA methylation using schizophrenia's PBMC.

      Recently, endophenotype strategy has emerged as an important tool in understanding the
      genetic architecture of schizophrenia. Some cognitive functions, such as attention and
      working memory (WM), have been used as candidate endophenotypes for genetic studies in
      schizophrenia. Synchronized GABA neurotransmission in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is
      required for adequate attention and working memory, suggesting that impairments in
      GABA-mediated inhibition in the prefrontal cortex could contribute to the endophenotype
      presentations in schizophrenia.

      The study will be approved by Institutional Review Board of participated institutions before
      recruiting patients. We will recruit 60 patients with schizophrenia and 60 healthy control
      subjects after explaining the study goal and getting the informed consents.

      We will evaluate the performance of continuous performance test (CPT) and working memory
      subset in Chinese version of WAIS-III in both case and control subjects. We will assay
      reelin, GAD, and MB-COMT gene promoter DNA methylation using methylation specific PCR (MSP)
      and quantify these gene expression using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
      reaction (qRT-PCR).

      Patients will be followed in one year and receive the same evaluation.
