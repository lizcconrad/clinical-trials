    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to obtain data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics
      (PD) and immune system effect of the BAT24 dosing regimen versus daily and pericoital dosing
      regimens with vaginal use of tenofovir 1% gel after a single sex act and after multiple sex
      acts.

    <description>Each participant will be randomized to one of nine groups: (dosing regimen: BAT24, precoital or postcoital) x (sample collection time-point: 4, 12 or 72 hours after the single act of study-related sex). Approximately 30 women will be assigned to each dosing regimen.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>TFV concentrations in blood plasma, aspirate and tissue and TFV-DP concentrations in PBMCs, endocervical cells and tissue to evaluate if daily or intermittent pericoital dosing provides concentrations similar to BAT24 after two weeks of twice weekly sex</measure>

    <description>Participants will be randomized to 1 of 12 groups: (dosing regimen: BAT24, precoital, postcoital or daily) x (sample collection time-point: 4, 12 or 72 hrs after the last act of study-related sex). 30 women will be assigned to each the BAT24 and daily dosing regimens; 15 will be assigned to each the pre- and postcoital dosing regimens. Those assigned to the BAT24 or a pericoital regimen will have study-related sex twice weekly for 2 weeks. Those assigned to the daily regimen will use the gel at about the same time each day for 2 weeks and to have sex at least twice each week.</description>

             and Gynecologist (ACOG) practice guideline #109 (see study manual) or willing to
             undergo a Pap smear at Visit 1. (Note: See study manual for clarification of
             eligibility criteria specific to Pap smear results.)

             including spermicides, lubricants, vaginal hygiene products, contraceptive
             intravaginal ring, diaphragms, and cervical caps (non-hormonal IUC if used as her
