  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the European Union (EU), plerixafor is indicated in combination with granulocyte colony
      stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the
      peripheral blood (PB) for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in patients
      with lymphoma and multiple myeloma (MM) whose cells mobilise poorly.

      This is a clinical outcome analysis of a prospectively defined cohort of patients with data
      reported retrospectively to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)
      who have lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM), whose cells mobilize poorly, and who have
      undergone autologous haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation during the years 2008 up
      to and including 2012.

      The EBMT is a non-profit, scientific society representing more than 600 transplant centers
      mainly in Europe. The EBMT promotes all activity aiming to improve stem cell transplantation
      or cellular therapy, which includes registering all the activity relating to stem cell
      transplants. Data are entered, managed, and maintained in a central database with internet
      access; each EBMT center is represented in this database.

      The analysis of data from a well established registry like the EBMT registry allows for
      follow up of a large number of patients who are representative of the patient population
      receiving plerixafor.

        Patients with data reported to the EBMT who have lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM) and who
        have undergone autologous haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation during the years
        2008 up to and including 2012.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For inclusion in the cohort analysis, patients must have data in the EBMT registry that
        meet the following criteria:

          -  Adults diagnosed with lymphoma or multiple myeloma (MM)

          -  Received first autologous transplants of peripheral blood (PB) non ex-vivo manipulated
             stem cells in the time period listed above using cells mobilised with one of the
             following regimens:

               -  plerixafor plus granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)

               -  plerixafor plus G-CSF plus chemotherapy

               -  G-CSF alone or

               -  G-CSF plus chemotherapy

        Note: Patients included in the plerixafor groups will be those treated according to the
        label

          -  Provision of informed consent (i.e., all patients with data in the EBMT registry will
             have signed consent at the time of transplantation for the potential use of their data
             for analysis)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients treated with plerixafor NOT according to the European Union (EU) label.

          -  Patients whose graft product underwent ex vivo manipulation will be excluded from
             analysis
