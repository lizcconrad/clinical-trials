  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of paliperidone
      extended release (ER) in symptomatic participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder
      with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and
      hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self) who were receiving treatment with any oral
      (having to do with the mouth) antipsychotic medication and who needed to be switched to
      paliperidone ER from the current oral antipsychotic therapy due to insufficient efficacy or
      due to side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-centric
      (conducted in more than one center) and non-comparative study of paliperidone ER in
      participants with schizophrenia who have a previous history of bad adherence to the
      antipsychotic treatment because of insufficient efficacy and side-effects. All the eligible
      participants will receive a dose of paliperidone ER in range of 3 to 12 milligram (mg) orally
      (taken by mouth; to be swallowed) once daily for 13 weeks. Efficacy and safety will primarily
      be evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS) and Extrapyramidal Symptom
      Rating Scale (ESRS), respectively. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - Total Score at Week 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self) including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210, higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) - Positive Subscale Score at Week 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS Positive Subscale assesses seven positive-symptoms of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal functions. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, with a range of 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Subjective Well-being Under Neuroleptic (SWN 20) Scale at Week 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The SWN 20 scale is a 20 item scale that was originally designed to explore the subjective experience of psychotic participants. The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI 30) Scale at Week 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The DAI is a 30-item self-rating inventory that focuses on subjective effects of neuroleptic medications in participants with schizophrenia. There are 15 items that are scored as true and 15 scored as false if the person is fully compliant (positive subjective response). Positive answers score as +1, negative answers score as - 1. Questionnaire allows identifying participants at high risk of low compliance. The total score may vary from -30 to +30 with a high total final score is a positive subjective response (compliant) and a low total score is a negative subjective response (non-compliant).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to normal, not at all ill and a rating of 7 is equivalent to among the most extremely ill participants. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) at Week 13</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP is 100-point validated clinician-rated scale that assesses degree of difficulty in 4 areas of functioning: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviors rated on 6-point scale (1=absent to 6=very severe).Total transformed score from 1 to 100 is generated from raw score based on clinical interpretation of scores generated in 4 areas of functioning, with higher transformed score indicating better function. Total score is divided into 3 levels: 71-100 (mild difficulty); 31-70 (marked difficulty) and 1-30 (severe difficulty).</description>

        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self) including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210, higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <description>The SWN 20 scale is a 20 item scale that was originally designed to explore the subjective experience of psychotic participants. The SWN scale contains five sub-scales consisting of four items each: mental functioning (MF), self control (SC), emotional regulation (ER), and social integration (SI), physical functioning (PF). The total score ranges from a minimum of 20 (poor subjective experience) to a maximum of 120 (excellent subjective experience). SWN scores appear to correlate with measure of objective psychopathology, quality of life and other self-ratings of mood.</description>

Questionnaire allows identifying participants at high risk of low compliance. The total score may vary from -30 to +30 with a high total final score is a positive subjective response (compliant) and a low total score is a negative subjective response (non-compliant).</description>
