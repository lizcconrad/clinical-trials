        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients willing to sign the informed consent.

          -  Patients able to comply with follow-up requirements including postoperative weight
             bearing restrictions and self-evaluations.

          -  Male and non-pregnant female patients ages 21-80 years of age at time of surgery.

          -  Patients requiring a primary total knee replacement.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA), traumatic arthritis (TA), or
             avascular necrosis (AVN).

          -  Patients with intact collateral ligaments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with inflammatory arthritis.

          -  Patients that are morbidly obese, body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40.

          -  Patients with a history of total or unicompartmental reconstruction of the affected
             joint.

          -  Patients that have had a high tibial osteotomy or femoral osteotomy.

          -  Patients with neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which would limit the ability
             to assess the performance of the device.

          -  Patients with a systemic or metabolic disorder leading to progressive bone
             deterioration.

          -  Patients that are immunologically compromised, or receiving chronic steroids (&gt;30
             days).

          -  Patients bone stock is compromised by disease or infection, which cannot provide
             adequate support and/or fixation to the prosthesis.

          -  Patients with knee fusion to the affected joint.

          -  Patients with an active or suspected latent infection in or about the knee joint.

          -  Patients that computer-assisted surgical navigation (CAOS) techniques will be used.

          -  Patients that minimally invasive surgical technique will be used.

          -  Patients that are prisoners.
