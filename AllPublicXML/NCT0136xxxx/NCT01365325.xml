      The aim of the study is to compare two different home monitoring care programs in patients
      with chronic heart failure in functional class NYHA III, one of them based on clinical and
      electrocardiographic evaluations, the other one using also periodical handled
      echocardiographic examinations.

      Randomized, blinded, controlled, monocentric study comparing two different home monitoring
      care programs in patients with chronic heart failure in functional class NYHA III, one of
      them based on clinical and electrocardiographic evaluations every three months, the other one
      using also periodical handheld echocardiographic examinations at the 6th, 12th and 18th
      month.

      The events occurring during the 18 month follow up and the results of the final
      echocardiography performed in all the patients will be transmitted to and evaluated by an
      independent observer, unaware of the features of the follow up. At the end of the trial, the
      randomization code will be opened and the events will be ascribed to the two groups. The
      primary end point is rehospitalization for worsening of heart failure symptoms and/or for the
      appearance of major vascular events during the 18 months follow up. Secondary end points
      include home treated vascular events, cardiovascular death and the composite end point death
      + rehospitalization.
