    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify, prior to prescribing, which neuropathic pain
      patients will benefit from duloxetine more specific the investigators aims are to:

        -  Verify whether presence of chronic pain alters the pain modulation mechanisms, such as
           DNIC (diffuse noxious inhibitory control) and TS (temporal summation).

        -  Investigate whether anti-neuropathic medications such as duloxetine indeed change the
           pain modulation profile, and whether this profile change is associated with a reduction
           of clinical pain.

      There is no accepted practice for selecting among recommended medications for the individual
      neuropathic pain patient. Guidelines published to date provided the evidence for their
      efficacy, however, data is not available on how to choose the right medication for the right
      patient in order to avoid long 'trial and error's. We hypothesize that medications affecting
      specific process of pain modulation will be more efficacious in patients expressing
      dysfunction of that specific process. Therefore, medications that enhance descending
      inhibition such as SSNRI will be more efficacious in patients with less-efficient pain
      inhibition. The latter is assessed by the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm.
      Accordingly, the aim of this study is to examine this hypothesis in painful diabetic
      neuropathy patients, using duloxetine, an SSNRI agent assumed to augment descending pain
      inhibition by reuptake inhibition of noradrenalin and serotonin in the spinal cord dorsal
      horn synapses. We expect to find better effect of duloxetine in those patients whose pain
      inhibition capability is less efficient, as expressed by their baseline CPM. Further, we aim
      to evaluate whether pro-nocieptive pattern of pain modulation indeed reverses in response to
      treatment. This will be explored by comparing the CPM responses before and after treatment,
      and by correlating pain alleviation with the possible changes in CPM.
