  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double-blind, randomized, two-cohort, placebo-controlled, parallel group study
      characterized the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of MNTX following single doses
      and at steady-state during multiple dosing and assessed the effects of aging on the
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of MNTX.
