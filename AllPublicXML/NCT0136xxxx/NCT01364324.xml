      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of gastrectomy on pharmacokinetic profile
      of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrectomy is a well-known risk factor for TB. Also, there were some reports about
      malabsorption of anti-TB drugs in the gastrectomized patients. However, pharmacokinetics of
      recently used first line anti-TB drugs in the gastrectomized patients have not been well
      evaluated simultaneously. Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of
      gastrectomy on pharmacokinetic profile of first-line anti-TB drugs in patients with pulmonary
      TB through this study.

    <measure>The effects of pharmacokinetics on responses of pulmonary TB to anti-TB drug</measure>
    <time_frame>9month after anti-TB treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment duration can be varied according to several factors such as a first TB episode or not, cavitary TB, and AFB culture(+) after 2month-treatment etc. We will plan 6 or 9 months treatment for each patient according to these factors. During treatment period, we will check chest radiographs and sputum AFB smear/culture with every 2-3month intervals. At 9month after treatment, we will evaluate the effects of pharmacokinetics on responses of pulmonary TB to anti-TB drug by taking account of improvement on chest radiograph and negative conversion and its continuation on sputum smear/culture.</description>

        Among patients with pulmonary TB diagnosed in our hospital and treated with 4 first line
        anti-TB drug(isoniazid/rifampicin/ethambutol/pyrazinamide= HREZ), we recruit patients who
        underwent gastrectomy to Gastrectomy group. And then, we recruit age-sex matched patients
        who did not underwent gastrectomy to Non-gastrectomy group.(age ±3 years)
