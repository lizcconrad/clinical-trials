  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a short lead-in course (8
      weeks) of entecavir followed by combination of entecavir plus peginterferon alfa-2a for 40
      weeks. The investigators hypothesize that using a potent nucleos(t)ide analogue will provide
      a higher rate of loss of HBeAg loss and suppression of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of treatment with 8 weeks of entecavir followed by 40 weeks of both
      entecavir and peginterferon in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in hepatitis B &quot;e&quot;
      antigen (HBeAg) positive adults who are in the immune tolerant phase.

      To evaluate &quot;off treatment&quot; safety and sustained responses after treatment with entecavir and
      peginterferon alfa-2a in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in HBeAg positive adults who
      are in the immune tolerant phase.

      A single arm treatment study of 8 weeks of entecavir followed by 40 weeks of both entecavir
      and peginterferon alfa-2a in adults with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B with normal or
      near normal ALT levels and high serum levels of HBV DNA (&quot;immune tolerant&quot; HBeAg-positive
      chronic hepatitis B). All participants will be followed until week 96 (48 weeks after
      discontinuation of therapy in the treatment group) at which time the primary outcome will be
      measured.
