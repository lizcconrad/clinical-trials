      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well giving alemtuzumab and ofatumumab
      together works in treating patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (CLL). Monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab and ofatumumab, can block cancer growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells
      and help kill them or carry cancer killing substances to them. Giving alemtuzumab together
      with ofatumumab may kill more cancer cells

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab-ofatumumab combination treatment in
      previously untreated CLL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive alemtuzumab subcutaneously (SC) three times a week in weeks 1-18 and
      ofatumumab intravenously (IV) over 4-6 hours on day 1 of weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and
      17.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.
