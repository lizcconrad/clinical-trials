  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to reduce the disparity in hypertensive heart disease which exists for
      African-Americans who have poorly controlled hypertension (HTN), also known as blood pressure
      (BP). The investigators are targeting a highly vulnerable, often neglected subject population
      which stands to benefit tremendously from better BP control and a corresponding decrease in
      heart damage. HTN occurs early in life and more often in African-Americans, reducing both
      quality and quantity of life. Inner-city African-Americans with HTN utilize the emergency
      department (ED) for chronic BP management. Like cardiovascular disease, vitamin D deficiency
      disproportionately affects African-Americans. Vitamin D is thought to play an important role
      in cardiovascular health. Vitamin D replacement in those who are deficient has been thought
      to reduce the cardiovascular disease, especially if initiated early before irreversible
      damage has occurred, but this has yet to be tested in a prospective clinical trial.
      Accordingly, this proposal was designed to investigate the relationship between vitamin D and
      cardiac damage (as identified on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) in a cohort of
      African-American, vitamin D deficient hypertensive patients without prior history of heart
      disease.

      The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D therapy in
      vitamin D deficient African-Americans with HTN. Vitamin D is an inexpensive treatment, which,
      if shown to be effective could improve the existing approach to a widely accessible,
      cost-effective option.
