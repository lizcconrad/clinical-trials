  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic fatigue (CF) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are disabling disorders that may be
      induced or aggravated by underlying sleep disturbances. The relationship between sleep
      quality and fatigue is still not fully elucidated. To evaluate the effect of improved sleep
      quality on fatigue, a randomized controlled and cross-over trial with nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is carried out in patients who present with a primary
      complaint of chronic disabling fatigue and who are found to have an apnea-hypopnea index
      (AHI) &gt;= 15 on polysomnography (PSG).

      The aim of this study is to address the issue of Continuous Positive Airway
      Pressure-responsiveness regarding fatigue as a presenting symptom in CF and CFS patient with
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in the absence of underlying medical or psychiatric illness.
      The answer to this question may shed further light on the enigmatic relationship between
      sleep and fatigue. We also want to investigate the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      responsiveness regarding sleepiness and general health in the same target population.
      Zero-hypothesis: there is no effect.

    <description>Patients are randomized into active or control arm. After the first treatment, a washout period is installed,after which therapy is switched according to the cross-over protocol. A CPAP device consists of a unit that generates airflow, which is directed to the airway via a mask. With active CPAP, the generated airflow creates a positive pressure and prevents upper airway collapse. With sham CPAP, the generated airflow creates a very low pressure.</description>
