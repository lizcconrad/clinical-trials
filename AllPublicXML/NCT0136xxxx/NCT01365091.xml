      To demonstrate the bioequivalence of saxagliptin and metformin in a saxagliptin,
      5-mg/metformin extended-release (XR), 500-mg, fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet with
      saxagliptin, 5-mg and metformin, 500-mg XR tablets administered together in both the fasted
      and fed states. In addition, to demonstrate the bioequivalence of saxagliptin and metformin
      in a saxagliptin, 5-mg/metformin XR, 1000-mg, FDC tablet with saxagliptin, 5-mg and
      metformin, 1000-mg XR tablets administered together in both the fasted and fed states.
