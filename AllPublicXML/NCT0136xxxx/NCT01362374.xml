  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase Ib, dose-escalation study designed to assess the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral GDC-0068 administered in combination with
      either docetaxel (Arm A), or oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (mFOLFOX6
      chemotherapy) (Arm B), or paclitaxel (Arm C), in participants with advanced or metastatic
      solid tumors for which standard therapy either does not exist or has proven ineffective or
      intolerable. Arm D will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0068
      administered in combination with enzalutamide in participants with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). There will be two stages within each arm of this
      study: a dose-escalation stage (Stage 1) and a cohort-expansion stage (Stage 2). In Stage 1,
      approximately 3 to 6 cohorts in Arms A and B and 1 to 2 cohorts in Arms C and D will be
      evaluated to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GDC-0068 in a given combination.
      Additional participants will be enrolled in Stage 2 (cohort expansion), to further
      characterize the safety and tolerability of GDC-0068 in these combinations and to confirm a
      potential recommended Phase II dose of GDC-0068 for each regimen.
