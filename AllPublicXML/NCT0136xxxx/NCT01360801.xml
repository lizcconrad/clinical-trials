    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to test the hypothesis that the improved version of high definition
      white light endoscopes and Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) are more accurate in detecting residual
      Barrett's Metaplasia and Dysplasia disease after previous resection or ablation treatments
      than current versions of these endoscopes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years and older

          -  Patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) dysplasia as the original indication for
             treatment

          -  Undergoing any type of endoscopic BE resection or ablation treatment including RFA,
             cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, or EMR, or combinations of these.

          -  &lt;1cm of circumferential, peninsular, or island-type BE on prior endoscopy or ablation

          -  Ability to provide written, informed consent

        Deferral Criteria: This category is for patients in two specific situations, 1) Erosive
        esophagitis, and, 2) presence of a nodule suspicious for the presence of neoplasia.

          1. Erosive esophagitis: patients found to have erosive esophagitis, will be deferred for
             up to 3 months from their Index study procedure, to permit more aggressive medical
             therapy to heal the erosive esophagitis. After healing, the Index study procedure will
             be performed up to 3 months later, and the follow-up endoscopy (and study closure)
             performed 3 to 6 months after that (total of no more than 9 months).

          2. Presence of nodule suspicious for neoplasia: for patients found to have such nodular
             lesions, the Index study procedure will be deferred for 3 months, while Endoscopic
             Mucosal Resection is performed and subsequently heals.

        Note: Only one deferral per patient is permitted, and this one deferral is allowed only for
        these specific criteria. The end of the study will be defined by the time of follow-up of
        the last patient who was not deferred; any deferred patients who have not completed
        follow-up procedures by that time, may miss their follow-up visit as part of the study.
        (This is to prevent the possibility of delaying the close of the study due to deferral of a
        procedure late in the study.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current participation in another clinical study

          -  Complete eradication of BE documented by biopsies in 3 or more previous endoscopic
             procedures performed after resection/ablation

          -  Inability to obtain biopsies due to anticoagulation, varices, etc.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Worse than Grade C erosive esophagitis

          -  Less than 3 weeks from previous endoscopy with biopsy or 6 weeks from previous
             endoscopic therapy (ablation or resection).
