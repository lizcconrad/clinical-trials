    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts: Part A is a randomized, multiple-dose, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled sequential dose escalation study to evaluate GS-6624 in subjects with
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and was completed in October 2011.

      Part B is a randomized, two-dose, open-label dose expansion study to evaluate GS-6624 in
      subjects with IPF and is currently enrolling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, and PK of
      GS-6624 after multiple IV administrations in patients with IPF. The secondary objectives are
      to evaluate the formation of anti-GS-6624 antibodies and to measure the effects of GS-6624 on
      FVC, DLCO, and SGRQ score. A total of 48 patients will be enrolled. In the double-blind phase
      (Part A), a total of 18 patients were enrolled at 3 dose levels. Part A was completed in
      October 2011.

      In Part B, 30 patients will be enrolled at 2 dose levels. Part B is open-label and is
      currently enrolling.
