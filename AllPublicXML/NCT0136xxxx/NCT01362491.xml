    <measure>Time-weighted Sum of Pain Relief Rating and Pain Intensity Difference From 0-3 Hours (SPRID 0-3) for Ibuprofen Sodium Versus Placebo Tablet</measure>
    <time_frame>0-3 Hours</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID:time-weighted sum of pain relief rating combined with pain intensity difference (PRID) over 3 hours. SPRID score range:-3 (worst) to 21 (best) for SPRID 0-3. PRID: sum of pain intensity differences (PID) and pain relief rating(PRR) at each time point. PRID score range: -1=worst to 7=best. PID: baseline pain severity score minus pain severity score at a given time point (score range 0=none to 3=severe; baseline score range 2=moderately severe to 3=severe). Total score range for PID: -1(worst) to 3 (best). PRR:assessed on 5-point pain relief rating scale (0=No relief to 4=Complete relief).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Onset of Meaningful Relief for Ibuprofen Sodium Versus Ibuprofen (Motrin IB) Tablet</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluated the time to meaningful relief by stopping a second stopwatch labeled 'meaningful relief' at the moment the participant first began to experience meaningful relief. It was also considered achieved if the participant stated &quot;meaningful relief&quot; at the time the first stopwatch was depressed. Stopwatch was active up to 3 hours after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or rescue medication was administered.</description>

    <measure>Time to Confirmed First Perceptible Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants evaluated the time to first perceptible relief by stopping a stopwatch labeled 'first perceptible relief' at the moment the participant first began to experience any relief. Stopwatch was active up to 3 hours after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or rescue medication was administered. First perceptible relief was considered confirmed by meaningful relief if the participant achieved both &quot;first perceptible&quot; and &quot;meaningful&quot; relief by either depressing the second stopwatch or by indicating that his/her &quot;first perceptible&quot; relief was also &quot;meaningful&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity Difference (PID)</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 2 &amp; 3 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>PID was derived by subtracting the pain severity score at a given post-dosing time point [pain severity score range 0 (none) to 3 (severe)] from the baseline score [Baseline pain severity score range 2 (moderately severe) to 3 (severe)]. Total possible score range for PID: -1 (worst) to 3 (best).</description>

          <title>Time to Confirmed First Perceptible Relief</title>
          <description>Participants evaluated the time to first perceptible relief by stopping a stopwatch labeled 'first perceptible relief' at the moment the participant first began to experience any relief. Stopwatch was active up to 3 hours after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or rescue medication was administered. First perceptible relief was considered confirmed by meaningful relief if the participant achieved both &quot;first perceptible&quot; and &quot;meaningful&quot; relief by either depressing the second stopwatch or by indicating that his/her &quot;first perceptible&quot; relief was also &quot;meaningful&quot;.</description>

          <description>PRID was sum of PID and PRR at each post-dosing time point. The overall possible score range, for PRID was -1 (worst) to 7 (best). PID was derived by subtracting the pain severity score at a given post-dosing time point [pain severity score range 0 (none) to 3 (severe)] from the baseline score [Baseline pain severity score range 2 (moderately severe) to 3 (severe)]. Total possible score range for PID: -1 (worst) to 3 (best). PRR was assessed on 5-point categorical pain relief rating scale (0=No relief to 4=Complete relief).</description>

          <description>SPRID: time-weighted sum of PRID over 2 and 3 hours. SPRID score range was -2(worst) to 14(best) for SPRID 0-2 and -3 (worst) to 21 (best) for SPRID 0-3. PRID: sum of PID and PRR at each time point. Total score range for PRID: -1=worst to 7=best. PID: baseline pain severity score minus pain severity score at a given time point (score range 0=none to 3=severe; baseline score range 2=moderately severe to 3=severe). Total score range for PID: -1(worst) to 3(best), PRR: assessed on 5-point pain relief rating scale (0=No relief to 4=Complete relief).</description>
