  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on information from several years of looking at Influenza vaccination doctors know
      that:

        -  Older adults suffer the worst illness and most deaths caused by Influenza illness of all
           age groups.

        -  Older adults do not seem to get as good a level of protection as younger adults after
           getting the usual seasonal Influenza vaccine.

      Because of this information doctors wonder if one of the new seasonal Influenza vaccines is
      more effective or more acceptable.

      This study has been designed to answer some of these questions. On this study doctors will
      compare 2 new vaccines against the usual seasonal influenza vaccine for protectiveness using
      several different testing methods (including the usual tests) and for acceptability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is prospective, multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blinded, controlled, parallel
      group study of 3 licensed seasonal influenza vaccine products conducted in seniors, with a
      4th vaccine included in a substudy of cellular immune responses.

      Ambulatory adults 65+ years of age, in good health or with stable health conditions, given
      TIV within the past 2 years, will be recruited in multiple Canadian centres. Subjects can be
      dwelling in the community or in centers providing minimal assisted living support. A total of
      930 subjects will be enrolled.

      Subjects will be centrally (electronically) randomized to receive either TIV, IDV or AIV on
      Day 0. Three blood samples will be collected (1 pre and 2 post vaccination) to measure HAI
      antibody responses to each virus strain (H1N1, H3N2 and B) in each vaccine, using
      standardized assays. Randomly selected subsets of sera from each study group will also be
      tested for neutralizing antibody and for cross-protection against drift variants of H3N2,
      H1N1 and B viruses. In a subset of subjects in Vancouver, randomization assignments will
      include TIV2 and extra blood samples will be obtained 0, 21 and 72 days post vaccination for
      CMI testing. Safety assessments will be conducted on Day 7, Day 21 and Day 180 following
      vaccination. Acceptability of each product, reflecting the frequency, severity and
      tolerability of adverse effects, will be assessed.

    <description>The primary outcome measures will be the 3-week post-vaccination immune (HAI) responses to the 3 vaccine strains present in each product, assessed by the EMEA/CHMP criteria for evaluation of immune responses to influenza vaccines in persons &gt;60 years of age.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0; Day 21; and Day 70</time_frame>
    <description>As secondary immunologic outcomes seroprotection rates will be compared between the products using a higher titer (â‰¥160) as threshold. Microneutralization titers will be compared among products at the 3 sampling points, using sera from 100 subjects per group. Cross-protection afforded by each vaccine against drift variants of H3N2, H1N1 and B viruses will be assessed using serum panels selected from 50 subjects in each group. Cellular immune responses elicited will be compared in subgroups of 30 subjects per vaccine in the CMI subjset.</description>

    <description>Safety and acceptability of the vaccines will also be examined and compared as the safety outcomes. The primary outcome measurements will be the rates of local adverse events (pain, redness, swelling, itchiness) as rates of general adverse events are not expected to differ substantially among the products.</description>

    <description>(Intanza 15ug, Sanofi Pasteur) is an inactivated, split-virion influenza vaccine. Strains are grown in fertilized hen's eggs, inactivated with formalin and split using Triton X-100 detergent, as for TIV. The syringe is attached to a micro-needle injection system (Beckton Dickinson) that limits the depth of injection to just under the skin. It is given into the skin over the upper arm at a dose of 0.1 mL.</description>
