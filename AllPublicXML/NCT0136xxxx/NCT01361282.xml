  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with endothelial dysfunction also present with cataracts. It is therefore
      common practice to perform cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation during
      the same operation and immediately prior to Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial
      Keratoplasty (DSAEK), in order to minimize trips to the operating room and the associated
      risks of ocular surgery. However, the unique posterior corneal anatomy of the DSAEK recipient
      makes it difficult to predict pre-operatively the proper power of IOL to place, and some
      patients end up with a mismatched lens that requires spectacle correction. The current gold
      standard for IOL power calculation (A-Scan optical biometry) takes measurements of the
      anterior surface of the cornea and makes assumptions about the posterior surface that are
      violated by the unique hourglass shape of the donor DSAEK graft. New optical coherence
      tomography (OCT) technology provides us with the ability to measure curvature in both the
      anterior and posterior aspects of the cornea in order to generate an IOL calculation that has
      the potential to give more accurate results for our DSAEK patients.

      The investigators will be using the Optovue to perform corneal power analysis on patients who
      have already received DSAEK and cataract surgery, in order to compare the post-op Optovue
      power calculations to the pre-operative power calculations provided by the A-Scan. If the OCT
      is shown to provide accurate IOL power calculations, then some patients might be better
      served by a two-stage procedure where DSAEK is performed and then followed six months later
      by cataract surgery using the OCT to calculate IOL power.
