      -  Background : The general experience with the Virtual Reality application approach
           suggests that this treatment concept is promising in stroke rehabilitation

        -  Purpose : In shopping activity in a real supermarket and in simulated with the
           investigators virtual shopping simulation (VAP-S = virtual action planning supermarket),
           the investigators will compare people who had undergone a stroke who receive
           conventional rehabilitation or virtual training in VAP-S.

      The objective of this study is firstly to examine the effectiveness of using virtual
      reality-based training VAP-S on the ability to run errands in a real supermarket in
      individuals with stroke. Virtual environment provide useful way to explore planning and
      secondly to examine the effectiveness of using VR in the assessment of cognitive planning for
      patients. A virtual supermarket was designed in which participants carried out a task close
      to daily activities: a test of shopping list. Of the 70 subjects (7 centres), 35 randomly
      allocated to the control group, and the other 35 subjects randomly allocated to the
      experimental group. Subjects will be evaluated by a therapist who will not be involved in the
      training program and did not know about the subject's group assignment.

      Statistical analysis : We will calculate descriptive statistics for the clinical
      characteristics of each group. We will use to compare the baseline demographic
      characteristics, the pretraining and posttraining variables between groups,
      independent-samples t-tests for means and Chi-square tests for frequencies. A significance
      level of 0.05 is set for all analyses.

    <description>The experimental group patients receive rehabilitation by training &quot;Virtual Action Planning - Supermarket&quot; on a computer 45 minutes 5 times a week during a 2-week period. The control group will receive similar duration cognitive rehabilitation (no extra computer training) during this period (problem solving and occupational therapy).</description>
