  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a highly prevalent ocular condition inducing an inflammatory
      response on the ocular surface. Common symptoms include ocular discomfort, visual impairment
      and instability of the tear film with potential damage to the ocular surface.

      In addition, an intact tear film is important to provide a smooth optical surface, to act as
      a barrier to pathogens, to nourish the epithelial cells of the ocular surface and to prevent
      exsiccation. Alterations in the tear film composition, which can have their origin in several
      conditions, lead to tear film hyperosmolarity or instability resulting in DES.

      Regardless of the cause of DES, chronic dryness of the ocular surface leads to an increased
      susceptibility to oxidative stress, which is triggered by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This
      results in cell damage and activation of the immune system, keeping up inflammatory processes
      . In order to prevent ROS damage, several micronutrients such as vitamin C, E, and certain
      carotenoids, omega-3 free fatty acids, flavonoids and minerals have been used because of
      their antioxidant capacities.

      Based on this knowledge the potential of these antioxidant dietary supplements has been
      discussed as a treatment option for DES. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that
      antioxidant supplementations, in particular, supplementation with omega 3 fatty acids may be
      beneficial for patients with DES.

      The purpose of the present study is to test the hypothesis that treatment with dietary
      supplements improves subjective and objective symptoms of DES.
