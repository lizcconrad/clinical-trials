    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine if the iron chelator, desferrioxamine can increase
      blood levels of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 (HIF-1 protein) and to see if there
      is a corresponding increase in blood flow to the brain.

    <measure>Define change from baseline cerebral blood flow after receiving DFO infusion.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3hr, 6hr, 9hr</time_frame>
    <description>Cerebral blood flow is measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasound at baseline and then study drug is initiated. Blood flow is measured again after 3 hours of infusion, 6 hours of infusion, then once more 3 hours after the infusion is complete.</description>

    <measure>Determine if DFO changes blood HIF-1 levels from baseline and whether this correlates with changes in cerebrovascular hemodynamics.</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 3hr, 6hr, 9hr</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples are taken at each time point and will be correlated with ultrasound blood flow measures taken at baseline, 3hrs of infusion, 6hrs of infusion, and 3 hours after infusion is complete.</description>
