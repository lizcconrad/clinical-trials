      Background:

        -  Malignant mesothelioma is a form of cancer that develops on the protective lining that
           covers the body s internal organs. It most often occurs on the lining of the lungs and
           chest wall or the lining of the abdomen. There is no known cure for malignant
           mesothelioma, so researchers are searching for new ways to treat it.

        -  Mesothelin is a protein that is found in mesothelioma and other types of cancer cells.
           An experimental cancer drug called SS1P is designed to attack cells that have mesothelin
           while leaving healthy cells alone. Researchers want to test how effective SS1P is when
           it is given with pentostatin and cyclophosphamide. These drugs help suppress the immune
           system and may make the SS1P more effective.

      Objectives:

      - To study the effectiveness of SS1P plus two drugs that suppress the immune system to treat
      malignant mesothelioma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have malignant mesothelioma in the chest or
      abdomen.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests.
           They will also have imaging studies.

        -  The first treatment cycle will last 30 days. Up to three 21-day cycles of treatment will
           follow.

        -  In the first cycle, participants will have pentostatin on days 1, 5, and 9. They will
           have cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 12. They will have SS1P on days 10, 12, and 14.

        -  On the next three cycles, participants will have pentostatin on day 1.They will have
           cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 4. They will have SS1P on days 2, 4, and 6.

        -  Participants will have frequent blood tests and other studies. They will receive all
           four cycles of treatment as long as there are no severe side effects.

        -  Participants will have regular followup visits as directed by the study doctors.

      BACKGROUND:

      Mesothelin is a cell surface glycoprotein present on normal mesothelial cells that is highly
      expressed in many human cancers including mesothelioma, lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
      SS1 (dsFv) PE38 is a recombinant anti-mesothelin immunotoxin that has undergone phase I
      testing and has been evaluated in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin for treatment of
      malignant pleural mesothelioma. SS1 (dsFv)PE38 is highly immunogenic and the majority of
      patients develop antibodies to it at end of one cycle. Pre-clinical studies demonstrate that
      SS1(dsFv)PE38 may be administered multiple times in combination with an immune-depleting
      regimen consisting of pentostatin and cyclophosphamide.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Mesothelioma Pilot Objective

      -To assess the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of a conditioning regimen of pentostatin

      and cyclophosphamide in combination with SS1(dsFv)PE38

      -To monitor antibody formation to SS1(dsFv)PE38 and to assess the impact of the conditioning
      regimen on the formation of these antibodies

      Mesothelioma Positive Cancers Dose De-escalation Pilot Objective

      -To determine the safety profile and recommended phase 2 dose of SS1P (dsFv)PE38 in

      drug lot FIL129J01 using dosing regimen A in patients with mesothelioma, lung and pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma

      Phase 2 and Lung and Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Expansion Pilot Objective

      -To evaluate objective tumor response in subjects with pleural mesothelioma, peritoneal

      mesothelioma, lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma using Regimen A

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients with one of the following histologically confirmed malignancies:

             -  malignant pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma with epithelial or biphasic tumors
                having less than a 50% sarcomatoid component who have previously been treated on at
                least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen with progressive disease
                documented prior to study entry

             -  advanced (Stage IIIB/IV) lung adenocarcinoma who have had at least one prior
                chemotherapy for advanced disease. Patients who received an approved targeted
                therapy as first-line treatment should have also received chemotherapy prior to
                study entry.

             -  recurrent, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
                pancreas.

        -  Measurable disease by modified RECIST criteria for pleural mesothelioma or by RECIST
           criteria for peritoneal mesothelioma, lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma

             -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function

             -  No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of
                therapy

      DESIGN:

      -During the mesothelioma pilot phase of this study, the first eleven mesothelioma patients

      enrolled in this study received a conditioning regimen of pentostatin on days 1, 5 and 9 of
      the first cycle and day 1 of subsequent cycles in combination with cyclophosphamide on days 1
      through 12 of the first cycle and days 1 through 4 of subsequent cycles (Regimen A) while the
      next 8 mesothelioma patients received conditioning regimen of pentostatin on days 1, 5, 9, 13
      and 17 of the first cycle and day 1 and 5 of subsequent cycles in combination with
      cyclophosphamide on days 1 through 20 of the first cycle and days 1 through 8 of subsequent
      cycles (Regimen B). SS1P was administered every other day for six days (3 doses) beginning on
      the day after the last pentostatin dose in each cycle for both regimens.

        -  In the mesothelin positive cancers dose de-escalation pilot study, a maximum of 12
           patients with mesothelioma or lung or pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be enrolled in a
           3+3 design to test up to 2 decreasing dose levels of SS1P administered in combination
           with cyclophosphamide and pentostatin on the Regimen A schedule for safety.

        -  In the phase 2 mesothelioma and pancreatic and lung adenocarcinoma pilot expansion
           portions of the study, a two-stage Minimax phase II trial design will be used to enroll
           up to 16 evaluable subjects with pleural mesothelioma (cohort 1), up to 10 evaluable
           subjects with peritoneal mesothelioma (cohort 2), up to 10 patients with lung
           adenocarcinoma (cohort 3)and up to 10 evaluable subjects with pancreatic adenocarcinoma
           (cohort 4) who will receive treatment on Regimen A.

        -  Treatment cycles will be repeated for up to four cycles if patients do not develop
           neutralizing antibodies, which will be assessed by a biological assay 14 and 20 days
           (+/- 2 days) following the first dose of SS1P in each cycle (corresponding to Days 24
           and 30 of Cycle 1, and Days 16 and 22 of Cycles 2 through 4)

        -  Toxicity will be assessed by the CTEP Version 4.0 of CTCAE

        -  Tumor response assessments will be performed at the end of 2 cycles and at the end of
           treatment

        -  Tumor biopsies will be performed before treatment, after 2 cycles, and after the last
           cycle or at follow-up.

          -  The effects of SS1(dsFv)PE38, pentostatin, and cyclophosphamide on the developing
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men
             must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence)
             for the duration of study therapy and for 3 months after the last dose of therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. While hormonal methods of
             birth control are effective, we ask that female patients who are participating in the
             study cease hormonal forms of birth control, as these methods of birth control (birth
             control pills, injections, or implants) may affect the study drug. Patients must be
             off hormonal forms of birth control for at least 4 weeks prior to initiating the
             study.

          -  Ability to comply with intravenous administration schedule, and the ability to
             understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA: (All Subjects)

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
             However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain
             metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 4-6 weeks without steroids
             may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.

          -  Uncontrolled medical illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or uncontrolled,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure (AHA Class II or worse), uncontrolled
             hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  HIV positive patients will be excluded due to a theoretical concern that the degree of
             immune suppression associated with the treatment may result in progression of HIV
             infection.

          -  Patients with Hepatitis B and C will be excluded.

          -  Serum neutralization antibody assay shows greater than or equal to 75% neutralization
             of the SS1 (dsFv) PE38 activity at 200 ng/ml.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  History of another invasive malignancy in the last two years. Adequately treated
             noninvasive, non-melanoma skin cancers as well as in situ carcinoma of the cervix will
             be allowed.

          -  Prior treatment with drugs of the immunotoxin class.

          -  Patients with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy as assessed by the
             investigator.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SS1(dsFv)PE38, pentostatin, and
             cyclophosphamide have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. The
             agents in the trial may also potentially be secreted in milk and therefore
