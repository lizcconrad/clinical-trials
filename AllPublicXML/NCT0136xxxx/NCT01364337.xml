  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence rates of hypertension and diabetes are high in Taiwan. Little attention is given
      to evidence-based dietary therapy in Taiwan. Patients, after confirmed diagnosis, are mostly
      prescribed with medications without comprehensive instructions on dietary therapy. DASH diet
      has been proven to be an effective dietary approach to reduce blood pressure for hypertension
      patients in US. However, dietary difference and patient profiles across countries are
      evident. In addition, hypertensive patients are often combined with hyperglycemia.
      Carbohydrate burden of DASH diet may be higher than most dietitians desire. Therefore, the
      investigators in tend to design a Taiwanese DASH diet and a lower carbohydrate DASH diet and
      test their efficacy on both blood pressure and fasting glucose lowering.
