  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long term disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still
      poor. Recently, so-called &quot;targeted therapy&quot; for cancer has been introduced to the treatment
      of patients with AML. This phase II clinical trial will explore the efficacy, safety, and
      pharmacodynamics of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib in patients with relapsed or
      refractory AML or patients with AML who are not eligible for intensive treatment. Biomarker
      studies will be included to study whether the targets are indeed inhibited and whether this
      leads to decreased BM angiogenesis. Toxicity assessments will be included, and the
      antileukemic effectiveness will be studied.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to performance of study-specific
             procedures or assessments which are not routinely performed for diagnosis or
             monitoring of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the subjects must be willing to comply
             with treatment and to follow up assessments and procedures

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of AML relapsed after or
             refractory to at least one induction regimen, or patients with AML at initial
             diagnosis who are not eligible for allogeneic transplant or intensive induction
             chemotherapy, except for AML M3 (acute promyelocytic leukemia)

          3. Age at least 18 years

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤3

          5. Measurable disease burden (blasts in BM and/or PB, extramedullary blasts [chloroma])

          6. Able to swallow and retain oral medication

          7. A life expectancy of at least 4 weeks

          8. Adequate contraception methods

          9. Adequate organ function as defined in the study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a valid option for intensive chemotherapy and/or stem cell
             transplantation (Patients after allogeneic stem cell transplant must be off
             immunosuppressive agents for at least 2 weeks prior to study entry and Graft-versus
             host disease must have resolved to Grade ≤2)

          2. History of cancer that according to the Investigator might confound the assessment of
             the endpoints of the study

          3. Uncontrolled peptic ulcer disease or clinically significant gastrointestinal
             abnormalities which interfere with oral dosing or any unstable or serious concurrent
             condition (e.g., active uncontrolled infection)

          4. Poorly controlled hypertension [defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) of ≥140 mmHg
             or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of ≥90 mmHg]. Note: Initiation or adjustment of
             antihypertensive medication(s) is permitted prior to study entry. BP must be
             re-assessed on two occasions that are separated by a minimum of 1 hour; on each of
             these occasions, the mean (of 3 readings) SBP / DBP values from each BP assessment
             must be &lt;140/90 mmHg in order for a subject to be eligible for the study

          5. Prolongation of corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;480 milliseconds

          6. History of any one of more of the following cardiovascular conditions within the past
             6 months: cardiac angioplasty or stenting, myocardial infarction, unstable angina,
             symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, class III or IV congestive heart failure, as
             defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)

          7. History of cerebrovascular infarction or bleeding, pulmonary embolism, or untreated
             deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within the past 6 months. Note: Subjects with recent DVT

             transfusions). Also, patients with known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions
             infiltrating major pulmonary vessels will be excluded from the study due to excess
             risk of bleeding.

          9. Prior major surgery or trauma within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug

         10. Treatment with an investigational agent within 28 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is
             longer prior to the first dose of study drug (for bevacizumab 60 days).

         13. Patients with psychological, familial, sociological, or geographical conditions that
             do not permit compliance with the protocol
