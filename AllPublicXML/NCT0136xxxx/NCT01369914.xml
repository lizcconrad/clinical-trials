      Background:

        -  Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is used to treat some kinds of cancer, blood cell
           disorders, and immune disorders. Stem cells from a donor s blood are used to replace the
           recipient s stem cells in the bone marrow. The recipient s bone marrow can then produce
           new blood cells. Some of these new cells involved in the immune system are like the
           donor s cells. Sometimes immune cells from the SCT attack the recipient s normal
           tissues, including the eyes. This type of immune attack is called graft-versus-host
           disease, or GVHD.

        -  The symptoms of ocular GVHD include eye pain, irritation, dryness, and inflammation.
           When it is severe and if it does not respond well to treatment, ocular GVHD may also
           cause vision loss.

      Objective:

      - To learn more about graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the eyes in people who have had
      stem cell transplantation.

      Eligibility:

        -  Participants must be at least 18 years of age.

        -  They must be taking part in a study at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) or the
           National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).

        -  They must have a SCT scheduled within the next 30 days.

      Design:

        -  The study lasts for 1 year and includes six visits to the National Eye Institute. (There
           is an optional visit about 1 month before your SCT.) When possible, visits for this
           study will be scheduled so that they can be done on the same day as your visits for the
           NCI or NHLBI protocol that you are taking part in.

        -  At each visit, participants will have a medical exam and an eye history will be taken.
           They will have an eye exam and a test to measure the ability to make tears. Those in the
           study will also have tear fluid collected for analysis in a lab. Tear fluid collection
           is a painless process. Blood will be drawn during certain visits if it has not already
           been collected by the transplant team.

      OBJECTIVE:

      The study objectives are to study the development of ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
      in participants treated with stem cell transplantation (SCT) at the NIH, including exam
      findings prior to SCT, changes in ocular signs and symptoms following SCT and response to
      standard therapy in participants identified with dry eye and ocular GVHD; to develop clinical
      outcome measures for early onset and more advanced ocular GVHD and provide estimates of
      progression rates for these outcomes; to analyze tear fluid, impression cytology (IC) and
      serum samples from participants undergoing SCT, to identify biomarkers or other findings
      which may predict the onset of ocular GVHD or correlate with disease progression or response
      to therapy and to establish a cohort of participants with ocular GVHD in anticipation of
      future clinical trials.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Up to 50 adult participants undergoing SCT at the NIH, and up to 50 healthy adult
      participants will be enrolled.

      DESIGN:

      This prospective, natural history study will follow participants through 12 months post-SC,
      with the option to extend follow-up for up to five years.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary objective outcome variable is ocular surface staining using fluorescein and
      lissamine green dyes, as measured by the Oxford criteria, with the scale ranging from 0 to 15
      in each eye. The primary subjective outcome measure is the Ocular Surface Disease Index
      (OSDI), ranging from 0 to 100. Secondary outcome variables include best-corrected visual
      acuity (BCVA), tear film osmolarity, Schirmer s tear testing with anesthesia, meibomian gland
      function and tear break-up time. In addition, tear fluid biomarkers and/or IC will be studied
      as secondary outcome variables to determine whether changes in biomarker levels (tear fluid)
      or cell densities and morphologies (IC) correlate with the development or progression of
      ocular GVHD.
