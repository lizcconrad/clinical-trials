    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of neuroscience-guided cognitive
      training combined with community-based supported employment for people with schizophrenia.
      The investigators will examine the effectiveness of moving our study of neuroplasticity-based
      restorative targeted cognitive training out of the laboratory and into the community setting;
      and the investigators will also investigate its utility in enhancing functional outcome in
      chronically mentally ill adults who are participating in supported employment.

      Neurocognitive functioning will be assessed at baseline (study entry), after cognitive
      training (6 months), and at 12 month follow-up, using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery
      (MCCB). The investigators will assess the following six constructs identified by MATRICS as
      separable, fundamental dimensions of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, with a likely
      sensitivity to intervention [26]: 1) Speed of Processing, 2) Attention/Vigilance, 3) Working
      Memory, 4) Verbal Learning and Memory, 5) Visual Learning and Memory, and 6) Reasoning and
      Problem Solving (executive functioning). The investigators will also administer the delayed
      memory trials of HVLT and BVMT, Trails B, and D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test [27], and
      will make one modification to the MCCB in utilizing BACS Tower of London [28] in place of NAB
      Mazes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder(DSM-IV criteria)

          -  between the ages of 18-65

          -  English as primary language (learned before age 12)

          -  no major medical or neurological disorder that precludes participation in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will not exclude subjects with substance abuse or dependence as we wish to
             investigate the real-world effectiveness of this cognitive remediation approach when
             combined with SE. As per the clinical policy at Community Services, however, patients
             will not be permitted to attend the SE program or to participate in the study if they
             are acutely intoxicated. Subjects who miss 5 consecutive days of participation due to
             intoxication will be dropped and a replacement subject will be recruited.
