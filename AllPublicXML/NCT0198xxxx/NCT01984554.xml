      The primary objective of this study is to compare the total costs to sites and payers of
      administering IV iron over the 30-day observation period for subjects with IDA who receive
      Ferric Carboxymaltose (FCM) relative to those who receive iron sucrose, iron dextran, and
      ferumoxytol.
