  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Professional interpretation improves quality of care for patients with limited English
      proficiency (LEP). However, many health care settings lack access to professional
      interpreters, and even in locations with good access, logistical factors and perceived
      barriers have limited their widespread use. Remote methods of professional interpretation,
      including telephone and video, hold great promise for expanding access, but only limited data
      exist on the relative impacts of these modalities on patient care and provider uptake.
      Comparing how these modalities impact multiple aspects of health care quality, including
      family comprehension, provider communication, and consistency of provider interpreter use
      will inform dissemination of strategies for delivery of safe, efficient, and equitable care
      to LEP families.

      Aim 1: To determine whether randomly assigned remote interpreter modality (telephone versus
      video) impacts parent-reported quality of communication and interpretation, diagnosis
      comprehension, and length of stay (LOS) among LEP Spanish-speaking families seen in a
      pediatric Emergency Department (ED).

      Hypothesis 1: Parent-reported quality of communication and interpretation and parent
      diagnosis comprehension will be higher among families assigned to video interpretation
      compared to telephone interpretation.

      Hypothesis 2: LOS will not differ between families assigned to video and telephone
      interpretation.

      Aim 2: To determine whether assigned interpreter modality is associated with provider
      decision to communicate without professional interpretation.

      Hypothesis 3: Parent-reported provider communication without professional interpretation
      (e.g. using the patient or a family member to interpret for some part of the visit) will be
      lower for families assigned to video interpretation compared to telephone interpretation.
