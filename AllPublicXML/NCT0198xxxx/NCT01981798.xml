      To investigated whether an ambulant intervention program with a behavioral therapy approach
      would exert a long-term effect on chronic unspecific back or neck pain. Specifically, the
      effect on patients with pronounced fear avoidance behavior and/or with psychosocial
      limitations was addressed.

      BACKGROUND: Sustained success of ambulant intervention programs consisting of individual and
      group physiotherapy in patients with with chronic unspecific back or neck pain (cBP) has not
      been conclusively proven. It's still not clear whether one can achieve such success by
      devoting greater attention to psychosocial factors.

      OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether an ambulant intervention program with a behavioral therapy
      approach would exert a long-term effect on cBP. Specifically, the effect on patients with
      pronounced fear avoidance behavior and/or with psychosocial limitations was addressed.

      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled trial

      SETTINGS, INTERVENTION: 64 patients were assigned to intervention group (IG) and 57 to
      control group (CG). All were examined, informed about cBP, and were encouraged to stay active
      and perform exercises according to specific instructions provided in a neck- or back-book.
      The IG received 9 units of physiotherapy and 2 units of occupational therapy, conducted with
      a behavioral therapy approach. Efficacy of treatment was evaluated after 6 and 58 weeks.

      MEASUREMENTS: Pain (VAS), quantity of painkillers consumed, sick leave days,
      Oswestry-Disability-Index (ODI), SF-36, FABQ.

    <time_frame>After 0 / 6 / 58 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the main hypothesis, current pain and mean pain during the preceding week and the preceding 3 months were determined on a visual analog scale (VAS; 0-100, lower scores indicate less severe pain)</description>

    <time_frame>After 0 / 6 / 58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate social function, psychological wellbeing and emotional role function we used the 36-item short form health survey (SF-36; scales 0-100, lower scores indicate poorer social, psychological and emotional quality of life)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>After 0 / 6 / 58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry disability index was used to measure functional impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety, insecurity in social contacts and compulsiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>After 0 / 6 / 58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety, insecurity in social contacts and compulsiveness were registered on the brief symptoms inventory (BSI), which is an abridged version of SCL-90_R. The BSI addresses subjective experience of impairment based on a list of symptoms that are partly physical and partly psychological. The time frame is seven days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sick leave days</measure>
    <time_frame>After 0 / 58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of (self-reported) days of sick leave due to pain during the preceding twelve months were inquired.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Painkillers</measure>
    <time_frame>After 0 / 58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of painkillers taken per day were inquired.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear avoidance behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>After 0 / 6 / 58 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fear avoidance behavior was determined by means of the fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ; scale 0-66; lower scores indicate lower fear-avoidance beliefs)</description>

    <description>Members of the training group received 9 units of physiotherapy and 2 units of occupational therapy, each with a duration of one hour. Every patient of the IG was trained to perform a neck or back intervention program specifically suited to his/her needs. The training was conducted in a single session by one of three experienced physiotherapists (with mean work experience of 6 years). After this training the patients completed eight group training units consisting a maximum number of 8 participants, each unit with a duration of one hour, over a maximum period of six weeks.</description>
