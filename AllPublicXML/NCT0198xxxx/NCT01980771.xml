  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This program utilizes a community-engaged research approach to implementing and evaluating a
      program that seeks to reduce sexual risk behavior among Black adult heterosexual men. The
      investigators aims are to assess the impact of this linguistically and culturally tailored
      HIV prevention program on the sexual risk of heterosexual, African American men aged 18 and
      older, to assess the intervention's impact on the more proximal social and psychosocial
      variables that the program is designed to change, and to identify key contextual level
      factors that may impact the intervention's impact across segments of this priority
      population.
