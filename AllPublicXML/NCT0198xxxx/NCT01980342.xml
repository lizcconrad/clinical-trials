  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether there is an interaction between etonogestrel, the progestin
      hormone released by the contraceptive implant Nexplanon, and efavirenz, a common medication
      used to treat HIV. The endpoints measured in this study will help determine if such an
      interaction leads to decreased contraceptive efficacy of the contraceptive implant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women now make up nearly half of the world's HIV-infected population, and many of these women
      with HIV are of reproductive age. There is a growing need to provide effective contraception
      for those women who want or need to be protected against pregnancy. However, there is concern
      for decreased contraceptive efficacy in women on antiretroviral therapy who rely on hormonal
      contraception due to drug-drug interactions. Of particular concern is a possible interaction
      with etonogestrel, the active hormone in a long-acting reversible contraceptive implant. We
      propose a pilot study to evaluate the effect of efavirenz (EFV), a commonly used
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of the etonogestrel
      implant. We will recruit 18 healthy women who have had the implant in place for 12 to 24
      months. They will be asked to take a two-week course of efavirenz. During these two weeks and
      for four additional weeks, we will monitor semi-weekly etonogestrel concentrations, and
      serum, ultrasound, and cervical mucus markers of ovulation. We will also assess efavirenz
      concentration at baseline and at the end of the two-week treatment course. We will derive
      pharmacokinetic parameters and compare concentrations across time points. Results will help
      to inform the design of larger studies, and of similar studies with different antiretroviral
      medications. We hypothesize that taking efavirenz while using the etonogestrel contraceptive
      implant will not result in an increased incidence of ovulation.

    <measure>Serum Concentration of Etonogestrel Before and After Two Weeks of Efavirenz</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will draw a baseline serum etonogestrel immediately prior to a participant starting the 2-week course of efavirenz. Serial blood samples will subsequently be drawn over the next 6 weeks to assess for changes in serum etonogestrel concentration. We will be looking to see if the serum etonogestrel concentration decreases below the level necessary for reliable ovulation suppression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Efavirenz Concentrations at the Start and End of the 2-week Dosing Period</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess serum efavirenz concentrations at the beginning and end of the 2-week dosing period. By comparing these concentrations to historical controls, we will determine whether taking efavirenz while using the etonogestrel implant alters the serum concentration of efavirenz.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Hormone Markers of Ovulation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will test serial blood samples for levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, and progesterone to determine whether the etonogestrel implant is able to suppress ovulation during and after a course of efavirenz.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Transvaginal Ultrasound to Assess for Ovarian Follicular Development</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the entire 6 week period of the study, participants will undergo twice-weekly transvaginal ultrasound to assess for the development of ovarian follicles. This direct assessment of follicular development will be combined with serum hormone concentrations to determine if efavirenz increases the incidence of ovulation in women using the etonogestrel implant for contraception.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical Mucus Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical mucus quality will be assessed twice weekly throughout the study period. The etonogestrel implant exerts a secondary contraceptive effect by causing cervical mucus to become thick and sticky, and therefore less permissive to the movement of sperm through the female genital tract. We will assess whether efavirenz causes a change in cervical mucus quality that would make sperm penetration more likely, and therefore indicate a reduction in the implant's contraceptive effect.</description>

        <title>Serum Concentration of Etonogestrel Before and After Two Weeks of Efavirenz</title>
        <description>We will draw a baseline serum etonogestrel immediately prior to a participant starting the 2-week course of efavirenz. Serial blood samples will subsequently be drawn over the next 6 weeks to assess for changes in serum etonogestrel concentration. We will be looking to see if the serum etonogestrel concentration decreases below the level necessary for reliable ovulation suppression.</description>

        <description>We will assess serum efavirenz concentrations at the beginning and end of the 2-week dosing period.

        <title>Transvaginal Ultrasound to Assess for Ovarian Follicular Development</title>
        <description>For the entire 6 week period of the study, participants will undergo twice-weekly transvaginal ultrasound to assess for the development of ovarian follicles. This direct assessment of follicular development will be combined with serum hormone concentrations to determine if efavirenz increases the incidence of ovulation in women using the etonogestrel implant for contraception.</description>

        <title>Cervical Mucus Quality</title>
        <description>Cervical mucus quality will be assessed twice weekly throughout the study period. The etonogestrel implant exerts a secondary contraceptive effect by causing cervical mucus to become thick and sticky, and therefore less permissive to the movement of sperm through the female genital tract. We will assess whether efavirenz causes a change in cervical mucus quality that would make sperm penetration more likely, and therefore indicate a reduction in the implant's contraceptive effect.</description>
