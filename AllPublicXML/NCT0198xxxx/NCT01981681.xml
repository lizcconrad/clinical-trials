  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-06263276 is a first in class inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) enzymes 1, 2, 3 and
      tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) that is being developed for the treatment of chronic plaque
      psoriasis. The goal of the study is to assess the safety, local tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects.

    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

    <measure>Cohorts 3 and 4: Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          -  Subjects willing to avoid tanning beds and sun exposure of the back during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of application).

          -  Subjects with any active skin condition at the application site possibly affecting
             drug absorption (e.g. rash, sun burn, scars, tattoos).

          -  Subjects with a Draize score &gt;0 of the test area (back) immediately prior to first
             treatment application.

          -  Subjects using topical prescription or nonprescription drugs/over the counter
             preparations on the back within 14 days of the first treatment application.

          -  Subjects not willing to avoid application of treatmentssuch as lotions or creams to
             the back throughout the study until follow-up.
