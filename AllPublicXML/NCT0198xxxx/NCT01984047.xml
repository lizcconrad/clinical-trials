  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of GSK3050002 in humans. Subjects will attend the clinical unit for a
      screening visit and if eligible and consenting, will attend to participate in the study
      within 30 days. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit the evening prior to dosing
      when each subject will receive a single intravenous dose of GSK3050002 or placebo, then
      remain in house under supervision until discharged on Day 3. Subjects will then return for 7
      outpatient visits scheduled over the following 81 days. Finally, the follow-up visit will be
      7-14 days following the last visit.

    <description>An assay for detecting anti-drug antibodies (ADA) against GSK305002 will be developed and validated using an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging assay. Testing will be performed using the typical tiered approach involving screening, confirmation, and titration assays. If sera contain potential anti- GSK3050002 antibodies, they will be confirmed by immunocompetition using excess drug. Confirmed samples with such antibodies will be further analyzed for titers and may be characterized for neutralizing activity by a neutralization assay</description>
