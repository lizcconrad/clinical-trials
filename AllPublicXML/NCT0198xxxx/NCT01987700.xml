      The primary objective of this study is to examine and compare the outcomes associated with
      the use of Flex HD®, a human acellular dermal matrix (HADM), and Strattice™, a porcine
      acellular dermal matrix, (PADM) when used as a reinforcing material in the repair of large
      complicated abdominal wall hernias.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 100,000 ventral hernia repairs are performed in the U.S. each year. Recently,
      biologically-based implants derived from acellular human dermis, porcine small intestinal
      submucosa, and porcine dermis have been reported in a variety of complex abdominal wall
      repair procedures. A variety of surgical techniques and implant placement methods have been
      described, with no one standard technique achieving precedence. Biologic implant
      reinforcement of a myofascial closure by means of component separation, or at a minimum,
      where three-layer fascial approximation is not possible, sublay placement (i.e., closure of
      the posterior rectus sheath under the implant) are described strategies. These techniques
      allow placement of the implant against an intact fascial layer and may improve implant
      incorporation into host tissue. However, the current literature shows few, if any,
      prospective, randomized, head-to-head comparisons of human acellular dermal matrix (HADM)
      allograft and porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM) xenograft when used as a reinforcing
      material in the repair of large abdominal hernias by a component separation technique.

      The Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF) has manufactured and processed Flex HD
      Acellular Hydrated Dermis. This acellular dermis is derived from human skin. In complicated
      ventral hernia repairs, this type of graft tissue is necessary. Flex HD has been shown to
      reduce operative time, lower operative costs and provides minimal elasticity.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine and compare the outcomes associated with
      the use of Flex HD®, a human acellular dermal matrix (HADM), and Strattice™, a porcine
      acellular dermal matrix, (PADM) when used as a reinforcing material in the repair of large
      complicated abdominal wall hernias.

    <description>Quantitative data collected over a one-year period:
Recurrent hernias requiring surgical intervention

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective comparisons regarding the integrity of repair/eventration/need for reoperation will be based on clinical assessment, photographs, and/ or radiographically.
Eventration (&quot;E&quot;) shall be recorded by observing both angles of the photographs taken at expiration and will be classified as: 1) E-Mild: less than 3 cm in both planes, 2) E-Moderate: Between 3 and 5 cm in both planes 3) E- Severe: More than 5cm in both planes.
The need for reoperation (&quot;R&quot;) shall be recorded as 1) R-1: Reoperation needed, or 2) R-2: No Reoperation needed. The statistical relationship between these parameters and the repair material (HADM or PADM) will be studied by means of a chi square test.</description>

    <description>Patient satisfaction ratings via the SF-36 at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months following their surgery. Cumulative changes in patient satisfaction will be calculated individually for each patient, collectively for all subjects receiving HADM and for all subjects receiving PADM and then compared collectively to each other.</description>
