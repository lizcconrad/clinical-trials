  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postresuscitation disease is a constellation of disorders related to whole-body ischemia and
      reperfusion syndrome. It includes hypoxic damage in brain, liver, kidney, heart and other
      organ. In previous study more than one-third of patients resuscitation from out of hospital
      cardiac arrest developed renal dysfunction. In acute kidney injury, NGAL is an earlier marker
      compared with serum creatinine.

      Cardiac arrest and severe asphyxia result in global brain ischemia. In previous study serum
      NGAL correlated with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in asphyxiated neonate.

      This study was designed to assess serum NGAL level in postresuscitative patients to evaluate
      its relation to hypoxic brain injury severity, and its clinical utility for early detection
      of acute kidney injury in these patients.

    <measure>Predictive value of plasma NGAL for acute kidney injury and cerebral dysfunction following out of hospital cardiac arrest.</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 4 hour until 72 hour after resuscitation</time_frame>
    <description>All patients in this study will be treated by induced hypothermia protocol in our hospital. Plasma NGAL level will check after 4hour from resuscitation. Renal dysfunction is defined using the RIFLE criteria. Patient base line creatinine is defined the first laboratory values obtained in the emergency department. The maximum difference between the peak creatinine level during the first 72hour of hospitalization and the base line creatinine level was determined for every patients.
Cerebral dysfunction is defined using CPC scale. Neurologic exam will be performed on arrival, 24, 48,72 hours after resuscitation and discharge day. Good neurologic outcome is defined as CPC of 1 or 2. The diagnostic accuracy of NGAL in predicting acute kidney injury and neurologic outcome will be evaluated.</description>

        Patients over 19 years of age admitted to our hospital after succesful resuscitation from
        out of hospital cardiac arrest. Mental state of the patient is less than 8 in GCS scale and
        the patient should be undergoing therapeutic hypothermia.Exclusion criteria is age younger
        than 19 years, terminal illness or do-not resuscitation status, pre-existing coma, abnormal
        mental status with defined intracranial lesion (ex. cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral
        infarction, etc), unstable vital sign and previous end-stage renal disease.
