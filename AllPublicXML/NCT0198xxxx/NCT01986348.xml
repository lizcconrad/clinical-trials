      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral
      Selinexor in patients with recurrent gliomas. Patients have been enrolled in Arms A, B and C,
      but Arm D is the only arm currently open to recruiting patients.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral
      selinexor in patients with recurrent gliomas.

      Initially, the study included 2 arms: an exploratory Surgical Arm (Arm A) with sequential
      enrollment for patients who require surgery and a medical arm (Arm B) for patients who are
      not eligible for surgery.

      Enrollment in Arm B was stopped to explore alternative dosing in Protocol Versions ≥ 4.0 to
      potentially improve tolerability. Four arms (Arms C, D, E, and F) were added to the Medical
      Arm in Protocol Version 4.0. Arms E and F were eliminated in protocol version 6.0 and no
      patients were ever enrolled in these arms.

      Patients in the primary population enrolled under Protocol Version 4.0 or above will be
      randomized to Arm C and Arm D (approximately 30 patients per arm) to explore alternative
      dosing to potentially improve tolerability.

      After screening and registration/randomization in the study, patients enrolling in Arm A or
      randomized to Arm C will receive 60 mg Selinexor orally twice weekly. Patients randomized to
      Arm D will receive 80 mg Selinexor orally weekly.

      Patients will be treated until progression of disease or the development of unacceptable
      toxicities. All patients will then undergo the End of Treatment (EOT) visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed GBM (including all histologic variants) at first diagnosis
             with radiographic evidence of recurrent disease after treatment with radiotherapy and
             temozolomide;
