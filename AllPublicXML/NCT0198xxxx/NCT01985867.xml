      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus Lcr35
      administration for the treatment of functional constipation in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional constipation is a common problem which affects over 3% of children. The standard
      treatment does not provide sustained relief of symptoms. As a consequence, there is interest
      in other therapeutic options. Previously, one small (n=40) randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      involving 27 children showed that Lactobacillus rhamnosus casei Lcr35 compared with placebo
      increased treatment success defined as ≥ 3 spontaneous defecations per week with no episodes
      of faecal soiling, increased the defecation frequency, reduced the frequency of abdominal
      pain, reduced the use of glycerin enemas during the four weeks of therapy, and decreased the
      percentage of hard stools. However, there was no difference between groups in the use of
      lactulose or the number of episodes of faecal soiling. Available evidence is insufficient to
      draw meaningful conclusion. Further studies are needed.
