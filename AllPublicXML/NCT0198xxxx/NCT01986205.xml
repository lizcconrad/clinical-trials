    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether 40 hyperbaric oxygen sessions has effect on
      long-term symptoms after concussion. This study will enroll 90 individuals with persistent
      problems 1-5 years after a mild traumatic brain injury. These individuals will be randomized
      to receive either oxygen or air in a pressurized hyperbaric chamber. Participants will
      receive 40 daily hyperbaric chamber sessions.

      Participants will have a series of tests and questionnaires before they begin their chamber
      sessions, after they complete 40 sessions, and 6 months after they joined the study. These
      tests include computer-based and pencil-and-paper questionnaires and thinking tests, brain
      imaging, a neurological examination, and an eye exam. Participants will also be asked to
      provide blood for future research.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind study to explore whether a course of
      hyperbaric oxygen can ameliorate persistent post-concussive symptoms after mild traumatic
      brain injury. In this study, civilian adult men and women with persistent symptoms 1 to 5
      years after injury will be randomized to receive 40 hyperbaric oxygen sessions (100% oxygen
      at 1.5 atmospheres absolute for 60 minutes) or sham chamber sessions (room air at 1.2
      atmospheres absolute or room air at sea level pressure, for 60 minutes). Chamber sessions
      will be provided Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, and participants will have up to
      12 weeks to complete their 40 sessions.

      Participants will be evaluated before the chamber sessions, at 13 weeks, and at 6 months.
      Assessments include self-administered questionnaires, neuropsychological function,
      neuroimaging, a brief neurological examination, and a neuro-optometry evaluation. These
      outcome tools will measure symptoms and deficit at the time of enrollment and subsequent
      evaluations, and provide insight into whether hyperbaric oxygen can play a role in recovery
      from mild traumatic brain in-jury.

      Participants will be asked to provide blood for long-term storage of serum, plasma, and DNA
      for future investigations.

             as required by the study protocol.

          -  Able to tolerate the chamber environment and hood placement and to equalize middle ear
             pressure.

          -  Past history of at least one mild traumatic brain injury with persistent symptoms that
             meets all of the following criteria: 1) Brain injury occurred at least 1 year but no
             more than 5 years prior to enrollment; 2) Brain injury occurred as an adult (at least

             graded as mild.

          -  At least 3 of the following persistent post-concussive symptoms from the injury:
             headaches, dizziness or balance problems, blurred vision, tiredness/fatigue or sleep
             problems, seizures, remembering things or solving problems, managing stress or
             emotional upsets, controlling temper/irritability, or ringing in the ears.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetes mellitus.

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder (participants must be on therapy and seizure-free for at

          -  Implanted devices not cleared for hyperbaric pressurization.

          -  Pregnancy or plans to become pregnant during the study participation period. Women of

          -  Lung disease, such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma that is not
             well-controlled, or bullous lung disease, that raises the risk for pulmonary

          -  Active malignancy, previous malignancy (except basal cell carcinoma) in the last 5
             years, or any prior treatment with bleomycin (Blenoxane). Prior treatment with
             doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is acceptable as long follow-up echocardiography is normal.

          -  Chronic disease such as heart or renal failure would raise the participant's risk of
             adverse events during hyperbaric oxygenation.

          -  Prior military service in theater.

          -  Alcohol abuse, by self-report, within the last year.

          -  Lifetime history of illicit drug use, by self-report, except remote (greater than one
             year), non-habitual use of marijuana.

          -  Failed urine drug screen during study participation.

          -  Continued participation during the intervention period in sports activities where head
             injury is likely, such as contact football, boxing, mixed martial arts, etc.

          -  Blind or deaf.

          -  Major psychiatric disorder or degenerative mental disease (such as multiple
             sclerosis).

          -  Prior therapeutic radiation to the central nervous system.

          -  Prior traumatic brain injury meeting severe or moderate classification, or any anoxic
             injury or stroke.

          -  Known untreated chronic or acute medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, Cushing's
             disease, untreated hypertension, etc., that would confound the outcome assessments or
             inhibit compliance with the study protocol. If treated, these disorders would not be
             excluded.

          -  Prior hyperbaric oxygen for brain injury.

          -  Prior hyperbaric oxygen for any reason within the last 3 months.
