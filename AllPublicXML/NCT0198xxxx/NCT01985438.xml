  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      To compare the effect of prophylactic enteral feeding tube placement (either percutaneous
      endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube or nasogastric (NG) tube) in patients undergoing treatment
      for head and neck cancer (HNC) on nutritional status, quality of life, mental and emotional
      health, rates of clinical complications, and cost of care.

      Study Design:

      Prospective randomized controlled trial with 2 arms and equal allocation ratio

      Study Objectives:

        1. The primary objective is to assess, among HNC patients randomized to receive either
           prophylactic PEG tube or NG tube for enteral support and who are undergoing
           chemo-radiation at SKMCH&amp;RC, the change from baseline in nutritional status at the end
           of 24 weeks after treatment initiation.

        2. The secondary objectives are to assess, among HNC patients randomized to receive either
           prophylactic PEG tube or NG tube for enteral support and who are undergoing
           chemo-radiation at SKMCH&amp;RC, the change from baseline in nutritional status at the end
           of 12 weeks; the rates of complications; quality of life including symptoms of
           depression and anxiety; and cost of care (all related to enteral feeding tube placement
           only) at baseline and at the end of 12 weeks and 24 weeks after treatment initiation.

      Patients and methods:

      Eligible patients will be enrolled consecutively from the gastroenterology outpatient clinics
      at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Center (SKMCH&amp;RC), Lahore and
      randomly assigned to receive either PEG tube or NG tube placement prior to commencement of
      treatment. Patients will receive counseling from a trained nutritionist regarding adequate
      nutrition during treatment and enteral feeding tube care. Detailed information regarding
      demographics, cancer location, type and staging, clinical status, nutritional status, quality
      of life, mental and emotional health, and cost of care will be obtained at baseline (time at
      which cancer treatment is initiated) and on 21st day (3 weeks), 42nd day (6 weeks), 84th day
      (12 weeks) and 168th day (24 weeks) after initiating chemoradiation. The primary endpoint
      will be to compare the nutritional status between the two treatment groups on an
      intent-to-treat basis on 168th day (24 weeks) after initiating chemoradiation.

    <description>Nutritional status will be assessed using three methods: (1) Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) tool, (2) anthropometric data, and (3) biochemical data. Biochemical assessment will be done by measuring serum albumin and electrolytes and kidney function tests. Primary outcome will be analyzed at aggregate level and after stratifying by age, sex, location of tumor, disease severity, and grade of dysphagia.</description>

    <description>The quality of life will be assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) version 3.0. and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Head and Neck (FACT H&amp;N) version 4. Patients will also be assessed for their mental and emotional health. For this purpose, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be used. All of these questionnaires are available in Urdu.</description>
