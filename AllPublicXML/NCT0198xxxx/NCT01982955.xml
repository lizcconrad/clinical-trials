  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, randomized, Phase 1b/2 trial to determine the recommended
      phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to evaluate the efficacy in terms of progression free survival (PFS)
      of Tepotinib when used in combination with gefitinib in subjects with T790M negative, MET
      positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and having acquired resistance to Prior
      EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) Therapy. This study has 2:1 randomization
      (Tepotinib/Gefitinib arm versus Chemotherapy arm).
