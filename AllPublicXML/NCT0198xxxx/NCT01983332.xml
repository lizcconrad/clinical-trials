  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of an introduction to the occupation-based
      theory (MOHO) on the clinical reasoning of therapists working with cancer clients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will occur at MDACC, a comprehensive cancer center in the Texas Medical Center
      (TMC) in Houston. The center is the largest freestanding comprehensive cancer center in the
      world. The facility provides inpatient and outpatient services and supports research and
      education.

      The facility has more than 50 buildings in the greater Houston area and in central Texas. The
      setting for this study will be the rehabilitation services area on the main campus in the
      TMC.

      There are private offices, conference rooms and treatment areas where video chats and monthly
      meetings will occur.

      The study is projected to occur over a one year period. Sessions will be videotaped (video
      chats - initial and follow ups and monthly group meetings) for further review. Analysis of
      the tapes will provide data for further research and education presentations. Sessions will
      also be audiotaped and transcribed for further review and data analysis purposes. Neither the
      videotapes nor audiotapes will be shared with anyone at the facility or any uninvolved
      parties. Audiotapes and videotapes will be stored in locked file cabinets and password
      protected computers will be used to view and analyze the audio and video tapes. Only the
      research team will have access to the stored data locked in the file cabinet.

    <description>The study will begin with a video chat (20-30 minutes) to attain a baseline of participants understanding of MOHO. An initial video chat interview guide (Appendix B) will be used to facilitate the chat session and a training session on MOHO concepts (4-8 hours) will also be held (Appendix F). The training session is a 6 part overview of the MOHO framework. All following video chats will be conducted using the follow up video chat interview guide (Appendix C). There will be 8 follow up video chat sessions (20-30 minutes) occurring every 6 weeks after the initial training session on MOHO concepts. Video chat sessions will be facilitated by a research team member. There will be 12 monthly group meetings (60-90 minutes) with all participants to allow a time to discuss use of MOHO in practice and troubleshoot issues and offer support in a formal manner. The monthly group meeting will be facilitated by the PI and/or an onsite collaborator. The maximum possible time commitment stands at 1830</description>

        Participants will be outpatient-focused therapists working within the MD Anderson Cancer
        Center. Participants must have worked in this setting for at least 90 days before the study
        begins and will self-select to participate in the study. Recruitment of therapists at the
        MDACC will involve an introduction of the study by an onsite collaborator. The onsite
        collaborator will gather the names of individuals interested in participating in the study.
        Then, an onsite collaborator and PI will work together to determine if the therapists meet
        the inclusion criteria for the study. Once the therapists are determined to meet inclusion
        criteria, an invitation for participation will be extended by an onsite collaborator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        No training in MOHO constructs,English speaking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Training in using MOHO concepts in practice, highly skilled in use of MOHO, and non-English
        speaking. If a therapist is skilled and knowledgeable of the constructs of MOHO, there will
        be no way to determine if introduction of the model has impacted a therapist's clinical
        reasoning. All the materials used for the study will be in English and analysis of data
        will be conducted by English speaking individuals, therefore the study participants must
        speak English.
