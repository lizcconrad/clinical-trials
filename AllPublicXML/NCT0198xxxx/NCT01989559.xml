    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies booster vaccination in preventing disease recurrence in
      previously vaccinated patients with melanoma that has been removed by surgery. Vaccines made
      from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Giving booster vaccinations may make a stronger immune response and prevent or delay the
      recurrence of cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity of booster vaccination with the gp100 (gp100:209-217(210M) peptide
      vaccine) and human papilloma virus (HPV) peptides in Montanide ISA 51 or Montanide ISA 51 VG
      administered &gt;= 12 months after the last immunization.

      II. To measure the T-cell response to the modified gp100: 209-217 (210M) peptide and the
      unmodified native gp100 peptide following booster vaccination &gt;= 12 months after the last
      immunization.

      III. To measure the T-cell response to the control human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2
      restricted clusters of differentiation (CD)8 epitope of papilloma virus HPV16E7:12-20
      following booster vaccination &gt;= 12 months after the last immunization.

      IV. To perform detailed studies of the memory T cells persisting &gt;= 12 months after
      immunization.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gp100:209-217(210M) peptide vaccine and HPV 16 E7:12-20 peptide vaccine with
      Montanide ISA 51 VG or Montanide ISA 51 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and between days 25-30.
      After 6 months, patients free of disease receive booster injections every 6 months for 3
      years in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, every 6 months for
      5 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <description>Characterized using three different in vitro assays. Fresh and cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be analyzed for gp100 peptide-specific CD8+ T cells using a fluorescinated, modified gp100, peptide-specific, A2-restricted tetramer binding assay and the interferon (IFN) gamma specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) and cytokine flow cytometry (CFC) assays.</description>

    <measure>Change in CD8+ T cell frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 years</time_frame>
    <description>Differences in immune parameters will be graphically depicted by means of density plots, frequency histograms, box and whisker-plots, dot-plots, trellis graphics (where appropriate) and other plots and graphs. Analyses of continuous variables will be performed first on the original frequency data. Goodness of fit statistics will be employed to determine whether assumptions underlying test statistics (e.g., normality) are satisfied. If assumptions for the test procedures are violated, then rank-transformed or arcsin-transformed data will be used. Probability tests will be two-sided.</description>
