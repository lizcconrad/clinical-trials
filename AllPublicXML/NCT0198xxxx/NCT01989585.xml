      This partially randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of
      dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax and to see how well they work in treating patients
      with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutant melanoma or solid tumors
      that have spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Dabrafenib,
      trametinib, and navitoclax may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity, and safety profile of navitoclax
      when given in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF-mutant solid
      tumors. (Phase I) II. To estimate the complete response (CR) rate in patients with
      BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax as compared to the
      historical control dabrafenib and trametinib combination (DT). (Phase II) III. To compare the
      maximal tumor regression in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with dabrafenib,
      trametinib versus dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe pharmacodynamics effects of treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, and
      navitoclax on both serial tumor biopsies and serial blood draws in a small subset of patients
      treated with BRAF-mutant melanoma. (Phase I) II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of
      treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax. (Phase I) III. To compare the
      progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and overall response rate (ORR) in
      patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with dabrafenib, trametinib, versus dabrafenib,
      trametinib, and navitoclax. (Phase II) IV. To compare the degree of apoptosis induced in
      on-treatment biopsies of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma treated with dabrafenib,
      trametinib versus dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax. (Phase II) V. To explore other
      pharmacodynamic effects in on-treatment biopsies of patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma
      treated with either dabrafenib, trametinib versus dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax
      including cell proliferation (Ki-67), proteomics (reverse-phase protein microarrays [RPPA]),
      and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) family gene expression
      analysis. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of dabrafenib, trametinib, and navitoclax
      followed by a randomized phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -7 to -1 of course 1
      only. Patients also receive dabrafenib PO twice daily (BID), trametinib PO QD, and navitoclax
      PO QD days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive dabrafenib PO BID and trametinib PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive navitoclax PO QD days -7 to -1 of course 1 only. Patients also
      receive dabrafenib PO BID, trametinib PO QD, and navitoclax PO QD on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.

             maintain the patency of a central intravenous catheter; aspirin will not be allowed
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of navitoclax or during navitoclax
             administration; however, subjects who have previously received aspirin therapy for
             thrombosis prevention may resume a low dose (i.e., maximum 100 mg QD) of aspirin if
             platelet counts are stable (&gt;= 50,000/mm^3) through 6 weeks of navitoclax

             peptide 9 (CYP2C9) substrates; common CYP2C8 substrates include paclitaxel, statins,
             and glitazones, whereas CYP2C9 substrates include phenytoin; when possible,
             investigators should switch to alternative medications or monitor the patients
             closely; cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) inhibitors such as
             ketoconazole and clarithromycin are not allowed 7 days prior to the first dose of

             inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C8 are ineligible; current use of, or intended ongoing
             treatment with: herbal remedies (e.g., St. John's wort), or strong inhibitors or
             inducers of permeability-glycoprotein (Pgp) or breast cancer resistance protein 1
             (Bcrp1) should also be excluded; below are a few examples of the agents:
