    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective open phase-I study to investigate the safety and tolerability for
      administration of repeated doses of ALECSAT.

      Each patient will be followed up to 24 weeks from the initial blood donation to the last
      visit. However, the actual treatment starts on day 26, when the first single dose of ALECSAT
      is administered. The following administrations are given with 3 weeks intervals, i.e. at week
      7 and 10. The patients are attending Kirurgisk afdeling K, Bispebjerg Hospital, and are
      followed by close examinations during the study period and at regular visits after completing
      the study as advised by the patient's responsible physician.

      This study is a prospective open phase-I study to investigate the safety and tolerability for
      administration of repeated doses of ALECSAT.

      Each patient will be followed up to 24 weeks from the initial blood donation to the last
      visit. However, the actual treatment starts on day 26, when the first single dose of ALECSAT
      is administered. The following administrations are given with 3 weeks intervals, i.e. at week

      followed by close examinations during the study period and at regular visits after completing
      the study as advised by the patient's responsible physician.

      The selected group of patients suffers from locally advanced pancreatic cancer and have been
      treated with first line treatment regimens (e.g. surgery, radiotherapy, and/or Folfirinox)
      and are followed at Kirurgisk afdeling K, Bispebjerg Hospital. The subjects will be recruited
      consecutively and included to the study if they fulfil the inclusion criteria and do not meet
      any of the exclusion criteria. Potential candidates will receive oral information by the
      Investigator subsequent to the written patient information. The potential candidate must have
      the opportunity to consider the given information and to further ask the Investigator
      questions before finally deciding to participate. When the patient decides to take part in
      the study he/she will be required to sign the declaration of consent.

    <description>The ALECSAT CBMP will be administered as single dose at week 4, 7 and week 10 which is considered an appropriate time for ALECSAT CBMP to strengthen the immune system and thus have the ability to kill tumour cells. It is the aim that the patients will receive three doses during the study period however, if the patient wish and it is recommended by the investigator, patients may receive more than three doses, continuing until progression or as judged by the Investigator. Continued treatment after the 24 week study period is only possible under the condition that no safety issues have been discovered. The interval between injections for continued treatment will be decided based on e.g. tumour response and clinical examinations.</description>
