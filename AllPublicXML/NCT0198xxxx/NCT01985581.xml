    <textblock>
      This study looks to examine whether or not INTUNIV extended release can help children aged
      6-12 years diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in improving
      Executive Function when added to their usual care stimulant therapy. Executive functions are
      a set of mental processes that include emotional control, planning, organization, working
      memory, inhibition of behaviors, and managing time and space. As children with ADHD usually
      have difficulties with Executive Function, and Executive function difficulties lead to more
      difficulties in school and behaviour, it is anticipated that adding INTUNIV extended release
      to usual stimulant therapy will improve Executive Function scores as rated by parents and
      teachers. Improvements in quality of life will also be measured.

      Although stimulant medications have been shown to have positive impact on executive function
      (EF) (Findling et al, 2009; Hale et al. 2011), little has been documented about the effect of
      INTUNIV extended release on EF in children. The manifestation of clinical symptoms related to
      impairment in EF often leads to the search for additional treatment options and in many cases
      to adjunct therapies to the traditional stimulant medication treatment regimen. Demonstrating
      that the addition of INTUNIV extended release to usual stimulant therapy is effective for
      symptom control as well as in improving EF may influence clinical treatment algorithms and
      the need for health care resources to effectively manage patients. Since EF deficits
      negatively impact academic achievement and behavior at school and because children spend a
      large number of daytime hours at school, the concordance of any reported improvement in the
      school and the home environment will be examined. Overall improvement in quality of life with
      the addition of INTUNIV extended release will also be evaluated.

    <description>The Behavioural Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) was developed to assess such real-world expressions of executive function in the home (BRIEF-P) as assessed by the parent. This is an 86 item questionnaire completed by the parents. The score is converted to a t-score with a score less than 65 being considered within the normal range. Higher scores are worsening in function.</description>

    <description>The KINDL is a quality of life questionnaire of 24 items completed by the subject (KINDL-child). It is a generic instrument for assessing Health Related quality of life in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older. Norm values are given based on representative German data from the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) study, a broad survey realized by the German Robert-Koch Institute. The KINDL scores were converted to range between 0 and 100 with higher scores indicating better quality of life as reported by the child</description>

    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV is completed by the Investigator familiar with the scale. It is an 18 item scale designed to reflect current symptomatology of ADHD based on the DSM-5 criteria. Each item is scored from a range of 0 (reflecting no symptoms) to 3 (reflecting severe symptoms) with total scores ranging from 0-54, with higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms</description>

             screening and stimulant is felt to be optimized by the investigator.

          <title>Evaluate the Effect of Adjunctive INTUNIV Extended Release Treatment on Change in Quality of Life as Assessed by the KINDL®-Parent Questionnaire.</title>
          <description>The KINDL is a quality of life questionnaire of 24 items completed by the parent (KINDL-parent). It is a generic instrument for assessing Health Related quality of life in children and adolescents aged 3 years and older. Norm values are given based on representative German data from the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) study, a broad survey realized by the German Robert-Koch Institute. The KINDL scores were converted to range between 0 and 100 with higher scores indicating better quality of life as reported by the parent.</description>
