      edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (EFP) commonly known as cellulite in adult women.

      The Phase 2a study is a randomized, double-blind multiple-dose study that is expected to
      enroll approximately 144 women between the ages of 18 and 45 in the United States. Treatment
      effectiveness will be evaluated by investigator and patient assessments, as well as 3-D
      photographic imaging techniques. Once the safety and local tolerability profile from the
      first stage has been found to be acceptable subjects will be enrolled in stage 2. After an
      interim safety and local tolerability review was completed of all subjects in stage 1, it was
      determined that enrollment in stage 2 is acceptable and has been initiated.

    <measure>Investigator Global Assessment of Aesthetic Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 73</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators assessment of aesthetic improvement (I-GAIS) scores ranged from 3 to -1 as follows: 3 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 1 (improved), 0 (no change), -1 (worse).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator Cellulite Severity Score (CSS) Total Score- Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 73</time_frame>
    <description>The CSS is a photonumeric scale that was used to evaluate 5 morphologic features of cellulite; (A) number of evident depressions, (B) depth of depressions, (C) morphological appearance of skin surface alterations, (D) laxity, flaccidity or sagging of skin, and (E) current classification scale based on medical literature including Nuernberger and Mueller. The severity of each feature is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (most severe). The CSS total score is the sum of the 5 cellulite features (range: 0 to 15, with higher scores corresponding to more severe cellulite). Change is Day 73 study visit rating minus baseline rating; negative values indicate improvement in cellulite.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Cellulite Severity Item (CSI)-Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 73</time_frame>
    <description>CSI scores ranged from 0 (no cellulite present), 1 (very mild), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe) to 5 (very severe). Change is Day 73 study visit rating minus baseline rating; negative values indicate a lessening in cellulite severity.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Global Bother Assessment (SGBA)- Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 73</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rated their cellulite on a scale from 0 (not at all bothered) to 4 (extremely bothered). Change from baseline is Day 73 study visit value minus baseline value; negative change reflects an improvement in the amount the subject was bothered by cellulite; positive change reflects a worsening in the amount the subject is bothered by cellulite.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject-reported Cellulite Impact Scale (SR-CIS)-Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 73</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to answer 6 exploratory questions regarding the appearance of their cellulite on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 representing &quot;not at all&quot; and 10 representing &quot;extremely.&quot; A SR-CIS total score was derived from these 6 questions with values varying from 0 (No negative impact) to 60 (Extreme negative impact). Change from baseline is Day 73 value minus baseline value; negative change reflects an improvement.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction With Treatment Assessment (SCTA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 73</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rated their treatment satisfaction at the Day 73 visit on a 5-point scale ranging from -2 (very dissatisfied) to +2 (very satisfied)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Global Assessment Cellulite (SGA-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 73</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects assessed their cellulite based on a 5-point scale from -1 (slightly worse), 0 (same), 1 (slightly improved), 2 (moderately improved), to 3 (much improved) on Day 73</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Global Assessment of Aesthetic Improvement (C-GAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 73</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects's assessment of aesthetic improvement (C-GAIS) scores ranged from 3 to -1 as follows: 3 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), 1 (improved), 0 (no change), -1 (worse).</description>

        <title>Investigator Cellulite Severity Score (CSS) Total Score- Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>The CSS is a photonumeric scale that was used to evaluate 5 morphologic features of cellulite; (A) number of evident depressions, (B) depth of depressions, (C) morphological appearance of skin surface alterations, (D) laxity, flaccidity or sagging of skin, and (E) current classification scale based on medical literature including Nuernberger and Mueller. The severity of each feature is rated on a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (most severe). The CSS total score is the sum of the 5 cellulite features (range: 0 to 15, with higher scores corresponding to more severe cellulite). Change is Day 73 study visit rating minus baseline rating; negative values indicate improvement in cellulite.</description>
