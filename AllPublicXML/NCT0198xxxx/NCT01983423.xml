  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Animal and clinical studies have suggested that local tissue trauma can promote the process
      of an embryo implanting in the uterine cavity. The clinical studies have been performed in
      patients with a history of previously failed treatments using in vitro fertilization; a
      process of stimulating many eggs from a women and removing them from the body, to allow
      fertilisation with sperm to occur in a laboratory setting. The embryos are then replaced into
      the uterine cavity.

      This study questions whether endometrial biopsy (placing a small straw like catheter through
      the cervix and into the uterine cavity to take a sample of tissue via suction into the bore
      of the catheter), within 5-10 days of starting a cycle of in vitro fertilization, will
      improve pregnancy outcome for patients in the first or second cycle of treatment. The
      hypothesis is that endometrial biopsy will improve pregnancy outcome.

      The study is a randomized multicentre study involving 3 Canadian fertility centres.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the data are preliminary, there are studies suggesting that mild endometrial trauma
      in the cycle preceding IVF increases pregnancy rates, at least in women with recurrent
      implantation failure. Whether endometrial biopsy could promote implantation and improve
      pregnancy rates in the larger population of women undergoing IVF has yet to be explored. The
      present study will address this question and examine the impact of endometrial biopsies on
      IVF outcomes in the context of a randomized controlled trial.

      The optimal timing of the endometrial biopsy in the cycle preceding IVF has not been
      determined, but the majority of the studies have included a biopsy in the mid-luteal phase of
      the preceding cycle. In order to allow an adjuvant therapy to IVF that would be considered
      tolerable to a subject, and applicable to a large infertile women population, it was
      determined that a single endometrial biopsy, performed approximately 1 week prior to the
      start of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in an IVF cycle, would be the simplest,
      most flexible, and generalizable intervention to study its effects on pregnancy rates. All
      other components of the IVF treatment will remain constant with approximately 8-12 days of
      ovarian stimulation, human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) trigger being administered in that
      time frame and oocyte retrieval occuring 36 hours later from trigger. The embryo transfer
      will take place either day 3 or day 5 after oocyte retrieval.

    <description>An endometrial biopsy is performed using a sampling device known as a pipelle catheter which is introduced into the uterine cavity. The inner core is withdrawn creating suctional pressure into the hollow bore of the cavity, which allows acquisition of endometrial tissue upon rotation in the cavity. This is removed and the tissue sent for pathologic examination.</description>
