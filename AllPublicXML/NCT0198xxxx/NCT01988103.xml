  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the clinical effectiveness and safety of two orally administered doses
      of apremilast compared to placebo in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe plaque-type
      psoriasis.

      Apremilast (CC-10004) is a new oral agent that is under clinical development for the
      treatment of inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis,
      ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Behçet disease.

      This is a phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the
      efficacy and safety of apremilast 20 mg twice a day (BID), apremilast 30 mg BID, and placebo
      in Japanese subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index-75 (PASI-75).</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of subjects with either apremilast 20 mg BID, apremilast 30 BID or placebo who achieve at least a 75% reduction from baseline in PASI (PASI-75)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of subjects with sPGA scores of clear (0) or almost clear (1); The sPGA is a measure of psoriasis disease severity at the time of evaluation by the Investigator. The sPGA is a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear, except for residual discoloration) to 5 (severe; majority of plaques have severe thickness, erythema, and scaling). The investigator examines all of the lesions on the subject and assigns a score ranging from 0 to 5 for thickness, erythema and degree of scaling. Scores for thickness, erythema and scaling are then summed and the mean of these 3 scores equals the overall sPGA score</description>

    <measure>Percent Change from baseline in the psoriasis affected Body Surface Area (BSA %)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Percent Change from baseline in the psoriasis affected BSA (%); BSA is a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the subject's hand (entire palmar surface or &quot;handprint&quot; including the fingers), which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline at Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Percent Change in the PASI score; The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. The PASI is a validated instrument that has become standard in clinical trials for psoriasis. Higher scores reflect a greater disease severity</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects who achieve PASI-50</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of subjects who achieve at least a 50% reduction from baseline in PASI score; The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. The PASI is a validated instrument that has become standard in clinical trials for psoriasis. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Pruritus (itch) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in Pruritus 100-mm VAS; The subject places a vertical line on a 100-mm VAS on which the left-hand boundary represents no itch at all and the right-hand boundary represents the worst itch imaginable. The distance from the vertical line to the left-hand boundary is recorded.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was developed as a practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitations related to the impact of skin disease. The instrument contains 10 items dealing with the subject's skin. The DLQI Total score has a possible range from 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a 36-item general health status instrument often used in clinical trials and health services research. It consists of 8 scales: physical function (PF), role limitations-physical (RP), vitality (VT), general health perceptions (GH), bodily pain (BP), social function (SF), role limitations-emotional (RE), and mental health (MH). Scale scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health. Two overall summary scores can also be obtained - a Physical Component Summary score (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary score (MCS).</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 16 and 68</time_frame>
    <description>Type, frequency, severity, and relationship of adverse events. An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including abnormal laboratory test values (which meet certain protocol-specified criteria), regardless of etiology</description>
