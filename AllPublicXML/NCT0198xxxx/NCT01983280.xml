  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate sleep is an important aspect of any healing process, and because it is known that
      children recovering from burns suffer long term sleep disruptions, the investigators believe
      that Healing Touch may improve the quality and quantity of sleep in the pediatric burn
      population.

      This study examines the impact of Healing Touch on the quality and quantity of sleep in
      pediatric burn survivors. Polysomnography recordings are obtained in order to assess
      nocturnal sleep in conjunction with Healing Touch; which is done on 1 of 2 nights during
      Polysomnography. Soft background music is played on both nights.

      Healing Touch is performed by one of 2 Healing Touch Certified Practitioners.
