    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between anti-drug antibodies, serum
      drug concentrations, and clinical response for rheumatoid arthritis patients being treated
      with etanercept, adalimumab or infliximab.

      cross-sectional Population will be selected through convenience sampling. Patients
      sequentially visiting the rheumatology clinic for routine care who are receiving etanercept,
      adalimumab, or infliximab for between 6 and 24 months will be evaluated for eligibility and
      interest in participation. A maximum of 200 patients per treatment will be enrolled.

    <description>The CDAI total scores for etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab compared between participants who are antidrug antibody positive versus negative.

The total score range is 0-76.

    <description>The DAS28 assessment is a derived measurement with differential weight given to each component. DAS28 will be calculated twice, utilizing first ESR, and then CRP as the acute phase reactant: 1) DAS28-ESR = 0.56 sqrt (28 painful/tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (28 swollen joint count) + 0.70 (ln ESR) + 0.014 GH, where GH=subject general health VAS (0-100 mm). 2) DAS28-4 CRP = 0.56 sqrt (28 painful/tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (28 swollen count) + 0.36 (ln CRP+1) + 0.014 GH + 0.96, where GH=subject general health VAS (0- 100 mm), higher scores were indicative of a worse outcome. The specific components of the DAS28 assessment that were used in this study are: Tender/Painful Joint Count (28), Swollen Joint Count (28), ESR/CRP, and Subject's General Health VAS assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty,&quot; 1 as &quot;some difficulty,&quot; 2 as &quot;much difficulty,&quot; and 3 as &quot;unable to do.&quot; Any activity that requires assistance from another individual or requires the use of an assistive device adjusts to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. The total score range for the HAQ-DI scale, minimum score was 0 (best), maximum score was 3 (worst).</description>

        <title>The Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Total Scores for Etanercept, Adalimumab, or Infliximab Compared Between Participants Who Are Antidrug Antibody Positive Versus Negative.</title>
        <description>The SDAI Total Scores for etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab compared between participants who are antidrug antibody positive versus negative. SDAI = DAS 28 prorated Swollen Joint Count (0-28) + DAS 28 prorated Tender Joint Count (0-28) + Physician’s Global Assessment (0-10) + Subject’s Global Assessment (0-10) + C-reactive protein (CRP) (in mg/dL). The total score range is 0-86. Score interpretation: Remission SDAI ≤ 3.3; Low Disease Activity SDAI &gt; 3.3 and ≤ 11; Moderate Disease Activity SDAI &gt; 11 and ≤ 26; High Disease Activity SDAI &gt; 26.</description>

        <title>Disease Activity Score Based on a 28-joint Count (DAS28), Calculated With Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate for Etanercept, Adalimumab, or Infliximab Compared Between Participants Who Are Antidrug Antibody Positive Versus Negative.</title>
        <description>The DAS28 assessment is a derived measurement with differential weight given to each component. DAS28 will be calculated twice, utilizing first ESR, and then CRP as the acute phase reactant: 1) DAS28-ESR = 0.56 sqrt (28 painful/tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (28 swollen joint count) + 0.70 (ln ESR) + 0.014 GH, where GH=subject general health VAS (0-100 mm). 2) DAS28-4 CRP = 0.56 sqrt (28 painful/tender joint count) + 0.28 sqrt (28 swollen count) + 0.36 (ln CRP+1) + 0.014 GH + 0.96, where GH=subject general health VAS (0- 100 mm), higher scores were indicative of a worse outcome. The specific components of the DAS28 assessment that were used in this study are: Tender/Painful Joint Count (28), Swollen Joint Count (28), ESR/CRP, and Subject’s General Health VAS assessment.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consists of 2-3 items. For each question in the questionnaire, the level of difficulty is scored from 0 to 3 with 0 representing “no difficulty,” 1 as “some difficulty,” 2 as “much difficulty,” and 3 as “unable to do.” Any activity that requires assistance from another individual or requires the use of an assistive device adjusts to a minimum score of 2 to represent a more limited functional status. The total score range for the HAQ-DI scale, minimum score was 0 (best), maximum score was 3 (worst).</description>
