  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard diagnostic workup for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer includes biopsy and
      determination of tumor estrogen status according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network and
      European Society for Medical Oncology. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is currently the most
      commonly used method for determining ER status. A investigational imaging tracer named
      16-alpha-[18F]-fluoro-17-beta-estradiol, or [18F]fluoroestradiol ([18F]FES) acts similarly in
      vivo to estradiol and binds to estrogen receptors (ERs). Previous studies in human have shown
      the efficacy of [18F]FES PET in detecting ER positive breast cancer without any observed
      toxicity. The investigators hypothesized that [18F]FES PET imaging can noninvasively assess
      ER status in recurrent or metastatic breast cancer lesion . In this study, a positive and
      negative percent agreement between IHC and [18F]FES will be determined.

    <description>[18F]FES PET/CT will be performed 90 min (± 10 min) after administration of [18F]FES. Patients will undergo core needle biopsy or surgery within 15 days after [18F]FES PET; or patients will undergo core needle biopsy within 30 days before [18F]FES PET. Experienced pathologists will determine metastatic/recurrent disease, and tumor histology including IHC. Patient will undergo surgery, radiation therapy or systemic therapy according to the results of staging workup, histology and biomarkers.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient will be enrolled if the patient meets the following inclusion criteria

               1. Patient is ≥19 years of age and male or female of any race/ethnicity

               2. Patients has first recurrence or stage IV disease by American Joint Committee on
                  Cancer tumor-node-metastasis staging system for breast cancer

               3. Patients had histologically confirmed invasive primary breast carcinoma and the
                  documented results of histology are available.

               4. Patients are scheduled to undergo core needle biopsy or surgery for histological
                  confirmation and determination of ER status of recurrent or distant metastatic
                  cancer within 15 days after [18F]FES PET; or patients already underwent core
                  needle biopsy of recurrent or distant metastatic cancer within 30 days before
                  [18F]FES PET and biopsy specimens are available for determination of ER status.

               5. Discontinuation of selective ER blocking agents including tamoxifen or
                  fulvestrant for at least 60 days prior to [18F]FES PET

               6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient will be excluded from this study if the patient does not full fulfill the
             inclusion criteria, or if any of the following conditions are observed

               1. Patient or patient's legally acceptable representative do not provide written
                  informed consent

               2. The recurrent or metastatic lesion scheduled to undergo biopsy is located in
                  breast, liver, ovary, uterus, or bone

               3. Female patient is pregnant or nursing. Exclusion of the possibility of pregnancy
