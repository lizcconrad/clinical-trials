    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the immediate effect of acupuncture on pain,
      cervical range of motion and electromyographic activity of the upper trapezius muscle in
      patients with nonspecific neck pain.Twelve patients with nonspecific neck pain and 12 healthy
      subjects will be enrolled in a randomized, single-blind, crossover study. Each patient will
      receive two forms of treatment in random order: a single session of traditional acupuncture
      and sham acupuncture. To eliminate carry-over treatment effects, a one-week wash-out period
      will be respected between sessions. Surface electromyography will be used to determine motor
      control in the upper trapezius muscle before and after treatment. The outcome measures in the
      group with neck pain will be a numerical pain rating scale (range: 0 [no pain] to 10 [maximum
      pain]), documentation of the pain area on a body chart and cervical range of motion. Linear
      regression analysis will be applied for each individual to investigate associations between
      the sEMG variables and force (excluding the sixth step). The slopes of the regression lines
      will be used to measure the sensitivity of the sEMG variables regarding changes in force. The
      Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to test the normality of the data distribution regarding RMS
      and MDF values in the third and sixth step of the step contraction. Paired samples (Student's
      t-test or Wilcoxon test) will be used to test differences between third and sixth contraction
      step. A mixed linear model will be used to analyze and compare the sEMG data during sustained
      contraction (five steps) between pre-acupuncture (EMG-1) and post-acupuncture (EMG-2)
      evaluations. These comparisons will demonstrate whether acupoints TE-5 and LI-11 affect the
      activity of the upper trapezius muscle, as hypothesized. The pain (NRS, PPT and area) and
      cervical ROM data collected during the four evaluations will also be compared using a mixed
      linear model. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 19.0 for Windows)
      will be employed for the statistical analysis, with the level of significance set to 5% (p &lt;
      0.05).

    <description>A cervical range of motion instrument will be used to determine cervical spine movements. This instrument is composed of two gravity goniometers and a compass goniometer and has demonstrated to be a reliable tool with adequate validity. The device will be placed on the top of the head and the patient will be instructed to move the head as far as possible without pain in a standard fashion: right rotation, left rotation, flexion, extension, right lateral flexion and left lateral flexion. Three trials will be conducted in randomized order for each direction of movement and mean values will be recorded for analysis.</description>

    <description>In the upper trapezius muscle with the greatest area pain and lowest PPT score will be chosen for acupuncture. Sterile acupuncture needles measuring 0.25 x 13 mm (Suzhou Huanqiu Acupuncture Medical Appliance Co. Ltd.®) will be inserted in TE-5 (located on the dorsal face of the forearm between the radius and ulna 3 cm above the joint line of the wrist) and LI-11 (located at the outermost point of the skinfold of elbow flexion in the direction of the lateral epicondyle of the elbow).</description>
