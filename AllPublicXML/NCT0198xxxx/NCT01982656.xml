  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study seeks to explore the effects of massage techniques on pain and anxiety
      relief among patients with subarachnoid hemorrhages in the ICU setting in comparison to
      subarachnoid hemorrhagic patients using standard medical therapy. In addition, our aim is to
      decrease the overall medication use to treat pain and anxiety, and to determine the impact of
      massage on sleep duration, quality, and breathing. Our goal is to improve and promote comfort
      during the ICU stay as well as decrease the need for narcotic medication usage.
