    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and activity of ibudilast administered twice
      daily over a 96 week period in subjects with primary or secondary progressive multiple
      sclerosis who are currently untreated with long-term MS disease modifying therapy (DMT) or
      who are receiving either glatiramer acetate (GA) or interferon beta-1, any formulation
      (IFNβ-1A [Avonex, Rebif] or IFNβ-1B [Betaseron, Extavia]). Study drug or placebo will be
      administered to a total of 250 male and female subjects from 21 to 65 years old, inclusive,
      in two treatment groups. Randomization of subjects will be stratified by disease status
      (primary progressive multiple sclerosis or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis) and
      immunomodulating therapy status: current use of immunomodulating therapy or no current use of
      immunomodulating therapy.

      The study will consist of a screening phase (up to 30 days) followed by a treatment phase (96
      weeks) and a follow-up visit (1 month post Week 96 visit). Following the screening phase,
      subjects who continue to meet entry criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment
      groups: doses up to ibudilast 100 mg/day or matching-placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Study drug will
      be administered twice daily (BID), e.g., ibudilast 50 mg or placebo taken in the morning and
      evening).

             hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular (including uncontrolled hypertension),
             gastrointestinal, urological disorder, or central nervous system (CNS) infection that
             would pose a risk to the subject if they were to participate in the study or that
             might confound the results of the study.

        Note: Active medical conditions that are minor or well-controlled are not exclusionary if,
        in the judgment of the Investigator, they do not affect risk to the subject or the study
        results. In cases in which the impact of the condition upon risk to the subject or study
        results is unclear, the Medical Safety Monitor should be consulted.

          -  Subjects with moderate to severe depression as determined by the Beck Depression
             Inventory-Fast Screen (BDI-FS).

          -  Subject has a history of alcohol or substance abuse (DSM-IV-TR criteria) within 3
             months prior to screening or alcohol or substance dependence (DSM-IV-TR criteria)
             within 12 months prior to screening. The only exceptions include caffeine or nicotine
             abuse/dependence.

          -  Subject has poor peripheral venous access that will limit the ability to draw blood as
             judged by the Investigator.

          -  Subject is currently participating, or has participated in, a study with an
             investigational or marketed compound or device within 3 months prior to signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Subject is unable to cooperate with any study procedures, unlikely to adhere to the
             study procedures and keep appointments, in the opinion of the Investigator, or was
             planning to relocate during the study.

          -  Subject is unable to undergo MRI imaging because of having an artificial heart valve,
             metal plate, pin, or other metallic objects (including gun shots or shrapnel) in their
             body or is unable to complete all the five MRI scans required for this study.
