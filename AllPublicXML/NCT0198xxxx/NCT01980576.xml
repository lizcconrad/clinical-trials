      The purpose of the study is:

        -  to measure sensitization of the nociceptive system at patients with low back pain in
           order to carry out a necessary surgical procedure

        -  to examine a possible association between low back pain and degenerative changes

        -  to analyse if low back pain is related to the clinical result 6 months after surgery

        -  to set up a model for pre-operative measurement of pain.
