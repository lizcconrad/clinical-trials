             with the study restrictions.

          -  Females may enroll if they are:

               1. documented to be surgically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrhoea &gt;1 year and

               2. practicing true abstinence and having a negative urine pregnancy test at
                  Screening and Day -1, or

               3. using double barrier contraception, out of which one should be a physical barrier
                  method such as adequate hormonal method (eg, contraceptive implants, injectables,
                  oral contraceptives) and/or non-hormonal methods (eg, intrauterine device,
                  condom, diaphragm or spermicides) from Screening or at least 2 weeks prior to
                  study drug administration (whichever is earlier) until 30 days after intake of
                  study medication and having a negative urine pregnancy test at Screening and Day
                  -1.

          -  Males with partners of childbearing potential may be enrolled if they are:

               1. documented to be surgically sterile (vasectomy), or

               2. practicing true abstinence, or

               3. using adequate double barrier contraception method, out of which one should be a
                  physical barrier for 90 days after the drug intake.

          -  BMI 18.0 - 35.0 kg/m2, inclusive, where BMI (kg/m2) = body weight (kg) / height2 (m2).

             signs, ECG, or laboratory tests at the pre-trial screening assessment that the
             Investigator judges as likely to interfere with the objectives of the trial or the

             probenecid) within 60 days prior to the baseline visit.

          -  Concomitant use of medications known to be strong cytochrome (CYP) P450 inducers or
             inhibitors within 21 days prior to study drug administration.
