  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidences showed that patients suffering from spinal cord injury (SCI) have poor mobility and
      higher chance to develop cardiopulmonary diseases, which leads to poor quality of life and
      shorter life expectancy. Different modalities were developed aiming at mobility restoration
      in SCI patients and robotic assisted body weight supported treadmill training is one of the
      latest technique in recent years. Yet there are scarce studies to investigate its
      effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of
      robotic-assisted body weight supported treadmill training on mobility and cardiopulmonary
      function of patients suffering from SCI by a randomized controlled trial.

      80 patients suffering from incomplete SCI will be recruited for an 8-week training program.
      They will be randomized into either robotic assisted body weight supported treadmill training
      group or passive lower limb mobilization training group. The training effects will be
      measured by Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury version II, lower extremity motor score,
      lower limb Modified Ashworth Scale, robotic gait system, gait analysis and gas analysis under
      sub maximal exercise stress test.

      Through the study, we intent to find the effectiveness of robotic-assisted body weight
      support treadmill training on walking and cardiopulmonary recovery with patients suffering
      from incomplete spinal cord injury.

      The hypothesis of the study is:

      Compared to the control group, robotic-assisted body weight supported treadmill training
      leads to a greater improvement in walking ability and cardiopulmonary functioning.

      Participants will be recruited from the spinal cord rehabilitation unit of Physiotherapy
      Department of Kowloon Hospital. Subjects will be allocated into intervention group or control
      group by using sealed envelope and they will be blinded for their group allocation. All
      participants will undergo standard physiotherapy program, including mobilization and
      strengthening exercise of limbs, trunk stabilization training, wheelchair maneuver training
      and overground walking training. Based on this standard training program twice per week, 60
      minutes per session, participants will receive an additional 30 minutes (exclude set-up time)
      of robotic-assisted body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) or control training
      based on their group allocation 3 times for 8 week.

      Outcome measures will be collected before the intervention and the subjects will be
      reassessed after finishing their 8 weeks of intervention. Outcome measures include Walking
      Index for Spinal Cord Injury version II, Spinal Cord Independence Measure version III, lower
      extremity motor score, Modified Ashworth Scale, L-stiff and L-force measured by Lokomat
      system, VO2 maximum, spirometry, and gait analysis (walking speed, heel-heel base
      support,bilateral stance duration, bilateral symmetry) The result of this study will provide
      useful information to enhance the clinical effectiveness of the management for spinal cord
      injury with the use of robotic assisted body weight supported treadmill training.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Walking speed, heel-heel base of support, bilateral legs stance duration and bilateral symmetry will be assessed by gait analysis system (GAITRite System, CIR Systems, Inc., US) . Subjects will be asked to walk on a pressure-detectable walkway, which is connected to a computer system. Assistance as well as orthoses will be provided based on subject's own choice. Two meters of acceleration distance will be provided before the subject walk onto the walkway while another two meters of deceleration distance will be provided so as to ensure that subjects walk with their fastest comfortable speed on the whole track of walkway. Bilateral symmetry will be assessed by the stride length ratio as well as stance phase duration ratio of the weak limb to strong limb, where the strong limb is defined as the one with higher score in lower extremity motor score.</description>

    <description>For cardiopulmonary functioning, the subject will be asked to perform upper limb ergometry (Endorphin's 300 e2 resistance system, Endorphin Corporation, US) with a gas analysis system (Fitmate pro, COSMED, Italy). Subjects will wear a mask connecting to the gas analysis system and they will be asked to perform the upper limb ergometry with the following protocol: 1 minute of rest following with 1 minute of warm-up using the least resistance, then the resistance will be increased by 1 level per 1 minute time. The test will be stopped when the heart rate reaches 85% of maximal heart rate, or the subject cannot further tolerate the test.
