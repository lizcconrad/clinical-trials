      The purpose of this study is to establish an efficient and economic treatment scheme by
      evaluation of the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous injection of low-dose rhGM-CSF, or of
      similar injection after whole lung lavage , in patients with PAP. During the observation,
      study visits will occur at the end of each month. During the 1-year follow-up period which is
      lasting 6 months after the treatment, all participants will be required to check the various
      efficacy indicators.

If the treatment is effective, participants may be entered into low-dose group(D1)(rhGM-CSF administration 1.25 ug/kg/d, qd, sc, for 2 months，then rhGM-CSF administration 1.25 ug/kg/d, qod, sc, for 3 months), when the chest CT absorption≥25% , and /or the PaO2 elevated by 5 mm Hg.</description>
