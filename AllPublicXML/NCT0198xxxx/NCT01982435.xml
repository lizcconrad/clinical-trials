    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the ocular and systemic adverse events of
      ranibizumab (Lucentis)for DME (diabetic macular edema) following previous treatment with
      intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin).

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of intravitreally administered 0.3mg ranibizumab
      (Lucentis) in subjects with DME (diabetic macular edema) previously treated with intravitreal
      bevacizumab (Avastin) with a randomized comparative dosing strategy, monthly vs
      &quot;treat-and-extend.&quot; Thirty patients total will be enrolled in the study, 15 in each group.
      This study will have a 1-year treatment period. The recruitment period will occur over 1 year
      with total potential study duration of 2 years.
