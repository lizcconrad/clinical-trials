  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is frequently identified as one of the most troublesome symptoms in cancer patients
      and there are very few conventional therapies which can address the symptom of fatigue in
      patients who are undergoing cancer treatment.

      This study will be testing whether the administration of a complementary therapy
      (individualized homeopathy) to a patient undergoing chemotherapy treatment is feasible and
      whether this treatment can lessen the fatigue symptoms of adults. The study will also test
      whether the n-of-1 study design is feasible in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an n-of-1 pilot trial of individualized homeopathic treatment of fatigue in a single
      adult who is undergoing any type of chemotherapy administered intermittently (i.e. not
      continuously). The participant will have a homeopathic consultation within 3 days of a round
      of chemotherapy (&quot;treatment period&quot;) and will be administered either verum or placebo
      according to a binary randomization allocation sequence unknown to both the clinician and
      participant. During the subsequent treatment period the participant will be given the other
      allocation (verum or placebo). The following pairs of allocations will also be randomized
      with treatment continuing for as long as the participant is undergoing chemotherapy
      treatment.

    <description>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is a 20-item, multi-dimensional, self-report instrument designed to measure fatigue. It covers the following 5 dimensions: 1) General Fatigue, 2) Physical Fatigue, 3) Mental Fatigue, 4) Reduced Motivation and 5) Reduced Activity.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item multi-dimensional questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients in the following four domains: functional scales; symptom scales; global quality of life; and single items.</description>

    <description>The study medication will be administered in one of two forms: (1) 3.5 mm diameter lactose/sucrose globule to be administered sublingually; or (2) 3.5 mm diameter lactose/sucrose globule dissolved in 250 ml spring water and administered orally. The medication will be administered as either 1 globule sublingual or 5 mL oral remedy/water up to 3 times per day. The dosage regimen is varialble at the discretion of the study clinician.</description>

    <description>Intervention must begin within 5 days of chemotherapy cycle completion. Intervention will continue until the next cycle of chemotherapy. The initial consultation will involve a verbal interview between the homeopath and the participant. The practitioner will then choose a single homeopathic remedy that will focus on the reduction of fatigue. Only one homeopathic remedy and potency will be administered at a given time. The participant will be asked to take the study medication at least 30 minutes before or after taking other medications, food and strong smelling substances.</description>
