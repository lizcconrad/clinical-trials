      A randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of methotrexate for the prevention of
      postmolar gestational trophoblastic disease among patients with high-risk hydatidiform mole.

      Women who will undergo suction curettage for complete hydatidiform mole at the Philippine
      General Hospital, who are at risk for developing postmolar gestational trophoblastic disease
      will be included in the study. Patients will receive either a single course of methotrexate
      or vitamin B complex (Benutrex) within fourteen days from molar evacuation. Patients' serum
      beta HCG will be monitored 1 week after molar evacuation and then every 2 weeks until the
      titers become normal for three consecutive determinations, then monthly for 6 months (every 2
      months for the next 6 months).

    <description>Diagnosis of postmolar gestational trophoblastic diseases will be based on the occurrence of any of the following conditions:
high level of hCG more than 4 weeks post-evacuation (serum level of 20,000mlU/m)
progressively increasing or plateuing hCG values at any time after evacuation (minimum of 3 weekly determinations)
clinical or histologic evidence of metastasis at any site
persistently elevated hCG titer at 14 weeks post-evacuation
elevation of previously normal hCG titer after evacuation provided the diagnosis of pregnancy is excluded
Toxicity brought about by the administration of methotrexate will be graded based on the WHO toxicity scoring system.</description>
