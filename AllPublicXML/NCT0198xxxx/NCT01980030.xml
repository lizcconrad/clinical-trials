    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II multicenter study which aims to assess the toxicity profile of
      Romiplostim in patients with transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia after allogeneic HSCT.

      A total of 24 patients with transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia after allogeneic HSCT will
      be included.

      The main endpoint is the incidence and severity of adverse events.
