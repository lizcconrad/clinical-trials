        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women aged 18 to 55 years, considered healthy based on screening physical
             examination, medical history, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis

               -  HNVs with a screening blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg

               -  Subjects who have hypertension controlled with up to 1 medication and who have a
                  blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg

               -  Note: For subjects with blood pressure at or above 140/90 mm Hg; two additional
                  readings 5 minutes apart are allowed but the last blood pressure reading must be
                  in range

               -  Subjects who have hypercholesterolemia controlled with up to 1 medication and who
                  have a low-density lipoprotein value less than 160 mg/dL

          -  Good venous access for blood draws

          -  No smoking in the past 6 months (including cigarettes, cigars, and pipes) and urine
             cotinine testing &lt; 100 ng/mL

          -  Completion of informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Blood donation (500 mL) within the last 8 weeks

          -  Fasting blood sugar &gt;100 mg/dL

          -  History of coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or congestive heart
             failure

          -  Allergy to study drug, components of Boost and Boost Plus, or other study material

          -  Clinically significant active or chronic illness

          -  History of asthma, COPD, or any other clinically relevant chronic lung disease

          -  Respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks before screening

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 5 years

          -  Positive urine drug screen

          -  Clinically significant screening ECG, physical examination, laboratory test, or vital
             sign abnormality

          -  Exposure to any other investigational drug or device within 30 days before treatment
             or within 90 days before treatment for drugs known to modify glucose metabolism

          -  History of malignancy within the 5 years before screening (other than basal cell
             carcinoma)

          -  History of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or hepatitis B or C

          -  Women who are pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the clinical
             study period

             bilateral tubal ligation, or postmenopausal for fewer than 2 years) not practicing
             adequate birth control. Adequate birth control is defined as using oral, percutaneous,
             or transdermal contraceptives; condoms and diaphragms (double barrier) with a
             spermicide; or intrauterine devices. Postmenopausal for the purposes of this clinical
             study includes experiencing amenorrhea for 2 or more years or being surgically
             sterile.

          -  Any subject who, in the opinion of the PI or a designee, appears not to be qualified
             for this study
