      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of AttraX® Putty as a bone
      graft substitute for autograft in instrumented posterolateral fusion of the thoracolumbar
      spine, in terms of efficacy and safety.

    <textblock>
      Spinal fusion, a surgical procedure frequently used for many spinal conditions requiring
      stabilization of the vertebral column, is currently performed by using large amounts of
      autologous bone graft or autograft. A substitute for this patient own bone would eliminate
      the graft harvesting morbidity that is currently one of the main disadvantages. Recently, a
      promising synthetic graft substitute has been developed that has shown favorable results in
      pre-clinical studies. This product is AttraX® Putty (CE-557130), a bioresorbable tricalcium
      phosphate (TCP), mixed with a fast resorbing polymer carrier to improve surgical handling.
      The aim of the current study is to clinically investigate AttraX® Putty as an alternative to
      autologous bone graft in adult patients qualified for instrumented posterolateral fusion of
      the thoracolumbar spine (T10-S1).

      The study design is a patient and observer blinded, controlled, randomized, multi-center
      clinical trial with intra-patient comparisons. This means that each patient is it owns
      control. According to a randomization scheme, one side of the spine will be grafted with
      AttraX® Putty the other side receives bone harvest from the iliac crest, which is currently
      the gold standard.

      The primary outcomes of this study are the posterior spinal fusion rate after one year (based
      on CT-scans), and potential serious adverse events related with AttraX® Putty. Secondary
      outcomes are the resorption characteristics during the first year, volume of bridging bone
      mass after one year, evaluation of iliac crest pain, correlation of the posterior fusion rate
      to the presence of interbody fusion after one year and the posterior spinal fusion rate after
      two years.

    <description>For the efficacy analysis of AttraX® Putty as a bone graft substitute for autograft in instrumented posterolateral fusion of the thoracolumbar spine, a comparison will be made between the fusion performance of the AttraX condition and the autograft condition after one year, assessed at CT-scans. Non-inferiority of AttraX® Putty will be tested with a McNemar's test.</description>

    <measure>Rate of (serious) adverse events with a potential relation with AttraX® Putty</measure>
    <time_frame>Untill 2 years (24-27 months) after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The safety of AttraX® Putty will be evaluated by documenting the number and nature of all (serious) adverse events that occur within the study population. The complication rate will be compared to the rate in control populations from the UMC Utrecht and a recently performed comparable multicenter-RCT coordinated by the UMC Utrecht. In addition, all (serious) adverse events will be evaluated for any potential relation with AttraX® Putty.</description>

    <measure>Resorption characteristics of AttraX® Putty compared to autograft during the first year</measure>
    <time_frame>During the first year (12-15 months) after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>In a subset of the study population, additional DEXA-scans at 1-5 days after surgery (reference scan) and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year follow-up will be made to evaluate the resorption characteristics of AttraX® Putty compared to autograft in the instrumented fusion locations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Volume of bridging bone mass after one year</measure>
    <time_frame>One year (12-15 months) after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>As quantification of the bone mass volume allows more detailed investigation of the amount of bone that has been formed, the volume of bridging bone mass derived from AttraX® Putty will be compared with the bone mass derived from autograft, using the one year CT scans made for the primary objective.</description>

    <measure>Visual analogue pain scale of iliac crest pain</measure>
    <time_frame>During two years (24-27 months) after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments of iliac crest pain at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years follow-up, by patients blinded to the side of graft harvesting from the iliac crest, will be analysed to investigate the relevance of donor site pain.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of posterior fusion rate to the presence of interbody fusion after one year</measure>
    <time_frame>One year (12-15 months) after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation of the posterior fusion rate to the presence of interbody fusion will be assessed at the one year CT scans made for the primary objective.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Posterior spinal fusion rate after two years</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years (24-27 months) after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the long-term fusion potential and behavior from AttraX® Putty and autograft, a comparison will be made between the fusion performance of both conditions after two years, assessed at CT-scans. Only those patients that scored a doubtful fusion or non-union in any of the relevant levels at the one-year CT scan will be scanned.</description>
