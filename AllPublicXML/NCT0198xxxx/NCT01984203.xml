      This study aims at determine if Progressive Heavy Load Exercises (PHLE) as treatment for
      patients diagnosed with Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy is superior to &quot;Standard Low-Load
      Exercises&quot; (LLE).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be performed as a multicenter randomised controlled trail, including 110
      patients diagnosed with Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy from four orthopaedic shoulder clinics in
      secondary sector in Denmark.

      The PHLE intervention will consist of progressive strengthening exercises performed with
      heavy load dumbbells, targeting the rotator cuff in a 12 weeks home-exercise program with six
      control visits at a physiotherapy department at the hospitals.

      The LLE exercise program consists of the same exercises as the PHLE, but performed with low
      load dumbbells.

      &quot;Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire&quot; is used as the primary
      outcome and is measured 12 weeks post baseline.

      12 months post baseline a secondary follow-up will be performed primarily measuring the
      number of patients referred to an operation.

      Patients will be randomised to either PHLE or LLE regime by blocks according to whether they
      have been referred to corticosteroid injection by their orthopaedic shoulder specialist.

      *April 2015: (We originally expected to be able to include 260 patients in order to analyze
      our data according to the sub-groups of exercise group +/- Corticosteroid injection, but
      inclusion rate has been much lower then expected, and due to time restraints we only expect
      to include 110 patients)

      Primary investigator and patients will be blinded towards group assignment.

A progressive exercise program consisting of 6 active exercises. Two exercises for the rotator cuff: Full Can and Sidelying external rotation Two exercises for the scapulae stabilizing muscles: Low Row and Push-Up Plus Two glenohumeral/postural corrective exercises: Posterior GH stretch and Scapular Retraction.</description>
