    <textblock>
      A rationally designed combination of adoptive T cell therapy and ipilimumab could strongly
      increase the proportion of CR patients, as well as the durability of response, as compared to
      ipilimumab or TIL alone. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of those two
      important modalities could result in a durable (≥ 1 year) complete response rate of 30% in
      stage IV melanoma patients.

          -  An interval of at least 28 days since last oncological treatment to the first
             ipilimumab course. Palliative radiation therapy outside of the brain or therapeutic
             radiation to the brain after the patient's condition is stabilized and systemic
             steroids required for the management of systems due to brain metastases is decreased
             to the lowest fixed dose possible does not require 28-day waiting period.

          -  Negative pregnancy test in women of child bearing potentialwithin 72 hours before the
             start of ipilimumab.
