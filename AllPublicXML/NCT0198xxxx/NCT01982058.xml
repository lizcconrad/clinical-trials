      Aim 1 A. To evaluate the impact of an Intimacy-Enhancing Couples' intervention (IEC) versus a
      General Health and Wellness Intervention (GHW) and a Usual care control (UC) on patient and
      partner psychological and relationship outcomes.

      B. To determine whether relationship length, pre-intervention relationship satisfaction, and
      men's pre-intervention masculinity moderate the effects of IEC on couples' psychological and
      relationship outcomes

      Aim 2 A. To evaluate whether IEC has an effect on couples' communication and intimacy when
      compared with GHW and UC and to determine whether changes in relationship communication and
      intimacy mediate changes in couples' psychological and relationship outcomes.

      Exploratory Aim:

      A. To evaluate the impact of IEC versus GHW on physical activity and fruit and vegetable
      intake as well as each partner's support for the other partner's adoption of greater physical
      activity and more fruit and vegetable intake.
