    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of pain resulting from injections of
      Botox® for wrinkles on the forehead and between the eyes using two different sized needles
      (32 gauge and 30 gauge needles).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened, assessed, and randomized to be injected with onabotulinum toxin A
      using a 30-gauge needle on one side of the face and injected using a 32-gauge needle on the
      other side during their first clinic visit. This study is a pilot study designed to determine
      feasibility of these procedures.

    <description>Subjects will rate pain using the visual analog score (VAS 1-10) after each side is injected using the 30 or 32 gauge needles. Lower values represents less pain; higher values represents more pain.</description>
