    <description>Patients receive Alemtuzumab escalated from initial dose of 3mg/day then 10mg/day and up to 30mg/day by intravenous infusion(if tolerated). when stable dose of 30mg/day is tolerated, Alemtuzumab is administrated at 30mg by IV infusion 3 times per week for up to 12 weeks (including escalation and stable dose period). After completion of 12 weeks treatment, or discontinuation of treatment within 12 weeks due to disease progression, patients will be visited every 3 months up to 1 year from enrollment or to death, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <description>Escalation Phase: Initial Doses of Alemtuzumab 3mg/day by intravenous(IV) infusion until tolerated, then Alemtuzumab 10mg/day IV infusion until tolerated, then Alemtuzumab 30mg IV infusion until tolerated.
Escalation to 30mg/day should be accomplished in 3~7 days.
Stable dose Phase: Once 30mg/day infusion of Alemtuzumab was tolerated, then continue 3 times per week. The total duration of Alemtuzumab therapy including escalation and stable dose phase is 12 weeks.
More than 30mg daily or 90mg weekly dose is prohibited</description>
