  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a common problem in cystic fibrosis (CF). It may lead to
      worsening lung function and more respiratory infections for a person with CF. This study will
      look at treating GERD with a medication, esopmeprazole. The medication stops stomach acid
      from being made. The study will see if there are fewer respiratory infections and improved
      lung function in patients with CF when taking esomeprazole.

      This is a randomized, placebo controlled intervention study in patients with CF who have a
      history of frequent exacerbations. Treatment duration is 6 months.
