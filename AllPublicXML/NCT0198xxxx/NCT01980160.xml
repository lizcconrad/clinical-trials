  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study hypotheses are that, without increasing doses of breakthrough medications
      or device intolerance, the Nometex™ device worn for 5-days beginning with the day of
      chemotherapy administration in women with ovarian or advanced endometrial or cervical cancer
      will, as an adjunct to standard-of-care anti-emetics, reduce vomiting episodes, and reduce
      the severity of nausea.

      The secondary hypotheses are that the Nometex™ device reduces acute (Day 1) emetic episodes,
      day 1 and days 2-5 severity of nausea, and delayed (days 2-5) emetic episodes without
      increasing doses of breakthrough medications or device intolerance.

    <description>Nometex Device that is activated so will be sending electrical pulses to the median nerve which will travel through afferent nerve fibers to the emetic centers of the brain. It is in these areas that the neurotransmitters modulate signals going to the stomach via the Vagus nerve. These electrical signals normalize the stomach rhythms, thereby alleviating nausea and vomiting.</description>
