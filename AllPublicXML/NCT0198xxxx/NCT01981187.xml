      The purpose of this signal seeking study is to determine whether treatment with LGX818
      demonstrates sufficient efficacy in select pathway-activated solid tumors and/or hematologic
      malignancies to warrant further study

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical benefit rate for patients with solid tumors will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 and will include responses of CR or PR or SD. For hematologic tumors other appropriate hematological response criteria will apply</description>

    <description>Overall Response (OR) of Partial Response (PR) or greater based on local investigator assessment. For patients with solid tumors the assessment criteria will be RECIST 1.1 and will include responses of CR and/or PR. For hematologic tumors other appropriate hematological response criteria will apply</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>every 8 weeks until death, assessed up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of first documented disease progression or relapse or death due to any cause</description>

    <description>Safety and tolerability will be will be based on the frequency of adverse events and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre-determined ranges. Other safety data (e.g., electrocardiogram, vital signs) will be considered as appropriate.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of a select solid tumor (except with a primary
             diagnosis of melanoma and colorectal cancer (CRC)) or hematologic malignancies and is
             in need of treatment because of progression or relapse.

          -  Patient's tumor has been evaluated and pre-identified as having a tumor with a
             BRAFV600 mutation at a CLIA certified laboratory.

          -  Patient must have received at least one prior treatment for recurrent, metastatic and
             /or locally advanced disease and for whom no standard therapy options are anticipated
             to result in a durable remission.

          -  Patient must have progressive and measurable disease per RECIST 1.1. or other
             appropriate hematological response criteria.

          -  Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received prior treatment with LGX818.

          -  Patients with Central Nerve System (CNS) metastasis or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

          -  Patient has received chemotherapy or other anticancer therapy ≤ 4 weeks (6 weeks for
