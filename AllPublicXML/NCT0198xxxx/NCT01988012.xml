    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Remission and CDAI Low Disease Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is an index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index was calculated using the following formula: CDAI = number of swollen joints using the 28-joint count (SJC28) + number of tender joints using the 28-joint count (TJC28) + patient global assessment of disease (PGA) based on 10 centimeter [cm] Visual Analog Scale [VAS] + physician global assessment of disease (PhGA) based on 10 cm VAS. VAS assessments involved a 10 cm horizontal scale from 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (maximum disease activity). Total CDAI scores ranged from 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity. Remission is defined as CDAI ≤2.8 and Low Disease Activity (LDA) is defined as 2.8&lt; CDAI ≤10.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Remission and SDAI Low Disease Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) was an index for measuring disease activity in RA and had a good correlation with the DAS28. The index was calculated using the following formula: SDAI: SJC28 + TJC28 + PGA (10 cm VAS) + PhGA (10 cm VAS + C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in milligram/liter (mg/L). VAS assessments involved a 10 cm horizontal scale from 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (maximum disease activity). Scores ranged from 0 to 86, with higher scores also indicating increased disease activity. An SDAI score of ≤ 3.3 represents clinical remission, a score of ≤ 11.0 represents low disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 20%, 50% and 70% Improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Response Scores (ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An ACR20 response requires at least 20% improvement compared to baseline in SJC (based on 66 joints) and TJC (based on 68 joints) as well as at least 20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: 1) PGA pain VAS, 2) PGA VAS; 3) physician's global assessment of disease activity VAS, 4) Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) with 20 questions consisting of 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; and 5) CRP in mg/L or ESR in mm/hr. ACR50 and ACR70 responses are defined in a similar way except that they required a 50% and 70% improvement from baseline, respectively. VAS assessments involved a 10 cm horizontal scale from 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (maximum disease activity).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI evaluates participant-reported quality of life using 8 categories: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other common activities and 20 questions. Each category contains multiple questions, which were answered using a 4-point scale from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The overall index score was an average of the individual item responses and may range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate more difficulty in daily living activities. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The symptom-specific measure FACIT-F assesses chronic illness therapy with special emphasis on fatigue in the past 7 days and consists of 5 dimensions: 1) physical well- being, 2) social/family well-being, 3) emotional well-being, 4) functional well-being, and 5) additional concerns. Each of the questions is categorically answered using the scales 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much for a total possible FACIT-F score of 0 to 52. The figures are reversed during score calculations, so that higher score values indicate more favorable conditions. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Total Scores on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HDRS is a clinician-administered depression assessment and consists of 17 items with a total score range from 0 to 54. A higher score indicates a worse outcome. HAS is a clinician-administered assessment to measure the severity of anxiety symptoms and consists of 14 items with a total score range from 0 to 56. A higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Follow-up Week 32</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not considered related to the drug. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as AEs. AESIs are AEs that occur in categories of special interest with regard to the benefit-risk profile and overall safety of a drug. The following nine categories of AESIs were identified for tocilizumab: 1) serious and/or medically significant infections, 2) myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome, 3) gastrointestinal perforations, 4) malignancies, 5) anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions, 6) demyelinating disorders, 7) stroke, 8) serious and/or medically significant bleeding events, and 9) serious and/or medically significant hepatic events.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Remission and CDAI Low Disease Activity</title>
        <description>Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is an index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index was calculated using the following formula: CDAI = number of swollen joints using the 28-joint count (SJC28) + number of tender joints using the 28-joint count (TJC28) + patient global assessment of disease (PGA) based on 10 centimeter [cm] Visual Analog Scale [VAS] + physician global assessment of disease (PhGA) based on 10 cm VAS. VAS assessments involved a 10 cm horizontal scale from 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (maximum disease activity). Total CDAI scores ranged from 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity. Remission is defined as CDAI ≤2.8 and Low Disease Activity (LDA) is defined as 2.8&lt; CDAI ≤10.</description>

        <description>Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) was an index for measuring disease activity in RA and had a good correlation with the DAS28. The index was calculated using the following formula: SDAI: SJC28 + TJC28 + PGA (10 cm VAS) + PhGA (10 cm VAS + C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in milligram/liter (mg/L). VAS assessments involved a 10 cm horizontal scale from 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (maximum disease activity). Scores ranged from 0 to 86, with higher scores also indicating increased disease activity. An SDAI score of ≤ 3.3 represents clinical remission, a score of ≤ 11.0 represents low disease activity.</description>

The index was calculated using the following formula: SDAI: SJC28 + TJC28 + PGA (10 cm VAS) + PhGA (10 cm VAS + C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in mg/L. VAS assessments involved a 10 cm horizontal scale from 0 (no disease activity) to 10 (maximum disease activity). Scores ranged from 0 to 86, with higher scores also indicating increased disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI evaluates participant-reported quality of life using 8 categories: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other common activities and 20 questions. Each category contains multiple questions, which were answered using a 4-point scale from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The overall index score was an average of the individual item responses and may range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate more difficulty in daily living activities.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACIT-F)</title>
        <description>The symptom-specific measure FACIT-F assesses chronic illness therapy with special emphasis on fatigue in the past 7 days and consists of 5 dimensions: 1) physical well- being, 2) social/family well-being, 3) emotional well-being, 4) functional well-being, and 5) additional concerns. Each of the questions is categorically answered using the scales 0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=somewhat, 3=quite a bit, and 4=very much for a total possible FACIT-F score of 0 to 52. The figures are reversed during score calculations, so that higher score values indicate more favorable conditions. A positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

The protocol recommended suspending the treatment after week 24 for a period of 8 weeks, according to investigators’ discretion, for the purpose of drug-free immunogenicity testing.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) and AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)</title>
        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not considered related to the drug. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as AEs. AESIs are AEs that occur in categories of special interest with regard to the benefit-risk profile and overall safety of a drug. The following nine categories of AESIs were identified for tocilizumab: 1) serious and/or medically significant infections, 2) myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome, 3) gastrointestinal perforations, 4) malignancies, 5) anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions, 6) demyelinating disorders, 7) stroke, 8) serious and/or medically significant bleeding events, and 9) serious and/or medically significant hepatic events.</description>
