    <textblock>
      Monitoring ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmatic sperm
      injection (ICSI) can be simplified by reducing the procedure to measuring follicles by
      ultrasound. Proponents of a simplified procedure claim that the procedure can be reduced to
      simple monitoring by ultrasound while maintaining results (numbers of mature oocytes,
      percentage of pregnancy and live birth rates). On the other hand simultaneous blood sampling
      for measuring hormone levels is still the state of the art in many clinics. A large review
      (Cochrane review) stated that &quot;although there was no clear evidence for a better outcome,
      combined cycle monitoring was still recommended until it could be proven that ovarian
      hyperstimulation can be avoided without hormonal monitoring&quot;. Investigators therefore perform
      a study that compares the results between 2 groups: those with ultrasound monitoring and
      those with combined monitoring. Deciding when to plan the retrieval of the oocytes can depend
      on subtle differences in the number of large follicles measured by ultrasound, but also on
      hormonal levels in the blood of the patient. Therefore the investigators planned a randomized
      study in the group of patients with combined monitoring. The investigators examined if
      delaying the moment for planning the moment of oocyte retrieval by 24 hours had any effect on
      the number of mature oocytes and pregnancy rates and what the effect of rising progesterone
      levels might be. The investigators hypothesis was that combined monitoring could lead to
      better results since recent studies have thought that rising progesterone levels, if found,
      have a negative impact on pregnancy rates. On the other hand the investigators expect to find
      that waiting for larger follicles in cases with normal progesterone levels lead to a better
      oocyte yield.
