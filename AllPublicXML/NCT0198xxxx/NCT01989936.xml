      To determine the tolerability and efficacy of eletriptan in patients who had discontinued
      oral sumatriptan due to lack of efficacy or intolerable adverse events (AEs) during previous
      clinical treatment (not a controlled trial).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary efficacy endpoint was 2-h headache response after taking the first dose of study medication for the first attack</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects recorded the intensity of each migraine headache in the diary based on a 4-point scale: 0, pain absent; 1, mild pain; 2, moderate pain; 3, severe pain. A response was considered a change from severe or moderate pain to mild or absent at various time points after dosing with study medication</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained response was defined as achieving a headache response within 2 h post dose, with no recurrence or rescue medication needed</measure>
    <time_frame>18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Recurrence was defined as a return of headache to moderate or severe intensity within 2-24 h if the subject had an initial response within 2 h of taking the study medication.</description>

    <description>Subjects were randomized to one of the 3 treatment groups (eletriptan 40 mg, eletriptan 80 mg, or placebo) in a 2:2:1 ratio and were given sufficient medication to treat 3 migraine attacks (including a second dose for each attack for recurrence) within 18 weeks of the initial visit. Subjects were instructed to treat a moderate to severe migraine within 6 hours of the onset of pain provided the headache was not decreasing in severity, the aura phase had ended and they had taken no analgesic or antiemetic within 6 hours. Efficacy data was collected in a diary. Subjects were allowed to take rescue medication if they had no response to the study medication within 4 hours of onset.</description>
