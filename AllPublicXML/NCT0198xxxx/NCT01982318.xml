    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint for the study is the time to complete wound closure, within the 8-week Treatment Phase, as assessed by the investigator. Complete wound closure is defined as 100% re-epithelialization with no presence of scab or drainage as assessed by the Investigator at PH0 and confirmed at PH2.
The date of complete healing is defined as the date of the first assessment of complete closure (100% re-epithelialization with no presence of scab or drainage) when complete wound closure is confirmed at a study visit 14 days (±3 days) later. For the purposes of this study, the initial assessment of complete closure will occur at PH0 and complete closure will be confirmed at PH2.</description>

        Abbreviations:

          -  Study Ulcer: SU

          -  Post-debridement: PD

        Inclusion Criteria: Potential subjects are required to meet all of the following criteria
        for enrollment into the study and subsequent randomization.

          1. 18≤ years old.

          2. Ankle Brachial Pressure Index ≥0.80. (Calculations made using measurements from
             posterior tibial &amp; dorsalis pedis arteries &amp; both arms).

          3. Presence of a venous leg ulcer extending through the full thickness of the skin, but
             not down to muscle, tendon, or bone. The largest ulcer will be designated the SU and
             the only one included in the study. If other ulcerations are present on the same leg
             they must be more than 2 cm apart from the SU.

          4. Venous disease confirmed by Doppler ultrasound to demonstrate reflux of &gt; 0.5 seconds
             in saphenous (great or small), calf perforators or the deep venous system. Subjects
             with prior venous surgery may be included if they still demonstrate significant reflux
             in a remaining venous segment and the SU continues to suffer poor healing because of
             venous hypertension.

          5. SU has been present 1 ≤ x ≤ 12 months prior to the initial screening visit, and is
             excluded if it has undergone 12 months of continuous high strength compression therapy
             over its duration.

          6. SU with a 2.5 ≤ x ≤ 20 cm2 at the T1 visit (PD).

          7. SU with a clean, granulating base free of adherent slough at the T1 visit (PD).

          8. In the case of a female patient of childbearing potential, willingness to use
             acceptable methods of contraception. A urine pregnancy test at the T1 visit must be
             administered, and must be negative for inclusion.

          9. Understanding of and willingness by the patient to participate in the clinical study
             and ability to comply with study procedures and study visit schedule.

         10. Reading, approval, and signature by the patient of the IRB/IEC ICF before screening
             procedures are undertaken.

        Exclusion Criteria:Potential subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be
        excluded from enrollment and subsequent randomization:

          1. Ulcer(s) deemed by the Investigator to be caused by a medical condition other than
             venous insufficiency. These may include, but are not limited to: ulcerations due to
             fungal, malignant, diabetic, and/or arterial insufficiency causes.

          2. Ulcer exhibits clinical signs and symptoms of infection at S1 or T1. The infection
             should be treated &amp; afterward the patient may be re-assessed for eligibility for study
             re-entry.

          3. Known allergy to any of the protocol-stipulated treatment procedures or non-tolerance
             of multi-layer compression therapy.

          4. Ulcer, in the opinion of the Investigator, is suspicious for cancer.

          5. A history of more than 2 weeks treatment with immunosuppressants (including systemic
             corticosteroids), cytotoxic chemotherapy, or application of topical steroids to the
             ulcer surface within 1 month prior to S1, or treatments with such medications during
             screening, or anticipated requirement of such medications during the course of the
             study.

          6. Treatment with any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30 days
             preceding S1; or anticipated use of any of these therapies during the course of the
             study.

          7. Malignant disease not in remission for 5 or more years, other than basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have been medically or surgically treated
             without evidence of metastases.

          8. History of radiation at the SU site.

          9. As determined by medical history, presence of one or more medical conditions including
             renal, hepatic, hematologic, active auto-immune or immune diseases that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would make the subject an inappropriate candidate for
             this ulcer healing study.

         10. Known history of having AIDS or history of HIV infection.

         11. Previous participation in any VitroGro® ECM trial within the past 6 months.

         12. SU has been previously treated with tissue engineered materials or other scaffold
             materials within 30 days prior to S1.

         13. SU which in the opinion of the Investigator might require negative pressure wound
             therapy or hyperbaric oxygen during the course of the trial.

         14. Presence of any condition(s) that seriously compromise(s) the subject's ability to
             complete this study, or a known history of poor adherence with medical treatment.

         15. NYHA Class III and IV congestive heart failure (CHF), as defined by the following
             criteria:

               -  Class III: Symptoms with moderate exertion

               -  Class IV: Symptoms at rest

         16. Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus, as measured by an HbA1c &gt;10%.

         17. Ulcer on the dorsum of the foot or with more than 50% of the ulcer below the malleolus
             is excluded.

         18. Pregnancy or breast-feeding.

         19. Increase or decrease by &gt;30% in the SU surface area at the T1 visit (PD) as compared
             to the SU surface area as measured at the S1 visit (PD).
