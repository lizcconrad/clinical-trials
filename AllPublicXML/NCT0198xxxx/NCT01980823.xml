      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of combining metformin and atorvastatin
      treatment in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer during the interval between breast
      biopsy and surgery.

      This study is designed to assess whether tumor proliferation, as measured by the natural log
      expression of Ki-67 staining of breast tumor cells, is reduced following approximately 2
      weeks of treatment with the combination of metformin plus atorvastatin in patients with newly
      diagnosed breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer cells require energy homeostasis shifts with enhanced anabolism to enable rapid
      growth and continued proliferation. The main energy regulatory system in eukaryotes and
      breast cancer cells is the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) pathway. AMPK is triggered by changes
      in the AMP/Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio thus impacting energy reserves and
      requirements. AMPK pathway closely interacts with the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
      signaling pathway, affecting the downstream function of the master regulator mammalian target
      of rapamycin (mTOR). Activation of AMPK has been shown in vitro to result in inhibition of
      proliferation of various cancer cell lines.

      Utilizing a pre-surgical model, the investigator plans to conduct a pilot study of 40 women
      with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) who will
      receive oral metformin and atorvastatin daily in the interval between diagnostic breast
      biopsy and definitive breast surgery.

      The goal is to determine if dual combination treatment with metformin plus atorvastatin
      significantly impacts tumor-based markers, such as proliferation, and blood-based biomarkers.

    <description>Metformin is an oral diabetes medicine that helps control blood sugar levels.
Dosage/Frequency: 1500 mg per day: divided 500 mg in the morning and 1000 mg in the evening
Metformin is for people with type 2 diabetes. Metformin is sometimes used in combination with insulin or other medications, but it is not for treating type 1 diabetes.</description>

    <description>Atorvastatin is in a group of drugs called &quot;statins.&quot; Atorvastatin reduces levels of &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) and triglycerides in the blood while increasing levels of &quot;good&quot; cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL).
Dosage/Frequency: 80 mg once a day at bedtime
Atorvastatin is used to treat high cholesterol, and to lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, or other heart complications in people with type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, or other risk factors.</description>
