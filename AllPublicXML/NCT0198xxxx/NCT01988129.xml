  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Firefighters work some of the most demanding schedules known under highly stressful and
      demanding conditions. The need to work frequent extended shifts and long work weeks leads to
      acute and chronic partial sleep deprivation as well as misalignment of circadian phase. Sleep
      disorders are common, costly, and treatable, but often remain undiagnosed and untreated and
      it is likely that a significant proportion of firefighters suffer from undiagnosed sleep
      disorders which will further impair their sleep and exacerbate fatigue.In the current
      proposal, we aim to address the health, performance and safety issues related to fatigue in
      firefighters and test the effectiveness of a Comprehensive Firefighter Fatigue Management
      Program (CFFMP) that we have termed 'Operation Healthy Sleep.'

      We propose to use a station-level, randomized experimental design to test the hypotheses that
      implementation of a Comprehensive Firefighter Fatigue Management Program will:

        1. improve the mean total sleep, alertness and cognitive performance of firefighters;

        2. improve firefighter safety, as determined by:

             1. decreased rates of motor vehicle crashes;

             2. decreased on-the-job injuries;

        3. improve firefighter performance, as determined by decreased response time;

        4. improve firefighters' health, as determined by:

             1. diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders

             2. improved general health indices

             3. decreased number of 'sick' days

        5. improve firefighters' and families' job satisfaction and ability to cope with extended
           work hours.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Firefighters' Health, as Determined by Number of 'Sick' Days Over 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We assessed 'sick days' cumulatively over 12 months in two ways from departmental payroll records; the number of 24-hour pay periods coded as 'sick' time per firefighter and the number of 24-hr pay periods coded as injury and disability per firefighter. Fewer sick days is indicative of better health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Firefighter Safety, as Determined by Motor Vehicle Crashes Over 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fewer motor vehicle crashes is indicative of better health. We assessed motor vehicle crashes cumulatively over 12 months. Accidents were counted as any incident that resulted in the filing and review of a departmental Fleet Accident Report.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Firefighter Safety, as Determined by On-the-job Injuries Over 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fewer on-the-job injuries is indicative of better health. We assessed injuries cumulatively over 12 months. Injuries that triggered the filing of an official city government accident report as the result of following normal departmental procedures were included in this study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Firefighters' Performance, as Determined by Response Time Over 12 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A lower response time is indicative of better performance.
Following detailed review of departmental procedures and records, we determined that 'turn-out time' was already very rapid and not considered an accurate measure of firefighters' performance by the department. Similarly, 'clearance time' (time from the start until the end of the event), which could last for many hours, was also not considered an appropriate measure of firefighter' performance in relation to sleep and alertness given the multiple factors, many of which are not under the control of the firefighters, that could affect clearance times. We therefore did not address this aim.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Mean Total Sleep Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A higher total sleep time is indicative of better sleep. The outcome measure was assessed in the intervention group only at the start and end of the program. There are no data for the control group and therefore they have not been added or reported as a separate study arm.
The analysis for total sleep time is limited to those individuals in the intervention stations who participated in the program, completed both the study start and 12-month follow-up survey, and had at least 1 week of work scheduled in the 4 weeks prior to each survey.</description>

    <description>A lower number of times reported falling asleep during meetings is indicative of better alertness and cognitive performance.
The outcome measure was assessed in the intervention group only at the start and end of the program. There are no data for the control group and therefore they have not been added or reported as a separate study arm.
The analysis for the number of times individuals reported sleeping during meetings is limited to those individuals in the intervention stations who participated in the program, completed both the study start and 12-month follow-up survey.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Mean Alertness and Cognitive Performance of Firefighters - Sleeping While Stopped in Traffic</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A lower number of times reported sleeping while stopped in traffic is indicative of better alertness and cognitive performance.
The outcome measure was assessed in the intervention group only at the start and end of the program. There are no data for the control group and therefore they have not been added or reported as a separate study arm.

    <measure>Change in Firefighters' Health, as Determined by General Health Indices;</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure was assessed in the intervention group only at the start and end of the program. There are no data for the control group and therefore they have not been added or reported as a separate study arm.
A higher health index is indicative of better health. We assessed general health with the question ' In general, would you say your health is Excellent/Very good/Good/Fair/Poor?' and coded the answers from 5-1, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change Firefighters' and Families' Job Satisfaction and Ability to Cope With Extended Work Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>In developing the study detail with the department, it became apparent that it would be impractical to assess firefighters' and families' job satisfaction and ability to cope with extended work hours in a meaningful way. We therefore did not address this aim.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Sleep Disorders According to Voluntary Sleep Disorders Screening Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Study start)</time_frame>
    <description>Firefighters were instructed to attend a mandatory 30-min education training presentation as operations allowed. Following the education, firefighters were invited and encouraged to complete a voluntary sleep disorders screening questionnaire. This questionnaire used validated, self-report screening tools for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), moderate to severe insomnia, restless legs syndrome and shift work disorder. All of the respondents who screened positive for a high risk of any sleep disorder were notified by letter as to their risk and provided with contact information for a local American Academy of Sleep Medicine-certified, partnering sleep clinics if they chose to follow-up. Participants were also free to seek medical follow-up elsewhere. Telephone calls were made to all high risk participants to ensure that they were aware of the results, and to facilitate clinic scheduling. Participants were asked to provide voluntary medical records release consent for tracking diagnoses.</description>

    <description>Workplace-based fatigue risk management program consisting of sleep health education and sleep disorders screening. The 32 fire department stations were paired according to the previous calendar years' workload. One station from each pair was randomly assigned to receive the intervention program. Sleep education sessions were scheduled according to station. On the education day(s) assigned to that stations, all personnel present that day were instructed to attend, and 542/601 did so.</description>

        <title>Firefighters’ Health, as Determined by Number of ‘Sick’ Days Over 12 Months</title>
        <description>We assessed 'sick days' cumulatively over 12 months in two ways from departmental payroll records; the number of 24-hour pay periods coded as 'sick' time per firefighter and the number of 24-hr pay periods coded as injury and disability per firefighter. Fewer sick days is indicative of better health.</description>

            <description>Workplace-based fatigue risk management program consisting of sleep health education and sleep disorders screening
Sleep disorders education and screening: Firefighters were instructed to attend an education presentation as operations allowed which provided information on firefighter mortality, fatigue-related health hazards and discussed the importance of sleep, and also included strategies to improve sleep hygiene and how to use caffeine and naps effectively to promote alertness. Firefighters were then invited to complete a voluntary sleep disorders screening survey. This survey used validated, self-report screening tools for obstructive sleep apnea, moderate to severe insomnia, restless legs syndrome and shift work disorder. All of those who screened positive for a high risk of any sleep disorder were notified by letter as to their risk and provided with contact information for a partnering sleep clinic if they chose to follow-up.</description>

            <description>Workplace-based fatigue risk management program consisting of sleep health education and sleep disorders screening
Sleep disorders education and screening: Firefighters were instructed to attend an education presentation as operations allowed which provided information on firefighter mortality, fatigue-related health hazards and discussed the importance of sleep, and also included strategies to improve sleep hygiene and how to use caffeine and naps effectively to promote alertness. Firefighters were then invited to complete a voluntary sleep disorders screening survey. This survey used validated, self-report screening tools for obstructive sleep apnea, moderate to severe insomnia, restless legs syndrome and shift work disorder. All of those who screened positive for a high risk of any sleep disorder were notified by letter as to their risk and provided with contact information for a partnering sleep clinic if they chose to follow-up.</description>

        <title>Firefighters’ Performance, as Determined by Response Time Over 12 Months</title>
        <description>A lower response time is indicative of better performance.
Following detailed review of departmental procedures and records, we determined that ‘turn-out time’ was already very rapid and not considered an accurate measure of firefighters’ performance by the department. Similarly, ‘clearance time’ (time from the start until the end of the event), which could last for many hours, was also not considered an appropriate measure of firefighter’ performance in relation to sleep and alertness given the multiple factors, many of which are not under the control of the firefighters, that could affect clearance times. We therefore did not address this aim.</description>

All of the respondents who screened positive for a high risk of any sleep disorder were notified by letter as to their risk and provided with contact information for a local American Academy of Sleep Medicine-certified, partnering sleep clinics if they chose to follow-up. Participants were also free to seek medical follow-up elsewhere.

        <description>A lower number of times reported sleeping while driving is indicative of better alertness and cognitive performance.
The outcome measure was assessed in the intervention group only at the start and end of the program. There are no data for the control group and therefore they have not been added or reported as a separate study arm.
The analysis for the number of times individuals reported being sleepy while driving is limited to those individuals in the intervention stations who participated in the program, completed both the study start and 12-month follow-up survey.</description>

            <description>Workplace-based fatigue risk management program consisting of sleep health education and sleep disorders screening
Sleep disorders education and screening: Firefighters were instructed to attend an education presentation as operations allowed which provided information on firefighter mortality, fatigue-related health hazards and discussed the importance of sleep, and also included strategies to improve sleep hygiene and how to use caffeine and naps effectively to promote alertness. Firefighters were then invited to complete a voluntary sleep disorders screening survey. This survey used validated, self-report screening tools for obstructive sleep apnea, moderate to severe insomnia, restless legs syndrome and shift work disorder. All of those who screened positive for a high risk of any sleep disorder were notified by letter as to their risk and provided with contact information for a partnering sleep clinic if they chose to follow-up.</description>
