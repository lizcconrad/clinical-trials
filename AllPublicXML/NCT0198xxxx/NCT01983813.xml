      The trial will examine whether a centralized Prevention Health &amp; Cardiovascular Risk Service
      (PHCVRS) run by clinical pharmacists at the University of Iowa can be implemented in primary
      care offices and whether it can improve the care delivered to patients at risk for developing
      cardiovascular disease. The study will be conducted in 12 medical practices in Iowa that are
      either a Federally Qualified Health Center or part of the IRENE practice-based research
      network.
