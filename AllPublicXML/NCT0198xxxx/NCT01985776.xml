  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to define parameters of the trunk neuromuscular functions
      that are pathologically altered in patients with low back pain due to spondylolytic
      spondylolisthesis. The second and also the main purpose of the study is to examine the
      effects of exercise intervention on patients with low back pain due to spondylolytic
      spondylolisthesis. Our overall hypothesis is that specific exercise intervention will improve
      neuromuscular functions of the trunk in patients with low back pain due to spondylolytic
      spondylolisthesis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is known to affect a considerable portion (&gt; 75%) of the society, causing
      enormous financial burden for the healthcare systems.

      Exercise interventions incorporated into low back pain patients rehabilitation protocols are
      known as successful treatment strategies, but ore often focused on strength training and not
      on functional stabilization. Spondylolytic spondylolisthesis is one of the most known types
      of spine instabilities. To date, no studies examined the effects of exercise intervention on
      patients with low back pain due to spondylolytic spondylolisthesis. Research will be carried
      out as a cross-sectional study, where patients with spondylolytic spondylolisthesis will be
      randomly arranged in one controlled and two experimental groups. For the forth group healthy
      asymptomatic participants will be recruited.

      Exercise intervention will last 12 weeks with a frequency of three times a week and duration
      of 60 minutes per training unit. Exercise intervention will include congregated set of trunk
      stabilisation exercises, starting with simple isometric tasks. Dynamic and more complex
      movements will be added progressively to achieve whole body tasks involving fast and sudden
      movements.

      Neuromuscular functions of the trunk will be measured before and after the intervention.
