      The study will assess the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy of different intra-tumoral
      dosing regimens of LTX-315; a lytic-peptide that induces long-term anti-cancer immune
      responses, as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab or pembrolizumab.

      In this phase I, open-label, multi-arm, multicentre, multi-dose dose escalation study in
      patients with transdermally accessible tumours; the safety, PK and efficacy of different
      dosing regimens of LTX-315 will be assessed.

      Patients will be allocated into 4 separate (parallel) arms depending on the tumour type and
      the number of lesions available.

      Arm A: Single lesion/sequential lesion treatment arm (LTX-315 monotherapy) (Completed) Arm B:
      Concurrent multiple lesion treatment arm with all tumour types (LTX-315 monotherapy) Arm C:
      LTX-315 combination with ipilimumab in patients with melanoma Arm D: LTX-315 combination with
      pembrolizumab in patients with TNBC

      All patients will have at least one lesion available for injection.

      Treatment schedule:

      Arm A: Injection of LTX-315 3 days week 1, 1 day in week 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Every 2 weeks
      starting with week 8.

      Arm B (all tumours): Injection of LTX-315 2 days week 3 weeks (Day 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16).

      Arm C (melanoma): Injection of lTX-315 2 days week 3 weeks (Day 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16) in
      combination with ipilimumab given in week 1 and every 3 weeks 4 cycles.

      Arm D (TNBC): Injection of LTX-315 2 days week 3 weeks (Day 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16) in
      combination with pembrolizumab given in week 1 and every 3 weeks up to 2 years.

      Patients will be enrolled into a dose cohort in order of study entry. Staring with the lowest
      dose. A minimum of 3 patients will be enrolled into each cohort. Dose escalation determined
      by the Safety Review Committee and the Sponsor. The the optimal regimen will be based on the
      results of the Dose Escalation from the following information:

        1. Safety parameters including blood samples and cardiovascular effects

        2. Immunohistology and ultrasound confirmation of necrosis and tumour infiltrating
           lymphocytes

        3. Systemic inflammatory response

        4. Evidence of clinical responses

      Cohorts may be utilized to:

        1. Evaluate different doses of LTX-315

        2. Explore potential modifications to the dosing schedule

        3. Evaluate the potential to include appropriate combination therapies with LTX-315

        4. Gain further information on clinical efficacy
