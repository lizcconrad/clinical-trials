      To determine the safety and efficacy of intravitreal Aflibercept (Eylea) injection in
      patients with diabetic retinopathy in the prevention of macular edema following cataract
      surgery.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy patients who are at risk of developing macular edema (defined as ≥ 30 %
      increase from pre-operative baseline in central subfield macular thickness) within 90 days
      following cataract surgery. Diabetic patients are defined as those who have either Type 1 or
      Type 2 diabetes. The patients must have either mild, moderate, or severe non proliferative
      retinopathy or treated proliferative retinopathy. Patients must be 18 years of age and older,
      of any race and either sex, requiring cataract extraction with planned implantation of a
      posterior chamber intraocular lens into the lens capsule.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:

               1. Must be 18 years of age and older, of any race and either sex, who have a
                  cataract, and are planning to undergo cataract extraction by phacoemulsification
                  with the implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens into the lens
                  capsule

               2. History of Type I or Type II diabetes

               3. NPDR: non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (mild, moderate, or severe) or
                  inactive proliferative disease in the study eye as defined by the International
                  Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale

               4. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

               5. Patients must be able to understand and sign an informed consent that has been
                  approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB)

               6. Central subfield macular thickness ≤ 320 μm in the study eye prior to cataract
                  surgery as determined by SD-OCT and confirmed by the reading center

               7. Absence of clinically significant macular edema (CSME) in the study eye as
                  detected by clinical exam

             reading center or investigator

          2. Current or previous ocular disease in the study eye that in the opinion of the
             investigator may confound assessment of the macula, the retina, or central vision
             other that diabetic retinopathy

          4. Planned multiple procedures for study eye during the cataract/IOL implantation surgery

             investigator

          8. Patients who are immunocompromised (e.g., patients receiving chemotherapy irradiation
             therapy, patients with AIDS, leukemia, or cachexia) or patients receiving dialysis

          9. Use of medications known to affect the macula, including hydroxychloroquinine
             (Plaquenil) and phenothiozines (e.g., thioridazine [Mellaril], chloropromazine
             [Thorazine]) or supplemental niacin ≥3 grams/day

         10. Use of systemic steroids, NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), anti-VEGF
             agents within 7 days prior to surgery (through study exit). Daily doses of aspirin, up
             to 325 mg, will be permitted.

         11. Use of topical ocular NSAIDS and steroids, in the study eye, within 7 days prior to
             surgery

         12. Treatment with intraocular or periocular steroids in the study eye within 3 months
             prior to surgery

         13. Focal photocoagulation for the treatment of diabetic macular edema in the study eye
             within 6 months of the pre-operative baseline visit (Note: peripheral retina treatment
             for retinal tear or lattice degeneration is permitted)

         14. Intravitreal anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) treatment in the study eye
             within 6 months of the pre-operative baseline visit

         15. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to NSAIDs or steroids or any component of the
             study medication.

         16. Use of a topical ophthalmic prostaglandin (e.g., TRAVATAN, XALATAN) within 4 days of
             surgery through study exit

         17. Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could require either medical or surgical intervention during the 90 day
             study period.

         18. Any concurrent ocular condition in the study eye which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could either increase the risk to the patient beyond what is to be
             expected from standard procedures of intraocular injection, or which otherwise may
             interfere with the injection procedure or with evaluation of efficacy or safety.

         19. Pregnant or breast-feeding women -
