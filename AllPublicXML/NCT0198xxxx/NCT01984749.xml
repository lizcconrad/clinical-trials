      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effect of febuxostat in preventing cerebral
      and cardiorenovascular events in elderly patients with hyperuricemia who are at risk for
      cerebral and cardiorenovascular disease.

    <description>Definition of &quot;cerebral and cardiorenovascular events&quot;:
Death due to cerebral or cardiorenovascular disease
New or recurrent cerebrovascular disease (stroke [cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke of unknown type], transient ischemic attack
New or recurrent non-fatal coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction and unstable angina pectoris)
Cardiac failure requiring hospitalization
Arteriosclerotic disease requiring hospitalization (aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, and arteriosclerosis obliterans)
Renal impairment (development of microalbuminuria, progression to overt proteinuria, or overt proteinuria [≥ 300 mg/gCr], confirmed by two consecutive laboratory tests performed after the initiation of study treatments; doubling of serum creatinine level; and progression to ESRD)
New atrial fibrillation (including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation)
Deaths that are not caused by cerebral or cardiorenovascular disease</description>

    <description>Febuxostat will be taken once daily after breakfast (generally within 30 minutes after eating) but can be taken around the time of breakfast even if no food has been eaten. When the dose is to be increased, the principal or sub-investigator will carry out any required examinations and tests as needed.
The starting dose of the investigational product (febuxostat) will be 10 mg/day.
The dose will be increased to 20 mg/day at Week 4.
The aim is to increase the dose to 40 mg/day at Week 8.</description>
