      After obtaining informed consent, concurrent with the changing of the Foley catheter in the
      clinic, would be obtaining a 30 cc. sample of urine which would also be fast frozen and
      stored in a -81 degree freezer until shipped to the Venter clinic on dry ice.

      A 30cc urine sample would also be collected, along with the used catheter. The molecular
      evaluation will be looking specifically at the biofilm accumulated on the catheter surface.
      The technologies to be used are proteomics, metabolomics and metagenomics.
