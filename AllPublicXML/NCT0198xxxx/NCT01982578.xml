  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genistein is an isoflavone that has antioxidant and neuroprotective effects on Alzheimer's
      disease (AD).

      A few years ago our group reported that genistein increased PPARg (peroxisome proliferator
      activated receptor gamma) levels. By the way, activation of retinoid X receptor (RXR)-PPARg
      dimer, will make overexpressing apolipoprotein E (apoE), which mediates the degradation of
      amyloid beta (AB). Therefore, we believe that if this phytoestrogen administration increases
      the availability of the transcription factor, it can increase apoE, and also AB degradation.

      The main aim of this study is to determinate the effect of 60 mg BID of genistein
      administration, during 180 days, compared to placebo group, in AD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease is devastating in terms of personal wellbeing as well as for society. Any
      effort to prevent and/or treat this disease is always sought after. Recently, an exciting new
      possibility was opened by modulating a cellular component called RXR-PPARG. A successful
      experimental treatment for Alzheimer's was found by activating RXR. But we previously showed
      that a component of soya, i.e., genistein, is able to activate the other part of the
      RXR-PPARG molecule, i.e., the PPARG moiety. Genistein, moreover, does not have the
      undesirable effect of bexarotene and is a food component. Our preliminary results in animals
      indicate that genistein is effective in the treatment of experimental Alzheimer's in mice.
      Epidemiological evidence shows that individuals who live in Eastern societies who have a high
      genistein intake (because they eat a lot of soya) have lower rates of Alzheimer's disease.

      Thus we propose a controlled clinical trial to test if administration of the food component
      genistein is able to prevent or cure, at least partially, Alzheimer's disease.
