    <textblock>
      Complex aortic aneurysms involving major branches have been difficult endovascularly. The
      primary purposes of this study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of
      multiple overlapping uncovered stents in treating aortic aneurysm while preserving major
      visceral branches, including the celiac artery (CA), superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and
      renal artery (RA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The traditional endovascular treatment of aneurysms is based on the utilization of
      stent-grafts that create a mechanical barrier between the aneurysmal sac and normal blood
      flow. Problems such as endoleak and occlusion of collateral arteries impede its application
      in complex aneurysms adjacent to or involving vital branches. Advanced branched/fenestrated
      endografts have been applied in many experienced centers, but the application of these
      techniques is limited in less-experienced centers due to the complicated and cumbersome
      nature of these procedures.

      The concept of using bare metal stents to occlude aneurysms was firstly described about two
      decades ago. Geremia et al suggested that a metallic stent bridging a saccular aneurysm would
      alter the local flow pattern, promoting thrombus formation, thereby leading to aneurysm
      occlusion. Optimal flow modulation effect is reached with a mean stent porosity of 65%. To
      achieve such low mesh porosity while maintaining the flexibility of the stent, the
      investigators applied multiple stents in an overlapping fashion. Computational simulation in
      this study has demonstrated that with 3 or 4 bare metal stents deployed, the mesh porosity
      could be decreased to an effective value, slowing flow velocity within the sac. The use of
      overlapping stents has been reported in the treatment of peripheral aneurysms with
      satisfactory clinical outcome.

      The primary purposes of this study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of
      multiple overlapping uncovered stents in treating aortic aneurysm while preserving major
      visceral branches, including the celiac artery (CA), superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and
      renal artery (RA).
