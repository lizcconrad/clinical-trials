  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain is a major challenge for patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) and is related to more fatigue, more physical disability, poorer quality of
      life, and poorer medical adherence. There is a need to examine strategies for managing pain
      in HSCT patients that can complement existing analgesic regimens. Strong evidence suggests
      that cognitive and behavioral factors play an important role in HSCT patients' ability to
      manage their pain. The investigator has found that HSCT patients having low levels of
      confidence (i.e., self-efficacy) in their ability to control pain and high use of maladaptive
      coping strategies (i.e., pain catastrophizing) experience increased pain and disability. A
      psychosocial intervention that modifies patients' cognitive and behavioral pain coping
      strategies may benefit HSCT patients. Protocols, particularly Pain Coping Skills Training
      (PCST), have been developed for reducing pain and improving quality of life in patients with
      persistent pain. However, HSCT patients with persistent pain face a number of unique
      challenges that must be considered when applying a PCST protocol. The investigator proposes
      to develop and test a Mobile Health Pain Coping Skills (mPCST) protocol for HSCT patients
      with persistent pain to meet the challenges of HSCT patients with pain as they transition
      from hospital based care to their home environment. The first aim of this study is to use an
      iterative development model to design a mPCST intervention protocol for HSCT patients that
      targets increasing self-efficacy for pain control and decreasing pain catastrophizing. The
      study team will use focus groups with patients and HSCT providers to guide development along
      with user testing with HSCT patients having pain. The second aim of this study is to use a
      small randomized controlled trial to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and engagement
      in the developed mPCST protocol. The third aim is to obtain an estimate of the effect size of
      the developed mPCST protocol on decreased pain, pain disability, physical disability, and
      adherence to post-transplant lifestyle recommendations impacted by pain when compared to a
      standard care control condition. Proposed innovative features of the mPCST protocol that will
      be developed include: extensive input from PCST and HSCT experts and HSCT patients with pain;
      an initial session prior to discharge with subsequent sessions occurring at home via
      video-conferencing; incorporation of strategies to decrease the impact of pain on adherence
      to critical post-transplant lifestyle recommendations; a real-time daily assessment system
      with subsequent tailored feedback. If the developed mPCST protocol demonstrates feasibility,
      acceptability, engagement, and promising effect sizes to influence pain and other indices of
      quality of life, a larger NIH grant will be sought to examine this protocol in a larger
      sample of patients, test the protocol against an active treatment, and investigate a broader
      array of outcomes (e.g., medication adherence). This mPCST protocol could also be examined in
      other patient populations with pain facing similar challenges (e.g., live far from medical
      center, travel limitations).
