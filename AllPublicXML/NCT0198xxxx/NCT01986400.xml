      Study Hypothesis: A virtual peer-to-peer support intervention will improve health outcomes
      and quality of life in adolescents with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to develop and examine the impact of a virtual peer support
      program on health outcomes and quality of life of adolescents with Juvenile Idiopathic
      Arthritis using a waitlist randomized controlled trial. In addition to standard medical care,
      adolescents in the experimental group will receive a manualized peer mentorship program that
      will provide modeling and reinforcement by trained young adults aged 16-25 years who have
      learned to function successfully with their pain. Mentoring sessions consist of 10 sessions
      of 30-45 minute Skype calls over 8 weeks. Feasibility of the program will be measured in
      addition to quality of life, physical and emotional symptoms, pain coping, self-efficacy,
      social support, and self-management skills.

    <description>In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in the experimental group will receive the VP2P support program, a manualized peer-mentorship program that will provide modeling and reinforcement by peers (young adults with JIA aged 16-25 years who have learned to function successfully with their JIA to the mentored participants).</description>

    <description>The mentorship program will encourage mentored participants to develop and engage in self-management and transition skills and support their practice of these skills. The mentors will present information to mentored participants in a monitored virtual interaction using Skype for 8 weeks (10 total Skype sessions of 30-60 minutes each) to encourage participation in skill building tailored to their needs. All mentors will complete a paid 2.5 day training course and will be supported throughout the duration of the study (consultations with research staff to deal with unforeseen concerns). Mentored participants will complete online outcome measures prior to randomization (T1) and upon study completion (T2).</description>
