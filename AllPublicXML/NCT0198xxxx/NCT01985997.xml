    <textblock>
      Children and adults will be immunized with Q/LAIV as part of routine clinical practice at
      Kaiser Permanente Northern California (NCKP) sites. Using existing data on healthcare
      utilization, rates of medically attended events (MAEs) of interest will be evaluated in all
      eligible Q/LAIV recipients who are vaccinated in the Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northern
      California Health Care Plan during the 2013-2014 influenza season. Enrollment must include a
      minimum of 10,000 children 2 through 8 years of age; based on previous utilization of FluMist
      at NCKP, enrollment is expected to include approximately 80,000 children and adults 2 to 49
      years of age.
