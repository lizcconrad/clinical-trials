  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In children with a severe form of spina bifida (which is the consequence of a spinal cord
      defect) it can happen that the bladder muscle (detrusor) contracts strongly and without
      warning (neurogenic detrusor overactivity) and that the urethra (the passage connecting the
      bladder with outside) does not relax. Those children cannot void but urine leakage can happen
      when the pressure in the bladder is so high that it overcomes the closed urethra (overflow at
      high filling bladder pressure) and/or when an overactive contraction is very strong. The high
      bladder pressure before overflow occurs puts those children at risk for kidney damage and the
      overactive contractions decrease the quality of the bladder additionally to the fact that
      they can cause leakage. Therapy is aimed to decrease the high filling bladder pressure and
      the overactive detrusor contractions.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate long term efficacy and safety of treatment with
      solifenacin succinate (the study drug) and blood levels of solifenacin succinate (the study
      drug) in children with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after multiple dose administration.
