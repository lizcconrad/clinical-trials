  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a common gynaecological condition which typically present with pelvic pain
      and fertility problems. It is caused by tissues which are similar to the lining of the womb
      growing inside the women's pelvis. Severe endometriosis is most effectively treated using
      keyhole surgery. During the operation, endometriosis tissue is removed. However, following
      successful removal of endometriosis, women may still experience pain because the ovaries
      sometimes become stuck to the bottom of the pelvis due to post-operative scarring. We want to
      see if coating one of the ovaries in an anti-scar tissue gel stops the post-operative
      scarring.

      Endometriosis is a common benign condition, affecting women of reproductive age. The disorder
      is characterized by endometrial surface epithelium, endometrial glands or stroma, found
      outside the uterus at anatomically ectopic sites.

        -  Laparoscopic excision of the disease is frequently carried out for the treatment of
           severe endometriosis. Pelvic adhesions often develop following surgery, restricting the
           success of treatment. Commercially available anti-adhesive solutions are often used
           successfully for limiting post-operative adhesions following myomectomy surgery.

        -  This study aims to assess the effect of resorbable hydrogel anti-adhesive gel following
           laparoscopic surgery for severe pelvic endometriosis on the prevalence of postoperative
           ovarian adhesions.

        -  This is a prospective double blind randomized controlled trial for patients with severe
           pelvic endometriosis (as defined by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine
           classification system) requiring extensive laparoscopic dissection (open of one or both
           para-rectal spaces) with uterine and ovarian preservation.

        -  Disease severity and eligibility for inclusion into the study will be confirmed at
           surgery.

        -  Pre-operatively, all participants will complete a standardized symptom questionnaire
           detailing the presence and intensity of specific endometriosis symptoms
           Intra-operatively both ovaries are routinely elevated to the anterior abdominal wall
           using Prolene suture (ovarian suspension) to facilitate operative access. At the end of
           the procedure, each participant will be randomized to having only one ovary coated with
           4mls of hydrogel anti-adhesive gel, before the ovaries are replaced to their
           anatomically correct position.

        -  Three months after surgery, all randomized patients will have a transvaginal ultrasound
           scan to assess for ovarian mobility and repeat symptom questionnaire.

        -  Both patients and the person performing the ultrasound scan will be blinded to the
           randomization process.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the prevalence of ovarian adhesions diagnosed by ultrasound assessment after surgery. The presence of ovarian adhesions will be assessed by a combination of gentle pressure with the vaginal probe and abdominal pressure with the examiner's free hand as in a bimanual examination. The prevalence of ovarian adhesions will be diagnosed when the ovarian mobility is restricted and the ovary cannot be separated from the peritoneum of the lateral pelvic side wall and/or pouch of Douglas.</description>

    <description>An anti-adhesive gel will be administered to one ovary (randomised at the time of laparoscopic surgery to severe endometriosis). The coated ovary will be compared to the non-coated ovary 3 months after surgery to assess for the presence of post-operative ovarian adhesions. Neither the patient nor the person performing the ultrasound scan assessing for the presence of ovarian adhesions will know which was the ovary coated in the anti-adhesive gel.</description>
