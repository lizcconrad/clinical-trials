  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carboxytherapy (CA) refers to the cutaneous and subcutaneous administration of carbon dioxide
      gas [CO2] for therapeutic purposes. Radiofrequency (RF) is a method that uses electric
      current to generate heat into the layers of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue. Both
      techniques are indicated to the treatment of skin laxity. The aim of this study was to
      compare the effects of CA an RF on human skin. Methods: Eight patients who underwent
      abdominoplasty surgery received a single procedure of both treatments. Untreated skin was
      used as control. In an area of 49 cm2 (7 x 7 cm) in the infra-umbilical region CA was
      performed on the right and RF on the left side. Sample collection period ranged from zero to
      120 days. CA was administered at a velocity of 40 ml/min, and the total quantity of CO2
      infused was approximately 20ml. RF was carried out in a temperature higher than 40ºC on the
      epidermis for 5 minutes after reaching this temperature.

      Untreated skin was used as control. In an area of 49 cm2 (7 x 7 cm) in the infra-umbilical
      region CA was performed on the right side and RF on the left side. CA was administered using
      the beveled end of a 30G ½ needle introduced in the skin in an angle of approximately 30ºC
      and delivered at a velocity of 40 mL/min. The total quantity of CO2 infused was approximately
      20 mL (0,3 to 0,6 mL/kg of patient's body weight) encompassing the whole delimited are. For
      the RF treatment, the epidermal temperature was controlled using an infrared thermometer
      monitored to reach 40ºC and treatment time was of five minutes starting after having reached
      this temperature. Sample collection varied from zero to 120 days after application. The
      samples were then fixed, cut in paraffin (5 µm) and stained with Picro sirus and Weigert.
      Morphological analyses were acquired using a Zeiss Axiophot® microscope, and they were
      processed using Adobe Photoshop®.
