      Most surgeons suggest the use of fecal diverting to address the high morbidity and mortality
      associated with anastomotic leakage (AL) in patients with high risk factors on AL who are
      undergoing anterior resections. Although debate about the use of defunctioning stoma
      continues, meta-analyses and randomized multicenter trial results support the use of
      defunctioning stoma in lower anterior resection(LAR). This exploratory study was conducted to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new diversion method called spontaneously closed
      cannula ileostomy (SCCI), which was designed to protect rectal anastomosis in patients with
      high risk factors on AL. Results of SCCI were compared to those of the loop ileostomy (LI)
      method.

      After low anterior resection(LAR), in the LI group, the operation method was done as surgeons
      all known. In the cannula ileostomy group, a double row of concentric purse-string sutures
      were placed in the ileum wall using 3-0 absorbable suture. The diameters of the purse-string
      rings were about 10 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The investigators then made a small incision
      within the inner purse-string and inserted the trachea cannula into the proximal end of the
      ileum. The inner purse-string suture then was tied, followed by the outer purse-string
      suture. The outer purse string should capsulate the inner purse string to prevent leakage.
      Normal saline was injected into the air bag until the ileum wall began to turn pale. The
      investigators then pulled the cannula out through the abdominal wall. The incision site in
      the ileum was approximated to the inner abdominal wall and extraperitonized by fixing the
      mobilized ileum wall around the cannula to the inner abdominal wall. This was accomplished
      using 3-4 interrupted sutures.

      In the LI group, patients accepted reversal operation at least 3 months after operation if
      operation condition permission.

      In the cannula ileostomy group, the cannula will be removed after 3-4 weeks. If anastomotic
      leakage occurred, The investigators will keep the cannula until the anastomotic leakage was
      cured.

    <description>Anastomotic leakage(AL) is the main complication after LAR.AL is defined as a defect of intestinal wall integrity at the colorectal or coloanal anastomotic site (including suture and staple lines of the neorectal reservoirs) leading to communication between intra- and extraluminal compartments. When AL occurred, whether this patient need reoperation is determined by the clinical manifestation. Reoperation rate and mortality are two key index to evaluate the effect and safety of cannula ileostomy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ileus rate</measure>
    <time_frame>during the follow time(about 6 months after operaion)</time_frame>
    <description>Another main operation complication was intestinal obstruction. Ileus conclude two types: temporally ileus and intractable ileus. Temporally ileus can be treated by conservative treatment and intractable ileus need reoperation.Ileus usually is caused by intestinal adhesion. But in cannula ileostomy group, ileus maybe caused by the cannula obstruction.</description>

    <description>In loop ileostomy group, hospital stays and costs include the readmission to close the stoma.</description>
