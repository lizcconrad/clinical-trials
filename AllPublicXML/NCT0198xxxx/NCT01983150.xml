      The principle study purpose of the randomized controlled trial is to determine the
      effectiveness of a smartphone delivered app for young adult smokers on smoking cessation at
      six months using a randomized controlled trial. Secondary aims of this study include
      examining: 1) proximal outcome measures of cessation behaviour; 2) satisfaction, extent of
      app use and use of NRT and other cessation services; 3) mediators of cessation outcomes
      between conditions; and 4) the incremental cost-effectiveness.

    <description>Crush the Crave (CTC) intervention group will receive a quit smoking smartphone intervention via the internet that is based on scientific findings related to tobacco use among young adults. It is a multi-component intervention informed by evidence on quitting smoking. The app was developed with the input of key experts in the field of smoking cessation, was assessed against Fiore's practice guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence, and was tested with eight focus groups of male and female young adult smokers (n=57) on functionality, look and feel and usability, as well as being piloted by over 300 smokers.</description>

    <intervention_name>Crush the Crave Application</intervention_name>
    <description>Crush the Crave (CTC) allows users to customize a quit plan by choosing a quit date and then deciding whether to quit now or cut down the number of cigarettes they smoke every week up to the quit date. CTC reminds users of money saved and health improvements. Based on contingency reinforcement, rewards are provided, which smokers can then choose to share with their social network via Facebook. Supportive text messages tailored to their specific quit plan and where they are in the quitting experience are provided. CTC allows tracking of daily smoking habits and cravings as well as craving triggers or psychosocial determinants by recording when, where and why smoking occurred. Online distractions to help smokers deal with cravings are provided.</description>
