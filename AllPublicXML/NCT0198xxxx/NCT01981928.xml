  <brief_title>A Clinical Trial to Investigate Safety and Tolerability of ASP7962 in Healthy Humans</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Phase 1, Randomized, Subject- and Investigator-blinded, Sponsor-unblinded, Placebo-controlled, Parallel Group Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of Single Ascending Oral Doses of ASP7962, Including a Food-effect Evaluation in Healthy Subjects</official_title>

      The purpose of the study is to see how safe the study drug is and how well it is tolerated
      after dosing. The study will also investigate how the study drug is taken up, metabolized
      (chemically broken down), distributed through the body and excreted. A further aim is to look
      at how this process is possibly altered by food by giving the study drug in the presence and
      absence of meals.

             within 7 days prior to admission to the clinical unit on day -1.

          -  Subject participated in any interventional clinical study or has been treated with any
             investigational drugs within 90 days or 5 half-lives whichever is longer, prior to the
             initiation of screening
