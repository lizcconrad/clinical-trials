        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Parent / guardian must be able to give written informed consent prior to participation
             in the study, which includes ability to comply with the requirements and restrictions
             listed in the consent form. Informed consent must be obtained prior to undertaking any
             study procedures.

          2. Assent should be obtained from all children in the study where appropriate.

          3. Male or female subject aged between 1 - 17 years inclusive at screening.

          4. The parent / guardian, or where appropriate the child must be able to read,
             comprehend, and write at a sufficient level to complete study related materials.

          5. Subjects will be allowed to enrol in other studies while taking part on this study.
             However, Permission from the Scientific Board must be obtained to enrol or allow the
             continued participation of a subject enrolled in another study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. As a result of medical interview, physical examination or screening investigation the
             physician responsible considers the child unfit for the study.

          2. The subject has a history of drug or other allergy, which, in the opinion of the
             responsable physician, contra-indicates their participation.

          3. Subject is female who is pregnant or lactating or up to 6 weeks post partum or 6 weeks
             cessation of breast feeding. If a woman is subsequently found to have been pregnant at
             the time of an assessment data from that assessment will not be included in the
             analyses

          4. The child has participated within 3 months of the first dose in a study using a new
             molecular entity, or the first dose in any other study investigating drugs or having
             participated within three months in a study with invasive procedures. Any U-BIOPRED
             assessments should be deferred until 3 months after the first dose or invasive
             procedure. Permission from the Scientific Board must be obtained to enroll or allow
             the continued participation of a child enrolled in another study.

          5. Those who, in the opinion of the investigator, have a risk of non-compliance with
             study procedures.

          6. Prematurity â‰¤35 weeks gestation

          7. The child had changed asthma medication within 4 weeks of the screening
             assessment(except those using the Symbicort maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART)
             regime)(assessment should be deferred)

          8. History or current evidence of an upper or lower respiratory infection or symptoms
             (including common cold) within 2 weeks of baseline assessment (assessment should be
             deferred).

          9. The child has had a severe exacerbation (requiring ER attendance or hospital admission
             and/or a course of high dose OCS for at least 3 days duration) within 4 weeks of the
             baseline assessment (assessment should be deferred).
