  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      APD356-A001-402 is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group pilot study of
      12-week duration in overweight and obese adults. Approximately 225 subjects will be
      randomized to one of three treatment arms in a ratio 1:1:1 and will receive the combinations
      of lorcaserin 10 mg twice daily (BID) plus immediate-release phentermine-HCl 15 mg BID or 15
      mg once daily (QD), or lorcaserin alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will take lorcaserin and phentermine-HCl/placebo once in the morning and again
      in the mid-afternoon. The dosing is timed to help reduce potential insomnia due to
      phentermine. Subjects in Arm A will take one tablet twice daily of lorcaserin 10 mg in
      combination with one capsule twice daily of phentermine placebo. Subjects in Arm B will take
      one tablet twice daily of lorcaserin 10 mg, one capsule of phentermine-HCl 15 mg once daily
      in the morning, and one capsule of phentermine placebo once daily in the mid-afternoon.
      Subjects in Arm C will take one tablet twice daily of lorcaserin 10 mg in combination with
      one capsule twice daily of phentermine-HCl 15 mg. Subjects will be instructed to take
      lorcaserin tablets and phentermine/placebo capsules concurrently and attempt to remain on a
      consistent daily schedule. The study will recruit obese (body mass index [BMI] greater than
      or equal to 30 kg/m2) subjects with or without a weight-related comorbid condition (e.g.,
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, or sleep apnea) or overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 27 to
      29.9 kg/m2) subjects with at least one weight-related co-morbid condition. At least one third
      of the subjects will have a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater, because there is a high likelihood
      that this combination therapy will be used by these subjects in medical practice.

      A lifestyle intervention program, using a 12-week adaptation of the Arena Healthy Lifestyles
      Program, including diet and exercise counseling, will be implemented for obesity/overweight.

      Blood sampling will be performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of lorcaserin and
      phentermine using population PK modeling as well as the potential relationships between
      exposure to the lorcaserin/phentermine and measures of safety and change from baseline in
      body weight, using population PK/PD (pharmacodynamics) modeling.

          1. Recent treatment (within 14 days of the Screening Visit and any time prior to
             randomization) with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAOIs have been associated
             with a risk of hypertensive crisis when used with phentermine.

          2. Active or recent history (within 1 month prior to the Screening Visit) of major
             depression or other major psychiatric disease requiring treatment (i.e., within 1
             month of the Screening Visit and any time prior to randomization or thereafter during
             the study) with prescription medication (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics,
             antipsychotics, lithium, Wellbutrin).

          3. Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine

             moderate or severe intensity).

         14. History of or active (confirmed fasting glucose greater than 126 mg/dL or hemoglobin
             A1c [HbA1c] greater than ULN [6.5% at central laboratory]) diabetes mellitus (type I,

         16. Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) laboratory value greater than 1.5 x Upper
             Limit of Normal (ULN)

         17. Hyperthyroidism, including abnormal screening laboratory values with T3 greater than
             ULN and TSH less than Lower Limit of Normal (LLN), and subjects taking methimazole or
             propylthiouracil (PTU) and/or beta-blockers for hyperthyroidism.

         18. Recent history (within 2 years prior to the Screening Visit) of alcohol or
             drug/solvent abuse or a positive screen for drugs of abuse at screening.

         19. Significant change is smoking habits or tobacco product use within 3 months prior to
             the Screening Visit.

         20. Use of tobacco products (i.e., smokes more than one-half pack of cigarettes per day,
             or smokes more than 2 cigars per day, or uses 3 or more pinches of smokeless tobacco
             per day).

         21. Surgical procedure for the treatment of obesity (i.e., gastric bypass, gastric
             banding), even if reversed prior to screening.

         22. Planned surgery during the study period that may interfere with completion or
             compliance with the protocol.

         23. A prolonged QT/QTc interval (QTc Bazett's greater than 450 msec) as demonstrated by a
             repeated electrocardiogram (ECG).

         24. Participation in any clinical study with an investigational drug, biologic, or device
             within 1 month prior to screening.

         25. Significant change in diet or level of physical activity within 1 month prior to
             dosing that in the opinion of the investigator(s) may confound the results of the
             study.

         26. Change in weight of greater than 5 kg within 3 months of screening.

         27. Use of a very-low calorie (less than 800/day) liquid weight loss diet within 6 months

             a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 IU/L or
             equivalent units of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG]). A separate baseline
             assessment is required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than
             72 hours before the first dose of study drug.

         30. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all
             with surgery at least one month before dosing).

         31. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse
             within 30 days before study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method
             [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral
             contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout
             the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently
             abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double barrier method as described above if
             she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a
             stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before
             dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation. Females not meeting these criteria will be
             excluded from the study.

         32. Any medical or other condition that in the opinion of the investigator(s) would
             preclude the subject's participation in a clinical study, such as significantly
             abnormal laboratory results or any physical or mental condition that prevents
             compliance with the protocol.
