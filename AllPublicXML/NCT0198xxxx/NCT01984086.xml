  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two part, six period- cross over, randomised, single dose, single
      centre study in healthy subjects. This is the first clinical study for the UD-DPI. This study
      is divided into two parts. Part A will ascertain whether the pharmacokinetic (PK) of
      salbutamol delivered via the UD-DPI is comparable to the salbutamol delivered via the Diskus
      or MDI. For this reason four treatment doses consisting of three dose strength and two
      percentage blends will be assessed in Part A delivered via UD-DPI. Part A will also provide
      preliminary PK variability estimates to allow for better sample size/precision calculations
      for Part B. Part B will explore whether the UD-DPI has a pharmacokinetic exposure profile
      that is comparable to either Diskus or MDI in the presence of the charcoal block.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Male/females aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Body weight &gt;=50 kg and body mass index within the range 19.0 - 34.0 kilogram per
             square meter (inclusive).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for
             this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40
             milli-international units per milliliter (MlU/mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms per
             milliliter (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole per liter) is confirmatory. Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the contraception methods in listed in protocol if they wish to continue
             their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation
             of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least
             2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
             post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
             contraceptive method; Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as
             determined by serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or urine hCG
             prior to dosing AND; Agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol
             for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or investigator)
             prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that
             point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until follow-up; OR has only
             same-sex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s)
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator agree and document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal
             (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and
             direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Based on single or averaged corrected QT interval (QTc) values of triplicate ECGs
             obtained over a brief recording period: QTcF &lt;450 milliseconds.

          -  Current non-smokers who have not used any tobacco- containing products within 3 months
             of screening and with a total pack year history of &lt;=10 pack years [number of pack
             years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years smoked].

          -  Able to use all medical device products included in the study adequately after
             training

             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof
             (including milk protein allergy) or a history of drug or other allergy that, in the

             investigational product (whichever is longer).
