    <textblock>
      Effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy is between gastric banding and gastric bypass. However, a
      proportion of patients that undergo surgery, report troublesome and persistent dysphagia,
      pain, new onset or worsening of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) requiring treatment. Improved
      results for sleeve gastrectomy could be possible if more was known about the surgical /
      mechanical factors that affect outcome. Current investigations based on traditional
      intra-luminal imaging (endoscopy) and radiology (UGI series) may not provide adequate
      preoperative assessment of esophago-gastric dynamics. Current practice in the creation of a
      sleeve gastrectomy involves the use of a bougie or endoscope around which the sleeve is
      stapled. There is no consensus on the diameter of this bougie and this intraoperative
      calibration may alter the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) anatomy, does not provide real
      time physiology feedback, and allows only for a rough approximation of the size of the sleeve
      providing no information about the distensibility and pressure gradient of the newly created
      gastric tube as it is filled. A more distensible sleeve will have lower intra-gastric
      pressure, and thus will theoretically be expected to reduce the incidence of side effects. As
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is performed with increasing frequency, there is a need for
      development of tools to assist the surgeon in modeling properly and standardize the
      gastroplasty. This study will be based on a strict assessment of the anatomical and
      functional characteristics of the &quot;ideal &quot;gastric sleeve, using existing imaging modalities
      (endoscopy - CT scan- MRI - HRM).
