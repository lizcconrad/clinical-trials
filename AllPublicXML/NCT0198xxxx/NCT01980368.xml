    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well Tai Chi Easy works in treating cancer survivors
      with peripheral sensory neuropathy. Tai Chi Easy is a simple and repetitive form of exercise
      that consists of movements with meditation and may improve peripheral neuropathy symptoms
      among cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine effects of Tai Chi Easy (TCEasy) exercise intervention on peripheral sensory
      neuropathy of cancer survivors who have chemotherapy compared with an educational control
      (EC) intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (TAI CHI EASY): Patients attend Tai Chi Easy class for 60 minutes once a week for 6
      weeks. Patients also receive a DVD and exercise manual of Tai Chi Easy exercises and are
      encouraged to practice at home for 30 minutes most days per week for 6 weeks.

      GROUP II (EDUCATIONAL CONTROL): Patients receive readings each week and attend a book club to
      discuss the readings for 60 minutes once a week for 6 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 months.
