      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of a subset of the length-109 probe set
      panel (a genetic test) in predicting response to golimumab treatment in participants with
      moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, golimumab, belongs to a group of medicines known as tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) inhibitors and is approved in the United States, European Union, and Canada for
      treatment of UC. Studies have shown that people respond differently to treatment with TNF
      inhibitors and furthermore, some people may not actually respond to treatment. Tests which
      could predict the likelihood of response to golimumab prior to treatment would be of benefit
      to people with UC. This is an open label (physicians and participants know the identity of
      the assigned treatment), multicenter study to evaluate the accuracy of a genetic test (a
      subset of the length-109 probe set panel) in predicting response to golimumab treatment in
      patients with moderately to severely active UC. The study will consist of a screening phase,
      an open label treatment phase (Week 0 to Week 50), and a follow-up visit at Week 58. A subset
      of the length-109 probe set panel will be tested on samples obtained from colonic biopsies
      taken prior to treatment with golimumab for all participants at screening. All participants
      enrolled in the study will receive subcutaneous golimumab from Week 0 to Week 50; at the
      discretion of the investigator, participants will be given the option to self-administer
      golimumab from Week 6 onwards. Blood and fecal samples will be taken at various time points
      during the study; colonic biopsies will be taken at screening, Week 6, and Week 30; and
      endoscopies will be performed at Week 0, Week 6, and Week 30. The study duration for each
      participant is expected to be approximately 58 weeks. Participant safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <description>The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve is a mathematical model used to measure the accuracy of a test. The accuracy of a subset of the length-109 probe set panel (a genetic test administered at screening) is being evaluated in terms of its ability to predict mucosal healing at Week 6. An area of 1.0 represents a perfect test; an area of 0.5 represents a test that is no better at predicting mucosal healing than &quot;flipping a coin&quot;. Areas above 0.5 represent increasing accuracy.</description>
