    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT), to
      determine if six month supplementation of olive oil can improve the health of the blood
      vessels and improve long term health of the heart and blood vessels, in patients requiring
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
