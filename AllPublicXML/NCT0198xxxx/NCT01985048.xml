      1. Primary Objectives:

             -  To characterize cardiometabolic risk factor profiles of patients entering cardiac
                rehab using traditional approaches (eg LDL-C) as well as a more comprehensive panel
                of cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers. It is hypothesized that the
                comprehensive panel will identify further increased risk that would not have been
                detected using only traditional approaches. Specifically, it is hypothesized that a
                greater percentage of the cohort will be identified with &quot;high risk&quot; levels of
                LDL-P (&gt;1100 nmol/L) and/or apoB (&gt;80 mg/dL) than of LDL-C (&gt;100 mg/dL). It is
                further hypothesized that the prevalence of elevated Lp(a) and elevated levels of
                inflammatory and insulin resistance markers will be higher in this cohort when
                compared to population norms (HDL, inc reference data).

             -  To assess improvements in laboratory and lifestyle risk factors and rate of goal
                attainment at completion of rehab (eg 3 months). This objective is primarily
                descriptive, and improvements in traditional risk factors (eg LDL-C) will be
                compared to existing published data. Improvements in non-traditional risk factors
                (eg LDL-P, insulin resistance markers) in a cardiac rehab population have not been
                extensively investigated.

             -  To determine which attributes at baseline best predicted recurrent events and
                re-hospitalizations assessed one year later.

        2. Secondary/Developmental Objective:

             -  To inform and guide development of a subsequent study protocol designed to compare
                outcomes associated with biomarker-guided personalized treatment plans vs. standard
                of care in the cardiac rehab setting.

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will characterize risk factors of patients as they enter cardiac rehab,
      track how comprehensive biomarker profiles change during the normal course of rehab, and
      associate biomarkers at baseline with MACE outcomes assessed one year later. Blood draws,
      vitals, and patient medical histories will be collected as subjects enter rehab and at the
      end of the rehab program. Major adverse cardiac events will be assessed via phone interview
      at 12 months.
