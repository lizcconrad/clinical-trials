  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioral rhytides present a difficult problem in facial rejuvenation. They cannot be
      addressed with rhytidectomy (face lift) and direct excision can leave visible unfavorable
      scars. Currently, fine static wrinkles are most effectively treated with facial resurfacing,
      usually with laser treatment. Often the peri-oral area is treated with additional spot
      treatments with an ablative laser to cause a more robust healing response and better aesthtic
      result. To date, no studies have specifically shown efficacy of additional spot treatment
      over full facial laser alone.

      This study is designed as a split-face study, to compare the aesthetic results of full field
      laser resurfacing on one half of the face with that of spot treatment of perioral rhytides on
      the other half.

      To clarify further to the IRB board, this is not an experimental treatment. Spot treatment is
      used by many surgeons/laser proceduralists for addressing specific areas of the face. This is
      an FDA indicated use of the laser for facial resurfacing. Due to the many genetic and
      enviromental factors that can effect the results the best design for the study to is have
      each patient serve as their own control with a split-face study.

      Cohort Study, with Split Face treatment

      Methods:

      Patients will be evaluated in the office for possible inclusion. Those who agree to partipate
      will receive preoperative photos.

      On the day of the procedure patients will have a topical anesthestic applied for 30 minutes,
      then patients will recieve a 20um laser resurfacing of the entire face to remove dead skin
      and debris. After that, patients will have reapplication of a topical anesthetic for an
      additional 10 minutes. They will then undergo a 50 um peel to one side of the face and a
      patient tailored spot treatment of perioral wrinkles to the other side of the face. The depth
      of this may vary from 100 to 400um.

      Patients will return to clinic at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks post-procedure and fill out a
      short survey and have medical photography done. Patients will return at 3 and 6 month
      follow-up for additional photography and surveys. These visits will typically take 10 to 20
      minutes.

      Preoperative and post-operative photos will be analyzed by 2 independent plastic surgeons for
      post-operative changes and improvements.
