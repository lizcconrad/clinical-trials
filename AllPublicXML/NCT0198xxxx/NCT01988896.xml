    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib, open-label, multicenter study designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of coadministration of intravenous (IV) dosing of
      atezolizumab (an engineered anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [anti-PD-L1] antibody) and oral
      dosing of cobimetinib in participants with metastatic or locally advanced cancer for which no
      standard therapy exists.
