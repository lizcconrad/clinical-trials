      Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of dental biofilm removal by
      brushing with and without conventional toothpaste. Settings and Design: Twenty-four students
      aged 17 to 28 years old participated in this randomized clinical trial.

      Materials and Methods: Quadrants 1-3 or 2-4 were randomly allocated to the test group
      (brushing without dentifrice) or control group (brushing with dentifrice). After 72 hours of
      cessation of oral hygiene, Quigley &amp; Hein (Turesky) plaque index was assessed before and
      after brushing by a calibrated and blind examiner. Overtime and intergroup comparisons were
      performed by paired sample t test.

    <description>The participants were instructed to interrupt any chemical and/or mechanical oral hygiene procedure for 72 hours. Dental plaque was stained by a 2% erithrosin solution, followed by a mouth rinsing with water for 1 minute. Next, the set of dental quadrants (1-3 and 2-4) were randomly allocated to experimental groups by the flip of a coin. One of the sets was brushed with multi bristle brush without the use of dentifrice and the second set was brushed with multi bristle brush using dentifrice. Toothbrushing was performed by the individual's regular technique timed. Two minutes was used for each set. After toothbrushing, the dental biofilm was again stained and evaluated by the same examiner, who was blind to the quadrants brushed with or without dentifrice.</description>
