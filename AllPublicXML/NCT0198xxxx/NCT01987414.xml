  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a forearm rotation orthosis combined
      with the occupational therapy task-oriented approach on functional performance for persons
      with a hemiparetic arm.

      Hypotheses of this study are:

        1. participants who wear the forearm rotation orthosis will demonstrate significantly
           greater improvement in functional performance and active range of motion of forearm
           rotators compared to those who do not;

        2. all participants who receive the occupational therapy task-oriented approach
           intervention will demonstrate significant improvement in functional performance; and

        3. all participants who receive the occupational therapy task-oriented approach
           intervention will demonstrate improvement in motor function of the upper extremity.

    <textblock>
      Persons with central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction often have difficulty incorporating
      their affected limb effectively and efficiently into functional tasks due to muscle weakness
      and/or spasticity. This may further interfere with their performance of everyday activities
      and restrict life roles. Traditional rehabilitation interventions emphasize spasticity
      reduction. However, active movement and muscle strength of forearm supination are found
      strongly related to motor function, rather than spasticity. In contrast, task-oriented
      movement training trials have demonstrated promising evidence that persons with CNS
      dysfunction benefit from the training in improvement of motor function and increase
      functional use of the affected limb.

      Orthotic intervention is one therapeutic option for this population. Most orthotic designs
      for this population are static, developed for sympton reduction or deformity prevention, and
      aimed at the wrist and hand. However, its effects on spasticity reduction remain
      controversial. Given that static orthotics may interfere with functional performance and
      further develop the learned nonuse of the affected limb, a dynamic or mobilization orthosis
      would be appropriate for enhancing functional performance. Moreover, an orthosis that assists
      forearm rotation is speculated to enhance functional performance. This study will examine the
      efficacy of a forearm rotation orthosis combined with the occupational therapy task-oriented
      approach on functional performance for persons with a hemiparetic arm.
