    <textblock>
      This research study is exploring how the blood vessels in the participant's tumor change from
      treatment with bevacizumab, and how these changes affect the way their tumor absorbs
      temozolomide (TMZ).

      The pilot part of this study is to evaluate the use of [11C] temozolomide PET (TMZ-PET) scans
      and MRI scans to tell investigators more about how standard treatment with bevacizumab
      affects the blood vessels in the participant's tumor, and how these changes affect the way
      the participant's tumor absorbs temozolomide. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the role of
      TMZ-PET scans is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more
      about it.

      Bevacizumab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in people with the
      participant's type of cancer. It works by blocking signals on a specific protein called
      vascular endothelial growth hormone (VEGF), which plays a role in promoting the growth of
      spread of tumor blood vessels. Bevacizumab is an &quot;anti-VEGF' agent because it is designed to
      slow the growth of the participant's cancer.

      Since anti-VEGF agents also affect normal blood vessels in the brain, they can inhibit the
      way other drugs used in combination with bevacizumab are delivered to the tumor. Researchers
      are looking for how bevacizumab affects delivery of chemotherapy, in this case temozolomide.

      In PET scans, a radioactive substance is injected into the body. The scanning machine finds
      the radioactive substance, which tends to go to cancer cells.

      For the PET scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance
      called [11C] temozolomide, which is chemically identical to the prescription drug TMZ. TMZ is
      FDA approved as a chemotherapeutic agent in cancer but [11C] temozolomide is an
      investigational agent.

      In this research study, participants will receive standard treatment with bevacizumab and
      oral temozolomide as well as standard MRI scans. In addition, participants will undergo
      TMZ-PET scans before and after treatment with bevacizumab. The first TMZ-PET scan will occur
      7-13 days after starting treatment with oral temozolomide but before beginning treatment with
      bevacizumab, day 1 after starting treatment with bevacizumab and 1 month after starting
      bevacizumab. TMZ-PET scans will be given at the same time as a vascular MRI, which will
      evaluate the changes in tumor blood flow, blood volume, and how receptive blood vessels are
      while also measuring how much TMZ is in the brain.

      Before the research starts (screening): After signing the consent form, the participant will
      be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if they can be in the
      research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer
      care and may be done even if it turns out that the participant does not take part in the
      research study. If the participant has had some of these tests or procedures recently, they
      may or may not have to be repeated.

        -  A medical history, which includes questions about the participant's health, current
           medications, and any allergies.

        -  Physical Exam including measuring the participant's height, weight, and vital signs

        -  Performance status, which evaluates how the participant is able to carry on with your
           usual activities.

        -  Blood tests.

        -  Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

        -  Urine test.

      If these tests show that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study,
      the participant will begin the study treatment. If the participant does not meet the
      eligibility criteria, the participant will not be able to participate in this research study.

      After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate in the
      research study:

      Please note that this study does not add any additional treatment to participants with your
      type of cancer. There will be no change in your treatment with bevacizumab and daily
      temozolomide based on the results of any procedures or tests carried out as a part of the
      study.

      Before each set of scans the participant will have the following tests and procedures:

        -  Routine blood tests to check the participant's overall health

        -  Creatinine clearance blood test to check for proper kidney function

        -  Blood pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

      After the participant have been taking oral TMZ for 7-13 days, the participant will have:

      - An assessment of their tumor by DCE-MRI (Dynamic Contrast Enhanced-Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging) scans and PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan

      MRI-PET Scan Procedure:

      The participant will have their scans performed in Charlestown, MA at the Martinos Center.
      The participant will be injected with two separate intravenous (IV) lines for:

        -  [11C] temozolomide for PET scan and a contrast dye for the MRI scan

        -  Drawing blood to assess the radioactivity of [11C] temozolomide [11C] temozolomide PET
           Scans (TMZ PET Scan):

        -  The PET scan will take approximately 90 minutes. The participant will receive one
           injection of [11C] temozolomide. Following the injection of the radioactive substance,
           blood samples will be taken from the second IV line.

      MRI Scan:

      - MRI scans will last about 60-75 minutes. This will occur at the same time as the PET scan.
      The participant will be injected with contrast dye twice during the MRI scan.

      The MR-PET scan(s) will be performed again on Day 1 after initiation of bevacizumab (or Day
      15 after initiation of temozolomide) and Day 30 after initiation of bevacizumab (on Day 45
      after initiation of temozolomide).

      Blood samples will be collected during both scans in order to measure how your blood vessels
      are processing the radiotracer [11C] temozolomide and how well it is being delivered to the
      tumor tissue. Blood samples will be drawn 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 75, and 90 minutes after
      the [11C] temozolomide injection.

      The participant will be assessed for side effects via clinic visit or phone call about 24
      hours after each of the visits above.

      - Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to call the participant every 3 months for
      three years after their second MR-PET scan to see how they are doing and if the participant
      is experiencing any side effects. If the participant was removed from the study due to an
      unacceptable side effect, the participant will be followed until it has been resolved.

    <description>The investigators plan to study patients with recurrent glioblastoma whose clinical care plan includes treatment with bevacizumab and temozolomide. Patients taking daily temozolomide 50 mg/m2/day will undergo a PET scan using radiolabeled temozolomide (TMZ-PET) at 3 time points: 7-13 days after initiation of temozolomide but before beginning bevacizumab (&quot;baseline&quot;- temozolomide steady-state scan), 1 day after initiation of bevacizumab (day 15) and 1 month after initiation of bevacizumab (day 45). Arterialized venous blood samples will be collected during the imaging in order to measure radioactivity, blood metabolites, and the relationship between radiotracer uptake and tumor features such as blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and tumor blood flow.
In addition, we will explore the link between flow, permeability, and tumor temozolomide retention. These studies will be performed using our human simultaneous MRI-PET imaging camera.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible
             to participate in the study:

          -  Participants must have histologically confirmed glioblastoma and evidence of
             recurrence &gt; 2 months since last cycle of temozolomide. Patients with low-grade tumors
             who have progressed to glioblastoma are eligible.

          -  Patients must have received at least 6 months of monthly temozolomide previously.

          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;
             10 mm. See section 10 for the evaluation of measureable disease.

          -  Only patients for whom their neuro-oncologist has planned to give bevacizumab and
             temozolomide 50mg/m2/day as part of their treatment are eligible for this study

          -  Age &gt; 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the
             use of radiolabeled temozolomide in participants &lt;18 years of age, children are
             excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 (see Appendix A).

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Leukocytes &gt; 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mcL

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL

          -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73
             m2 for subjects with creatinine levels about institutional normal .

          -  Patient must be able to undergo MRI and PET scans.

          -  Patients must be maintained on a stable corticosteroid regimen for 5 days prior each
             MR-PET scan.

          -  The effects of radiolabeled temozolomide on the developing human fetus are unknown.
             For this reason and because radiopharmaceuticals agents are known to be teratogenic,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be
             eligible for admission into the study.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to temozolomide.

          -  Participants who have already received anti-VEGF or experimental anti-angiogenic
             therapy for glioblastoma.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiolabeled temozolomide is a
             radiopharmaceutical agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with radiopharmaceutical agents, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with radiopharmaceutical agents. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with radiolabeled temozolomide. In
             addition, these individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients who are no suitable to undergo MRI or use gadolinium contrast due to:

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  Presence of metallic objects or implanted medical devices in body (i.e. cardiac
             pacemaker, aneurysm clips, surgical clips, prostheses, artificial hearts, valves with
             steel parts, metal fragments, shrapnel, tattoos near the eye, or steel implants)

          -  Sickle cell disease

          -  Renal failure

          -  Reduced renal function, as determined by creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min based on a
             serum creatinine level obtained within 28 days prior to registration
