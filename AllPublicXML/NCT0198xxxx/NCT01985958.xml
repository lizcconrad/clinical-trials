      Primary Objective: To estimate the rate at which radiotherapy to the primary or a metastatic
      lesion produces an immune response in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the pancreas.

      Secondary Objectives: To characterize the kinetics of an immune response induced by
      radiotherapy. To characterize the dependency of the immune response on prior exposure to
      chemotherapy.
