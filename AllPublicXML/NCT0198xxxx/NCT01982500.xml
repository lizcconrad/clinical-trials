      Investigators propose to assess,the safety and tolerability profile (number of participants
      with adverse events) of bevacizumab (Avastin) when added to chemotherapy as front-line
      treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal
      carcinoma

    <textblock>
      In the last decade, clinical studies with bevacizumab (Avastin) in various tumors have shown
      encouraging results in terms of efficacy/safety. However there is no data generated in Greek
      population with regards to safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in front line Ovarian Cancer.
      Two prior global phase III randomized trials showed that the addition of concurrent
      bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy and maintenance bevacizumab significantly increased the
      PFS in patients with advanced ovarian cancer It would be relevant to document the real life
      clinical data of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy (paclitaxel/carboplatin) in
      Front Line Ovarian Cancer as prescribed by the medical oncologists in Greece.
