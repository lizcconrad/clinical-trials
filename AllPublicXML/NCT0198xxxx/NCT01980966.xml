  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of MHAA4549A in healthy volunteers in an influenza challenge model. Subjects will be
      intranasally oculated with the challenge virus and will be randomly assigned to receive a
      intravenous dose of either MHAA4549A or placebo. In the stage 5 cohort, subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive doses of MHAA4549A or placebo or Tamiflu (oseltamivir) orally
      twice daily for 5 days. All subjects in all cohorts may take Tamiflu twice daily from Day 7
      to Day 11.
