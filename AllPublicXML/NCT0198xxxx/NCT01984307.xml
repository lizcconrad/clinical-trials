  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To characterize and estimate the size of different populations with a history of acute
      coronary syndrome in Sweden. To assess the burden of illness (co-morbidities, mortality rates
      healthcare resource utilization and atherothrombotic events) among patients with a history of
      myocardial infarction (MI) 1-3 years ago and additional risk factors for atherothrombosis.

    <time_frame>Follow up period 1-7 years</time_frame>
    <description>1. Assess rate of other CVD events (including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, angina pectoris) 2. Assess prevalence and rate of (major) organ specific bleedings (recorded diagnose in hospital) 3. Describe patients/proportions of patients with increased bleeding risk (history of previous bleedings, age, anti-thrombotic treatment etc) 4. Assess the prevalence of major co-morbidities in this population: (e.g. bradycardia, insertion of pacemaker, acute liver and renal failure) 5. To describe the death rate for the most common cause of deaths in the study population relative to the standardized death rate in the Swedish population and calculate the standardised mortality ratio</description>
