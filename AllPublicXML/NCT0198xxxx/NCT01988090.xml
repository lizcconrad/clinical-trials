  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the difference, if there is a difference between two
      different doses of Vitamin D and the reduction of joint/muscle pain (arthralgia)that is
      caused by taking anti-estrogen medications (aromatase inhibitors) by breast cancer patients.
      The investigators hope to learn if taking a higher dose of Vitamin D is a good way to prevent
      aromatase inhibitor arthralgia (AIA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatments with anti-estrogen agents for hormone receptor positive breast cancer is the most
      efficacious of systemic therapies, with aromatase inhibitors (AI's) being considered the most
      active anti-estrogen therapy in early stage breast cancer. But, use of these treatments has
      been shown to cause musculoskeletal (joint/muscle) side effects that sometimes cause patients
      to discontinue the use of them. Also, Vitamin D deficiency is a well know cause of a wide
      array of musculoskeletal issues. There is evidence that Vitamin D supplementation may help
      prevent arthralgia while on AI's. Therefore, the investigators want to see if giving a higher
      dose of Vitamin D could decrease the incidence of AIA as compared to a standard dose of
      Vitamin D. The investigators believe that this could possibly result in patients continued
      treatment with AI therapy for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

    <description>The primary endpoint for this study is development of Aromatase Inhibitor Arthralgia (AIA) in each arm after 12 weeks of AI therapy. We will measure this by using patient questionnaires that describe the level of AIA pain experienced by the participant. We will also measure the grip strength of the patients enrolled.
At five years, we will compare breast cancer recurrence rates in each arm to see if there is a difference between those patients that had less pain and stayed on their aromatase inhibitor therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compliance with Anti-Cancer Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>52 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will check compliance of aromatase inhibitor therapy during the study by reviewing the patient's use of AI drug. This will be done by counting remaining pills in patient's bottles of AI at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks. Compliance rate over 52 weeks of AI therapy will be compared between the two arms using longitudinal data analysis.
We will test the participant's blood to see if there is an association between low baseline vitamin D levels and AIA (aromatase inhibitor arthralgia / pain).</description>

             laboratory's normal parameters

          -  History of either symptomatic hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism, at the treating
             investigator's discretion

          -  Baseline Vitamin D level greater than 50 ng/mL

        the trial. Also, patients who are taking phenytoin or phenobarbital are not allowed on the
        trial either because of interaction between Vitamin D and anti-epileptic medications.
