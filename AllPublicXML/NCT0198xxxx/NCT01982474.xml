    <textblock>
      Specific immunotherapy (SIT) has been used in the treatment of allergic disease for over one
      hundred years. SIT for environmental allergies consists of allergen extracts that have been
      traditionally administered by subcutaneous or sublingual routes to both children and adults.
      In the United States, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is currently the only FDA-approved
      route of administration for allergenic extracts. In recent years, a novel method of
      administering allergen immunotherapy, intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT), has been
      developed, which has shown to be safer, more efficacious, and less painful than traditional
      SCIT. ILIT can dramatically decrease treatment time from 3 - 5 years to 8 weeks. It has only
      been studied in European adults. The aim of this project is to study efficacy and safety of
      intralymphatic immunotherapy in adolescents and young adults with allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis, using currently available allergen extracts. Patients with clinical
      history suspicious for rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis, correlating with positive
      allergy skin and/or blood tests to grass pollen, will be randomized to either placebo (normal
      saline) or treatment (Center-Al grass pollen extract) arms. A total of 3 injections over
      eight weeks will be administered intralymphatically. A third arm will include an
      observational group of grass-allergic subjects already receiving SCIT for 1 year. Primary
      outcome will be comparison of a safety score between arms 1 and 2. We will follow adverse
      events, as well as serum markers for Th2 and Th1 phenotypes, and objective respiratory
      measures (spirometry and FeNO) in those with asthma. Visits will occur at baseline for
      screening/enrollment, on day 0/week4/week 8 for injections (injection visit for arms 1 and 2
      only), and for follow-up at 12 weeks and near end of grass pollen season. A substudy will
      evaluate participants one-year after completing ILIT injections by obtaining repeat serum
      biomarker levels and interval change in medical history. Results could help in dramatically
      decreasing treatment time, as well as increasing safety of allergen immunotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 15-24 years

          -  Bothersome nasal, ocular, and/or respiratory symptoms correlating with grass pollen
             season (summer)

          -  Grass pollen allergic (+ skin prick test [wheal ≥ 3 mm larger than negative control]
             or specific IgE [minimum 0.35 kU/L] to grass pollen [Timothy or a northern pasture
             grass mix containing Timothy])

          -  Informed consent obtained and signed

          -  Informed assent (as appropriate) obtained and signed

          -  Understanding of study procedures

          -  Ability to comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study

          -  For inclusion in observational group (arm 3), must have initiated SCIT containing
             grass pollen 12 - 18 months prior to grass pollen season 2014 (ex. started SCIT any
             time Dec 2012 - May 2013). This group was included for comparison between traditional
             IT and ILIT, and these subjects will continue SCIT during this study. Since patients
             undergoing SCIT may not see clinical response to therapy until 12 months, we selected
             this time point to better compare with the more rapid immunologic and clinical changes
             expected with ILIT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant year-round allergy symptoms and year-round symptoms without worsening
             during grass pollen season (summer). (Exception: intermittent year-round symptoms with
             significant worsening during summer is acceptable for inclusion).

          -  Blood donation or surgery within the previous 30 days of baseline/enrollment, visit
             #1.

          -  Use of investigational drugs within the previous 90 days

          -  Pregnancy or nursing

          -  Mastocytosis

          -  Significant cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, autoimmune, hematological, or active
             infectious disease

          -  History of malignancy, hypertension, use of immunosuppressive agents, beta-blockers,
             ACE inhibitors, or tricyclic antidepressants

          -  Previous IT (exception: those in observational arm currently on grass SCIT).
