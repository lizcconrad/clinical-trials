  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of anxiety and depression in our OSA population is more than in COPD and the
      general population of North West Adelaide. (principal hypothesis).

      CPAP therapy in OSA population produces a positive effect on the anxiety and depression
      scale.

      The Investigators intend to study the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with
      sleep disorders in comparison to patients with COPD and subsequently, to assess whether CPAP
      has a role in controlling anxiety and depression in depressed and anxious patients with sleep
      apnoea.

      This is a two phase study, in first phase; investigator will assess the prevalence of anxiety
      and depression, in a population with sleep disorders to check whether it is different to the
      prevalence in the COPD population. The prevalence of depression in Sleep Disorder population
      will also be compared with the Adelaide North Western general population, which was reported
      in The North West Adelaide Health Study. According to this epidemiological survey, which was
      conducted from 2008 to 2010, the prevalence of depression in Adelaide North Western general
      population was 20%.During the second phase of the study investigator will evaluate the effect
      of CPAP on anxiety and depression scores in the depressed and anxious patients with sleep
      apnoea by comparing the pre and post CPAP anxiety and depression status. The Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression (HAD) scale will be used to assess Anxiety and Depression, which is a
      well-documented tool for assessing symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with
      somatic diseases.

      AIM (S) / OBJECTIVE OF STUDY

        1. To compare the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with sleep disorders
           (OSA), COPD and the general population of North West Adelaide.

        2. To study the effect of CPAP on depression and anxiety in patients with sleep apnoea who
           also have anxiety and depression.

      STUDY DESIGN/ SETTING/LOCATION/POPULATION

      This is a multicenter Prospective Cohort study run at the Lyell McEwin Hospital (LMH) and The
      Queen Elizabeth Hospital (TQEH), among patients attending the Respiratory and Sleep
      Outpatient Clinics at the Lyell McEwin Hospital (LMH) and The Queen Elizabeth Hospital
      (TQEH). These both sites are teaching tertiary hospital.

      STUDY OUTCOMES

        1. Primary Outcome To establish the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with
           sleep disorders and compare how this prevalence differs from its prevalence in COPD and
           in the general population.

        2. Secondary Outcome To evaluate whether treatment with CPAP improves anxiety and
           depression symptoms (HAD scale) at 3 and 12 months in OSA patients with anxiety and
           depression.
