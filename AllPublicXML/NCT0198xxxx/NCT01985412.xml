  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether shotgun sequencing technology, which can be
      used to detect donor DNA in recipient plasma, can be used as a rapid, accurate, non-invasive
      method to detect Acute Cellular Rejection (ACR) after heart transplantation. Currently, all
      heart transplant recipients undergo invasive heart biopsies to diagnose ACR. Thus, there is
      an ongoing need to monitor patients for the development of acute and chronic rejection, with
      the primary goal of non-invasive early detection and treatment to prevent organ damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous attempts to develop a non-invasive marker of graft rejection have focused on
      recipient-specific immune responses, and thus have inherent limitations in both sensitivity
      and selectivity, especially in distinguishing rejection from infection. The investigators'
      goal is to use a novel DNA sequencing technology to develop a rapid, inexpensive, and
      non-invasive method for monitoring organ transplant recipients for graft rejection. The
      investigators' research is driven by the fact that acute and chronic rejection of thoracic
      organ transplants remain major causes of patient morbidity and mortality, and require intense
      resource utilization. The investigators' novel approach is the first to focus on a
      donor-specific marker of acute rejection. The investigators will use high throughput next
      generation sequencing to monitor the proportion of cell-free donor DNA to recipient DNA in
      the recipient's blood stream as a marker of rejection. This approach is enabled by the fact
      that an organ transplant is also effectively a genome transplant, and by monitoring single
      nucleotide polymorphisms that are specific to the donor's genome (and are not shared with the
      recipient's genome) one can measure the relative health of the transplanted organ. The
      investigators' preliminary studies show that cell-free donor DNA levels in the serum of heart
      transplant recipients increase prior to diagnosis of acute rejection by endomyocardial
      biopsy, but remain at stable low levels in the absence of acute rejection.

      A single whole blood specimen from both the donor and recipient of the organ prior to
      transplant. Additionally, blood samples are taken post-transplant at specified timepoints and
      spun down into a plasma, buffycoat layer. The plasma and buffycoat are retained while the
