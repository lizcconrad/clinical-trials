  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, randomized (1:1), active control, single-blind, non-inferiority,
      European multicenter clinical trial.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the neointimal healing score (as evaluated
      by intra-coronary OFDI) in patients with ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and
      treated with Abbott Vascular ABSORB everolimus eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS)
      at 6 months follow-up by comparing with a metallic drug eluting stent (XIENCE). Furthermore,
      the safety and feasibility of implanting ABSORB BVS in patients with STEMI is assessed.

      It is hypothesized that acutely and at 6 months follow-up implantation of the ABSORB fully
      bioresorbable everolimus-eluting scaffold is at least as safe as implantation of metallic
      drug-eluting stent, and that at late follow-up the ABSORB scaffold could improve the arterial
      healing process and potentially reduce late stent thrombosis in patients presenting with
      STEMI.

      This is a preparatory trial in anticipation of a major outcome study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 190 patients will be included in this trial, at 8-10 European sites.

      The primary endpoint is arterial healing at 6 month follow up. To assess the arterial
      healing, at 6 months follow-up all patients will undergo angiographic follow-up with OFDI
      investigation. To score the arterial healing, a Healing Score is used.

    <description>The primary endpoint is: Healing Score at 6 months follow-up. This is measured with OFDI imaging.
This Healing Score is a weighted index that combines the following parameters:
Presence of filling defect (%ILD) is assigned weight of &quot;4&quot;,
Presence of both malapposed and uncovered struts (%MN) is assigned a weight of &quot;3&quot;,
Presence of uncovered struts alone (%N) is assigned a weight of &quot;2&quot; and finally,
Presence of malapposition alone (%M) is assigned a weight of &quot;1&quot;.</description>
