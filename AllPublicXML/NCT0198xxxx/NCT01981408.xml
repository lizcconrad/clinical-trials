      This type of study is called a radiolabeled study. For this study, LY2801653 (study drug) has
      been specially prepared to contain radiolabeled carbon [^14C]. [^14C] is a naturally
      occurring radioactive form of the element, carbon. This study will increase understanding
      about how the drug appears in the blood, urine, and stool after it is administered to healthy
      people. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. This study
      will last up to 15 days for each participant, not including screening. Screening is required
      within 28 days prior to enrollment.
