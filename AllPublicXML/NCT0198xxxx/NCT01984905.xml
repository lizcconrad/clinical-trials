  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical outcomes of chronic type B aortic dissections are unknown, especially in case of
      false lumen expansion and risk of rupture. Data of literature give us some indications about
      prognosis. The 1-year survival rate is about 80%, but we deplore the 25% rate of mortality at
      3 years despite follow-up.The only known predictive factors are the initial diameter of more
      than 4 cm and the persistence of a false lumen patent.However, actual means of follow-up do
      not allow to predict severe complications. The aim of the sudy is to propose a diagnostic and
      preventive strategy for the follow-up of chronic type B aortic dissections treated medically.

      The primary objective is then to evaluate the prognostic role of 18-FDG-PET Scan in such
      patients in order to predict the risk of aortic diameter growth of more than 5 mm in 1 year
      and/or of an aortic dissections extension at 1 year. The secondary objectives are to evaluate
      the link between fibrosis biomarkers MMP et TIMP) and the results of imaging results
      (evolution of diameter and extension and results of PET-Scan imaging) Methods: 100 patients
      to be included in 3 years History of chronic type B aortic dissection, treated medically,
      evolving since more than 1 month and less than 5 years.

      Expected results: Prognostic contribution of 18FDG-PET-Scan and biomarkers for the
      identification of patients at high risk of evolution. Elaboration of a decisional algorithm
      about follow-up modalities of chronic aortic dissections. Demonstration of a correlation
      between aortic diameter growth or aortic dissection extension and intensity of marker
      fixation with 18-FDG-PET-Scan.
