    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up of the primary series vaccination schedule in Study A3L24 (NCT01177722)
      and booster vaccination in Study A3L27 (NCT01444781).

      Study Objective:

        -  To describe the long-term antibody persistence at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age following a
           3-dose primary series vaccination of either DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T+Prevenar™ (PCV7)
           +Rotarix™ or Infanrix hexa™+Prevenar™ (PCV7) +Rotarix™ vaccination at 2, 4, 6 months of
           age and a booster vaccination of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T+Prevenar™ (PCV7) or Infanrix
           hexa™+Prevenar™ (PCV7) at 12 to 24 months of age.

      Observational Objectives:

        -  To describe the long-term antibody persistence by group and by stratification on the age
           at inclusion of the A3L27 booster study.

        -  To describe the effect of one additional oral dose of stand alone poliovirus isotypes 1,
           2 and 3 vaccine* on the antibody persistence immune response for poliovirus isotypes (4
           vs 5 doses of poliovirus administered).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No investigational vaccine will be administered in the study. Subjects who were previously
      randomized and completed the primary series, Study A3L24 and the booster study A3L27 will be
      invited to take part in this study.

      Any serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the vaccines administered during the preceding
      trial (A3L27;) and SAEs related to A3L28 study procedures will be collected throughout the
      trial.

      No vaccine will be administered as part of this study.
