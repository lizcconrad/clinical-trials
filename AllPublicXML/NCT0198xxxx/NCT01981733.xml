  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The THRIVE-1 study will examine novel methods for enhancing blood flow in the lower limb
      using electrical stimulation. Increases in lower limb blood flow improve venous return and
      thereby reduce venous stasis. Since stasis is one of the compounding factors in the
      development of deep vein thrombosis, the risk of developing thrombosis should theoretically
      be proportionally reduced. This technique may prove to be a useful tool in preventing and
      reducing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in both medical and surgical patients together
      with passengers undertaking significant duration travel (as travel - related deep vein
      thrombosis is not exclusively related to flying).

          2. Aged between 18 and 65 years.

          3. Free of significant abnormal findings as determined by medical history (specifically
             an absence of DVT or haematological disorders or indications), screening physical
             examination, vital signs (sitting blood pressure, sitting pulse rate, sitting
             respiratory rate and body temperature) and duplex ultrasound within 48 hours prior to
             commencement of the each study phase.

          4. BMI between 18 and 34

          5. No history or signs of drug abuse (including alcohol), licit or illicit.

          6. Has not to used any medications (prescribed or over-the-counter including herbal
             remedies) judged to be significant by the Principal Investigator during the thirty
             (30) days preceding the study, and agrees not to use any medications during the course
             of the study without informing the Research Team.

          7. Able to understand the Volunteer Information Sheet and signed the written Informed
             Consent Forms.

          8. Able and willing to follow the Protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any evidence of organ dysfunction, or any clinically significant deviation from normal
             in the physical determinations.

          2. History or signs of haematological disorders (especially in relation to clotting or
             coagulation or previous Deep or superficial vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism).

          3. Peripheral arterial disease (ABPI &lt; 0.9), varicose veins or lower limb ulceration.

          6. Recent trauma to lower limb.

          7. Chronic Obesity (BMI Index &gt;34).

          8. Pregnancy.

          9. Any Medication judged to be significant by the Principal Investigator (such as

             diabetes), psychiatric, haematological (especially in relation to clotting or
             coagulation), or systemic disease judged to be significant.

         12. A pulse rate of less than 50 beats/minute, a sitting systolic blood pressure &gt;160 or
             &lt;80 mmHg and/or a sitting diastolic pressure of &gt;90 or &lt;60 mmHg.

         13. Any significant illness during the four (4) weeks preceding the screening period of
             the study.

         14. Any contraindication to blood sampling.

         15. Donation of blood during the eight (8) weeks preceding the screening period of the
             study or during the investigation.
