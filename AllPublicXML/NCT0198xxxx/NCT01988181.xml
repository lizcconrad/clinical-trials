  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As kidney function declines, the ability to maintain water balance is impaired and is most
      often treated with hemodialysis. The removal of excess water in hemodialysis often leads to a
      sudden drop of blood pressure and causes symptoms of dizziness, light-headedness, cramping,
      and chest pain. This sudden drop in blood pressure has been linked with complications of
      heart attacks, strokes and even death. Research has focused on different ways to prevent
      dangerous drops in blood pressure during hemodialysis. One way is the use of blood volume
      monitoring biofeedback technology to monitor the patient's relative blood volume and
      automatically reduce the amount of fluid that is being removed when the blood volume is low
      to prevent the drop in blood pressure from occurring. This type of biofeedback device is
      currently available on some hemodialysis machines and while this approach appealing, it is
      not clear how effective this form of biofeedback is in preventing the drops in blood
      pressure.

      We plan to determine if the use of biofeedback based on the changes in the patient's blood
      volume will reduce the number of sudden drops in blood pressure that occur during
      hemodialysis. To do this, we will compare patients treated with this technology to current
      hemodialysis practices and follow them for important adverse outcomes. The result of interest
      will be the frequency of hemodialysis sessions complicated by a sudden symptomatic drop in
      blood pressure. We also plan to monitor the amount of water in the different body
      compartments, blood pressure, blood pressure medication use, markers of heart function, and
      patient symptoms and quality of life.

      We hope that by providing information on this technology we can reduce the sudden drops in
      blood pressure in hemodialysis, the associated rates of serious disease or death, and improve
      patient quality of life.

      This is a 22 week parallel group, randomized crossover trial to determine the effect of blood
      volume monitoring, BVM, guided ultrafiltration (UF) biofeedback on symptomatic intradialytic
      hypotension (IDH) episodes amongst IDH prone patients. The first part of the study (Part 1 -
      Run-In/Dialysis Optimization Phase), eligible patients will undergo a four-week run-in phase.
      During this period all patients will undergo a comprehensive clinical assessment including,
      clinical weight assessment, anti-hypertensive medication review, and dialysis prescription
      standardization. At the end of the run-in phase, patients that still meet eligibility
      criteria will enter the randomized cross-over phase. In part 2 (Randomized Cross-Over Phase),
      patients are randomized to regular best clinical practice hemodialysis, HD (without
      BVM-guided UF biofeedback; control arm) or to BVM-guided UF biofeedback (intervention arm)
      for an 8 week period. This will be followed by a two-week washout phase and then patients
      will be crossed over for a second 8-week phase. The study will be conducted and reported
      following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 guidelines.

    <measure>Change in the rate of symptomatic IDH during hemodialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>During hemodialysis up to the 22 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome will be rate of symptomatic IDH as defined by an abrupt drop in the systolic blood pressure of â‰¥20mm Hg when compared to baseline along with an abrupt onset headache, dizziness, unconsciousness, thirst, dyspnea, angina, muscle cramps, or vomiting (reflecting cerebral, cardiac, gastrointestinal, or musculoskeletal ischemia). The end of an episode of IDH will be defined as resolution of the symptom. The number of symptomatic IDH episodes along with the duration of each dialysis treatment will be captured. The rate of IDH for each session will be calculated by dividing the number of episodes by the duration of the session in hours. The rate of IDH will be calculated for every dialysis treatment. The rate of symptomatic IDH will be measured in the two months preceding enrollment, during each phase of the study.</description>

    <measure>Number and Frequency of Nursing Interventions during hemodialysis</measure>
    <time_frame>During hemodialysis up to the 22 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>IDH-related nursing interventions are defined as the use of Trendelenburg/supine position, discontinuation of UF, fluid/saline challenge, return of blood, shortened dialysis run, or prolonged (more than 15 minutes) post-dialysis recovery period as a result of IDH or its symptoms. Given the subjective nature of IDH-related symptoms and intervention, in-services and customized dialysis run sheets will be provided to all nurses at participating dialysis centers to ensure that all events are recorded and recorded consistently. The number of symptomatic IDH episodes per session will be record.</description>

    <measure>Change in Single Session Dialysis Adequacy</measure>
    <time_frame>After hemodialysis up to the 22 week study period</time_frame>
    <description>Patients that experience symptomatic IDH may require a reduction in the duration of HD treatments with a resultant reduction in dialysis adequacy. Dialysis adequacy will be measured and recorded (usual care) at the end of each dialysis session on the session sheet as single-pooled Kt/V. Single-pooled Kt/v is measured using the previously validated online clearance measurement method, which detects changes in conductivity in the dialysate to reflect the clearance of serum electrolytes and urea.</description>

    <description>The Fresenius 5008 uses an ultrasound and temperature monitor incorporated into the machine to detect ultrasonic velocity and temperature changes to derive the total protein concentration, which is a sum of total plasma proteins and hemoglobin. The relative blood volume is calculated at by dividing the initial concentration of total protein by the total protein concentration at any given time, multiplied by 100. The HD software is based on the critical blood volume entered at the beginning of the dialysis session for each individual patient. The UF rate is adjusted based on the changes in the relative blood volume to the patient's critical relative blood volume.</description>
