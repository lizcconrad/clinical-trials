    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      doses of volitinib administered to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors
      and determine MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) or RPTD(recommended Phase 2 dose).

      The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety and tolerability during all the study of therapy
      following the initiation of multiple dosing of HMPL-504. The safety and tolerability
      variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, physical examinations, vital
      signs (specifically including blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations including
      serum chemistry, hematology (Maximum Tolerated Dose), and urinalysis (with detailed sediment
      analysis, proteinuria, and 24-hour urine for collection for protein), and electrocardiograms
      (ECGs) in triplicate, Incidence and nature of DLTs (Dose-Limiting Toxicity), to determine the
      MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose).
