  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) plays an important role in different psychiatric
      disorders, such as depressive and anxiety disorders, complicated grief, posttraumatic stress
      disorders, anorexia nervosa. RNT is seen as a vulnerability factor in the onset, duration,
      severity and relapse of those disorders. Although there is a lot of theoretical research, it
      is unknown if a group training protocol addressing RNT has an additional effect on Treatment
      as Usual (TAU) of patients with GAD or Depressive disorder. Our hypothesis is that a training
      intervention will show a significant effect on declined RNT activity (measured by PSWQ and
      LARRS), reduced identification with worrying/rumination (measured by CFQ-13 and a Visual
      Analogue Scale), and reduced scores on metacognitions questionnaire (MCV Dutch version of the
      MCQ), when compared to TAU (medication, psychotherapy or a combination of both treatments).
      Further we expect that this effect on RNT will not be temporary and the beneficial effects
      will remain present over a longer time (9 months). Our third hypothesis claims that reduced
      RNT will have an effect on Quality of Life, self-esteem and depressive and anxiety scores
      (measured respectively by WHO-QoL, Rosenberg Self Esteem Questionnaire, BDI-II and STAI; all
      of them in Dutch version). Fourth hypothesis concerns the effect of the training in the
      functioning on a neurobiological level. Here we expect that the beneficial effects of
      training on RNT will increase top-down prefrontal (dorsolateral) cortical control over an
      overactive bottom-up limbic system. To examine these neurobiological effects, we apply a
      multimodal approach where we combine resting state fMRI, structural MRI such as diffuse
      tensor imaging (DTI), anterior spin labelling (ASL). Further, in our department we developed
      an audio critique task where participants hear different kinds of critique amongst some of
      negative valence which will be especially problematic for ruminative patients reflecting
      difficulties and differences these top-down/bottom-up processes when compared to a healthy
      control group at baseline. Further, we hypothesize that only when coping with RNT is
      successful these neuronal processes will normalize. We do not expect changes in the waiting
      list group.

      To examine these clinical and neuronal effects, people suffering from GAD and/or depression
      will be allocated by randomisation to an active treatment condition (ATC) and a waiting list
      control group (WLC). All the participants will be patients treated by general practitioner,
      psychologist or psychiatrist. Training exists of 8 sessions in group (max 12 participants) on
      a weekly basis, except for the last session, which takes place after one month). During the
      training people will get information on RNT, they will be trained in re-allocation of their
      attention, will receive some basic ideas about becoming aware of dysfunctional thinking and
      learn coping strategies such as stimulus control and engaging in positive activity.

      Assessments will take place before and after treatment for the ATC. The WLC will be measured
      at the start of the WLC and 12 weeks later. Measurement takes place by means of
      questionnaires and fMRI. During the fMRI, people will undergo a resting state paradigm and
      some tasks triggering RNT. 3 and 9 months after the group treatment, participants will be
      evaluated again on RNT by means of questionnaires. Participants in WLC will receive group
      treatment from the moment the parallel active treatment condition is ended (e.g. after 12
      weeks). This group will be evaluated immediately after training and at 3 and 9 months
      follow-up.

      At the end of the training, after the 8th session, two participants per run will be asked to
      cooperate in a qualitative in-depth interview. We are interested in linking results with the
      group training with some factors such as quantity of sessions, degree of active participation
      in between sessions. We are also interested in defining which interventions are perceived as
      most useful and if there is a link between disorder and the usefulness of some interventions.
