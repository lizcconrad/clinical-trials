      Purpose: To compare the effects of 16-week multicomponent and resistance trainings on
      cognition and physical performances related to falls in oldest old people living in
      community; to analyze the same variables after 6-week detraining. Method: We conducted a
      randomized controlled trial with 69 community elderly over 80 years, sedentary and without
      cognitive disorder. Participants were allocated to control, multicomponent training or
      resistance training group. The multicomponent group performed a protocol involving warm-up,
      aerobic, strength, balance and cool-down exercises. The resistance group underwent to
      strength exercises using six machines: leg press, chest press, calf, back extension,
      abdominal and rowing. The control group did not perform any intervention. The trainings had
      progressive intensity, lasted 16 weeks and included three 1-hour sessions per week. The
      participants were evaluated at baseline, at the end of 16-week training and at 6-week
      detraining. The assessment consisted of anamnesis, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale),
      cognition (Montreal cognitive assessment), dual task walking (associated to cognitive and
      motor tasks), balance (unipedal and tandem tests), strength of lower limbs (sit-to-stand
      test) and history of falls. For statistical analysis by intention to treat, we adopted a
      significance level of α=0.05.
