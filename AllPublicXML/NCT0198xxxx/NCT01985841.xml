  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to study the efficacy of Bevacizumab plus systemic chemotherapy prior
      to surgery in order to make a locally advanced tumor operable. Treatment is thus expected to
      induce a maximum tumor shrinkage within a short period (usually 3-6 months). In addition
      Bevacizumab (Avastin) is to be administered as early as possible during the disease stages.
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity in terms of
      pathological complete responses (pCR) of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy.

      The aim of administering systemic therapy prior to surgery is to make a locally advanced
      tumor operable or to allow conservative surgery in the case of a T2-T3 tumor. Therefore,
      treatment is expected to induce a maximum tumor shrinkage within a short period. In addition
      and based on the anti-angiogenic MoA, bevacizumab (Avastin) is to be administered as early as
      possible during the disease stages. Bevacizumab has already been tested in the neoadjuvant
      setting with encouraging results. In a first trial patients with inoperable locally advanced
      breast cancer received docetaxel with or without bevacizumab with five clinical Complete
      Responses and 24 Partial Responses. In a second trial there was also reported the results of
      the combination of bevacizumab with doxorubicin and docetaxel for the treatment of
      inflammatory breast cancer. Then, a set of studies of primary therapy exploring the activity
      of different regimens have confirmed the role of baseline pathological features of the tumor
      in predicting the responsiveness to primary therapy. A 22% pathological complete responses
      (pCR) rate has been achieved in a study combining bevacizumab together with Xeloda and
      Taxotere suggesting that bevacizumab addition to chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment is
      feasible showing promising activity while no unexpected toxicities were reported.

      Thus, a very high interest exists from our clinicians mostly within our cooperative groups
      which cover the largest national oncology centers to be involved and run such a study.
