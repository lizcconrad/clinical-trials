  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to document the effectiveness of Cyberknife
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the treatment of intermediate and high-risk
      localized prostate cancer defined by biochemical Disease-Free Survival (bDFS), using Phoenix
      and American Society of Therapeutic Radiation and Oncology (ASTRO) definitions, at 5 years.

      During the prostate-specific antigen era, an ever-increasing percentage of men with prostate
      cancer have presented with clinically localized, potentially curable disease. Although
      conventional treatment options are potentially curative in selected patients, these
      treatments also have drawbacks, including the risk of negative long-term quality of life
      consequences and serious complications.

      The CyberKnife® system is a type of radiation machine that uses a special system to precisely
      focus large doses of x-rays on the tumor. The device is designed to concentrate large doses
      of radiation onto the tumor so that injury from radiation to the nearby normal tissue will be
      minimal.

      Intermediate risk patients will be treated with either CyberKnife® Stereotactic Body
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) monotherapy or CyberKnife® SBRT boost followed by Intensity
      Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT). High risk patients will be treated with CyberKnife® SBRT
      boost followed by IMRT. Treatment will last 4-7 days. Patients will complete the QOL
      questionnaires before treatment. Questionnaires will also be completed during follow-up
      visits at 1, 3 , 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months then every 12 months until year 5.
