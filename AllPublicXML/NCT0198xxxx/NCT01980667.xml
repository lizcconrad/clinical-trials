      Clinical and Pharmacokinetic Study of Lurbinectedin (PM01183) in Combination with Cisplatin
      in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors to determine the recommended dose (RD) of PM01183 in
      combination with cisplatin, to characterize the safety profile, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      this combination, to obtain preliminary information on the clinical antitumor activity and to
      conduct an exploratory pharmacogenomic (PGx) analysis.

    <description>To determine the recommended dose (RD) of PM01183 in combination with cisplatin every three weeks (q3wk) with or without aprepitant in patients with advanced solid tumors. The RD will be the dose level (DL) immediately below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), that is, the highest DL explored at which less than one third of evaluable patients experience a DLT during Cycle 1.</description>

    <description>To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters Cmax (maximum concentratio), AUC (area under the curve), CL (clearance), HL (half life) y Vss (volume of distribution ) of this combination in patients receiving/not receiving aprepitant and to explore factors that may affect individual variability in main PK parameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacogenomic (PGx) analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>30 months</time_frame>
    <description>To conduct an exploratory pharmacogenomic (PGx) analysis to identify and validate putative molecular markers associated with the clinical outcome of patients treated with PM01183 and cisplatin. These molecular markers would help in the future selection of patients who might preferentially benefit from PM01183 therapy, thus contributing to improve health care through a more individualized medicine.</description>
