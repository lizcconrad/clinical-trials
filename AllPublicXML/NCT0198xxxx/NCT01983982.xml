  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many breast cancer survivors report chronic pain that develops or worsens following
      chemotherapy. The impact of chemotherapy on the development of chronic pain is uncertain. In
      this proposal, we are studying the impact of chemotherapy on a patient's sensitivity to pain.
      We are also investigating whether a patient's sensitivity to pain is related to how many
      symptoms she experiences during treatment.
