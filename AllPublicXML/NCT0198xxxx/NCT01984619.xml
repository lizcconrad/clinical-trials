        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or Females 18-65 years of age.

          -  Forehead wrinkle(s) rating of at least 2 in animation on the 5-point Wrinkle Scale
             (5WS) which upon physical manipulation of the skin demonstrates a reduction in wrinkle
             severity.

          -  Subject has at least a 2 point difference between resting and dynamic forehead wrinkle
             scores using the 5WS.

          -  Glabellar wrinkle score of &quot;1&quot; or higher in animation on the 5-point Glabella Scale
             (5GS).

          -  Fitzpatrick Skin Type I, II, III, or IV.

          -  Subject has consented and agreed to participate in all study procedures and visits for
             the study's duration.

          -  Subject is in good general health, free of any disease state, or physical condition
             that might impair evaluation of forehead and/or glabellar wrinkle rating or which, in
             the Investigator's opinion, exposes the subject to an unacceptable risk by study
             participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a clotting disorder or coagulopathy that requires use of an anticoagulant
             and/or antiplatelet therapy (e.g., warfarin, clopidigrel, etc.)

          -  Subject has used medication or supplements affecting clotting cascade (e.g., aspirin,
             fish oil, etc.), or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g., ibuprofen and
             naproxen) within seven (7) days prior to administration of the device.

          -  Subject has had prior surgery that alters the subcutaneous anatomy of the target
             treatment sites.

          -  Subject has undergone another surgical cosmetic procedure or botulinum toxin injection
             at or above the level of the zygoma (cheekbones) within the past six (6) months prior
             to administration of the device.

          -  Subject has a resting wrinkle score of &quot;3&quot; or higher on the 5WS.

          -  Subjects who actively elevate forehead at rest.

          -  Subject has been treated with fillers in the temple or forehead area in the time
             intervals specified prior to the start of their participation in the study.

          -  Subject has any of the following:

               1. Dermatochalasis with &lt;1mm lid margin when looking straight ahead.

               2. Excessive skin laxity.

               3. Asymmetry in the upper face.

               4. History of facial nerve palsy.

               5. Eyebrow or eyelid ptosis.

               6. History of neuromuscular disorder.

               7. Chronic dry eye symptoms.

               8. Allergy or intolerance to local anesthetic agents (e.g., Lidocaine).

               9. Use of narcotic medication for a chronic pain condition.

              10. Any other clinically significant, in the opinion of the Investigator, local skin
                  condition (e.g., skin infection) at target treatment site that may interfere or
                  be a safety concern.

              11. Any physical or psychiatric condition that in the Investigator's opinion would
                  prevent adequate study participation.

              12. Chronic medical condition that in the Investigator's opinion would affect study
                  participation (such as uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes, hepatitis, HIV,
                  etc.).

              13. Diagnosis of:

                    -  Cryoglobinemia

                    -  Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria

                    -  Cold Uticaria

              14. Fitzpatrick Skin Type V or IV

              15. Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug, biologic or device
                  study that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the iovera° treatment.

              16. Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to comply with the
                  requirements of the study protocol in the opinion of the Investigator.
