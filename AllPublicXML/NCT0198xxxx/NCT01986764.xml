  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to address cognitive disturbance, which is a frequent adverse sequelae of
      riskreducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) with or without post-procedure
      chemotherapy and adjunctive treatments. RRSO after completion of childbearing is recommended
      for prevention of ovarian and breast cancer in women with BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations and standard
      of care for women with some forms of hormone-responsive cancer. Knowledge regarding the
      impact of this procedure, with or without chemotherapy, and subsequent hypogonadism on brain
      health is less than adequate. Premenopausal women who undergo an acute surgical menopause are
      at greater risk for verbal memory decline and executive function (EF) complaints, but as of
      yet, we cannot predict who is going to experience these adverse sequelae, nor do we have
      targeted prevention or treatment strategies other than hormone therapy, which is not an
      option in many cases and not always effective. An idealized sample as women who are planning
      for a RRSO will undergo brain imaging and behavioral assessments pre- and post-surgery as
      well as pre-/post-treatment with E2 or the psychostimulant, lisdexamphetamine (LDX;
      VyvanseÂ®).

    <description>This study uses a double-blind, placebo-controlled, design. The primary subjective outcome variable is the BADDS score measured at the initial screening visit, and one week after oophorectomy and 12 weeks after randomization to E2, LDX or placebo post-oophorectomy. The primary, out-of-scan objective outcome will be performance on the HVLT, while the primary, in-scanner outcomes will be behavioral and brain activation measures during performance of the N-back task.</description>
