  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess in an exploratory manner, the pronostic utility for locoregional control,
      progression-free and distant metastasis-free survival of a pre-therapy and post-therapy blood
      DNA test of HPV E6 and E7 DNA for subtypes 16 and 18 in p16+ and/or HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer
      patients. This will entail analysis of both initial pre-therapy HPV level as a continuous
      variable and initial post-therapy HPV level as a dichotomous variable.
