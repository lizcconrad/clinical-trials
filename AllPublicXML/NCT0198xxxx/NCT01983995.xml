  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitors are commonly prescribed for treatment of postmenopausal women with
      breast cancer. These medications can cause side effects in some women, and occasionally they
      can be quite bothersome. We are doing a study to better understand the side effects of
      aromatase inhibitors so that we can hopefully treat them better or possibly prevent them. In
      particular, we are interested in pain and difficulty sleeping. This study is designed to
      assess the effect of aromatase inhibitors on pain, sleep quality, and fatigue and the
      interplay of these side effects and their subsequent impact on daily activity. Each
      participant will fill out a series of questionnaires about pain, sleep quality, and fatigue
      and will also complete a sleep diary and wear an actigraphy watch for 10 days before starting
      an aromatase inhibitor and after taking it for 3 months. We hope to learn more about these
      symptoms so we can better manage medication toxicity in the future.

             planned during study participation.

          -  Cytoxic chemotherapy, if applicable, must have been completed at least 4 weeks before
             the baseline evaluation.

          -  Radiation therapy, if applicable, must have been completed at least 2 weeks before
             baseline evaluation.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2.

             of pain or activity level, including but not limited to inflammatory arthritis
             (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis,
             polymyalgia rheumatica), Parkinson's disease, and cancer involving the bone.
