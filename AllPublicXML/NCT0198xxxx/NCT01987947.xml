             enrollment despite use of H1 antihistamines during this time period

          -  UAS7 score greater than 16 and itch component of UAS7 greater than 8 during 7 days
             prior to Day 1. Patients must have been on daily stable doses of H1 antihistamine for
             at least 3 consecutive days immediately prior to the screening visit and must document

             Day 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with an investigational agent within 30 days of screening, and previous
             treatment with monoclonal antibody therapies used to treat CSU 9 months prior to
             screening

          -  Chronic urticarias other than CSU, including the following: Acute, solar, cholinergic,
