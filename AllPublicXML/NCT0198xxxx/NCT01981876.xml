  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) is common in the developing world, and is the leading
      cancer diagnosis at Tenwek Hospital in southwestern Kenya. The investigators long-term goal
      is to understand the pathogenesis and risk factors for ESCC in Kenya, and to establish
      effective screening and prevention programs. The investigators hypothesize that asymptomatic
      esophageal squamous dysplasia (ESD) is common in their region, and the current protocol is
      designed to determine the prevalence of ESD in residents of southwestern Kenya.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of esophageal squamous dysplasia will be determined after evaluating pathology
      reports from unstained lesions and normal biopsies after staining with Lugol's iodine.
