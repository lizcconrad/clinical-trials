  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wilson disease is a genetic disorder resulting in copper accumulation in liver, brain and
      eye. The neurologic complications include dystonic syndrome, which is a prolonged and
      excessive muscle activation responsible for abnormal postures. Hand dystonia prevents daily
      life activities such as writing, which is particularly disabling, since writing is the only
      mean of communication in these patients with significant slurred speech. Treatment is limited
      and only partially effective.

      Low frequency (&lt;or=1Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has shown
      inhibiting properties when applied over the cortex. Since dystonia has been correlated to
      hyperactivation of the neurons of the somatosensory cortex (SSC), we hypothesize that one
      single 20-minute session of 1 Hz rTMS applied on left SSC will improve writing of the right
      dystonic hand, assessed immediately at the end of the session.

      This study investigates the handwriting performance of an homogeneous cohort of patients with
      Wilson disease and right handed dystonia, after one single inhibitory repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Fifteen patients with focal right hand dystonia will receive
      randomly either active or sham rTMS (1 Hz) to the left somatosensory cortex (SSC) in one
      single 20 minutes session. Handwriting performance will be measured immediately after this
      unique session (Visual analogic scale of subjective discomfort in writing, DPRE and WCRS
      scales, pen pressure and pen velocity measured on touchpad), compared to scores obtained 24
      hours before the session. Three days later, the patient will receive the other session (sham
      rTMS or active rTMS) and the same parameters will be evaluated.

      This is a single-center, randomized, crossover, prospective, clinical and double-blind study
      (the rTMS session is performed by the neurophysiologist, but the patient and the neurologist
      who will perform the handwriting evaluation are blind to the session).
