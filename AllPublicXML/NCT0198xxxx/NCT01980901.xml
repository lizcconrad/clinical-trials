    <textblock>
      The Post-Approval Study (PAS) will evaluate the &quot;real world&quot; data on the Ovation™/Ovation
      Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System along with the long-term data collected from the IDE
      cohort to monitor the long-term safety and effectiveness of the device.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the long term safety and effectiveness of the
      Ovation™/Ovation Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System for the endovascular treatment of
      infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms in a post-approval environment.

      The clinical objective of the study is to evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of
      the Ovation™/Ovation Prime™ Abdominal Stent Graft System assessed at 5 years through freedom
      from Aneurysm-Related Mortality.

      Additionally, this study will evaluate the physician training program for modifications based
      on IDE and post-approval experience.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is &gt; 18 years of age.

          2. Patients who are male or non-pregnant female (females of child bearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to enrollment into the study).

          4. Patient is considered by the treating physician to be a candidate for elective open
             surgical repair of the AAA (i.e., category I, II, or III per American Society of
             Anesthesiology (ASA) classification; refer to Appendix III: ASA Classification
             System). ASA category IV patients may be enrolled provided their life expectancy is
             greater than 1 year.

               -  Aneurysm has increased in size by 0.5 cm in last 6 months.
