    <textblock>
      This clinical validation study is aimed at establishing a birch pollen challenge in the
      Fraunhofer ECC in patients allergic to birch pollen. The symptoms will be recorded on a
      validated symptom score as Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), allowing to determine whether
      the challenge is dose dependent and reproducible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a mono-center, single-blind, placebo controlled study assessing nasal symptoms in
      patients with allergic rhinitis upon exposure to birch pollen in an environmental challenge
      chamber during a 4 hour challenge period with different concentrations of birch pollen versus
      placebo.

      Subjects with allergic rhinitis to birch pollen will be recruited from the Fraunhofer ITEM
      database or the surrounding communities. After the screening evaluation eligible subjects
      will undergo six challenge sessions in the environmental challenge chamber at intervals of at
      least one week. In order to determine dose response, the concentration of birch pollen in the
      atmosphere of the challenge chamber will be varied from 1000 birch pollen/m³ in the first
      period, 2000 birch pollen/m³ in the second period, 4000 birch pollen/m³ in the third period,
      8000 birch pollen/m³in the fourth period to 0 birch pollen/m³ (only air) in the fifth period.
      In order to investigate reproducibility in addition to dose response, a challenge with one
      concentration previously used will be repeated in period six. The dose will be chosen by the
      Investigator according to the observed nasal symptoms. According to previous experience with
      grass pollen (Dactylis glomerata) the target symptom level for TNSS is around 6. Therefore,
      the dose to study reproducibility will be chosen where the average mean TNSS of the last two
      hours will be closest to six. If two doses are equally close, the higher dose will be chosen
      because this will allow to optimize the particle monitoring technique. In this regard, it is
      better to have a high particle concentration in order to separate specific particles from
      unspecific particles (originating from the subjects themselves).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects aged 18-65 years.

          -  Non smokers or ex-smokers with a history of less than 10 pack years, having been
             non-smokers for at least the last 12 months.

          -  History of allergic rhinitis to birch pollen. Subjects with mild intermittent asthma
             controlled with occasional use of as-needed short-acting beta-agonists can be
             included.

          -  Normal lung function (FEV1 ≥ 80 % predicted)

          -  Positive skin prick test for birch

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent to take part in the study.

          -  Available to complete all study measurements

          -  Women will be considered for inclusion if they are:

        O Not pregnant, as confirmed by pregnancy test (see flow chart) and not nursing.

        O Of non-child bearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
        including any female who were pre-menarchial or post-menopausal, with documented proof of
        hysterectomy or tubal ligation, or met clinical criteria for menopause and had been
        amenorrhoeic for more than 1 year prior to the screening visit).

        O Of childbearing potential and using a highly effective method of contraception during the
        entire study (vasectomised partner, sexual abstinence - the lifestyle of the female should
        be such that there was complete abstinence from intercourse from two weeks prior to the
        first dose of study medication until at least 72 hours after treatment -, implants,
        injectables, combined oral contracep-tives, hormonal IUDs or double-barrier methods, i.e.
        any double combination of IUD, condom with spermicidal gel, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical
        cap).
