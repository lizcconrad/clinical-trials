    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a multi-faceted communication
      intervention for family members of critically ill patients to reduce the family members'
      long-term symptoms of depression and anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in four elderly Americans die in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care unit.
      An expanding body of literature documents that physician-family communication and end-of-life
      care is poor in intensive care units. These deficiencies are associated with high rates of
      adverse psychological outcomes among surrogates, physician-family conflict, and life support
      decisions that may be inconsistent with patients' goals and preferences. There is a lack of
      information on practical, generalizable interventions that effectively improve this important
      aspect of care for elderly patients and their families.

      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted
      communication intervention as compared to an educational control to improve psychological
      outcomes among family members of critically ill patients, using a randomized, controlled
      trial design.

      Sample size: With a sample size of 300 patients (450 surrogates), the study is well powered
      to detect small and clinically important differences in the primary outcome measure Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS).The trial's original sample size of 400 patients (600
      surrogates) was chosen to maximize the power to detect differences in a secondary outcome
      measure (costs) that required a substantially larger sample size than the primary outcome
      (HADS). Since the original power calculations were conducted, new data were published which
      indicated that cost analysis in this context will require an even larger sample size based
      one effect modification from whether the patient lived or died. Therefore, the Data and
      Safety Monitoring Board recommended revising the sample size to power the trial on the
      primary outcome (HADS), which required 300 patients (450 surrogates).
