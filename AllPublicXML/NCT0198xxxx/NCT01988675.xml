  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine if Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques can detect early
      changes in white matter (in the brain) and the blood-brain barrier resulting from radiation
      therapy.

      Patients will be assigned to one of two groups based on the type of radiation they will be
      receiving: whole brain irradiation or partial brain irradiation. Patients will undergo
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assessments, neurocognitive testing (Quality of Life and
      Neuropsychological assessments), and clinical evaluation.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks post radiation therapy (RT), 4 months post RT (whole brain irradiation only), 6 months post RT, 18 months post RT (partial brain irradiation only)</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) assessments will be compared graphically to changes in neurocognitive function and clinical symptoms. Parallel analysis will be conducted on each of the neurocognitive tests to determine if MRI assessments can identify patients at increased risk for later neurocognitive dysfunction.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients receiving partial brain irradiation for malignant or benign brain tumors
             (including low-grade gliomas, high-grade gliomas, malignant meningioma, pituitary
             adenomas, supratentorial meningioma, or craniopharyngiomas); or patients receiving
             whole brain irradiation for brain metastases.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older

          -  Patients must sign a study specific consent form approved by the Institutional Review
             Board (IRB) of the University of Michigan prior to study entry.

          -  Patients must have a neurological function class 1 or 2 with a Karnofsky performance
             status (a scoring system used to quantify general well being and quality of life on a
             scale of 100 to 0) of greater than or equal to 70.

          -  Patients must have an expected life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of major medical illness or psychiatric impairment which, in
             the investigator's opinion, will prevent administration of the protocol.

          -  Patients who have had prior external beam irradiation to the brain or head/neck area
             that will lead to overlap of the radiation field.

          -  Patients should have no contraindications to having a contrast enhanced Magnetic
             Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan.

          -  Prisoners are excluded.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded.
