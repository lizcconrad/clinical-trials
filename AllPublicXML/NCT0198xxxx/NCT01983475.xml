  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sublesional bone loss after acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is sudden, progressive, and
      dramatic. After depletion of bone mass and the loss of architectural integrity, it may be
      difficult, if even possible, to restore skeletal mass and strength. Denosumab is a relative
      new, highly potent anti-resorptive agent that has proven efficacy in postmenopausal
      osteoporosis to improve bone mass and in solid tumor patients to prevent a skeletal-related
      event to a greater extent than that with bisphosphonate administration. In persons with
      complete motor lesions, bisphosphonates have not been effective at reducing bone loss at the
      knee, the site of greatest relevance because of its increased risk of fracture. Anti-RANKL
      therapy appears to be more potent than bisphosphonates in animal models of bone loss due to
      immobilization, suggesting that treatment with denosumab may prove to be an efficacious
      therapy for persons with acute SCI to preserve bone mass and strength.

      The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of a potent anti-resorptive
      agent, denosumab [receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) antibody; Amgen
      Inc.] to preserve bone mass at the hip and knee and trabecular connectivity at the knee after
      acute SCI. Setting: patient enrollment, study drug administration and DXA scanning will be
      completed at the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation (KIR) and pQCT measurements will be
      performed at Columbia University. A Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel
      group trial.

      Twenty-four subjects with acute, motor complete SCI (≤12 weeks) who have been admitted to the
      Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation (KIR) will be recruited for participation. The age of
      study participation will be males between the ages of 18 and 65 years old and females between
      the ages of 18 and 50 years old. Primary outcome measure will be BMD as measured by DXA and
      microarchitecture as measured by pQCT at the hip and knee.

    <description>In clinical trials, denosumab (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA), has been shown to be more potent in reducing osteoclastosis and function than bisphosphonates.39,40 The rate of bone loss in the lower extremity at sites of interest in patients with acute SCI has been reported to be several-fold greater than the rate of bone loss in postmenopausal women not prescribed antiresorptive medications, which is about 3-5% per year.11,50,51 The dose of denosumab chosen for our protocol in patients after acute SCI will be the same dose that has been shown to be efficacious to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis (60 mg SQ q 6 months).</description>
