    <measure>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve (AUC) From Time Zero to Infinity (AUCinf) of Midazolam</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUCinf is the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve extrapolated from time 0 to infinity, calculated using the observed value of the last non-zero concentration. AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the Time of the Last Measureable Concentration (AUClast) of Midazolam</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUClast is the area under the concentration versus time curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration. AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure. It is derived from drug concentration and time so it gives a measure how much and how long a drug stays in a body.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) of Midazolam</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 72 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax is a term that refers to the maximum (or peak) concentration that a drug achieves in the body after the drug has been administrated.</description>

        <description>AUClast is the area under the concentration versus time curve from the time of dosing to the last measurable concentration. AUC can be used as a measure of drug exposure.
