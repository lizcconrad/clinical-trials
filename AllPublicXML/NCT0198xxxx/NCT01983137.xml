    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, observational study evaluates the efficacy of Targinact with regard
      to pain relief in daily clinical practice in Belgium compared to the previous analgesic
      treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are treated with Targinact® according to daily clinical practice and are monitored
      during 3 study visits. Parameters assessed are efficacy regarding pain relief, efficacy
      regarding bowel function, pain relief, use of analgesic rescue medication, bowel function,
      use of laxatives, safety of Targinact treatment, use of concomitant medication, patient
      satisfaction and quality of life.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of Targinact® treatment, with regard to pain relief, in patients with severe pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 140 days</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy will be evaluated by the physician (7 categories). For the analysis the ordinal scale will be reduced to a binary scale: responder or non-responder. A responder is defined as a patient responding ''slightly better'', ''better'' or ''much better'' at any time during the Targinact®therapy. A non-responder is defined as a patient responding &quot;same&quot;, &quot;slightly worse&quot;, &quot;worse&quot;, &quot;much worse&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain NAS score (0-10) will be measured at each visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 140 days</time_frame>
    <description>The relative changes from baseline at each visit will be used to compare the NAS pain scores during the Targinact® therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bowel Function Index (BFI) will be recorded at each visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 140 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Bowel Function Index is the mean value of the 3 single items included in the BFI:1/ Difficulty of bowel movement (0 to 100; 0 = easy/no difficulty, 100 = severe difficulty); 2/ Feeling of incomplete bowel evacuation (0 to 100; 0 = not at all, 100 = very strong); 3/ Judgement of constipation (0 to 100; 0 = not at all, 100 = very strong).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The use of laxative medication (yes/no) per 24 hours will be recorded in the e-CRF</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 140 days</time_frame>
    <description>If laxative is used, the physician will document if it's used 1/ continuously, 2/ intermittently or 3/ rarely.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The use of analgesic rescue medication (yes/no) used per day (24 hours) will be recorded</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 140 days</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of Targinact® treatment, with regard to bowel function, will be evaluated by the physician (7 categories)</measure>

    <description>much worse, worse, slightly worse, same, slightly better, better, much better.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

        Inclusion criteria:

        Patients who are to be included in the study, are those who meet all of the following

          1. Male or female patients at least 18 years, or older, with severe pain.

          2. Patients with documented history of severe pain treated with WHO step 1, step 2 and/or
             3 analgesics with insufficient pain relief and/or unacceptable side effects that
             require around-the-clock opioid therapy and are likely to benefit from WHO step 3
             opioid therapy for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion criteria are based on the SPC of Targinact®.
