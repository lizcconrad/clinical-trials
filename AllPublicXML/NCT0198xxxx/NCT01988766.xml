      The purpose of this study is to compare the difference in thrombosis as a result of internal
      jugular (IJ) catheters versus peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines. It is
      hypothesized that there will be a decreased rate of thrombosis in patients as a result of IJ
      catheters verses PICC lines.

      In a cohort of patients from Sept 1, 2010 until December 31, 2011 with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) has shown that the incidence of IJ thrombosis after short term catheter access occurred
      in only 1/26 subjects or 4%. The current study is being done to compare this experience with
      the incidence of thrombosis from PICC lines. A secondary aim will be to determine if
      variables such as level of renal function, prior history of thrombosis or atherosclerosis
      contribute to the risk of thrombosis when PICC lines are placed. This data will provide the
      first comparison of the incidence of thrombotic complications from short term IJ catheter
      access versus PICC lines.

    <description>To evaluate if factors, known to be associated with thrombosis and atherosclerosis, are associated with the risk of thrombosis from PICC or IJ access. These factors include: renal failure, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, transplant, gender, age or the indication for the access, including antibiotics or chemotherapy.</description>
