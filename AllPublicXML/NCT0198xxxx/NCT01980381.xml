  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are among our most common diseases and the prevalence is increasing.
      When suffering from depression or anxiety, the individual's ability to cope with everyday
      life occupations is decreased, as well as the ability to relate to others. The Tree Theme
      Method® (TTM) is a treatment method. The purpose is to enhance the ability to develop
      strategies for occupations in everyday life and relationships with others. The method
      involves using creative activities to create a life story focusing on everyday occupations
      and to create an imagination of future possibilities/goals. The TTM is a short-term therapy
      with five sessions. The treatment also implies that the patient is asked to identify various
      homework tasks to perform between the sessions.

      The aim of the project is to investigate the effects of the TTM compared to a control group
      for people with depression and anxiety diagnosis. The intention is to examine the effect on
      outcome measures regarding psychological symptoms, everyday occupations and health. The study
      has been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board.

      The project is a randomized multicenter study with an intervention group and a control group.
      A total of 130 patients will be included. Inclusion criteria are patients with depression
      and/or anxiety in the age of 18-65 years and who have problems with their everyday
      occupations. Exclusion criteria are individuals with a severe somatic illness or psychosis
      and/or who have difficulties to understand and fill out self-rating questionnaires.

      The project implies that doctors will refer appropriate patients to the occupational
      therapist. After informed consent each patient will be drawn to the TTM or control. Before
      and after the treatment, as well as 3 and 12 months after finished treatment the patient will
      meet a project assistant in order to respond to questionnaires regarding psychological
      symptoms, everyday occupations and health.

      The study is a collaborative project involving the Region Skåne, Kronoberg County Council,
      and Jönköping County Council. Doctors will recruit patients and occupational therapists will
      perform the treatment. The research team comprise of researchers from Kronoberg County
      Council (B Gunnarsson and K Hedin), Lund University (C Håkansson) and School of Health
      Sciences in Jönköping (P Wagman).
