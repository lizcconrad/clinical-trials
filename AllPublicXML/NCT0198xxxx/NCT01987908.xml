  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder characterized by the presence of
      sickle-shaped red blood cells. In the U.S. and the U.K. this occurs primarily in persons of
      African origin. There is only one drug (hydroxyurea) approved to manage SCD, but it is not
      fully efficacious and can produce medically significant side effects. Aes-103 is being
      evaluated as a novel agent for the long term management of SCD. By directly reducing the
      sickling process, Aes-103 has a different mechanism of action than hydoxyurea. The active
      ingredient in Aes-103 is 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, a naturally occurring small molecule that
      is chemically related to glucose.

      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of two dosing regimens of
      Aes-103 for up to 28 days in up to 50 adult subjects with stable SCD compared with subjects
      receiving placebo.

      This study will evaluate evaluate in subjects with stable SCD the safety, pharmacokinetic
      profile, clinical pharmacology actions and clinical activities of two dosing regimens of
      Aes-103 (1000 mg four times daily in Cohort A and a higher or lower dose given once daily or
      up to four times daily in Cohort B) given for up to 28 days in adult subjects with stable SCD
      compared with subjects receiving placebo.

    <time_frame>At baseline and Day 49 during the post-treatment observation period</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated the degree to which their pain interfered with various daily functions by using the BPI short form. Interference with general activity was rated on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).
Baseline was defined as the most recent value obtained prior to the start of the dosing on Day 1 of the double-blind dosing period.</description>

        <description>A measure of the amount of oxygen in the blood. Oxygen saturation was determined by pulse oximetry. A pulse oximeter was placed over a nail polish-free finger nail to determine peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2).
Baseline was defined as the most recent value obtained prior to the start of dosing on Day 1 of the double-blind treatment period. A mean change from baseline &gt;0 indicates an increase in oxygen saturation, a mean change &lt;0 indicates a decrease in oxygen saturation.

        <title>Exercise Tolerance: 6-Minute Walk Distance on Day 49 of the Post-treatment Observation Period - Change From Last Day of Double-blind Treatment Period (Day 28)</title>
        <description>Functional exercise capacity was evaluated by using the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) which measures the distance that a subject can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes. Guidelines developed by the American Thoracic Society were used for conducting the test and interpreting the results.</description>

        <description>Participants assessed the change in activity limitations, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life by using the 1- to 7-point PGIC scale. The question and scale was as follows: Since beginning treatment at this clinic, how would you describe the change in your sickle cell condition? Please circle the number that matches your overall judgment. -3 - much worse -2 - moderately worse -1 - minimally worse 0 - no change +1 - minimally improved +2 - moderately improved +3 - much improved.
Baseline defined as the most recent value obtained prior to the start of dosing on Day 1 of the double-blind treatment period. No values available for placebo group for Day 28.

        <description>Participants assessed their pain levels by using the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale: 0 = No pain 1-3 = Mild pain (nagging, annoying, interfering little with activities of daily living [ADLs]) 4-6 = Moderate pain (interferes significantly with ADLs) 7-10 = Severe pain (disabling; unable to perform ADLs A negative mean change denotes a pain decrease. A positive mean change denotes an increase in pain. Baseline was defined as the average of all measures taken from screening through the period prior to start of dosing on Day 1.

        <title>Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): Worst Pain (Weekly Average) in the Post-treatment Observation Period - Change From Last Day of Double-blind Treatment Period (Day 28) - AUC</title>
        <description>Participants assessed their pain levels by using the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale: 0 = No pain 1-3 = Mild pain (nagging, annoying, interfering little with activities of daily living [ADLs]) 4-6 = Moderate pain (interferes significantly with ADLs) 7-10 = Severe pain (disabling; unable to perform ADLs A negative mean change denotes a pain decrease. A positive mean change denotes an increase in pain. Baseline was defined as the most recent value obtained on the last day of the double-blind dosing period (Day 28). Area under the curve (AUC) was computed using change from baseline (Day 28) in weekly average values at Day 35, Day 42 and Day 49.</description>

        <title>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI): Interference of Pain With Aspects of Life (General Activity) During Post-treatment Observation Period - Change From Baseline</title>
        <description>Participants rated the degree to which their pain interfered with various daily functions by using the BPI short form. Interference with general activity was rated on a scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).
Baseline was defined as the most recent value obtained prior to the start of the dosing on Day 1 of the double-blind dosing period.</description>
