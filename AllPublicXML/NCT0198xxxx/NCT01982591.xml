      This research trial studies heavy metal exposure in predicting peripheral neuropathy in
      patients with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Studying samples of blood
      and urine in the laboratory for heavy metal exposure from patients receiving chemotherapy may
      help doctors find out whether side effects from chemotherapy are related to heavy metal
      exposure.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the correlation, if any, of specific heavy metals with high grade symptoms of
      peripheral neuropathy, defined as grade &gt;= 3 peripheral neuropathy, (utilizing the Common
      Terminology Criterial for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v.] 4.0) in a cohort of breast
      cancer patients undergoing (neo)adjuvant taxane chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the range of specific heavy metals in a cohort of breast cancer patients
      undergoing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy treatment.

      II. To evaluate the reproducibility of sera and urine testing of heavy metal levels by
      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) testing in a cohort of breast cancer
      patients undergoing (neo)adjuvant taxane chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo serum and urine sample collection for heavy metal analysis by ICP-MS at
      baseline and at the completion of treatment. Patients also complete neurotoxicity assessment
      questionnaire at baseline and at the completion of treatment.

    <measure>Level of heavy metal in blood and urine</measure>
    <time_frame>The levels will be measured on a blood and urine sample obtained on the first day of chemotherapy, which is considered the first day of the study. The actual laboratory processing of the samples will occur in batches throughout the duration of the study.</time_frame>
    <description>Heavy metal levels will be characterized in participants being treated at participating sites. Means and variances and ranges of these levels will be tabulated.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of high grade neurotoxicity, defined as grade &gt;= 3 peripheral neuropathy, graded according to CTCAE v. 4.0</measure>
    <time_frame>Last day of chemotherapy approx.4-6 months from initiation, depending on chemotherapy regimen. Neurotoxicity grade will be assessed intermittently during course of therapy, with note of maximum grade made by clinician.</time_frame>
    <description>Neurotoxicity grade during chemotherapy will be obtained from the medical record and study doctor's notes. The maximum grade during the course of chemotherapy will be recorded. Frequencies of toxicities will be tabulated.</description>
