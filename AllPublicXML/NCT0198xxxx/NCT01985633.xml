  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common joint diseases.This disease commonly develops
      in the weight bearing joints of the lower limbs, such as the knee and hip joints.
      Osteoarthritis is considered a chronic degenerative disorder that is characterized by a loss
      of articular cartilage. Pathogenesis can involve all of the major articular tissues including
      cartilage, synovial membrane, subchondral bone and other connective tissues such as ligaments
      and tendons3. There is no effective therapy available today that alters the pathobiologic
      course of the disease.In view of vast role of platelet derived growth factors, mesenchymal
      cells and its safety, this prospective clinical trial is designed in an attempt to compare
      the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells enhanced with platelet rich plasma in early stages of
      knee osteoarthritis.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from adult
      tissues. These are characterized in vitro by their extensive proliferative ability in an
      uncommitted state while retaining the potential to differentiate along various lineages of
      mesenchymal origin, including chondrocyte, osteoblast, and adipocyte lineages, in response to
      appropriate stimuli.MSCs can be induced to undergo chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and
      in vivo. Centeno et al.in 2008 reported about the beneficial effects of autologous
      mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis of knee. The regenerative effects of MSCs in
      osteoarthritis can be due to their ability to differentiate themselves into chondrocytes and
      structurally repair the articular cartilage. Recently, MSCs have been shown to possess many
      potent paracrine effects through secretion of various soluble factors which can influence the
      local tissue environment and exert protective effects with an end result of effectively
      stimulating regeneration in situ. Recently Amgad etal.in their study reported even more
      effective results with use of platelet rich plasma along with mesenchymal stem cells.
      Platelets play an instrumental role in the normal healing response via the localsecretion of
      growth factors and recruitment of reparative cells. Its use in orthopaedic began early in
      this decade as PRP was used with bone grafts to augment spinal fusion and fracture healing.

      Wakitani et al. in 1994 described repair of defects in articular cartilage in rabbits.Murphy
      et al.studied the effects of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in caprine knee joints.Quarto
      et al.reported the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to repair a large musculoskeletal defect
      with successful healing of a large bone defect in three patients. Centeno et al. reported one
      case in which they showed that isolated and expanded autologous mesenchymal stem cells when
      percutaneously injected into a knee with symptomatic and radiographic osteoarthritis,
      resulted in significant cartilage growth, decreased pain and increased joint mobility. Mishra
      et al. reported that PRP could enhance the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, and that
      TGFbeta and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which are factors present within PRP,
      were important for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs.Hence present study is designed to
      study the efficacy of use of PRP enhanced mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis knee.

      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

        1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Platelet rich plasma enhanced autologous
           mesenchymal stem cells versus platelet rich plasma in knee osteoarthritis.

        2. To correlate the clinical improvement with the radiological findings.

    <description>Twelve patients will be placed in supine position with knee in full extension and under full aseptic precautions 10 ml of Mesenchymal stem cell suspension and 8-10 ml of platelet rich plasma would be injected by lateral approach with an 18-20 G needle</description>

    <description>About 100 ml of venous blood would be drawn with aseptic technique from the antecubital vein with an 18g needle , in order to avoid irritation and trauma to the platelets which are in a resting state. The blood would be collected in a 100 ml paediatric bag with CPDA(citrate phosphate dextrose adenine) as anti coagulant. A leucocyte filter will be also used to filter off the leucocytes. The blood will be then centrifuged for 15 min at 1300 rpm. This separates blood in to RBC( packed red blood cells) and platelet rich plasma. Next the PRP will be passed through a leucocyte filter to obtain leucocyte poor platelet rich plasma. 10 ml of PRP will be dispensed in a sterile syringe. The PRP would be used for injection.</description>

    <description>About 8-10ml of bone marrow would be aspirated under strict aseptic precautions, cell fractionationated with Ficoll sol,centrifuged at 1100rpm for 20-30 mins. Buffy layer will be centrifuged again at 1100 rpm for another 20-30 mins. The pellet thus formed will be suspended in 5ml of culture medium. The nucleated stem cells thus isolated, will be incubated at 37deg.C under 5%CO2 in culture flasks for about 4-6weeks. Those cells adherent to flask removed with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA sol and characterised . Those positive for CD90 and CD105 and negative for CD45 and CD34 will be the mesenchymal stem cells. These will then be expanded to 10Ã—106 for use.</description>
