    <textblock>
      The long term goal is to improve the quality and equity of chronic pain treatment among VA
      patients. The primary objective of this study is to improve pain outcomes among black VA
      patients with chronic, musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, who experience poorer pain treatment and
      outcomes than their white counterparts. The work proposed is expected to result in a
      non-pharmacological intervention, delivered by telephone, designed to reduce pain and improve
      functioning among black patients with MSK pain, by promoting walking. This intervention is
      specifically designed to address factors that contribute to MSK pain among black Veterans;
      however, the investigators expect that it will also benefit non-black Veterans. The proposed
      research is innovative, in its use of proactive outreach and recent advances in
      self-regulation strategies (such as Action Planning) to help black Veterans overcome
      psychological, environmental, utilization-related, and provider-related barriers that
      contribute to pain.

      BACKGROUND/RATIONALE:

      Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is one of the most common conditions among Veterans,
      affecting approximately 60% of those seen in VA primary care. Although perceived
      effectiveness of chronic pain treatment is low among all VA patients, black patients are less
      likely than whites to perceive their treatment as effective, and are more likely to
      experience functional limitations due to pain. There is growing consensus that chronic pain
      is best addressed by a biopsychosocial approach that acknowledges the role of psychological
      and environmental contributors to pain, some of which differ by race and hence contribute to
      disparities. For example, blacks experience greater pain-related fear and lower self-efficacy
      in coping with pain (psychological contributors), and neighborhoods that make physical
      activity difficult (environmental contributors). However, there is a lack of effective
      interventions to improve pain treatment among minority patients, particularly those that
      target psychological and environmental contributors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      The long term goal is to improve the quality and equity of pain treatment in order to improve
      pain outcomes for all Veterans. The objective of this application is to test the
      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention that specifically targets known barriers to
      effective pain care among black Veterans with chronic MSK pain. The primary hypothesis is
      that a telephone-delivered intervention, which emphasizes walking and incorporates Action
      Planning, Motivational Interviewing (MI) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques,
      and the use of pedometers, will improve core chronic pain outcomes in black Veterans.
      Secondarily, we will determine whether our intervention also benefits non-black patients with
      MSK.

      METHODS:

      The investigators propose a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention
      compared with usual care (UC) among 250 black and 250 non-black patients with chronic MSK
      pain. Patients from the Atlanta VAMC will be identified using administrative data. Patients
      will be screened by phone, and, if eligible, will be mailed the baseline survey to complete
      and mail back. Eligible patients who complete the baseline survey will be randomly assigned
      to the usual care (UC) or intervention condition (IC). Intervention participants will receive
      a pedometer-mediated walking intervention that will incorporate Action Planning and the use
      of MI and CBT techniques. The intervention will be delivered in 6 telephone counseling
      sessions over three months. Patients in the UC condition will receive an informational
      brochure and a pedometer. The study is powered to find a difference between the IC and UC
      groups within the black and non-black groups. The primary outcome is chronic pain-related
      physical functioning, assessed by the revised Roland and Morris Disability Questionnaire, a
      measure recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in
      Clinical Trials (IMMPACT). We will also examine whether the intervention improves other
      IMMPACT-recommended domains (pain intensity, emotional functioning, and ratings of overall
      improvement). Secondary objectives include examining potential mediators targeted by the
      intervention, exploring whether the intervention affects service utilization and use of
      opioid analgesics, and exploring whether the intervention reduces racial disparities in pain
      outcomes. Measures will be assessed by mail and phone survey at baseline, 3 months, and 6
      months. Data analysis of primary aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology.

      FINDINGS:

      None at this time.

      STATUS:

      Focus groups were conducted at the Atlanta VAMC in September and October 2015. These focus
      groups provided valuable information that led us to refine our recruitment materials. Focus
      groups also yielded important information for our counselors, including potential
      communication barriers and barriers to walking. During January - April 2016, we conducted a
      pilot test of our intervention with 3 participants. We began the trial on July 2016, and it
      is currently ongoing.

      IMPACT:

      The work proposed is expected to result in a non-pharmacological intervention, delivered by
      telephone, designed to reduce pain and improve functioning among black patients with MSK
      pain, by promoting walking.

             the brief screening survey.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The investigators will not include any vulnerable populations or those who meet any of the
        following exclusion criteria that may interfere with the outcome assessment: a) moderately
        severe cognitive impairment defined as &gt; 2 errors on a brief cognitive screener; b)
        anticipated back, knee, hip, or other major surgery within the next 6 months; c) patients
        who say they are unable to walk at least a block; d) patients who say they would be
        unavailable to participate in a 6 month study; e) patients with active psychotic symptoms,
        suicidality, and/or active manic episode or poorly controlled bipolar disorder, as
        determined by chart review.
