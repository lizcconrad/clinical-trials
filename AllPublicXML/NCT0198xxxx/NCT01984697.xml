  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 37-month safety and immunogenicity study conducted in boys and girls 9 to 14
      years of age and in young women 16 to 26 years of age. From this study, the goal is to
      establish that the investigational 2-dose regimens (0, 6 months and 0, 12 months) studied in
      boys and girls 9 to 14 years of age are generally safe and immunogenic, with an antibody
      response that is not inferior to that observed in young women 16 to 26 years of age who
      received the standard 3-dose regimen of V503 (i.e., the population and dose regimen used to
      establish V503 efficacy).
