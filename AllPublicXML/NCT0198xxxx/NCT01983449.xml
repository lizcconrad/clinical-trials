  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the safety and effectiveness of adventitial deposition of the Study Drug in
      reducing inflammation and restenosis in patients with clinical evidence of claudication or
      critical limb ischemia and an angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral
      and/or popliteal arteries.

      Study Drug and Dose: Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection, USP, 4 mg/ml, with dilute
      contrast (17%) administered to the adventitia in a dose of 1.6 mg per cm of desired vessel
      treatment length.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will examine the ability for adventitial dexamethasone to safely delay restenosis
      in patients at least 18 years of age, who have peripheral atherosclerotic lesions involving
      the superficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries. These patients have no current therapeutic
      alternatives beyond the procedure used to open, or revascularize, their superficial femoral
      and/or popliteal arteries. Metal stents have the potential to fracture when implanted in this
      artery segment due to continual flexion and bending of the knee. It is desirable to improve
      the patency of this artery after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and/or
      atherectomy-based revascularization.
