  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: The aims were to measure one year change in caloric compensation (CC) and eating
      in the absence of hunger (EAH) in 3 to 6 year-old French children in their regular eating
      context and to link these change with individual characteristics (adiposity, age, gender) and
      maternal feeding practices.

      Three series of measurements of caloric compensation (CC) and eating in the absence of hunger
      (EAH) were conducted: at baseline, and 3 (FU3M) and 15 (FU15M) months later. Each serie of
      measurement was composed of three consecutive weeks an identical lunch was served in four
      preschool canteens reaching 236 children. The first lunch was a control session. For the CC
      situation (week 2), thirty minutes before the lunch children were offered a preload (137
      kcal). For the EAH situation (week 3), ten minutes after lunch children were exposed to
      palatable foods (430 kcal). Food intake was measured at the individual level. Maternal eating
      behaviour and feeding practices were measured by questionnaires. Child's height and weight
      were measured by a medical doctor.

    <time_frame>one week</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the change in caloric compensation across time, caloric compensation was measured at baseline, 3 and 15 months after baseline, in the same conditions. At each time point to assess caloric compensation, children were offered a chocolate bun 30 minutes before the lunch. The food intake at lunch was recorded. We calculated if children compensated the chocolate bun, by comparing energy intake at this lunch with energy intake from a control lunch which took place one week before.</description>

    <description>In order to evaluate the change in eating in the absence of hunger across time, a measurement was conducted at baseline, 3 months and 15 months after baseline. To collect the measurement of eating in the absence of hunger, we offered palatable foods to children 10 minutes after their lunch. We recorded the energy intake from these post-meal foods. At each time point, this measurement was conducted one week after the measurement of caloric compensation.</description>

    <description>Using a validated questionnaire, we collected information about maternal feeding practices (Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire, Musher-Eizenman &amp; Holub, 2007) and eating behaviour (Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, Van Strien, 1986).</description>
