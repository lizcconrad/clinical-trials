      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of endoluminal rectal
      prolapse repair under sedation and local anesthesia using CO2 colonoscopy to fix the rectum
      with sutures to the abdominal wall under needlescopic control. Further, investigators will
      evaluate the short and long-term clinical outcomes after this novel approach to treating
      rectal prolapse.

      .Aims/Objective The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of
      endoluminal rectal prolapse repair under sedation and local anesthesia using CO2 colonoscopy
      to fix the rectum with sutures to the abdominal wall under needlescopic control. Further, we
      will evaluate the short and long-term clinical outcomes after this new procedure.

      Primary Outcomes

        1. Feasibility: successful completion of endoluminal rectal prolapse repair with
           needlescopic assistance

        2. Safety: measured by the incidence of the Intraoperative complications (bowel
           perforation, organ injury and bleeding requiring blood transfusion)

        3. Sedation and local anesthesia feasibility: surgery completed without patient intubation

        4. Clinical Outcomes: rectal prolapse recurrence within 30 days, length of hospital stay
           and postsurgical complications

        5. Long Term Clinical Outcomes: Rectal Prolapse Recurrence

      Methods Design: A prospective pilot study with 10 patients who will be undergoing Combined
      Needlescopic and Endoluminal (Colonoscopic) Surgery under sedation and local anesthesia for
      Rectal Prolapse Repair with the Colon and Rectal Surgeons at WCMC. Data will be collected
      prospectively before, during, and after surgery.

      Settings: Colon and Rectal Surgery at WCMC-NYPH Population: Patients male and female above 75
      years of age, with rectal prolapse will be invited to participate in the study after surgery
      is deemed necessary for standard treatment of their medical conditions.
