      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of sub-callosal cingulate (SCC) deep
      brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD).

      The working hypotheses are that long pulse-width DBS applied to the SCC region will lead to
      improvements in TRD patients, and specific neuroimaging biomarkers will correlate with
      response to DBS; the functional recovery will be enhanced with concurrent cognitive
      behavioural therapy (CBT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to collect data on prediction, optimization and augmentation of DBS for TRD and
      develop tools for DBS surgery. It is a biological pilot study designed to provide informative
      data for future work.
