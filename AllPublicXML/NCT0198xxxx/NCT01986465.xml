    <description>The trial pharmacist prepares a series of similar vials containing either 4 mg of Depomedrol or Normal Saline and coded them either 1, 2, 3 or 4, the group assignments are not decoded until the end of the trial when the final analysis is due to take place. Patients take their envelopes to the trial pharmacist who give them a coded vial which they take to the orthopaedic surgeon who make the injection. After the injection the trial clerk take the patients to a technician who give patients in groups 1 and 3 long arm splints.</description>
