      The clinical trial aims at showing efficacy of prebiotics and the probiotic on microbiota
      balance. Together, the prebiotic solution in combination with the probiotic is expected to
      harmonize the microbiota of formula fed neonates with the microbiota of breast fed neonates
      and to allow a greater diversity of Bifidobacteria species in comparison with a formula
      non-supplemented with pre and probiotics.

      The infants will be recruited and randomized between 0 and 14 days. The intervention period,
      in terms of data necessary for the primary outcome, will be until they reach 3 months old.
      Measurements will be collected on three separate occasions during this period, i.e. 2 and 6
      weeks and 3 months. Stools will be collected, on 3 separate occasions, i.e. 4-5 day, 6 weeks
      and 3 months of life.
