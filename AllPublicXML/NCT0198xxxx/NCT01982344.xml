    <textblock>
      To compare the effect of mini-exchange-room and usual care on physical activity and quality
      of life in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients through a randomized controlled study. A total
      of 80 incident CAPD patients with age of 18~80 years old will be enrolled, who are medically
      stable and regularly followed up. The one group perform traditional PD procedure (G1), and
      the other group will utilize disposable mini-exchange-room group (G2). Two groups will be
      followed for 6 months. Biochemistry data, types of space for bag exchange, physical activity
      and quality of life will also be collected for all subjects at the 3rd and 6th month. During
      the study period, peritonitis episode, acute comorbidity and hospitalization will be
      recorded. The change of physical activity, quality of life and peritonitis rate will be
      compared between the two groups.
