  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile (what the
      body does to the medication) of esketamine when given by the intranasal route (through the
      nose) to healthy adult Japanese and Caucasian participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label single-center study with 2 cohorts (groups). The study will consist of
      a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a follow-up visit (9 to 13 days after the last dose
      of the study drug). During the screening phase, participants will be evaluated to determine
      if they meet the study eligibility criteria. A target of 14 healthy Japanese and 14 healthy
      Caucasian adult participants (20 to 55 years of age inclusive) will be enrolled in Cohort 1
      and Cohort 2, respectively.

      The participants in each cohort will self-administer each of the 3 different single-dose
      regimens of intranasal esketamine (Treatments A, B, and C) over the 3 treatment periods (ie,
      1 treatment per period) in an open-label manner (both the investigator and the participant
      knows which intervention the participant receives). The participants will be randomly (like
      the toss of a coin) assigned to receive Treatment A and Treatment B in the first two periods
      (ie, Treatment A in Period 1 and Treatment B in Period 2, or the reverse order). All
      participants will receive Treatment C in Period 3. The regimens differ in the number of
      sprays to achieve the total dose and the total esketamine dose administered.

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated throughout the study and will include assessment of
      adverse events, targeted nasal examinations, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, physical
      examination, pulse oximetery, and vital signs.
