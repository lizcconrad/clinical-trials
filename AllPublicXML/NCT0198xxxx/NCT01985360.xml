      The purpose of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine the best management strategy for
      patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD), at least moderate ischemia and advanced
      chronic kidney disease (CKD; estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;30 or on dialysis).
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 777 randomized participants with
      advanced CKD. Participants were assigned at random to a routine invasive strategy (INV) with
      cardiac catheterization (cath) followed by revascularization (if suitable) plus optimal
      medical therapy (OMT) or to a conservative strategy (CON) of OMT, with cath and
      revascularization reserved for those who fail OMT. The trial is designed to run seamlessly in
      parallel to the main ISCHEMIA trial as a companion trial.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

      A. Primary Aim. The primary aim of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial is to determine whether an invasive
      strategy of cardiac catheterization followed by optimal revascularization, in addition to
      OMT, will reduce the primary composite endpoint of death or nonfatal myocardial infarction in
      participants with SIHD and advanced CKD over an average follow-up of approximately 2.8 years
      compared with an initial conservative strategy of OMT alone with catheterization reserved for
      those who fail OMT. The primary endpoint is time to centrally adjudicated death or nonfatal
      myocardial infarction (MI).

      B. Secondary Aims. Major: To compare the incident of the composite of death, nonfatal MI,
      resuscitated cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure; angina
      control per SAQ Angina Frequency Scale; disease specific quality of life per SAQ Quality of
      Life Scale between the INV and CON strategies. Other secondary aims include: comparing the
      incidence of the composite of death, nonfatal MI, hospitalization for unstable angina,
      hospitalization for heart failure, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke; composite of
      death, nonfatal MI, or stroke; composite endpoints incorporating cardiovascular death;
      composite endpoints incorporating other definitions of MI as defined in the clinical event
      charter; individual components of the primary and major secondary endpoints; stroke and
      health resource utilization, costs, and cost effectiveness.

      BACKGROUND:

      Among patients with advanced CKD, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death,15-30
      times higher than the age-adjusted cardiovascular mortality rate in the general population.
      The projected 4-year mortality is &gt;50% in patients with advanced CKD and is worse than that
      for patients in the general population who have cancers, heart failure, stroke or MI.
      Participants with advanced CKD are 5-10 times more likely to die than to reach end stage
      renal disease (ESRD). Despite this, ~80% of contemporary coronary artery disease (CAD) trials
      exclude participants with advanced CKD. Most of the treatments aimed at reducing
      cardiovascular events in advanced CKD are therefore extrapolated from cohorts without
      advanced CKD. Participants with advanced CKD and cardiovascular disease are undertreated with
      less frequent use of statins and revascularization therapies, and the optimal management
      approach to these patients is unknown. Participants with advanced CKD are notably
      underrepresented in contemporary trials comparing revascularization with medical therapy in
      SIHD patients, such as the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes
      (BARI 2D) trial or the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug
      Evaluation (COURAGE) trial,making any assessment about the efficacy of revascularization plus
      medical therapy vs. initial medical therapy alone in this cohort problematic.

      Participants with advanced CKD are at increased risk for complications of the assigned
      invasive procedure, specifically contrast-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis, major
      bleeding and short-term risk of death. However, there is controversy in the medical
      literature regarding the incidence (&lt;1% to &gt;30%), effective treatment (saline hydration,
      N-acetyl cysteine, or sodium bicarbonate) and prognosis of contrast induced AKI (&lt;0.5% to &gt;5%
      requiring dialysis). In addition although contrast induced AKI have been associated with
      increase in short-term mortality residual confounding in these studies makes interpretation
      difficulty. Moreover it is unknown if these short-term increased risks are offset by
      long-term benefits. Limited observational study in the CKD cohort suggests a survival benefit
      of revascularization when compared with medical therapy alone long-term, despite increase in
      short-term risks. However, the medical therapy in these trials was not optimized, drug
      eluting stents were rarely used and there is undoubtedly inherent selection and ascertainment
      bias with observational studies. The above has resulted in substantial clinical equipoise in
      the management of these patients with the rates of revascularization of only around 10-45%.
      The results of ISCHEMIA-CKD will have profound implications for guidelines, health policy,
      and clinical practice.

    <description>Narrowed blood vessels can be opened without surgery using stents or can be bypassed with surgery. To determine which is the best approach for you the doctor needs to look at your blood vessels to see where the narrowings are and how much narrowing there is. This is done by a procedure known as a cardiac catheterization.</description>

    <description>Artery narrowing is bypassed during surgery with a healthy artery or vein from another part of the body. This is known as coronary artery bypass grafting, or CABG (said &quot;cabbage&quot;). The surgery creates new routes around narrowed and blocked heart arteries. This allows more blood flow to the heart.</description>
