    <textblock>
      Background: The Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) acquired by Diffusion Weighted Imaging
      (DWI-MR) has been shown to correlate with cellular density. The ADC is indicative of Gross
      Tumour Volume (GTV), and preliminary data shows that the dynamics of DWI volumes during
      treatment (shrinkage) as well as dose to DWI volumes has impact on treatment outcome.

      Hypoxic tumour cells within the primary tumour have been identified to have prognostic
      importance for local control Tumour hypoxia is caused by insufficiency of the tumour
      vasculature leading to both chronic diffusion limited and acute flow limited hypoxia.
      Radioresistant hypoxic cells diminish the rate of local control, and the hypoxia driven
      increase in metastatic potential of the tumour and lowers the rate of distant disease
      control. Functional imaging has the potential to visualise radioresistant tumour subvolumes.
      PET scanning (18F-FAZA) is hypothesized to visualise hypoxic tumour subvolumes, and dynamic
      contrast enhanced (DCE) MR imaging has been used to quantify the extent of poor perfusion
      regions within cervical tumours.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

      Sensitivity and specificity of functional imaging (18F-FAZA PET (optional), T1w, T2w, DWI-MRI
      and DCE-MRI) to identify tumours with good and bad response to radio-chemotherapy

      Secondary:

      Determining whether there are differences in bias between centre. The difference in bias will
      be assessed for the T1 and T2 scans and the Ktrans and ADC maps.
