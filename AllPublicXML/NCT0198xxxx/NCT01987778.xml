  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today's women will live more than a third of their lives after menopause, i.e. with a changed
      hormonal and metabolic state. Vasomotor symptoms like hot flushes and sweating are reported
      by about 75% of all women around menopause and may impair well-being, mental state, daily
      activities and night sleep. Vasomotor symptoms are less prevalent in women who participate in
      regular physical exercise. It is, however, still uncertain if physical exercise reduces
      vasomotor symptoms.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to establish possible beneficial health
      effects from 15 weeks of supervised resistance training (RT) on postmenopausal women.
      End-points include effects from RT in postmenopausal women on

        1. clinical outcomes (number and severity of vasomotor symptoms, Health-Related quality of
           Life (HRQoL), Body Mass Index (BMI), abdominal height, muscle strength and mass,
           browning of fat),

        2. diagnostic variables (production of myokines as irisin, immunological markers) and

        3. genetic variables (length of telomeres).

      The control group will be offered resistance training after the intervention period.

      The first phase is planned as a pilot-study including 20 women participating for 15 weeks.
      Thereafter an evaluation of the sample size and the study methodology will be made.

Furthermore, the MRI images will be used to quantify the volume of and fat concentration in supraclavicular and interscapular brown adipose tissue according to our recently published measurement protocol (Lidell 2013, Borga 2013), as well as the volume of the major extensor and flexor muscles (Karlsson 2013).</description>
