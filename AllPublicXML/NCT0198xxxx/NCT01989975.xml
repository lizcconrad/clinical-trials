      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance, patient satisfaction and safety of
      connectivity gateway device CareLink Connect, transferring CGM data from a VEO insulin pump
      to CareLink online (every 5th minute) and thereby making it available for patients or Care
      Partners individual web connected devices such as smartphones, tablets and PCs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject between the age of 12 - 65 years that has a clinical diagnosis of insulin
             requiring diabetes for at least 1 year

          2. Subject is currently using a Paradigm® Veo™ Medtronic insulin pump for at least 3
             months and willing to continue to use for the duration of the study.

          3. Subject has sufficient Continuous Glucose Monitoring use experience, as determined by
             the Investigator, and is willing to continuously use CGM for the duration of the
             study.

             Guidelines to evaluate the patients experience are:

             i. Subject has a minimum of 30 days of CGM use within a year prior to enrollment.

             ii. Subject has experience with and is able to, or has a Care Partner who can:

               1. Insert/change sensor,

               2. Recharge the transmitter.

               3. Read sensor data in real-time on the insulin pump screen.

          4. Subject is willing to, or has a Care Partner who can, perform at least the minimum
             required (2 per day) Blood Glucose readings to maintain CGM Sensor calibration.

          5. Subject, if under the age of 18, has a Care Partner who is willing to participate to
             the study, attend the study visit with the subject, and complete user's feedback
             questionnaires and Care Partner diary. Care Partners are optional for patients of 18
             years of age or older.

          6. Subject and/or Care Partner have access to a computer with Internet access.

          7. Subject and/or Care Partner have access to an Internet connected device.

          8. Subject, or their legal guardian, is willing to allow a Care Partner to receive and
             view information transmitted by their Paradigm® Veo™ Medtronic insulin pump to a
             Mobile phone/Smartphone/tablet/PC via the CareLink Connect/CareLink Personal System.

          9. Subject is willing to keep CareLink Connect device in the same room as themselves or
             regularly carry the study device with them and maintain its operational status (at
             approximately 16h per 24h).

         10. Subject is willing to keep a short diary during the device use reporting time periods
             away(for more than one hour) from the CareLink Connect device.

         11. Subject is in good general health as judged by the PI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subject is pregnant, per urine pregnancy test performed at screening in women
             of child-bearing potential

          2. Female subject plans to become pregnant during the course of the study

          3. Subject is unable to tolerate tape adhesives of the infusion set and CGM sensor

          4. Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of the pump infusion set
             or the CGM sensor placement (e.g. psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection)

          5. The subject has known cellular connectivity problem at their home

          6. The subject is by the PI judged ineligible or unable to perform the study procedures
