  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell nephropathy (SCN) is a progressive complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) that
      begins in childhood and results in renal (kidney) failure and early mortality in nearly 12%
      of adults with hemoglobin SS (HbSS). The potential for prevention and reversal of kidney
      damage in SCD is not known. Albuminuria is a commonly used biomarker of glomerular damage;
      however the correlations of albuminuria with specific measurements of glomerular function and
      pathophysiology have not been determined. The investigators hypothesize that in patients with
      persistent albuminuria despite treatment of SCD with hydroxyurea, losartan will reverse
      kidney dysfunction in early stage nephropathy and ameliorate progressive kidney dysfunction
      in more advanced nephropathy. The primary aim is to study the acute and longer-term effects
      of losartan (study drug) on specific glomerular functions in children and adults with SCD who
      have persistent albuminuria. Research glomerular function tests will be done at study entry
      (prior to taking losartan), 1 month, and 1 to 2 years after starting losartan therapy
      (participants may take losartan for up to 24 months). In addition, participants are seen each
      month in clinic and assessed by their regular clinical team. The second aim is to assess the
      correlation of changes in albuminuria after 1 month of losartan with changes in direct
      measurements of glomerular function at 12-24 months, thus determining if the magnitude of the
      initial decrease in albuminuria in response to losartan predicts sustained improvements in
      renal function.

      Sickle cell nephropathy (SCN) is a progressive complication of sickle cell disease (SCD) that
      begins in childhood and results in renal (kidney) failure and early mortality in nearly 12%
      of adults with hemoglobin SS (HbSS). The potential for prevention and reversal of kidney
      damage in SCD is not known. Albuminuria is a commonly used biomarker of glomerular damage;
      however the correlations of albuminuria with specific measurements of glomerular function and
      pathophysiology have not been determined. The investigators hypothesize that in patients with
      persistent albuminuria despite treatment of SCD with hydroxyurea, losartan will reverse
      kidney dysfunction in early stage nephropathy and ameliorate progressive kidney dysfunction
      in more advanced nephropathy. Losartan is an FDA-approved drug to treat blood pressure to
      protect the kidneys in people who have diseases like diabetes and blood pressure. It is not
      specifically labeled for use in sickle cell disease. Participants will be enrolled from
      Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (pediatric subjects) or Grady Memorial Hospital (adult
      subjects) and will be in the study for 1 to 2 years (depending on when the final renal
      function tests can be preformed).

      The primary aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the acute and longer-term effects of
      losartan (study drug) on renal function in children and adults with SCD who have persistent
      albuminuria. The renal function tests will be done at study entry (prior to taking losartan),
      1 month, and 1 to 2 years after starting losartan therapy. In addition, participants are
      assessed monthly by their regular clinical team. The second aim of this study is to assess
      the correlation of changes in albuminuria after 1 month of losartan with changes in direct
      measurements of renal function at 12-24 months, thus determining if the magnitude of the
      initial decrease in albuminuria in response to losartan predicts sustained improvements in
      renal function.

    <description>Adults and Children &gt;50 kg:
Those with systolic blood pressure (SBP) â‰¥ 100 mm Hg at entry will start with 50 mg of oral losartan once daily. At the week 2 visit, losartan will be increased to 100 mg daily.
Those with SBP &lt;100 mm Hg at entry will start with 25 mg of oral losartan once daily. Participants will return after 1 week for titration to 50 mg daily, if tolerated (i.e. SBP not lower than pre-losartan measurement by 10 mm Hg or more), and after 2 weeks to monitor blood pressure.
Children &lt;50 kg weight:
Treatment will start with 25 mg oral Losartan once daily given as a morning dose. At the 2 week visit, Losartan will be increased to 50 mg daily. The dose will be increased to 100 mg once a body weight of 50 kg is achieved.</description>
