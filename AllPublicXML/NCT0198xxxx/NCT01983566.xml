  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the effect of food with different fat content and
      of gastric pH increase (mediated by multiple dosing of omeprazole) on the relative
      bioavailability of deleobuvir.

             and judged clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the study
             drug(s)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy), other neurological

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>It was planned that 16 healthy Caucasian subjects (males and females, at least one third of each sex) and 16 healthy Japanese subjects (both males + females, at least one third of each sex) would enter the study. They were recruited from the volunteers' pool of the trial site. Due to early study termination, no Japanese subjects were randomised.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility to participate in the trial. Subjects attended specialist sites which would then ensure that the subject met all strictly implemented inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Subjects were not to be randomised to trial treatment if any one of the specific entry criteria were violated.</pre_assignment_details>
