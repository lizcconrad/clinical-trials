  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes is critical for maintaining
           genomic stability by regulating a variety of DNA damage repair mechanisms.

        -  BMN 673 is a PARP inhibitor with greater in vitro activity than any other PARP inhibitor
           currently in development. BMN 673 has been shown to cause single-agent synthetic
           lethality in BRCA1/2- and PTEN-deficient cell lines, and has potent antitumor activity
           in animal models of tumors harboring mutations in DNA repair pathways.

        -  BMN 673 is showing promising single-agent activity in patients with advanced ovarian and
           breast cancer harboring deleterious BRCA mutations.

        -  This pilot study will evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of BMN 673 on DNA damage and
           apoptosis markers in tumor biopsy tissue.

      Primary Objective:

      -Determine the pharmacodynamic effect of BMN 673 in tumor biopsies from patients with
      advanced ovarian, breast, or other solid tumor and deleterious BRCA mutations.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Determine the response rate (CR + PR) of treatment with BMN 673 in patients with
           advanced ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma and deleterious BRCA mutations.

        -  Determine the response rate (CR + PR) of treatment with BMN 673 in patients with
           advanced breast carcinoma and deleterious BRCA mutations.

        -  Determine the response rate (CR + PR) of treatment with BMN 673 in patients with
           advanced solid tumor (other than breast or ovarian) and deleterious BRCA mutations.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adult patients with documented deleterious BRCA 1 or 2 mutations with histologically
           confirmed ovarian, primary peritoneal, breast, prostate, pancreas, gastric or other
           solid tumor whose disease has progressed following at least one standard therapy or who
           have no acceptable standard treatment options.

        -  No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment,
           and recovered from toxicities of prior therapies to at least eligibility levels.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age; ECOG performance status less than equal to
           2

        -  Adequate organ function.

        -  Willingness to undergo tumor biopsies.

      Study Design:

        -  BMN 673 will be administered orally each day in 28-day cycles.

        -  Dosing will be at the established recommended Phase II dose of 1000 mcg/day each day for

           28 days.

        -  We plan to accrue a total of 12 evaluable patients per cohort for a total of 36
           patients. To allow for some patients who will not be evaluable, the accrual ceiling is
           42 patients.

        -  Tumor biopsies will be mandatory at baseline (pre-dose), and then approximately 3-6
           hours post BMN 673 on day 8. An optional tumor biopsy may also be collected at time of
           disease progression.

      SCHEMA

        -  BMN 673 is administered orally each day in 28-day cycles

        -  Tumor biopsies will be performed at baseline (pre-treatment) and 3-6 hrs post dose on
           cycle 1 day 8. An optional tumor biopsy may also be collected at time of disease
           progression. Tumor biopsies will be evaluated for PAR levels, DNA damage response
           markers such as &gt;=H2AX, cleaved caspase 3, ERCC1, pNbs1, XPF, RAD51, and pT1989ATR, and,
           as indicators of ATR/ATM activation, chk1 and chk2

        -  Blood samples for CTC analyses will be collected at baseline (pre-treatment), on cycle 1
           day 1(3-6 hours post dose), on cycle 1 day 8 (3-6 hours post dose), and on cycle 2 day 1
           (3-6 hours post dose)

        -  Blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on cycle 1 day 1 pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2,
           3, 4, 6,8, and 24 hours post-dose, on cycle 1 day 8 (3-6 hours post dose), and on cycle
           2 day 1 predose and 3-6 hours post dose.

      Background:

        -  The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes is critical for maintaining
           genomic stability by regulating a variety of DNA damage repair mechanisms.

        -  Talazoparib (BMN 673) is a PARP inhibitor with greater in vitro activity than any other
           PARP inhibitor currently in development. Talazoparib (BMN 673) has been shown to cause
           single-agent synthetic lethality in BRCA1/2- and PTEN-deficient cell lines, and has
           potent antitumor activity in animal models of tumors harboring mutations in DNA repair
           pathways.

        -  Talazoparib (BMN 673) is showing promising single-agent activity in patients with
           advanced ovarian and breast cancer harboring deleterious BRCA mutations.

        -  This pilot study will evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of talazoparib (BMN 673) on
           DNA damage and apoptosis markers in tumor biopsy tissue.

      Primary Objective:

      -Determine the pharmacodynamic effect of talazoparib (BMN 673) in tumor biopsies from
      patients with advanced ovarian, breast, or other solid tumor and deleterious BRCA mutations.

      Secondary Objectives:

      -Determine the response rate (CR + PR) of treatment with talazoparib (BMN 673) in patients
      with deleterious BRCA mutations.

      Eligibility:

        -  Adult patients with documented deleterious BRCA 1 or 2 mutations with histologically
           confirmed ovarian, primary peritoneal, breast, prostate, pancreas, gastric or other
           solid tumor whose disease has progressed following at least one standard therapy or who
           have no acceptable standard treatment options.

        -  No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment,
           and recovered from toxicities of prior therapies to at least eligibility levels.

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age; ECOG performance status less than equal to
           2

        -  Adequate organ function.

        -  Willingness to undergo tumor biopsies.

      Study Design:

        -  Talazoparib (BMN 673) will be administered orally each day in 28-day cycles.

        -  Dosing will be at the established recommended Phase II dose of 1000 microgram/day each
           day for 28 days.

        -  To meet the primary, pharmacodynamic endpoint of the trial, we plan to accrue a total of
           12 patients with matched, evaluable baseline and day 8 biopsies. To allow for some
           patients whose biopsies will not be evaluable (i.e., will contain &lt;5% tumor content),
           the accrual ceiling is 24 patients. The number of patients evaluable for objective
           response, while relevant to the secondary objective of the trial, will not be considered
           in determining completion of accrual.

        -  Tumor biopsies will be mandatory at baseline (pre-dose), and then approximately 3-6
           hours post talazoparib (BMN 673) on day 8. One optional tumor biopsy may also be
           collected either on day 1 (+/- 2 days) of the cycle following any restaging at which a
           10-19% increase in tumor volume is observed (according to RECIST criteria) if the
           patient has been on study for at least 4 cycles, or at time of disease progression.

        creatinine levels above institutional normal.

        The effects of BMN 673 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
        because PARP inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and
        men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
        abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 30 days
        after completing study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
        while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating
        physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use
        adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for
        3 months after completion of BMN 673 administration.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets or capsules. Nasogastric or G-tube
             administration is not allowed. Any gastrointestinal disease which would impair ability
             to swallow, retain, or absorb drug is not allowed.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer or ovarian cancer should have
             received at least two lines of systemic therapy in the advanced setting.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.
             Patients who have had prior treatment with any PARP inhibitors are ineligible.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded
             from this clinical trial. Patients whose brain metastatic disease status has remained
             stable for greater than or equal to 4 weeks following treatment of brain metastases
             are eligible to participate at the discretion of the principal investigator.

          -  Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances with the potential to
             affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of BMN 673 will be determined following review
             by the principal investigator.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of the study drugs on
             the developing fetus are unknown.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with BMN 673. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow
             suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving
             combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Patients who require use of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin are
             excluded. Low molecular weight heparin is permitted for prophylactic or therapeutic
             use. Low-dose warfarin (less than or equal to 1 mg/day) is permitted.

          -  Women who are currently lactating
