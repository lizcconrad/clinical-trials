  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind study with respect to the diluents used, with patients known to be
      allergic to the specific allergen tested. Three study sites will be involved, each testing
      one allergen (Cat, Mite, Timothy grass pollen). Subjects who are known to be allergic to the
      allergen in question will be tested with serial three-fold dilutions to determine the ID 50
      and relative extract potency using the method described by Turkeltaub.

      The specific objective of this study is to determine the stability of immunotherapy extract
      dilutions. Higher dilutions (lower potency) have been shown in vitro to decrease in potency
      over time more rapidly than less dilute preparations. The investigators hope to determine
      whether there is a detectable difference in skin test reaction of dilutions of three common
      antigens (Cat, Timothy Grass, Dust Mite). The diluents used strongly affect the strength when
      extract potency is tested in vitro. Therefore, the investigators expect to find a detectable
      difference in skin test potency based on the diluents used (Saline vs. HSA Saline
      [300mcg/ml]).
