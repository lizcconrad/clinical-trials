  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gallstone formation is multifactorial: immutable risk factors include genetics and ethnicity,
      age and being female, and mutable risk factors include obesity, and metabolic syndrome, diet,
      rapid weight loss, and other conditions such as cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
      syndrome, gallbladder stasis, and the use of certain drugs like Ceftriazone. Previous studies
      have linked serum cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and fatty liver
      disease to gallbladder disease. Given betaine's reported beneficial effects on fatty liver
      and lipid profile, A-F Betafood® may have a beneficial effect on gallbladder function.

      The objective of the study is to assess the effect of A-F Betafood® on gallbladder and liver
      function as measured by gallbladder ultrasounds and liver function tests. The hypothesis is
      that A-F Betafood® will improve gallbladder and liver function after the 12 week treatment
      period.

      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study
      with two arms. This study will consist of a single 12 week treatment period. The planned
      sample size for this study is 50 overweight female subjects, with 25 subjects randomized
      equally to each of the two study arms in double-blind manner at a ratio of 1:1
