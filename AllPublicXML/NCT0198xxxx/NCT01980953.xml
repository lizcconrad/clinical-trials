  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4-part study will assess the effect of formulation, food, and active pharmaceutical
      ingredient (API) lot on the pharmacokinetics of GDC-0032 in healthy volunteers. Part 1 is an
      open-label, 3-period, 6-sequence study, and Parts 2, 3, and 4 are open-label 2-period
      crossover studies. Participants will receive single doses of GDC-0032 capsule or tablet
      formulation, in the fasted or fed state.
