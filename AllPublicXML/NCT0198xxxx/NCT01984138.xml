    <textblock>
      This study is investigating whether breast cancer patients who experience vaginal dryness
      while on anti-estrogen treatment could benefit from either vaginal estrogen or from a vaginal
      moisturizer called Replens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate Estring versus Replens for treatment of atrophic vaginitis in breast cancer
      survivors on adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 1. To compare improvement of atrophic vaginitis signs and symptoms between
      women on the vaginal estrogen ring and those on Replens vaginal cream. 1.1 Administer a
      questionnaire at baseline, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks to all patients which will assess
      vaginal dryness and vaginal itching. Over six months, we expect that patients who are
      receiving vaginal estrogen will have more improvement in atrophic vaginitis symptoms as
      compared to those women on Replens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Assess compliance with aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in each arm
      to see whether vaginal estrogen therapy increases AI compliance among women who have atrophic
      vaginitis. Compliance will be checked by counting pills at clinic visits at 4 weeks, 12
      weeks, and 24 weeks during the study treatment period, and then every 6 months for a period
      of 4.5 additional years, or until completion of aromatase inhibitor therapy. We expect that
      compliance in the vaginal estrogen arm will be superior to that of the Replens arm.

      Women over the age of 18 who have been diagnosed with stage I-III ER+ breast cancer and are
      currently taking adjuvant AI therapy who also complain of atrophic vaginitis symptoms
      including vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, frequent urinary tract infections, or dyspareunia
      are candidates for this study. Women also must be post-menopausal as defined by any of the
      following: age &gt;55 years, history of bilateral oophorectomy, amenorrhea for 1 year with
      intact uterus and ovaries, or serum estradiol and FSH concentrations in the post-menopausal
      range along with either amenorrhea for 6 months or previous hysterectomy.

    <description>ESTRING (estradiol vaginal ring) is a slightly opaque ring with a whitish core containing a drug reservoir of 2 mg estradiol. Estradiol, silicone polymers and barium sulfate are combined to form the ring. When placed in the vagina, ESTRING releases estradiol, approximately 7.5 mcg per 24 hours, in a consistent stable manner over 90 days. ESTRING has the following dimensions: outer diameter 55 mm; cross-sectional diameter 9 mm; core diameter 2 mm. One ESTRING should be inserted into the upper third of the vaginal vault, to be worn continuously for three months.</description>
