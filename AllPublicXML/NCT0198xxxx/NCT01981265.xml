  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a case-control study involving one medical center and one research institute to
      develop a data-set containing a minimum of 100 osteoarthritis cases, minimum of 100
      independent controls of similar gender ratio and a minimum of 100 disease controls (cases
      with hip and/or knee OA) to associate DNA sequence (allelic) variations in candidate genes
      with osteoarthritis phenotypes.

      This study is intended to begin at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences at Academia Sinica
      (which includes National Genotyping Center (NGC) and National Clinical Core (NCC)), National
      Taiwan University Hospital.

    <description>The sample was collected from the patient who suffered from osteoarthritis of finger joints, espcially DIP joint. The operation was perfomed due to arthrodesis procedure. So we set the outcome measurement goal for the arthrodesis successful rate.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with the following diseases will be excludedï¼šRheumatoid arthritis, Gout
             arthritis, Psoriatic arthropathy, Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, Hypermotility
             syndrome, Hemochromatosis, Post-traumatic OA, Other secondary-form OA and Lupus.

          2. The individual is excluded if the hand X-rays show MCP changes compatible with
             hemochromatosis. The site then is obligated to measure fasting transferrin saturation
             (FE/TIBC ratio) and if &gt;55%, the individual is excluded.

          3. Have more than 3 swollen MCP joints equal to, or greater than KL grade 2.

          4. Be unable to give informed consent.

          5. One cannot participate in this study if other members of his or her immediate family
             have already been recruited (Only one person from each family can participate in the
             study).
