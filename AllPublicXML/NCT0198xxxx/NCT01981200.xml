  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the feasibility of progressive unilateral knee-extension strength training using
      ankle weight cuffs in patients hospitalized due to acute exacerbation in COPD
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We decided that feasibility is indicated if: 1) the absolute training loads increase
      progressively, 2) more than 80% of the planned training sessions are completed, and 3)if the
      absolute training loads do not exceed 20 kg (2 x10kg weight cuffs) for 90% of patients.

    <measure>Increase of training load during admission</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change in training loads measured by the number of kilos lifted using ankle weight cuffs in 3 sets of 10 repetition maximum at the first training day to the number of kilos lifted at the last training day</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal isometric knee extension strength</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal isometric knee extension strength is measured unilaterally by a fixated handheld dynamometer. The test will be performed upon admission and at the day of discharge</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sit-to- stand- test</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>The number of times the patient comes to full standing position in 30 seconds. The Sit to Stand test provides a measurement of a person's lower body (particularly quadriceps) strength. This is associated with the ability to perform lifestyle tasks such as climbing stairs, getting in and out of a vehicle or bath. The test will be performed upon admission and on the day of discharge</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Timed Up and Go (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 6 days</time_frame>
    <description>A test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. The time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three metres, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit Down. The test will be performed at admission and at the day of discharge</description>

    <description>The patients begin training on day 1 of admittance. The training consists of knee extension performed in the sitting position on the bed with a 90 degrees of flexion of the knees. The weight cuffs are tired to the angles with a weight corresponding to 10 RM (the weight lifted 10 times). The weights and exercises are subjected to supervision on daily basis by the physiotherapist. The weight is increased after every set of training if more than 10 rep. can be performed with a given weight. Limitations to exercise is also recorded along with the degree of dyspnoea as assessed by the Borg CR10, possible oxygen supplementation and saturation is recorded before and following exercise.</description>
