  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the compliance with and perceptions of treatment, as well as health-related
      quality of life (HRQOL) in surgically resected melanoma patients undergoing HDI or PEG IFN
      therapy.

      The primary objective of this study is:

      â€¢ To evaluate compliance with the administration of standard HDI versus PEG IFN for patients
      with melanoma in need of adjuvant therapy

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To compare the convenience and satisfaction with chemotherapy for patients on standard
           HDI versus PEG IFN using a chemotherapy convenience and satisfaction questionnaire
           (CCSQ) and to evaluate the treatment-related side effects that may impact the patient's
           HRQOL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy of Biologic Response Modifier
           (FACT BRM)

        -  To assess the frequency of Grade 3 and 4 toxicities, according to the National Cancer
           Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for patients on
           standard HDI versus PEG IFN

        -  To examine reasons for patients' choice of treatment with HDI versus PEG IFN, for those
           cases in which patients are presented with a choice of either treatment option

        -  To assess Health Resource Utilization on both arms of the study
