    <textblock>
      Background: The Portuguese National Health Directorate has issued clinical practice
      guidelines on prescription of anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 inhibitors, acid suppressive
      therapy and proton pump inhibitors, and anti-platelets. However, their effectiveness in
      changing actual practice is unknown. The objectives will be to compare the effectiveness of
      educational outreach visits in the implementation of clinical guidelines in primary care in
      Portugal against usual implementation strategies and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis
      of this method.

      Methods: The trial will be a parallel, cluster-randomized, unblinded, trial in primary care,
      with a 1:1 allocation ratio. This study will assess the effect of educational outreach visits
      on physician compliance with prescription guidelines. The general study hypothesis is whether
      educational outreach visits are superior to usual implementation of guidelines regarding the
      reduction of inappropriate prescribing (compliance with prescription guidelines). All
      National Health Service primary care units in the Lisbon (Portugal) region will be invited to
      participate. Units will be eligible if they are using an Electronic Health Record to issue
      prescriptions and have at least four doctors willing to participate. Doctors in intervention
      units will receive three educational outreach visits (one for each guideline) during a six
      months period, while the control group doctors will be offered an unrelated group training
      session (on using the international classification for primary care). Intervention visits
      will be one on one 15 minutes discussions conducted by guideline authors or trained family
      physicians at the physician's workplace. There are two primary outcomes, measured at the
      physician's level. One is the proportion of COX-2 inhibitors prescribed within the entire
      NSAID class, in defined daily doses 18 months after the intervention. The other is the
      proportion of omeprazole within the entire proton pump inhibitors class, in defined daily
      doses at 18 months post-intervention. Prescription data will be collected from the regional
      pharmacy claims database.

      The trial will be a parallel, cluster-randomized, unblinded, trial in primary care, with a
      1:1 allocation ratio. This study will assess the effect of educational outreach visits on
      physician compliance with prescription guidelines. The general study hypothesis is whether
      educational outreach visits are superior to usual implementation of guidelines regarding the
      reduction of inappropriate prescribing (compliance with prescription guidelines). All
      National Health Service primary care units in the Lisbon (Portugal) region will be invited to
      participate. Units will be eligible if they are using an Electronic Health Record to issue
      prescriptions and have at least four doctors willing to participate. Doctors in intervention
      units will receive three educational outreach visits (one for each guideline) during a six
      months period, while the control group doctors will be offered an unrelated group training
      session (on using the international classification for primary care). Intervention visits
      will be one on one 15 minutes discussions conducted by guideline authors or trained family
      physicians at the physician's workplace. There are two primary outcomes, measured at the
      physician's level. One is the proportion of COX-2 inhibitors prescribed within the entire
      NSAID class, in defined daily doses 18 months after the intervention. The other is the
      proportion of omeprazole within the entire proton pump inhibitors class, in defined daily
      doses at 18 months post-intervention.Besides the above primary endpoints, the secondary
      outcomes will be the short (1 month) and medium-term (6 months) effects of educational
      outreach visits in the prescription of these two drug classes. Other secondary endpoints will
      be the short, medium and long-term effects of educational outreach visits in the prescription
      of clopidogrel. Finally, the trial will determine the cost effectiveness of educational
      outreach visits.

      Allocation to intervention and blinding:

      Clusters will be enrolled and allocated sequentially. To achieve a good balance regarding
      baseline characteristics, the allocation sequence will be determined by minimization (Ivers
      NI 2012). The units will be minimized by number of doctors (4 or 5, 6 or 7, 8 to12), median
      baseline prescription of COX-2 inhibitors (above or below the regional median), median
      baseline prescription of omeprazole (above or below the regional median), proportion of
      doctors with less than 10 years of practice after completing vocational training (above or
      below 50%), and type of primary care unit (family health unit or personalized care unit). All
      doctors sending the consent statement before the cluster allocation will be included in the
      study.

      The sequence of intervention visits for each unit will be determined by simple randomization.

      Allocation concealment will be ensured by the following procedures: the trial manager (hired
      and not part of the authors research team) will assign a sequential number to each unit as
      participation forms are received; only anonymized data about participating units will be sent
      to the trial statistician (sequential number and minimization variables); data will be sent
      in two batches, one for each half of all units; the statistician will allocate units to each
      trial arm using minimization; the sequence of visits will be determined using the random
      sequence generator from Random.org (http://www.random.org/sequences/); the statistician will
      return allocation information to the trial manager.

      Due to the nature of the intervention, neither family physicians, nor detailers can be
      blinded. Outcomes are routinely collected by the regional health administration independently
      of the researchers or the trial and will only be sent to researchers after the intervention
      has ended. Data analysts (the trial statistician plus one of the members of the research
      team) will be blinded to group and visit sequence allocation until all analysis are
      completed.

      Intervention and comparison:

      Doctors in units randomized to the intervention will have three educational outreach visits
      during a six month period. These visits will promote the implementation of governmental
      guidelines on the prescription of the following agents: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) and COX-2 inhibitors, acid secretion modifiers, and antiplatelets. The outcomes for
      the trial were chosen according to the main key-message from each guideline. For NSAIDs,
      COX-2 inhibitors should be prescribed only in patients with increased gastrointestinal risk
      who do not tolerate a classical NSAID associated with a gastroprotective agent; for acid
      secretion modifiers, all proton pump inhibitors are equivalent in effectiveness so omeprazole
      should be used in most patients as it is the least expensive; for antiplatelets, there is no
      benefit of maintaining long term clopidogrel after a myocardial infarction, acute coronary
      syndrome or percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Intervention group: During each 15 to 20 minutes visit an academic detailer will promote one
      of the guidelines to a family doctor (up to three physicians may be present in each visit if
      they wish to, but one to one visits will be preferred and encouraged). The detailer will also
      distribute a point of care summary highlighting the main messages.

      Control group: Usual guideline implementation consists of passive dissemination by their
      publication on the National Health Directorate's website. Doctors in units randomized to the
      control group will be offered an unrelated training session (coding with the International
      Classification of Primary Care, second edition) as a token of good will for participating in
      the trial.

      Cost analysis:

      Global prescription spending will be defined as the sum of the cost of all drug prescriptions
      of NSAIDs (ATC M01A), acid suppressive therapy (proton pump inhibitors ATC A02BC and their
      alternatives: H2-receptor antagonists ATC A02BA, antacids ATC A02A, misoprostol ATC A02BB01,
      and sucralfate ATC A02BX02), and antiplatelets (ATC B01AC) , up to 18 months after the
      intervention. These costs will be compared with the amount spent training the detailers,
      preparing and printing educational materials, travel expenses to intervention units, payment
      of detailers, program coordination, and physician time spent with a detailer rather than with
      a patient. Costs will be analyzed from the point of view of an educational outreach program
      rather than from conducting research. Therefore research related costs (such as researcher
      time for data collection and analysis) will not be considered. Similarly, the unrelated
      training session offered to the control units will not be accounted for because it is only
      intended to improve recruitment and it would not be necessary for the implementation of an
      educational outreach program.

      Data collection:

      Researchers will have access to prescription data through a data monitoring system operated
      by the Regional Health Administration. Data will be collected and provided by employees from
      this Administration according to researcher defined specifications. Importantly, researchers
      will not be directly involved in data collection. This information arrives with a two month
      delay from the date the prescription is dispensed. The prescription information contained
      there can be either for acute conditions - single prescriptions with up to two packages to be
      dispensed within 30 days; or for chronic usage - three identical prescriptions (up to two
      packages each) to be dispensed within 6 months. Within the drug classes of this study, only
      NSAIDs cannot be prescribed for chronic usage. Adverse events cannot be collected in this
      study because only prescription data is available.

      Detailers will record whether the planned visit was effectively accomplished, whether it had
      the planned duration, the number of physicians (including residents) present, whether the
      visit was made on patient visit time or off hours, the number of times the detailer had
      previously visited that physician, and feedback from the physician about the educational
      materials.

      Sample size:

      The research team has obtained pilot data from all physicians of three primary care units.
      This data was used to estimate within unit variability and the intra-cluster correlation
      coefficient (ICC). Data was also gathered for all the units in the Regional Health
      Administration to estimate the mean prescription and standard deviation for the primary
      outcomes. The mean proportion of omeprazole dispensed was 54.0% of all PPIs (standard
      deviation, SD, 10.1%) and the ICC was 0.027. The mean proportion of COX-2 inhibitors
      dispensed was 20.6% of all oral NSAIDs (SD 7.4%) and the ICC was 0.249. The Cochrane review
      on educational outreach visits found a median adjusted risk difference for improvement in
      compliance with desired practice of 5.6% (interquartile range 3.0% to 9.0%) in previous
      trials (O' Brien, 2008). Therefore, we chose to calculate our sample size assuming the
      intervention would lead to about 5% absolute difference between intervention and control
      units.

      If one assumes a mean cluster size of 6 doctors per unit, a 1:1 allocation ratio of controls
      per intervention unit, an alpha type error of 0.025, and a dropout rate of about 15%, then a
      sample of 110 doctors in each group will allow for 80% power to demonstrate a 5% absolute
      increase in the proportion omeprazole and a 5% absolute decrease in COX-2 inhibitors. To
      recruit the necessary number of physicians about 38 primary care units will be required.
      STATA 12.0 (STATA Corp, TX, USA) and its sampsi and sampclus commands were used to calculate
      sample size.

      Statistical methods:

      Physicians will be analyzed according to their randomly allocated group regardless of
      adherence to the intervention (intention to treat analysis). If physicians transfer to
      another unit within the health region we will still be able to monitor their prescriptions.
      If the transfer is to a different health region (i.e. not the Lisbon one) we will contact the
      physician and ask for the missing prescription data. In both cases, prescription of
      clopidogrel will be adjusted to the new patient list. If a physician retires or we are unable
      to retrieve data from a physician who moved to a different region then we will use the last
      working month's prescription.

      Both groups will be compared on primary outcomes using a generalized mixed-effects model. The
      ratio of COX-2 inhibitors to the entire NSAIDs class and the ratio of omeprazole to the
      entire proton pump inhibitors class and respective 95% confidence intervals will be
      calculated. Statistical significance will be assumed for a p-value of less than 0.025. STATA
      12.0 (STATA Corp, TX, USA) will be used to conduct the analysis.
