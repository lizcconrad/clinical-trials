  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching question addressed in the current project is: Does dietary nitrate
      supplementation (8 weeks) improve physiological function in patients with peripheral arterial
      disease (PAD)? The investigators will specifically address whether dietary nitrate
      supplementation enhances blood vessel function, blood pressure regulation, and exercise
      capacity. The proposed project uses an array of clearly defined measurements which will allow
      investigators to quantify blood vessel function (vasodilator responsiveness and arterial
      stiffness), blood pressure (variability and responsiveness to stress), and functional
      capacity before and after 8 weeks of dietary supplementation.

    <time_frame>Pre and post 8 weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>Forearm and calf blood flow will be measured independently by venous occlusion plethysmography using mercury-in-silastic strain gauges. Plethysmographic measurements will be made at rest and following 5 minutes of ischemia (reactive hyperemia) of the distal limb (forearm and calf). Peak blood flow will be determined as the highest flow recorded during the post deflation period. Total blood flow will be measured as the area under the time-curve after resting flow is subtracted. Vascular conductance will be calculated using blood flow/mean arterial pressure (via finger plethysmograph).</description>

    <measure>Change in Arterial Stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post 8 weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>ECG gated arterial waveforms will be obtained via applanation tonometry from the carotid and femoral arteries. The pulse wave velocity (PWV; index of arterial stiffness) will be determined between the carotid and femoral measurement sites (cfPWV). The time (t) between the feet of recorded pressure waves will be determined as the mean of 10 consecutive cardiac cycles. PWV is calculated from the distance (D; meters) between measurement points and the measured time delay (t): PWV = D/Î”t (m/s).</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post 8 weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>6-minute walk tests will be performed before and after treatment to assess functional capacity. The main comparisons will be changes distance walked in 6 minutes and time to claudication after 8 weeks of dietary nitrate supplementation.</description>
