  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the use of an allograft adjuvant to partial repair will
      lead to improved shoulder outcome measure scores compared to partial repair alone in massive
      rotator cuff tears.

      A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be randomized into two
      arms, either (1) Partial Repair/Debridement or (2) Allograft Reconstruction.

      The patients will complete a structured clinical examination conducted by a sports medicine
      fellowship trained orthopaedic consultant, Pre-operatively and Post-operatively at 6 weeks,
      3, 6, 12, 24 months. The examination will consist of range of motion testing by goniometer as
      well as strength testing by hand dynamometer. The patient will also complete the Western
      Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC) questionnaire.

      The main benefit of this procedure is that patients who have currently irreparable massive,
      chronic rotator cuff tears may acquire a means for their cuff to be repaired. This may aid in
      improving function of the shoulder, restoring ability to complete activities of daily living,
      while decreasing pain and sleep disturbances. This would allow the participant to become more
      functional after rehabilitation. It is our belief that this study could provide new
      information in helping to understand this relationship, which would in turn lead to future
      study in this area of orthopaedic surgery.

    <description>Patients in this arm will undergo a partial rotator cuff repair (debridement), followed by an allograft augmentation. An Allopatch HD patch will be rehydrated in saline solution for 15 minutes. The patch is then sewn in place with braided polyester suture material. Multiple sutures, approximately 5 to 10 mm apart from one another will be used. The medial sutures are placed at least 3 cm medial to the tendon-bone attachment site. The patch is stretched to remove the manufacturing surface irregularities. The patch is then attached to the greater tuberosity at the tendon-bone attachment site with arthroscopic bone anchors. The subacromial space will then be thoroughly irrigated.</description>
