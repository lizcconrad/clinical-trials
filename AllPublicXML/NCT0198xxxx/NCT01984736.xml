        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult male or female subjects age 18 to 65 years (both inclusive).

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form and able to comply
             with the study restrictions.

          -  Females may enroll if they are:

               1. documented to be surgically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrhoea greater than 1
                  year and follicle stimulating hormone,FSH, greater than or equal to 30 mU/mL), or

               2. practicing true abstinence and having a negative urine pregnancy test at
                  Screening and Day -1, or

               3. using double barrier contraception protection, out of which one should be a
                  physical barrier method, such as adequate hormonal method (eg, contraceptive
                  implants, injectables, oral contraceptives) and/or non-hormonal methods (eg,
                  intrauterine device, condom, diaphragm or spermicides) from Screening or at least
                  2 weeks prior to study drug administration (whichever is earlier) until 30 days
                  after intake of study medication and having a negative urine pregnancy test at
                  Screening and Day -1.

          -  Males with partners of childbearing potential may be enrolled if they are:

               1. documented to be surgically sterile (vasectomy), or

               2. practicing true abstinence, or

               3. using adequate double barrier contraception method, out of which one should be a
                  physical barrier for 90 days after the drug intake.

          -  BMI 18.0 - 35.0 kg/m2, inclusive, where BMI (kg/m2) = body weight (kg) / height2 (m2).

          -  Patients with diabetes mellitus can be included provided that the disease is
             controlled (as judged by the PI).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal history, abnormal findings on physical examination, vital
             signs, ECG, or laboratory tests at the pre-trial screening assessment that the
             Investigator judges as likely to interfere with the objectives of the trial or the
             safety of the volunteer except for conditions associated with hepatic impairment in
             subjects with liver cirrhosis (Groups 1 and 2).

          -  Surgery (eg stomach bypass) or medical condition that might significantly affect
             absorption of medicines (as judged by the PI).

             5 times the half-life of the drug, whichever is longer) or exposure to more than three
             new investigational agents within 12 months prior to enrolment.

          -  Acute illness within 14 days prior to dosing unless mild in severity and approved by

             basal cell skin cancer or squamous cell skin cancer) as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Positive urine drug screen (if not due to concomitant medication) or alcohol breath
             test at Screening and/or Day -1.

          -  History of drug abuse within the last 2 years.

             confinement. Regular alcohol consumption must not exceed 21 units for males and 14
             units for females per week (1 unit equals 340 mL of beer, 115 mL of wine or 43 mL of
             spirits).

          -  Smoking of more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent per day.

             prior to study drug administration and during the study conduct.

          -  Positive serology for anti-Human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1 or 2.

          -  Loss of more than 450 mL blood during the 3 months before the trial (eg, as a blood
