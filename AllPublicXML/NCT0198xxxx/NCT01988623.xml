    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the efficacy of Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) in the
      treatment of communication deficits in children with intellectual disabilities. By collecting
      information about parent and child functioning before and after PRT, The investigators will
      be able to determine whether the intervention is effective in improving child communication
      and reducing parent stress.
