      Argatroban is a selective thrombin inhibitor, and previous study had suggested that
      argatroban use post percutaneous coronary intervention could potentially prevent reocclusion.
      But there has no study on large sample of argatroban treated restenosis vertebral artery
      stenting. This study will test the safety and efficacy of the argatroban on prevent Occlusion
      and Restenosis in patients with Extracranial vertebral Artery Stenting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk of restenosis post intracranial and extracranial artery stenting is 20-40%,
      therefore, in the past, aspirin and clopidogrel were performed as anticoagulant therapy post
      stenting.But this treatment had limited effectiveness upon restenosis. Argatroban is a
      selective thrombin inhibitor, and previous study had suggested that argatroban use post PCI
      could potentially prevent reocclusion. But there has no study on large sample of argatroban
      treated Occlusion and Restenosis Extracranial vertebral Artery Stenting. This study will test
      the safety and efficacy of the argatroban on prevent Occlusion and Restenosis in patients
      with Extracranial vertebral Artery Stenting.

    <description>Stenosis detected by DSA(digital subtraction angiography),CTA(CT angiography)or MRA(MR angiography)was measured according to NASCET(North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial)method.Concretely, NASCET stenosis is calculated from the ratio of the linear luminal diameter of the narrowest segment of the diseased portion of the artery to the diameter of the artery beyond any poststenotic dilatation: NASCET=(1-md/C)×100%</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>NIHSS, mRS</measure>
    <time_frame>at half a year</time_frame>
    <description>NIHSS and mRS are widely used stroke deficit assessment tools. Most clinical stroke-related trials require a baseline and outcome severity assessment. The baseline of mRS is rank 0, NIHSS 0; the severity of mRS is 6, NIHSS 42. AS many patients have one or more strokes before they perform stenting, this study selected NIHSS and mRS as the supplementary materials to estimate the stroke deficit of patients and to reflect the therapeutic effect and safety of stenting and argatroban therapy. These two scales are performed according to the guidance before and after stenting and argatroban therapy.</description>
