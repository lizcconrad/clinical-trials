      This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, balanced, placebo and
      active-controlled, six-way crossover Phase 1 study with six single-dose treatment sessions.
      The profile of acute effects on pharmacodynamic abuse potential measures of different
      almorexant doses was compared with that of placebo and two doses of zolpidem.

    <measure>Maximum effect (Emax) over 24 h post-dose for &quot;At the moment&quot; Drug Liking Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score during each Treatment Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Emax was determined on a Drug Liking VAS which assessed positive and negative drug effects (Griffiths 2003, Milovan 2009, Schoedel 2008). VAS items were displayed on two screen images. Using a mouse, the subject positioned the cursor over the small vertical box (&quot;slider&quot;) and clicked on it to move it left or right on a scale of 0-100. To register the response, the subject then pressed the &quot;OK&quot; button that appeared below the horizontal line. A score of '0' represented a 'Strong disliking' and a score of '100' represented a 'Strong liking'.</description>

    <measure>Take Drug Again VAS score (Emax and arithmetic mean of 8 h and 24 h post-dose assessments during each Treatment Visit)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Take drug again scores were determined on a Drug Liking VAS which assessed positive and negative drug effects (Griffiths 2003, Milovan 2009, Schoedel 2008). VAS items were displayed on two screen images. Using a mouse, the subject positioned the cursor over the small vertical box (&quot;slider&quot;) and clicked on it to move it left or right on a scale of 0-100.

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The SDV measure involved a series of independent, theoretical forced choices between the drug administered and different monetary values. Subjects were asked to choose between receiving another dose of the same drug to take home or an envelope containing a specified amount of money. However, they did not actually receive either the drug or the money offered in the choices. The monetary value of the drug or the envelope ranged from $0.25 to $50.00.</description>

    <measure>Bowdle VAS scores (Emax and TWMean over 24 h post-dose during each Treatment Visit)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Bowdle VAS [Bowdle 1998] consists of 13 items for which the subjects were asked to rate their current feelings. Each VAS was scored from 0 to 100, with 0 reflecting &quot;not at all&quot; and 100 reflecting &quot;extremely&quot;. Lower individual and overall scores indicated fewer psychedelic effects. The scale was adapted for computer presentation and took approximately 3 minutes to complete.</description>
