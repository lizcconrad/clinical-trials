  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New York-Presbyterian Hospital has created a system that notifies its primary care providers
      whenever their patients are admitted to the hospital. In this study, the investigators want
      to evaluate how accurate this system is and how it is affecting the primary providers and
      their health care delivery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will interview the participating providers to understand if they were aware
      of the admission of their patients, and how they want to get involved in the care of that
      patient while he/she is in hospital. The investigators will also look at the data in the
      Electronic Health Record system to understand how providers are acting in response to the
      notifications.

      Lastly, the investigators will determine if the notifications have resulted in any change in
      the care of the patients, specifically in terms of the number of days from discharge until
      the next clinic visit.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean duration until first post-discharge outpatient visit</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the time from each patient's discharge until their first follow-up visit in the outpatient setting. The investigators hypothesize that the automated notification will result is earlier post-discharge followups.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean number of secure health messages (SHMs)</measure>
    <time_frame>1-7 days after each admission</time_frame>
    <description>Once a primary care provider is notified about their patient's admission via a secure health message (SHM), the investigators will measure number of such SHMs that are read within 24 hours and within 7 days</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Average rate of readmission to inpatient setting</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare the rate of readmission for patients associated with providers in the two arms of the study, to assess if provider's notification about their patient's visit to the emergency department has any effect on rate of readmission.</description>
