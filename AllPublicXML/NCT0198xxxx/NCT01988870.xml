  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational way to provide radiation therapy
      to treat breast cancer at the time of surgery.

      Traditionally, the recommended treatment for early stage breast cancer is surgery to remove
      the tumor, followed by whole breast radiation therapy to decrease the chance of recurrence of
      the cancer. Whole breast radiation involves daily radiation treatments for 4-6 weeks and can
      be associated with damage to other tissues including the skin. Recent technological advances
      have made it possible to provide radiation treatment during the breast cancer surgical
      procedure. This procedure is called intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). The University
      of Virginia has a unique IORT system which allows for the inclusion of cutting edge imaging
      technology into the IORT procedure in order to provide delivery of radiation directly to the
      needed areas and to avoid radiation to other tissues.
