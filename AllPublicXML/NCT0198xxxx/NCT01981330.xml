    <textblock>
      This is a pilot-study of 16 selected Swedish patients which all have severe hoarseness or
      aphonia due to vocal fold scarring (from previous surgery, radiation therapy, inflammation or
      possibly hereditary). The patients are operated with phonomicrosurgical dissection of the
      scarred vocal folds, removal or scar tissue and injection of autologous mesenchymal stroma
      cells, aMSC (which were previously harvested from each patients´s bone marrow, purified,
      expanded and characterized according to standard procedure at the Center of Hematology and
      Regenerative Medicine Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge). 8 Patients is planned to be
      treated with a single injection of aMSC and 8 patients with injection of aMSC mixed with a
      carrier hyaluronan gel developed at Uppsala University Sweden and at the Karolinska
      Institute. The laryngeal status, vocal fold function, and voice function will be followed
      individually with an advanced battery of examinations performed before and up to 1 year
      postoperatively. Side effects and complications are noted and reported during surgery and
      following surgery at regular intervals during at least 1 year Since spring 2015 no new
      patients have been recruited and no treatments are given during 2016 or 2017. The monitoring
      authority was changed from Swedish National Board of Health to Swedish Medical Product Agency
      (MPA) in March/April 2016. Further inclusions and treatments are postponed until permission
      is granted from MPA to continue the study.

    <description>Laryngeal and general ear, nose, and throat status will be followed for each patient at least one year after primary treatment. This includes examination of signs of local (laryngeal) inflammatory reaction/defect healing, e.g. polyp or granuloma formation, inflammatory reaction after local aMSC injection It also includes repetitive examinations of vocal fold function and voice function including high speed examination of the vocal folds, acoustic voice analysis and phonation pressure measurements as well as subjective ratings by means of Voice handicap index scale</description>
