    <textblock>
      This is prospective, multi-center, single-blinded, non-randomized clinical trial. Enrolled
      subjects will receive two Ulthera® treatments on the peri-orbital and peri-oral regions, each
      treatment provided 30 days apart. Follow-up visits will occur at 90 and 180 days following
      treatment. Study images will be obtained pre-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at
      each follow-up visit.
