  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is now considerable scientific evidence that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables could
      improve human health. Apples are among the most frequently consumed fruits in the world.
      Epidemiological studies have linked frequent apple consumption with several health benefits
      including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Apples are an important source of
      polyphenols and fiber and their beneficial effects could be attributed to this content;
      however, their impact on our health is not clear. Although, there are some studies that have
      reported cholesterol lowering effects the results are inconsistent. Furthermore, few studies
      have explored the impact on vascular function and gut microbiota. The objective of the
      current study is to assess whether a regular apple consumption, reduces total cholesterol
      levels, improves vascular function and gut microbiota profile in mildly hypercholesterolemic
      subjects compared with a control, sugar matched commercial clear apple juice squash.
