  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials is an increasing problem. Doctors occasionally face
      genuine therapeutic dead-ends, when attempting to cure nosocomial infections and, more and
      more frequently, community-acquired infections. Mastering antimicrobial resistance diffusion
      is nowadays a major Public Health issue.

    <textblock>
      Struggling against bacterial resistance to antimicrobials lays on three main measures:

        -  individual and collective hygiene.

        -  proper antibiotics practices, which could help reduce antibiotic selective pressure.

        -  better understanding of bacterial resistance mechanisms and resistance gene transfer
           between bacteria.

      Integrons, gene capture and expression systems, are recognised as major players in resistance
      gene transfer, which accounts for the greater part of resistance emergence and dissemination.
      Integrons are typically described in Gram negative bacteria, isolated in man, environmental
      settings and animals. They encode resistances to nearly every class of antimicrobials. A
      strong link between integrons and resistance to multiple antibiotic compounds has been
      described and integron detection is a relevant indicator of resistance to multiple
      antibiotics.

      The investigators project offers to study the impact of antibiotics on the frequency of
      integron intestinal carriage in the Limousin region and the genetic communities between the
      two groups.

      This study will use an innovative real-time PCR technique to detect integrons directly in the
      sample without using traditional culture-based techniques. The investigators hope to detect
      new integron-carriers, notably patients for whom integrons are borne by non or poorly
      cultivable bacteria. Stool samples will be taken from two groups of subjects : 246
      intensive-care unit patients under high antibiotic selective pressure, compared with 246
      healthy individuals representative of the community, under a more usual selective pressure.
      In both groups, antibiotic consumption will be fully documented.

    <description>From the &quot;conventional&quot;, a subject is found integrons carrying resistance when the PCR is positive on at least one bacterial strain previously isolated.
According to the &quot;direct&quot; approach, a subject is considered integrons carrying resistance when the PCR is positive in the DNA extracted directly from feces or broth enrichment.</description>
