    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, study testing whether LDX improves cognitive
      function and EF in 20 postmenopausal women who report onset of cognitive difficulties after
      oophorectomy (with or without subsequent chemo/adjunctive therapy). Brain imaging is included
      at critical time points to obtain objective data regarding effects of LDX as well as
      potential predictors of resilience in the face of oophorectomy.

      Participants will be asked to undergo three brain-imaging scans throughout the course of the
      study. Once they are deemed eligible for participation based on two assessment visits, they
      will be scheduled for their baseline test day. On this they, they will be asked to under a
      series of cognitive tests following by a brain-imaging scan. They will then take the first
      dose of either the LDX or placebo, wait for 3 hours and then undergo another brain-imaging
      scan to assess acute changes to memory/cognition due to the study drug. They will then come
      in for three 30-minute check-in visits during weeks 2, 4 and 6 on the study drug. They will
      be asked to undergo a final scan and series of cognitive tasks during weeks 8-10 on the study
      drug. They will then be discharged from active study participation. All participants,
      regardless of randomization, will be offered a consultation with the study MD and optional
      prescription for 4-weeks of treatment with LDX.
