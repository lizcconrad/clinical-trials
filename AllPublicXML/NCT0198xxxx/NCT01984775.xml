    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to assess the potential of topically-applied GSK2894512 cream at 3
      concentrations (0.5%, 1%, and 2%) to induce skin irritation at the site of application in
      healthy subjects. Results from this study will be considered when selecting the
      concentration(s) of GSK2894512 to evaluate in the Phase II and Phase III clinical safety and
      efficacy studies. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in order to have at least 30
      evaluable subjects complete the study. The total duration of subject participation may be up
      to 50 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at time of consent.

          -  In generally good overall health with healthy skin in the potential test sites on the
             back.

          -  Skin tone in the potential test sites on the back such that erythema and other dermal
             reactions can be easily visualized, i.e., Fitzpatrick skin types I (always burns;
             never tans), II (usually burns; tans with difficulty), III (sometimes mild burn;
             gradually tans), or IV (rarely burns; tans with ease). Determination of skin types is
             based on sunburn and tanning history in response to the first 30 to 45 minutes of sun
             exposure.

          -  A woman is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential, defined as
             a woman with functioning ovaries who has a documented bilateral tubal
             ligation/sterilization or hysterectomy, bilateral oopherectomy, or postmenopausal with
             at least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of known or suspected intolerance to GSK2894512, any of the ingredients of the
             study products, adhesive tape/plaster, or the test chambers.

          -  Inability to evaluate the skin at and around the potential test sites on the back due
             to sunburns, unevenness in skin tone, tattoos, scars, excessive hair, freckles,
             birthmarks, moles, or other skin damage or abnormality.

          -  Clinically-relevant skin disease, including psoriasis, eczema, atopic dermatitis,
             acne, dysplastic nevi, or other skin pathologies, or a history of skin cancer, that
             may, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicate participation or interfere
             with test site evaluations.

          -  Considered immunocompromised, or has a clinically-relevant history of or currently
             suffering from any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             might affect the evaluation of the study product or place the subject at undue risk.

          -  Used prohibited concomitant medications or products within the defined washout periods
             before the Day 1 visit. This includes investigational products, allergy injections,
             immunizations, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, anti-inflammatories, antihistamines,
             selective leukotriene receptor antagonists, mast cell stabilizers, and topical
             medications or products at and around the potential test sites.

          -  Participation in any interventional clinical study within 4 weeks of the Day 1 Visit.

          -  A clinically relevant history of or current evidence of abuse of alcohol or other
             drugs.

          -  Considered vulnerable (e.g., individuals in detention/institutionalized due to legal
             or regulatory order).

          -  Employee of the study center, bioskin GmbH, Parexel, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), or Stiefel
             who is involved in the study, or an immediate family member (e.g., partner, offspring,
             parents, siblings, or sibling's offspring) of an employee who is involved in the
             study.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). Alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, or bilirubin &gt;1.5x upper limit of normal
             (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and
             direct bilirubin is &lt;35%).

          -  QTc &gt;=450 millisecond (msec) or QTc &gt;=480 msec for subjects with bundle branch block.
             The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia's formula
             (QTcF), with machine overread. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc
             values of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period.
