    <textblock>
      In select, therapy resistent patients with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) Deep Brain
      Stimulation (DBS) has been used as a treatment. DBS is a therapy modality in which electrodes
      are implanted within specific sub-structures of the brain in order to modulate the activity
      in targeted neural circuits associated with different neurological disorders. The results of
      this novel approach to psychiatric disorders have been optimistic. This study aims to
      investigate wether or not the distance to target location has an influence on the outcome.

      In order to deliver DBS, leads containing four electrodes are implanted into the brain target
      in the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS). After an optimization period, patients enter
      a triple blind randomised two fazed crossover design of two periods of three months. In both
      crossover branches, patients, evaluating psychiatrist and psychologist are blinded for the
      stimulation conditions. These conditions are stimulation ON (at optimal parameters) and
      stimulation OFF. Stimulation parameters are constant during the entire period. During the
      second crossover branch, stimulation conditions are reversed for all patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of OCD following the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental
             disorders-fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria for OCD (300.3).

          -  Failure of documented trials of pharmacotherapy, following an appropriate treatment
             algorithm for OCD.

          -  Failure of documented trial of cognitive and behavioural therapy

          -  Duration of illness: min. 5 year

          -  Y-BOCS at least 30/40.

          -  Age: 20-65 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  DSM-IV diagnosis on axis 2 of severe personality disorder in cluster A or B,
             especially in the case of heightened risk for acting-out behavior.

          -  DSM-IV diagnosis on axis 3 of organic brain pathology or significant abnormalities on
             MRI.

          -  Present or past history of psychotic symptoms.

          -  Present substance abuse, or instable remission of substance abuses (i.e. no substance
             abuse during the last 12 months).

          -  Any disorder affecting cognitive functioning, other than motor tics and Gilles de la
             Tourette's Syndrome

          -  Mental retardation. A minimum threshold of cognitive skills is needed for adequate
             reporting on questionnaires and evaluation, and for technical handling of the
             instruments in a later faze.

          -  The patient must be juridical free.
