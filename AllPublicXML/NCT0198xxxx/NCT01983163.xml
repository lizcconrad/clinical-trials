      In children aged 1yr -18 years with refractory epilepsy Modified Atkins diet as add on to
      ongoing AED therapy would not be inferior compared to ketogenic diet ** in terms of seizure
      reduction from baseline seizure frequency at 6 months

      Primary objective:

      To compare the efficacy of Modified Atkins diet compared to Ketogenic diet * in children aged
      1 year to 18 years of age with refractory epilepsy on anti epileptic drugs at 6 months of
      diet intake in terms of percentage of seizure reduction from base line.

      Secondary objective:

      Proportion of patients who achieve &gt; 50% seizure reduction from baseline after 6 months in
      both groups To evaluate the nature of adverse events in both the groups
