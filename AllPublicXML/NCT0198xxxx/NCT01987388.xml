    <textblock>
      The objective is to develop a new metabolic flexibility biomarker, which has application in
      the study of changes diet and exercise on fuel management in humans. The new biomarker
      involves the characterization of an individual's metabolic flexibility utilizing room
      calorimeters rather than the current method, which is based on glucose clamp data. It is
      hypothesized that this new metabolic flexibility method will be a useful and noninvasive
      biomarker for measuring adaptation to exercise and diet challenges.

    <measure>Metabolic Flexibility by Room Calorimetry</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will stay in a room calorimeter for 24 hours where oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide produced will be measured. Mathematical approaches will use continuous calorimetry data to generate consistent estimates of the gas exchange rates, and hence accurate &quot;instantaneous&quot; respiratory exchange ratios. This novel approach allows evaluating the instantaneous dynamics of respiratory quotient noninvasively and for many different conditions (e.g., exercise and various nutrient ratios).</description>

Each bout is approximately 5 minutes in duration at a predetermined speed and elevation to achieve an intensity of 85% of VO2 max according to their fitness level test described previously. Subjects then sit quietly until either the next meal or the next exercise bout.</description>
