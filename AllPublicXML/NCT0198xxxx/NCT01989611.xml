      A prospective, open, multicenter,demonstrative of PrEP, which aims to assess the
      acceptability, feasibility and safety from chemoprophylaxis co-formulated emtricitabine /
      tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC / TDF) administered orally, once daily, to MSM and
      transgender women . The demonstration project aims to include 400 participants over 12
      months, with 200 at IPEC-Fiocruz, 100 at CRT-SP and 100 at USP.

    <textblock>
      Subjects preliminarily eligible who choose to receive PrEP will be included after obtaining
      the informed consent and confirmation of eligibility within 45 days after the screening
      visit.

      Once included, participants will be examined in a follow-up visit performed four weeks later
      and evaluated for evidence of seroconversion to HIV, medication compliance and clinical
      toxicity. The second follow-up visit will occur at 12th week and every 12 weeks successively
      (quarterly). Quarterly visits include HIV testing, serum creatinine and counseling on
      medication compliance and risk reduction.

      The study has a total of 6 visits. In all visits will be assessed the risks, HIV testing will
      be performed, monitoring of renal function and dispensing of the drug Truvada [emtricitabine
      1 tablet (FTC) / tenofovir (TDF) (200/300 mg) once a day orally for 12 months].

      Participants who have completed 12 months of follow-up or prematurely discontinue a PrEP will
      be encouraged to return for a follow-up visit after discontinuation of medication for
      monitoring of the status and evaluation of HIV as the resolution of side effects.
