      The objective of this trial to see whether:

      -Cardiac performance (cardiac index and secondary outcomes)can be improved in patients with
      acute heart failure (AHF) and symptoms and consequences of fluid overload (pulmonary and
      interstitial edema) and poor peripheral perfusion can be reduced by:

        1. Providing lactate as a substrate(Improve cardiac index)

        2. Simultaneously restoring optimal preload

      Optimal standard treatment will be achieved in both arms with the use of current best
      treatment protocol for AHF as per independent treating physician.

      4. To assess effects of 0.5M Na lactate (Totilac) on plasma and urine biological parameters
      (sodium, potassium, chloride, pH, bicarb, base excess, albumin)

      5. To assess effects of 0.5M Na lactate on morbidity and mortality.

      -  Acute heart failure is a critical illness for which current treatments are suboptimal.

        -  The various symptoms are related to inadequate cardiac output and usually include left
           ventricular overload with pulmonary oedema, interstitial fluid accumulation and tissue
           oedema (as indicated by frequent hyponatremia and hypoalbuminemia) and insufficient
           peripheral perfusion frequently manifesting as cold extremities and low urine output.

        -  The current treatment of this syndrome is based on diuretics, vasodilators and/or
           inotropes, but fluid administration is also required to optimise the intravascular
           volume state and to reverse shock if present. Therefore management of body fluid balance
           remains a challenge since treatment aims to simultaneously maintain or improve
           intravascular volume and decrease body fluid excess and oedema.

        -  The purpose of the present study is to assess in a prospective randomised trial the
           efficacy and safety of a newly designed crystalloid solution, 0.5 M sodium lactate, with
           properties potentially able to improve multiple pathophysiological aspects of AHF, as
           compared to the use of standard crystalloid solution Compound Sodium Lactate (mildly
           hypoosmolar ~ 274 mOsm/L and isotonic).
