    <textblock>
      Research shows that people with PTSD are more likely to smoke than people without PTSD. It
      also shows that people with PTSD have more difficulty at attempts to quit smoking. This study
      is part of a program aimed at finding out how best to help smokers quit who also have PTSD.
      One option is to give patients standard smoking cessation treatment including nicotine
      replacement and cognitive behavioral therapy. Another option is to give patients the standard
      smoking cessation treatment in addition to treatment for their PTSD symptoms (called
      prolonged exposure). However, it is not known which method works better. In order to answer
      this question, patients will be assigned by chance to one of two groups. One group will be
      given standard smoking cessation treatment to help quit smoking. A second group will be given
      the standard smoking cessation intervention to help quit smoking in addition to a form of
      psychotherapy called Prolonged Exposure to reduce symptoms of PTSD. The patients will be
      randomly assigned (by chance) to one of these groups. If the patient is assigned to the
      smoking cessation only condition and the patient still has PTSD symptoms after the last study
      visit (week 30) the patient will be offered treatment for your PTSD symptoms (Prolonged
      Exposure) at no cost. The patient's participation will help the investigators determine if
      treating PTSD symptoms enhances the ability of standard smoking cessation to help people quit
      smoking.
