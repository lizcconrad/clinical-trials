  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic insufficiency is a condition in which there is a decrease in the production and
      release of enzymes made in the pancreas, which causes nutrient malabsorption. There are many
      chronic diseases that can lead to pancreatic insufficiency. In the early stages of this
      disease, a patient may not experience any symptoms, and the prevalence of pancreatic
      insufficiency may be underestimated. Smoking has long been recognized as a cause of disease
      in many organs in the body. Cigarette smoke causes inflammation and damages tissue, including
      the pancreas. Studies have shown that smoking is an independent risk factor for pancreatic
      cancer and chronic pancreatitis. It has also been shown that the more a person smokes, the
      worse his disease will be. Additionally, there are studies that show that smokers have
      nutritional deficiencies. There are observational and retrospective studies that suggest that
      pancreatic insufficiency may also be caused by smoking. However, this has not been
      established, and the relationship has not been examined in a controlled manner. This study
      examines the relationship between smoking and pancreatic insufficiency in patients who do not
      have other pancreatic diseases.
