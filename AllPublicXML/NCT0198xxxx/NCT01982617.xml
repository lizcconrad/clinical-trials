      The investigators primary hypothesis was that recipients of the Motivational Interviewing
      intervention would be significantly more likely than those assigned to the Psychoeducation
      intervention to demonstrate increased readiness to quit smoking at the end of the
      intervention and to seek smoking cessation treatment in the one month period following the
      intervention. We also predicted that the Psychoeducation intervention would result in greater
      improvements in smoking knowledge.

    <description>The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy/Motivational Interviewing group consisted of four group sessions focused on using motivational interviewing to enhance motivation to quit smoking and on presenting cognitive-behavioral techniques for preparing to cut down or quit smoking. The following four topics were covered in this program: 1) Positive and Negative Aspects of Smoking, 2) Concerns and Hopes about Cutting Down or Quitting, 3) Small Changes that Can Help You Get Motivated, and 4) Planning for the Future.</description>

    <description>The education group also consisted of four group sessions that were co-led by a doctoral-level clinical psychologist and at bachelors-level research assistant. However, the focus of the education group was to present factual information about health risks of smoking, benefits of quitting, pharmacological smoking cessation aides, and smoking cessation programs in the area. The four group topics included: 1) Health Risks of Smoking, 2) Benefits of Quitting, 3) Nicotine Replacement Therapy and Bupropion (Zyban), and 4) Options for Treatment Programs.</description>
