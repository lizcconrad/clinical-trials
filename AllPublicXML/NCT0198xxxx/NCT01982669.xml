  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excess dietary salt intake is closely associated with the development of hypertension and
      cardiocerebral vascular diseases. Reduction in high salt intake significantly prevents
      hypertension and cardiocerebral events. Currently, few promising method is available to
      reduce salt intake in human. This study focus on examining the salty taste in
      population-level and exploring whether dietary factors can reduce salt intake through acting
      on salty taste.

      Hypertension and its related complications are common health problems that can lead to
      multiple organ damage and death. Excessive salt intake plays very important role in the
      development of hypertension. Reducing salt intake prevents high blood pressure as well as
      cardiocerebral vascular diseases.

      The experimental design is a multi-center, random-order, double-blind observational study to
      investigate the salty taste and salt intake in population-level.

      A total of 606 individuals from four cities in China are recruited in this study. This study
      aims to explore the salty taste characterization and salt intake in participants who like or
      dislike spicy diet through questionnaire, spicy preference, salty perception and
      super-threshold as well as the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion.
