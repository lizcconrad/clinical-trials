    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to examine the influence of feedback on psychotherapeutic
      competency. The present randomized controlled study compares a feedback condition with a
      non-feedback condition. Therapists in the feedback condition receive feedback after every
      fourth session. The feedback is given by two trained and independent raters. The raters are
      licenced and experienced psychotherapists. Therapists in the non-feedback condition receive
      no feedback during the psychotherapy.
