  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to define the recommended dose of a VEGFR-TKI (pazopanib) in
      combination with RT pre-operatively given.

      Study design A dose escalation trial of Pazopanib, starting at 400mg daily, orally in
      combination with the standard 25 x 2Gy preoperative radiotherapy in newly diagnosed extremity
      sarcoma patients. Dose of pazopanib will be escalated via 600mg to maximally 800mg. Overall
      treatment time of pazopanib is 40 days.

      Treatment plan: Pazopanib Dose level Dose of pazopanib orally, once daily, # patients

        1. (starting) 400 mg 3

        2. 600 mg 3

        3. (maximum) 800 mg 3

      Treatment plan: radiotherapy RT is given during 5 weeks with a once daily fraction of 2 Gray
      (50 Gray in 25 daily fractions)

      RT planning: The dose planning should be performed by CT based Intensity Modulated RT (IMRT)
      or 3 Dimensional Conformal RT (3D-RT) according to the local planning protocol of the
      participating institute.

      Dose specification: According to the ICRU 50/62.
