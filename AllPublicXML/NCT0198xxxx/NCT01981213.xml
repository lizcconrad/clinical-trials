      A: Early predictors of hepatic injury after suicide attempt with acetaminophen:

      To explore the following in a pediatric population with acetaminophen overdose due to suicide
      attempt: 1) the prevalence of episodes of pre- and in-hospital vomiting and the relationship
      between the total number of vomiting episodes and hepatic injury, 2) the relevance of the
      early initiation of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment to hepatic injury, and 3) the
      presence/absence of illness prior to the suicide attempt and hepatic injury.

      B: Characteristics, social behaviour, trends and risk factors:

      1. To explore the relationship between children admitted to a paediatric department as a
      result of suicide attempts with acetaminophen and their parents and friends. 2. To determine
      the extent to which the children had attempted to speak to their parents or other adults
      about their problems before their suicide attempts. 3. To determine the prevalence of
      self-mutilation among children with suicidal behaviour. 4. To examine the reasons for these
      suicide attempts.

      C: Establishment of the expression of cytochrome P450 in a pediatric including the
      age-adjusted activities.

      Urine samples will be analyzed using an HPLC tandem mass spectrometric method, which we have
      already established in our lab.

      There will be categorized three groups for comparison:

        1. An age-appropriate background population (approximately 200 patients)

        2. Paediatric patients that have been admitted to Rigshospitalet, due to severe hepatic
           injury (approximately 50 patients)

        3. Other pediatric patients admitted to their local hospital because of acetaminophen
           poisoning (approximately 200 patients) A control urine sample will be analyzed three
           months after the suicide attempt.

    <description>1) To identify early clinical and biochemical predictors of hepatoxicity in children and adolescents after the ingestion of a single acetaminophen overdose as a part of a suicide attempt e.g. pre-hospital vomiting, in-hospital vomiting, stomach pains, latency time before NAC treatment, illness prior to the suicide attempt. The initial and maximum levels of the following biochemical parameters are registered from the electronic biochemistry files of each patient: gluthathione (GLU), basic phosphatase (BP), INR, ALT, AST, and s-acetaminophen.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  8-18 years-old, who tried to commit suicide with acetaminophen.

          -  Children are only included if they have answered all our standard questions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with known liver disease prior to the suicide attempt.

          -  If a child have several suicide attempts during the inclusion-period, only the 1st
             will be included.

          -  Suicide attempts with other agents than acetaminophen.

          -  Children taking medication that enhance the induction of the cytochrome P450 system,
             increase the production of toxic metabolites, and aggravate the hepatic injury, such
             as ethanol, rifampin, isoniazid, barbiturates, and carbamazepine, will be excluded.
