      The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI
      in detecting lymph nodes that have been invaded by tumor cells in patients with colorectal
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the accuracy of ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI in detecting lymph nodes
      that have been invaded by tumor cells in patients with colorectal cancer. This study will be
      performed in addition to any ongoing routine care and will not serve as a substitute for any
      imaging tests that would be routinely performed prior to surgery.
