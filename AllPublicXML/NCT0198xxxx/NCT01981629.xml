  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, bedside ultrasound (US) is performed routinely in emergency department (ED)
      patients with undifferentiated shock to help guide resuscitation. Previously, it has never
      been possible to measure cardiac output on patients in the ED. Our clinical question looks at
      whether the USCOM device gives clinically relevant information in addition to ED cardiac US
      in patients with shock.
