  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To validate our previously developed model of risk factors for diagnosis of
      eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and to assess the utility of serum levels of biomarkers in
      diagnosis and monitoring of treatment of EoE. Participants: Up to a total of 800 participants
      (approximately 400 with EoE and 400 without EoE) who are referred for upper endoscopy.
      Procedures: This is a prospective cohort study. Patients will be compared with newly
      diagnosed EoE to non-EoE controls, obtain baseline measures, reassess EoE patients after
      treatment, and also reassess untreated controls. Data collection will include questionnaire
      results, blood collection, and tissue collection (esophageal biopsies performed during upper
      endoscopy per pre-specified protocol). Blood will be analyzed for the presence of the
      candidate biomarkers. Patients will be compared with newly diagnosed EoE to non-EoE controls,
      obtain baseline measures, reassess EoE patients after treatment, and also reassess untreated
      controls. Data collection will include questionnaire results, blood collection, possible
      saliva collection, possible urine collection, and tissue collection (esophageal biopsies
      performed during upper endoscopy per pre-specified protocol). Blood will be analyzed for the
      presence of the candidate biomarkers, including eotaxin-3 and IL-13.

    <description>To validate our model of clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic risk factors for diagnosis of EoE by calculating the EoE risk score which includes subject's age, allergic conditions, endoscopic findings, and eosinophil count. Subject's EoE risk scores will be compared between EoE patients and two non-EoE control groups: patients with dysphagia and patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who are not responsive to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.</description>

Prospective longitudinal participants will have specimens collected and complete questionnaires s prior to their standard of care clinical therapy of swallowed steroids and at their clinically indicated follow up upper endoscopy.</description>
