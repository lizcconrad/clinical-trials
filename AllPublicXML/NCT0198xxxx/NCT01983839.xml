    <textblock>
      At the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus Denmark, moxifloxacin is used in the
      empirical treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study was designed to
      determine the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin 400 mg/day to patients treated empirically for
      CAP. To accomplish this aim, we established a pharmacokinetic population model. This approach
      was adopted with the dual purpose of assessing the potential efficacy of the drug and
      performing Monte-Carlo simulations to characterize the maximal MICs for which recommended
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets are obtained for pathogens commonly known to
      cause CAP.

      We determined the pharmacokinetic profile of moxifloxacin 400 mg/day in 18 patients treated
      empirically for community-acquired pneumonia. . Moxifloxacin plasma concentrations were
      determined the day after therapy initiation using ultra high performance liquid
      chromatography. The moxifloxacin plasma concentration-time profiles were described with a one
      compartment model, using NONMEM. Peak drug concentrations (Cmax) and 24-hour area under the
      free drug concentration-time curve values (fAUC0-24) predicted for each patient were
      evaluated against epidemiological cut-off MIC values for Streptococcus pneumoniae,
      Haemophilus influenzae and Legionella pneumophilia. PK-PD targets adopted were Cmax/MIC ≥
      12.2 for all pathogens, fAUC0-24/MIC &gt; 34 for S. pneumoniae and fAUC0-24/MIC &gt; 75 for H.
      influenzae and L. pneumophilia. The same PK-PD estimates were used in the simulations of
      probability of target attainment (PTA) versus MIC.

          <population>The model estimated median values of fAUC0-24 for the current study population were32.78 mg.hr/L (IQR 22.75; 47.31). respectively.</population>

          <description>Patients with diagnosed CAP who were prescribed moxifloxacin 400 mg qd (Avelox® 400 mg Bayer) empirically by the treating physician, according to national CAP treatment guideline, had plasma concentrations of moxifloxacin determined. Patients under 18 years of age were excluded from the study and the age, gender and body weight of each enrolled patient were registered.</description>
