  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Cerebellum contains ten percent of the total volume of the brain and receives brain,
      spinal cord and vestibular sensory input. The organization of vestibular and somato-sensory
      afferent informations are also reported to be impaired in patients with cerebellum
      dysfunctions. Ataxia and impaired balance control are common symptoms in individuals with
      spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Previous studies have shown that patient with cerebellar damage
      are usually agonist and antagonist muscle coordination problem. Past studies also found the
      regulation of reciprocal Ia inhibition was impaired in patients with spinaocerebellar ataxia.
      In chronic phase, weakness might be developed due to deconditioned. All deficits mentioned
      above might lead to a decrease functional ability. Therefore, increasing somato-sensory and
      vestibular input, normalizing the modulation of recriprocal inhibition, and improve muscle
      strength might be able to improve the functional abilities of individuals with SCA.

      Recently, whole body vibration (WBV) has been trained for health groups. Studies showed that
      WBV training were able to improve muscle strength, balance control, and functional ability.
      However, there is no evidence showed that whether the whole body vibration training can
      affect the brain and spinal cord for the regulation of neural circuits. Whether also can
      affect for maximal voluntary contraction and improve central fatigue. No previous studies
      that whole body vibration training for SCA.

      Therefore, the purpose of this research was to investigate the intracortical facilitation and
      inhibition, reciprocal Ia inhibition, low frequency depression, maximal voluntary
      contraction, interpolated twitch technique to compare the different between the SCA and
      health subject. Also to investigate the short term and long term effect of WBV.
