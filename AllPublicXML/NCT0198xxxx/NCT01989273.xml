  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of patients admitted with major traumatic injuries. Such patients may develop
      inadequate circulation to the organs as a result of internal blood loss. Early detection of
      internal blood loss can be difficult as physical examination alone may miss patients with
      significant blood loss. Some patients with internal bleeding will arrive with low blood
      pressure; these patients are usually given 2 liters of intravenous fluid to determine if
      their blood pressure will recover. If the blood pressure does not rise or if it drops again
      later, the blood loss can be assumed to be severe, and the patient will likely need
      transfusions, surgery and other interventions. However, this fluid treatment method can lead
      to delays and complications as some patients may initially respond but then continue to
      bleed. The inferior vena cava (IVC) is the large vein draining blood from the lower body to
      the heart. The inferior vena cava is known to empty when the patient has had significant
      blood loss. The vena cava diameter can be seen using ultrasound. This study intends to
      perform ultrasound to examine the vena cava diameter on patients just after arriving with
      major trauma. The hypothesis of the proposed study is that an ultrasound assessment protocol
      of inferior vena cava diameter and collapsibility can detect and aid management of
      non-compressible hemorrhage in major trauma victims. After the patient has been given the 2
      liter intravenous fluid treatment, the inferior vena cava diameter will be measured again. A
      third examination 8-24 hours after admission will determine if the inferior vena cava
      diameter has returned to normal. We propose that measuring the inferior vena cava in this
      manner can predict those patients who are likely to continue bleeding and require
      interventions such as surgery. Early detection in these patients may avoid delays in
      treatment, complications and excess mortality. Because this examination is done with handheld
      ultrasound machines, it could be done outside hospitals and in military combat casualty care.
