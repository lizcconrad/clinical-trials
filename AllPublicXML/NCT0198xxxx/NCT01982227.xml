  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Between 30% and 40% of patients with colorectal cancer develop metastatic disease
      intraperitoneally. The optimal treatment of this disease combines surgery and chemotherapy
      but requires resection of all lesions larger than 2mm.

      Indocyanine green has an affinity for tumor tissues and the interest of its use has been
      demonstrated for the detection of sentinel lymph node and some liver surgeries.

      The ability of indocyanine green to detect peritoneal carcinomatosis in humans has never been
      evaluated.

      This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of fluorescence in the detection of
      malignant cells in peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin compared with pathological
      analysis.
