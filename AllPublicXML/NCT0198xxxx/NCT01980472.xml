      OBJETIVOS

      To assess the toxicity of the treatment in elderly patients (≥70 years) with NSC lung cancer
      who meet inclusion criteria for bevacizumab and selected based on a geriatric evaluation.

      Determine predictive factors of toxicity in the elderly population (≥70 years). Determine
      objective response rate Determine disease control rate Determine progression free survival
      Determine overall survival Determine safety of the treatment combination

      VARIABLES

      Primary endpoint:

      Rate of grade 3-4 neutropenia defined according to National Cancer Institute Common
      Terminology Criteria version 4.0 (NCI-CTC v4.0).

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Items of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) scale as predictive factors for
           toxicity end-points.

        -  Objective response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST
           v1.1).

        -  Progression-free survival.

        -  Overall survival.
