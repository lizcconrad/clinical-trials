    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma (NB) originates from the sympathetic nervous system and is one of the most
      common cancers in infants and children. In our hospital, nearly 70% of patients are diagnosed
      with stage 4, metastatic disease with a poor prognosis, despite the use of multimodal therapy
      including chemotherapy, surgery, autologous stem cell transplantation, radiation therapy, and
      differentiation therapy. To improve the survival rate and patient care, our NB Study Group
      has devoted to the research on NB-specific molecular imaging, biomarkers, and target therapy.
      We have confirmed studies in cancer genetics by showing that N-myc gene (MYCN) amplification
      and segmental abnormalities on overall genomic profiling both have an adverse effect on
      treatment outcome. Therefore, there is an unmet need for the development of novel molecular
      target therapy in NB. Recently, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) oncogene has been found
      to play an important role in the pathogenesis of NB, as well as serving as the driver
      mutations in approximately 10% of high-risk NB. The availability of ALK inhibitors also
      enables ALK as a treatment target in NB. In this proposal, we plan to utilize gene
      sequencing, array-comparative hybridization, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe
      amplification methods to evaluate the frequencies and characteristics of ALK mutations and
      amplifications in patients with NB. The gene and protein expression of ALK will also be
      evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and immunohistochemistry,
      respectively, and compared with ALK genotype. The overall genomic pattern, clinical
      characteristics, histopathology, and treatment outcome of ALK-mutated NB patients will be
      analyzed. The results from this study may serve as the first report on ALK mutations of NB in
      Taiwan and will be used for the development of standardized genetic diagnosis protocols, as
      well as the design of future clinical trials targeting ALK.

      -  purpose Despite the advance of modern multimodal therapy including surgery,
           chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, radiation therapy, and
           differentiation therapy, most children with NB are diagnosed with metastatic diseases
           and suffer from a dismal outcome. There is an unmet need for the development of novel
           target therapy in NB. Among all recently identified targets, ALK gene mutations have
           been found in approximately 10% of high-risk NB patients and are the treatment target of
           several promising agents that have already been tested in clinical trials, including
           crizotinib, which is to be available in Taiwan soon. This study aims to evaluate the
           prevalence of mutations and copy number aberrations of the ALK oncogene in prospective
           and previously treated NB patients' tumor sample (from surgical specimens) and germ-line
           (peripheral blood lymphocytes). The messenger ribonucleic acid(mRNA) and protein
           expression levels of ALK will also be analyzed. The results will be correlated with the
           clinical characteristics and pathological findings of this NB cohort.

        -  technique Prospective cases: Cryopreservation of tumor samples Retrospective cases:
           Archived tumor Sequencing: point mutation array-based comparative genomic
           hybridization(aCGH) &amp; MLPA（multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification）：analyze
           copy number alterations (CNAs) compare to clinical data

        -  expected results The results from this study may serve as the first report on ALK gene
           mutations of NB in Taiwan. We anticipate that 5-15% of NB tumors carry with common ALK
           mutations. Genome-wide CNAs profiling by aCGH can help us to categorize the genomic
           types of NB patients based on published guidelines, while the presence of ALK mutation
           or amplification may or may not be associated with subtypes with worse outcome. Some
           patients may have high ALK expression level without bearing common mutations on ALK gene
           locus, and we may identify novel mutation points in this patient cohort. Finally, we
           will probably find significant prognostic value of ALK gene mutation, which may be
           independent from other known risk factors, such as age, stage, MYCN amplification, and
           genomic pattern.

      Based on these results, we are able to develop standardized protocol for diagnosing ALK
      mutations for Taiwanese NB patients. With the development of ALK genetic testing, a phase II
      clinical trial of an ALK inhibitor in high-risk NB patients with relapsed or refractory
      disease may subsequently be conducted and may improve the treatment outcome of the patients.
