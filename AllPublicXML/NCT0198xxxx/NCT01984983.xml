  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Phase I study will assess the basic safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a
      DNA-based Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV)vaccine candidate delivered by
      electroporation . The study will enroll 40 healthy adult volunteers ages 18-49 and will
      comprise evaluation of intradermal or intramuscular administration by electroporation.
      Administration of the vaccine candidate will be at two DNA dose levels (0.5 mg/ml and 2.0
      mg/ml) for each route of administration. Electroporation will be administered using the
      TriGrid Delivery System devices for intramuscular and intradermal delivery. An additional
      group of subjects will serve as a placebo control, receiving injections of saline with
      electroporation. The overall goal of this study will be to determine if further human
      clinical studies of the vaccine candidate are warranted and, if so, to aid in the selection
      of dose and route of administration for future studies.
