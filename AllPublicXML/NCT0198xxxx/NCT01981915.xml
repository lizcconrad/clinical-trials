  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with underlying neuromuscular disorder (NMD) often suffer from weakness in the
      inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Consequently they do not have the strength to generate
      the minimum flow of 160 to 300 liters/minute for an efficient cough function. The restricted
      cough function allows secretion to accumulate, which in turn causes narrowing of the airway
      lumen and makes ventilation of the neuromuscular patient even more difficult. The patient's
      susceptibility to infection increases again and the vicious circle repeats itself. Severe
      secretion retention may even lead to ventilator failure. Effective secretion and cough
      management instead reduces the risk for stay in hospital. Therefore, secretion and cough
      management is a mandatory part of the therapeutic concept for treating patients with
      neuromuscular disease.

      The therapeutic efficacy of the Lung Insufflation Assist Maneuver(LIA) integrated in the
      ventilator VENTIlogic LS-plus manufactured by Weinmann GmbH+Co KG was studied in a pilot
      study carried out by the Dep. for Pediatric Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine at the University
      Hospital of Essen/Germany in cooperation with Research &amp; Development at Weinmann GmbH &amp;Co KG,
      Germany . The objective of the pilot study was to examine the therapeutic efficacy of LIAM as
      a cough support function in patients with neuromuscular disease and indications for
      mechanical ventilation.

      We hypothesized that i) a certain insufflation maneuver pressure may be optimal to achieve
      the highest individual peak cough flow and ii) that this pressure is below the pressure
      needed to achieve the maximum insufflation capacity. We define the lowest insufflation
      capacity at which the best individual PCF can be achieved as optimum insufflation capacity
      (OIC). The study was performed using two different techniques in order to demonstrate that
      findings are not dependent on maneuver details but are rather based on effects of maneuver
      pressure. The protocol was limited to techniques which do not require breath stacking: i)
      insufflation with an Intermittend Positive Pressure (IPPB) device and ii) with the VENTIlogic
      LS using LIAM.
