  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to demonstrate that treatments generated by an
      investigational algorithm reduces spherical aberration compared to currently available
      iDesign treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-LASIK induction of spherical aberration is currently among the most prominent challenges
      for refractive surgery. The presence of significant spherical aberration in the visual system
      results in reduced contrast sensitivity, visual symptoms such as &quot;glare&quot; and &quot;halos,&quot; and
      &quot;night myopia&quot; or the induction of myopia under low lighting (larger pupil size). A modified
      Treatment Planning Software (TPS) &quot;VSS-Rx1 OPM software&quot; has been developed that uses a
      modified algorithm (software that designs the LASIK treatment profile) to limit the induction
      of postoperative spherical aberration. Commercially available software used to calculate the
      LASIK treatment profile was used in one eye (active comparator [i.e., control]) and VSS-Rx1
      OPM software was used in the fellow eye (experimental). Subjects were masked to the use of
      either the commercially available or VSS-Rx1 OPM software.

      <population>This was a paired-eye study in which treatment of 26 participants included both eyes (52 eyes total). Use of the commercial versus VSS-Rx1 OPM treatment planning software was randomized by eye. One eye of each subject received the investigational treatment and the fellow eye received the commercial treatment.</population>
