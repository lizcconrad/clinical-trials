  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic examination, an important part of gynecologic oncology patients to help detect cancers
      recurrence or infections.Despite its importance, many women are reluctant and anxious about
      the procedure because of fear, as well as discomfort and pain. The objective of this study is
      to estimate whether using lubricating gel decreases patient pain during speculum insertion
      compared with using water in gynecologic oncology patients

    <description>The speculum was warmed, and patients were informed about what was going to happen. The labia were spread from below to introduce the speculum, which was inserted at a 45-degree angle pointing downward then rotated horizontally as the insertion continued. A VAS score (insertion) was obtained at this point. Next, the bill of the speculum was opened up until the vaginal cuff could be seen, and the speculum was secured by turning the thumbnut. A second VAS score (dilation) was recorded. During speculum examination, cervical smear with cervical brush was obtained for pathologic assessment if necessary. The speculum was withdrawn slightly, which allowed the bill to close together, and at this stage (extraction) the final VAS score was obtained. In the gel group , a doctor placed 6,5 mL mL sterile lubricating gel on the top and bottom blades of the speculum. Length of the vagina was measured by the index finger.</description>

In the water group the speculum's top and bottom blades were moistened with 6,5 mL tap water previously loaded into a syringe kept at room temperature.After the speculum examination, pelvic examination was performed and length of the vagina (defined as distance from vaginal cuff to vaginal apex) was measured by the index finger.</description>
