  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine replacement treatment (NRT) can be efficacious for smoking cessation, but used by
      only a minority of smokers in China. Pharmacogenetic matching may improve treatment outcomes
      for NRT in subgroups of smokers. The investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of
      sublingual nicotine tablets (SNT) for smoking cessation and the association of
      catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype with efficacy in this smoking cessation trial
      among Chinese smokers.

    <description>The nicotine sublingual tablet is Smokers were recommended to use one or two tablets per hour, up to a maximum of 20 tablets per day. Subjects were advised to use the full treatment dose for 4 weeks. After this time-point, treatment could be tapered off up to the 8-week visit. During the next 4-week follow-up phase, no further medication was dispensed. Staff, who dispensed medications, were not involved in treating the subjects. During each patient visit, the importance of adequate dosing with study medication was emphasized. The medication was free of charge. In addition, all participants received six sessions of standardized behavioral group counseling focusing on self-monitoring and behavioral modification approaches.</description>
