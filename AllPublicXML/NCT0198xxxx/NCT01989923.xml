  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will compare two smoking cessation methods, traditional nicotine
      replacement therapy and Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (electronic cigarettes) in
      patients with gynecological conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will allow women with serious gynecological conditions to sample both traditional
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (electronic
      cigarettes, ENDS). Whether the woman samples NRT or ENDS first will be randomized. Women will
      choose the product they wish to try for a 6-week intervention period for smoking cessation.
      Women choosing NRT will receive a 6-week intervention of a daily nicotine patch plus either
      nicotine gum or lozenges to use (as needed) throughout the day. The ENDS group will receive
      an electronic cigarette device with refills to last the 6-week duration of the study. Both
      groups will receive identical tobacco cessation counseling. As part of the study, each
      subject will complete a survey conducted at baseline, 6-weeks into the study during
      intervention, and upon completion of a 6 week follow-up period in which participants receive
      no intervention. At the 12-week measurement period we will add a qualitative interview that
      will allow us to ask the women whether the methods were acceptable, caused any problems, and
      if so, what the problems entailed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite set of questions about the feasibility of successfully using NRT and ENDS over time (assessing change in smoking habits) in Women with Serious Gynecological Conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>We plan a 3-month study with 6 week follow-up periods.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the acceptability of traditional nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine patch plus nicotine gum or lozenges) and the ENDS (electronic nicotine delivery system or electronic cigarette as smoking cessation tools in a group of women with cervical dysplasia from the Stephenson Cancer Center Dysplasia Clinics.
Measurements to assess success:
Reduction of number of cigarettes smoked per day.
Point prevalence abstinence at 7 and 30 days
Smoking cessation rates
Qualitative interviews to assess positives and negatives in these two smoking cessation methods.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Study</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months with 6 week follow-up windows</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if we can accure 30 smoking women with cervical dysplasia from the Stephenson Cancer Center for smoking cessation intervention in a 6-month window.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Product Adherence Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Women fill out diary every day for 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The diary will be used for the 6 week intervention portion of the study. This diary is designed to assist individuals in monitoring their smoking and product use during the study. We will encourage each subject to write down every regular cigarette that she smokes as well as every use of the product to which she has been randomized.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Composite set of semi-structured interviews</measure>
    <time_frame>done at the end of the study (at 12-weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>We will use semi-structured interviews at the 12 week follow-up to help us understand:
If the woman currently feels she has a healthy or unhealthy lifestyle, and what factors contribute to this answer.
What smoking cessation methods the women have tried in the past, if the methods were acceptable, if they worked, and why or why not.
Barriers that might make it difficult for women with this diagnosis to quit smoking using the device they tried in the study.
Assists that might make it easier for women with this diagnosis to quit smoking using the device they tried in the study.
How the women feel about continuing to use the device that they tried in the trial.
Risks the women feel they are taking if they continue to use NRT, ENDS, or decide to return to smoking.
What about smoking makes it worth or not worth the risk to these women personally.</description>

    <description>Women in this arm of the study will receive 24-hour Nicotine Patches - either 21 mg patches (for 1 pack per day smokers), or 14 mg patches (for 1/2 pack per day smokers) smokers). Patients will use one patch per day for 6 weeks for a total of 42 patches. Women will receive 3 weeks of original strength nicotine patches, and will receive patches half as strong during the last 3 weeks of the study. This will allow for a lower strength of nicotine as each woman continues with smoking cessation.
Women will also receive nicotine gum or lozenges (subject choice)- these will be 2 mg pieces of nicotine gum or lozenge (approximately 210 pieces). This will account for using 8-10 per day at the beginning of the study and tapering to 2-3 pieces per day by the end of the study.</description>

    <description>Women in this arm of the study will receive one &quot;Blu Cig&quot; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Device (E-cigarette) along with 2 electronic cigarette batteries, 1 wall charger and 1 USB charger, cartridges/refills in menthol or regular (patient choice). The number of cartridges is determined by asking each patient the number of packs currently smoked per day, and multiplying 1.5 times the number of packs smoked per day. We plan to decrease the strength of the cartridges by one half after three weeks of intervention. We will give each women supplies and instructions accordingly. This will allow for a lower strength of nicotine as each woman continues with smoking cessation.</description>
