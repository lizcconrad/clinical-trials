    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of two types of stem
      cells,(either banked cord blood or bone marrow), in children between the ages of 2 to 10
      years with CP. 15 children with banked cord blood at CBR and 15 children without banked cord
      blood will be enrolled into the study. The study involves one baseline/treatment visit and 3
      follow-up visits at 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years. Five children in each group will be
      randomized to a placebo control group at the baseline/treatment visit. Parents will not be
      told if their child received stem cells or a placebo until the 12 month follow-up visit. At
      that time parents may elect to have their child receive the stem cell treatment; either bone
      morrow harvest or umbilical cord blood if banked with CBR. All study visits will be conducted
      at the UTHealth Medical School and Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, Texas.

      As of 1/21/2014 we have met our enrollment limit for children without banked cord blood
      undergoing bone marrow harvest for stem cells.

    <description>In-hospital infusion toxicity: pulmonary and hepatic function; new seizures, hemorrhagic lesions or ischemic lesions on imaging. (Composite Outcome Measure)
Long-term safety: development of new mass lesions or other pathological structural changes; worsening neurological status. (Composite Outcome Measure)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine if late functional outcomes are improved following the administration of autologous cells compared with patients in the control group.</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months, and the end of study year 2 visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Detailed analysis of MRI's done at baseline and follow-up visits. Specific white matter tract analysis will be identified at baseline MRI and correlated with motor function studies as the primary lesion of interest. Total volumes and specific tract lesions will be analyzed and correlated with functional outcomes.
The following functional outcomes studies will be performed at baseline, 6 months, 1 year after infusion, and 2 year after infusion.
