    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to identify patients at moderate to high risk for peri-procedural (type
      4) myocardial infarction or injury after after undergoing an elective coronary intervention
      (PCI) as measured by high sensitivity troponin T, who might benefit from more potent
      antiplatelet therapy.

        Patients with stable or unknown CAD undergoing elective coronary intervention without
        receiving additional examination, such as biopsy, Ablation or any other procedure that
        could lead to myocardial injury resulting in elevation of the cardiac Troponin.
