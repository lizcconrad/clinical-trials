  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, non-randomized, dose-escalating, open label, multi-center study to be
      conducted in two parts (Part A and Part B). RO6870810 is a small molecule, non-covalent
      inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of bromodomains. This study is
      designed to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity
      of RO6870810 in participants with histologically confirmed solid tumors with progressive
      disease (PD) which is refractory or intolerant to standard/approved therapies. In Part A,
      RO6870810 will be administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection daily for either 21 consecutive
      days in a 28-day cycle or for 14 consecutive days in a 21-day treatment cycle in participants
      with advanced solid tumor malignancies to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). In Part B, RO6870810 will be administered at a dose up to the
      MTD to further characterize the safety profile and biological effect in a subset of
      participants with advanced solid tumor malignancies. It is anticipated that a total of 84
      participants will be enrolled in to this study (54 in Part A and 30 in Part B). In addition,
      it is expected that up to 20 participants with histologically confirmed nuclear protein in
      testis (NUT)-midline carcinoma (NMC) with progressive disease requiring therapy will be
      enrolled in the sub-study of Parts A and B. In addition, up to 20 participants with diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) may be enrolled at selected study sites.
