  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter, global Phase Ib study will evaluate the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of intravenous (IV) dosing of MEHD7945A in combination with oral dosing
      of cobimetinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that carry a
      Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) mutation and for which standard therapies
      do not exist, have proven ineffective or intolerable or are considered inappropriate. The
      study comprises a dose-escalation (Stage 1) and an indication-specific cohort expansion stage
      (Stage 2).

          -  Previous treatment with a combination of a MEK inhibitor with an EGFR inhibitor

          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the cobimetinib formulations

          -  History of severe (Grade 3 or 4) allergic or hypersensitivity reaction to therapeutic

          -  Known severe ulcer disease

          -  History of or evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination that is
             considered a risk factor for neurosensory retinal detachment, central serous
             chorioetinopathy (CSCR), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or neovascular macular
             degeneration

        Patients will be excluded if they currently have either of the following conditions which
