  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common cause of liver
      disease in the western world. It can progress from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH), and then onto cirrhosis where there is a concomitant risk of developing
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevalence of hepatic steatosis is high, ranging from 16
      to 31% in the general population, up to 80% in the obese populationand up to 96% in severely
      obese patients.

      Liver biopsy (LB) has traditionally been regarded as the gold standard for the assessment of
      patients with NAFLD, although it has several limitations. LB has a potential sampling error,
      is an invasive and often painful procedure.

      The natural history of patients with NAFLD is generally determined by the extent of liver
      fibrosis, hence non-invasive assessment of fibrosis with FibroScan® is often sufficient. For
      patients with proven NASH, changes in hepatic steatosis and serum ALT levels may provide
      information on the patient's course and/or response to treatment.

      Several clinical studies have shown the benefit of measuring hepatic stiffness with the
      FibroScan® machine using the M+ probe. The ability to identify significant fibrosis and
      cirrhosis has been demonstrated in normal and overweight patients affected with chronic
      hepatitis B and C, biliary diseases, alcohol related liver disease (ALD) and NAFLD.

      Recently, Echosens has also developed a novel ultrasonic controlled attenuation parameter
      (CAP) designed to quantify hepatic steatosis using a process based on vibration controlled
      transient elastography (VCTE™). Studies comparing CAP with liver biopsies in multi-aetiology
      cases and patients with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have shown that there is a good correlation
      between steatosis assessed histologically and using CAP.

      The main objective of this prospective study is to evaluate the diagnosis accuracy of the
      Controlled attenuation Parameter (CAP) measured by FibroScan® (either with M+ or XL+)in
      patients with NAFLD to assess liver steatosis using biopsy as a reference.

      The study involves adults' patients with suspected NAFLD scheduled to have a liver biopsy
      within 2 weeks of fibroscan examination and followed by the Hepatology service of four
      centers in United Kingdom.

      Approximately 450 patients (of which 350 will be evaluable) will be enrolled in this study:
      Around 100 patients will be measured with the M+ probe and around 250 with the XL+ probe.

      The inclusion period is from 18 to 24 months. Starting date: January 2014. End of
      recruitment: June 2017. The duration of the study for a patient is from 1 to 7 days,
      depending to the exams calendar.

    <description>The study involves adults' patients with suspected Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease(NAFLD). The FibroScan® is a device equipped with probes (M+ or XL+), each of which consists of an ultrasonic transducer mounted on the axis of a mechanical vibrator. Liver stiffness and CAP measurements are performed on the right lobe of the liver with the patient in a dorsal decubitus and maximal abduction position. The procedure is non-invasive and painless.</description>
