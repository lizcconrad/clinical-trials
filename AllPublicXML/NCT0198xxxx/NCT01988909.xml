  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of open label treatment
      with WR 279,396 (topical paromomycin &amp; gentamicin) in patients with non-complicated,
      non-severe cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected CL will be screened up to a 14 day period for eligibility including
      parasitology for confirmation of ulcerative CL. Recruitment will primarily be from patients
      exposed to leishmaniasis. A target enrollment of 30 patients will receive WR 279,396 (15%
      paromomycin + 0.5% gentamicin topical cream) once daily for 20 days.

      The index lesion and all other ulcerated lesions will be assessed for clinical response by
      measurement of the length and width of area of ulceration. A lesion will be considered to be
      completely cured if 100% re-epithelialization is observed. Non-ulcerated lesions will also be
      measured to monitor the total area of exposure of lesions to study drug and will be evaluated
      for cure.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for the study, patients must:

          1. Be male or females ages 2 to 80 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Have non-complicated, non-severe CL.

          3. Be able to give written informed consent or by their legal representative.

          4. Have a diagnosis of CL in at least one lesion by at least one of the following
             methods: 1) positive culture for promastigotes; 2) microscopic identification of
             amastigotes in stained lesion tissue and/or 3) by positive polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR). Patients who have a prior diagnosis of CL within 30 days of the start of
             treatment are eligible without a confirmatory test during screening.

          5. Have at least one ulcerative lesion ≥ 1 cm and &lt; 5 cm, that meets the criteria for an
             index lesion.

          6. Be willing to forego other forms of treatments for CL including other investigational
             treatment during the study.

          7. In the opinion of the investigator, be capable of understanding (or their legal
             representative) and complying with the protocol.

          8. Expect to be located in the area of the clinical site for at least the duration of the
             screening, 20-day treatment period, and for the followup visits at Days 28 +/- 2 days,
             42 +/- 7 days and 100 +/- 14 days.

          9. If female and of child-bearing potential, have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
             test during screening and agree to use an acceptable method of birth control during
             the treatment phase and for 1 month after treatment is completed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Also, to be eligible for the study, patients must not:

          1. Have a prior diagnosis of leishmaniasis where all lesions had healed.

          2. Have only a single lesion whose characteristics include any of the following:
             verrucous or nodular lesion (non-ulcerative), lesion &lt;1 cm in its greatest diameter,
             lesion in a location that in the opinion of the Investigator is difficult to maintain
             application of study drug topically.

          3. Have a lesion due to leishmania that involves the mucosa or palate.

          4. Have signs and symptoms of disseminated disease.

          5. Be a female who is breast-feeding.

          6. Have an active malignancy or history of solid, metastatic or hematologic malignancy
             with the exception of basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been
             removed.

          7. Have significant organ abnormality, chronic disease such as diabetes, severe hearing
             loss, evidence of renal or hepatic dysfunction, myasthenia gravis, parkinsonism,
             impairment of the eighth cranial nerve or clinically significant levels of creatinine,
             AST, or ALT in the judgment of the investigator.

          8. Have received treatment for leishmaniasis (except mercurochrome or local antiseptics)
             including any medication with pentavalent antimony including sodium stibogluconate
             (Pentostam), meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime); amphotericin B (including liposomal
             amphotericin B and amphotericin B deoxycholate); WR 279,396; or other medications
             containing paromomycin (administered parenterally or topically) within 56 days of
             starting study treatments, or methylbenzethonium chloride (MBCL); or local or systemic
             antibiotics of the following families (penicillin, betalactamics, cyclines,
             synergistin, macrolides, lincosamides, fusidic acid, mupirocin) within 8 days of
             starting study treatments.

          9. Have history of known or suspected hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions to
             aminoglycosides.

         10. Have any other topical disease/condition which would interfere with the objectives of
             this study.
