      This is a Phase 1/2 study of the combination of CTO with lomustine in patients with recurrent
      malignant glioma to be treated at the Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center (PRTBTC) at
      Duke. The Primary Objectives are:

        -  Phase 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CTO when combined with
           lomustine among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (World Health Organization
           (WHO) grade III or IV) who have not been previously treated with bevacizumab.

        -  Phase 2: To assess the efficacy of CTO (either in monotherapy or in combination with
           lomustine) compared to lomustine alone in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV malignant
           gliomas that have not been previously treated with bevacizumab based upon 6-month
           progression free survival (PFS6).

      Note: This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the
      study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and lomustine had been
      determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.

    <textblock>
      In the Phase 1 component of the study, we will conduct a dose-escalation study of the
      combination of CTO with lomustine among patients with recurrent malignant glioma (WHO grade
      III or IV). All patients will be bevacizumab-naïve. The dose escalation will be a standard
      &quot;3+3&quot; design to determine the MTD of CTO in combination with lomustine. The Phase 2 portion
      of this study will be a randomized screening study comparing CTO alone (Arm A) versus CTO
      with lomustine (Arm B) versus lomustine alone (Arm C) in patients with recurrent WHO grade IV
      malignant glioma who are bevacizumab-naïve. Subjects will be randomized with a treatment arm
      allocation ratio of 2:2:1.

      Based on the results of patients who have already taken part in Phase 1 of the study, the
      Principal Investigator has decided to reduce the dose of lomustine used in combination with
      CTO in this study by 25% of the FDA-approved dose, due to hematologic side effects (side
      effects related to lower than expected blood counts). Therefore, the dose of lomustine
      received in combination with CTO is approximately 75% of the standard recommended dose.

      Note: This study was terminated early due to funding issues. At the time of termination, the
      study was still in Phase 1 and no MTD for the combination of CTO and lomustine had been
      determined for this population. Phase 2 will not proceed.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A standard &quot;3+3&quot; design to determine the MTD of CTO in combination with lomustine. Subjects will be administered CTO orally on a continuous daily dosing schedule, while subjects will receive oral lomustine (110 mg/m2) every 6 weeks. Cohorts of 3-6 subjects will accrue at each dose level of CTO, beginning with 225 mg/m2, until MTD is defined. The MTD is the highest dose level at which ≤ 1 out of 6 experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).
MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 1 out of 6 experienced DLT.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants surviving six months from date of randomization without progression of disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression according to the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, or to death due to any cause.</description>

Non-hematologic:
Nausea/vomiting of Grade 3 or greater despite maximal antiemetic therapy
Diarrhea of Grade 3 or greater despite maximal antidiarrheal therapy
