  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beachchair position is used by many orthopaedic surgeons for shoulder surgery. Most patients
      undergoing surgery in this position have no complications. However, reported cases of
      postoperative neurological deficits have highlighted the risk of cerebral and spinal cord
      ischemia. The etiology of such complications remains unclear. The most plausible explanation
      for these events would be intraoperative hypotension followed by cerebral hypoperfusion.

      General anesthesia is commonly used for shoulder surgery in conjunction with interscalene
      brachial plexus blockade. During the block, local anesthetic's spread is frequently observed
      leading to a block of sympathetic fibres. Since all nerves located in the head and neck area
      go through the stellate ganglion, its block will cause a sympathetic denervation and a
      decrease of the peripheral vascular resistance, thus increasing the circulation in cerebral
      blood vessels. In normal situations, there is a vasoconstriction of the cerebral blood
      vessels in response to a sympathetic stimulation and a vasodilation if sympathetic fibres are
      blocked.

      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive examination that provides a reliable evaluation
      of intracranial blood flow in real-time. It can help to detect sudden changes in perfusion
      and identify potential embolic events. Some studies using TCD have shown an increased
      ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF) secondary to a reduced vascular tone associated with a
      stellate ganglion block. Others have shown a reduction of contralateral CBF that could
      theoretically increase the risk of ischemia in the affected area.

      This study will assess the role of interscalene nerve blockade in the protection of cerebral
      ischemia and preservation of cerebral autoregulation. This study will also aim to identify
      changes in contralateral CBF.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. Interscalene nerve block will increase CBF

        2. Interscalene nerve block will not decrease contralateral CBF

        3. Cerebral autoregulation will be preserved under general anesthesia in conjunction with
           an interscalene nerve block in this setting.

      Prior to surgery, each patient will undergo a baseline bilateral TCD examination in supine
      position. If the Doppler's results are satisfactory, the patient will then be randomized and
      proceed to the next step. In case of inadequate results, the patient's participation to the
      study will be terminated.

      The interscalene nerve block and the insertion of the interscalene catheter will be performed
      according to randomization. In the interscalene nerve block and catheter group, the attending
      anaesthesiologist will assess the success of the block and record the presence or absence of
      Horner's syndrome. The transcranial Doppler operator will be blinded to these observations.
      Following the insertion of the interscalene catheter, the patient will undergo a second
      bilateral TCD in supine position before induction of anesthesia.

      The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. After the induction of
      anesthesia, a bilateral TCD will be performed with the patient in supine position. Another
      examination will be performed under general anesthesia immediately after and 30 minutes
      following the installation of the patient in the beachchair position. A last TCD will be
      performed after a reduction of end-tidal carbon dioxide at 30 mm Hg.

      For each examination, the arterial blood pressure must be stabilized for at least 5 minutes
      before the Doppler can be initiated. Arterial blood pressure will be measured during each
      examination. Type, duration of surgery and beachchair position will be recorded. Vasopressor
      therapy will be noted. Body temperature, end-tidal carbon dioxide and minimum alveolar
      concentration of desflurane will be collected during each examination performed under general
      anesthesia.
