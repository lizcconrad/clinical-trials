  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many hospitalized patients experience pain during their hospital stay, and less than half
      report adequate pain relief. Common treatments for pain include opioid medications, which
      have associated side effects and complications. Research has shown that acupuncture is
      effective for surgical, postoperative and cancer-related pain, nausea, and vomiting. More
      research is needed on the effectiveness of adding acupuncture to routine care for
      hospitalized patients. The objective of this study is to examine the effectiveness of
      acupuncture delivered in a &quot;real-world&quot; setting according to the principles of traditional
      Chinese medicine among hospitalized patients to manage pain and other symptoms. 250
      hospitalized participants will be randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio to receive either 1) usual
      care or 2) usual care with acupuncture offered (125 in each group). The primary outcome
      measure will be change in daily pain intensity. Data on other symptoms, such as nausea,
      vomiting, anxiety, and depression, as well as functionality and quality of life will be
      collected in person, on a web-based survey, or via telephone follow-up. The aims of the study
      are to examine the effectiveness of acupuncture to manage pain and other symptoms among
      hospitalized patients; to evaluate the impact of acupuncture on patient satisfaction among
      hospitalized patients; and to estimate costs and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture among a
      subset of hospitalized patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that compared to hospitalized patients receiving usual care
      alone, hospitalized patients receiving acupuncture will have:

        1. decreased pain severity

        2. higher patient satisfaction
