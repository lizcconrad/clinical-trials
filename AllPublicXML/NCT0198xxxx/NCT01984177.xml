      This study will, in a sample of cocaine-dependent and healthy control subjects, administer
      corticorelin and compare dopamine release between groups. Dopamine release will be measured
      using PET neuroimaging with the radiotracer [11C]-(+)-PHNO.

      SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY The project will, in a sample of cocaine-dependent (CD) and healthy
      control (HC) subjects, use administration of Corticorelin, a synthetic form of corticotropin
      releasing factor (CRF)and PET imaging to assess dopamine (DA) transmission in addiction. We
      will use [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET to measure striatal DA receptor binding on two occasions: 1)
      following corticorelin administration and 2) following saline. The change in receptor binding
      between the two occasions (i.e., displacement of [11C]-(+)-PHNO by endogenous DA) will index
      DA release.

      SUBJECTS CD subjects will meet DSM-IV criteria for abuse or dependence and be ~10d cocaine
      abstinent at the time of PET. HC will be recruited to match CD on age, sex, education, and
      cigarette smoking.

      PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES We will measure [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding on two occasions
      (corticorelin, saline), with the difference between conditions indexing dopamine release;
      this measure will then be compared between cocaine-dependent and control subjects. We will
      also measure plasma cortisol and ACTH), physiological measures, and subjective craving and
      mood.

    <description>Each subject will receive a single dose of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone corticorelin on a single occasion, and a volume-matched saline injection on a second occasion. Corticorelin will be administered as an intravenous infusion over a 30- to 60-second interval at a dose of 1 ug/kg body weight. ~15 minutes after Corticorelin/saline injection, [11C]-(+)-PHNO will be administered followed by 90 minutes of PET scanning. Primary outcome measure ([11C]-(+)-PHNO) as well as Secondary outcome measures (self reported feeling, hormones and physiological measures) will be obtained before saline or Corticorelin/saline injection and for 90-120 minutes following injection.</description>
