      The purpose of this study is to estimate the clinical benefit of lapatinib plus trastuzumab
      compared to lapatinib plus capecitabine as measured by investigator-assessed progression-free
      survival, tumour response and overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, explorative phase II trial of lapatinib plus trastuzumab
      or lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.
      The trial is designed to obtain some evidence wether chemotherapy-free combined HER2-directed
      therapy with lapatinib and trastuzumab provides a similar efficacy as the established
      combination of lapatinib with capecitabine and a more favourable toxicity profile. This study
      will also assess the relationship between the anticipated anti-tumour activity of the
      treatment regimens and biological characteristics of subjects' tumour at baseline.

      The purpose of this study is to estimate the clinical benefit of lapatinib plus trastuzumab
      compared to lapatinib plus capecitabine as measured by investigator-assessed progression-free
      survival, tumour response and overall survival.

      The purpose of this study ist further

        -  to characterize the safety and tolerability of lapatinib plus trastuzumab in this
           population.

        -  to identify predictors of sensitivity to lapatinib and trastuzumab therapy. and

        -  to compare the differences in health-related quality of life (HRQL) and pain symptoms
           for patients by treatment assignment.

    <description>The primary outcome measure for this study is:
• The 6-month PFS-rate (PFS6) The 6-month PFS-rate (PFS6) will be the number of patients without disease progression or death within 6 months from the date of randomization, divided by the number of patients in the respective analysis population. For the purpose of the analysis patients who are lost to follow-up or deceased in at or before 6 months after randomization will be counted as &quot;disease progression&quot;.</description>

    <description>Progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression (as assessed by the site radiologist and/or investigator, using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST1.1)) or death on study from any cause (defined as death within 30 days of the last study treatment), whichever occurs first. Data for patients who experienced no progress or who are lost to follow-up will be treated as censored on the last date the patient was known to be progression free.</description>
