      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of SAR405838 / pimasertib combination therapy in
      patients with solid tumors.

      To assess the anti-tumor activities of SAR405838 / pimasertib in patients with solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of SAR405838 and pimasertib.

      To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of the SAR405838 and pimasertib.

      To characterize genetic status in tumor tissue and circulating tumor DNA.

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a period to assess
      eligibility of up to 4 weeks, a treatment period of at least 6 weeks of study treatment, and
      an end-of-study visit at least 30 days (or until the patient receives another anti-cancer
      therapy, whichever is shorter) following the last administration of study drug.
