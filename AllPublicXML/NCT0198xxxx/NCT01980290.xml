  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information on the efficacy, safety and tolerability
      of telaprevir (in combination with other medications), in patients who have a history of
      intravenous drug use with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, under substitution therapy (eg.,
      methadone, buprenorphine) and/or followed in addiction centres.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, observational, prospective study to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and adherence to telaprevir in ex-People Who Inject Drugs (ex-PWIDs)
      infected with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C and any fibrosis stage including compensated
      cirrhosis, who are receiving substitution therapy (eg, methadone, buprenorphine) and/or are
      being followed in an addiction center. Patients may be treatment naïve or relapsers.
      Participating physicians are to offer enrollment in this study to all eligible patients at
      their site in who they plan to initiate triple therapy with telaprevir, pegylated interferon
      alfa (PegIFN alfa), and ribavirin (RBV). A target of 115 patients will participate in this
      study. The duration of each patient's participation in this study will be up to approximately
      60 weeks. After obtaining the signed participation agreement or ICF, selection criteria will
      be reviewed to verify the patient's eligibility. Data will be recorded in the electronic case
      report form (CRF) at 6 time points for each patient which correspond to routine care visits:
      inclusion, and at the patient's routine care visit closest to Week 4, 12, and 24, end of
      treatment, and end-of-follow-up (e.g., approximately 12 weeks after end-of-treatment). No
      additional blood, urine, or other biological samples will be required, and no additional
      investigations, beyond the routine clinical management of the patient, will be performed.

    <description>The EQ-5D consists of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) each of which can take 1 of 3 responses. The responses record 3 levels of severity (no problems/some or moderate problems/extreme problems). A standard vertical 20 cm visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording an individual's rating for their current health-related quality of life state is also included ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state)</description>

    <time_frame>on day 1 and routine visits closest to week 4, 12, 24 and end of treatment and end of follow-up (up to approximately 60 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is a validated 14-item scale with 7 of the items relating to anxiety and 7 relating to depression. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater likelihood of depression or anxiety. Cases of anxiety or depression are each defined by subscale scores of 8 or greater, and categorized as normal (score of 0-7), mild (score of 8-10), moderate (score of 11-14), and severe (score of 15-21). The recall period is the past week.</description>

    <time_frame>on day 1 and routine visits closest to week 4, 12, 24 and end of treatment and end of follow-up (up to approximately 60 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The AUDIT questionnaire consists of 10 questions about a patient's quantity and frequency of alcohol use. The response to 8 of the questions are scored as 0 = never, 1 = monthly or less, 2 = 2 to 4 times a month, 3 = 2 to 3 times a week, 4 = 4 or more times a week. Two questions are scored as 0 = no, 2 = yes, but not in the last year, 4 = yes, during the last year. A score of 8 or more is associated with harmful or hazardous drinking</description>
