  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to test whether 6 months of supervised weekly Kundalini
      yoga classes and a brief daily meditation homework assignment can improve memory and thinking
      in older adults with mild memory complaints when compared to weekly classes of memory
      training with daily homework assignments.

      The purpose of this pilot study intervention is to investigate brain mechanisms of response
      to memory enhancement training (MET) compared to Kundalini yoga and Kirtan Kriya meditation
      using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that will be acquired from each subject at
      baseline and at 12 weeks (post-randomization).

      Overall, the investigators anticipate recruiting 66 adults with memory complaints and
      diagnosed with MCI for adults 55 years old and older. Subjects will either receive: (1) MET
      class for 60 minutes per week; or (2) Kundalini yoga and Kirtan Kriya meditation class for 60
      minutes per week. All assessments will be completed immediately after the interventions for a
      total of 10 visits in 12 weeks and a follow-up visit at 6 months (24 weeks)to monitor the
      overall benefit of the intervention.
