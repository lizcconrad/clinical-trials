    <textblock>
      Cardiac catheterization is the most important test for the evaluation of cardiac patients.
      Since the beginning of the cardiac catheterization procedure, we have used the femoral artery
      puncture as a gateway for those procedures. Recently it is used more often the path for the
      radial. Using this approach has gained many followers worldwide and has been used almost
      routinely in our country but has not gained popularity because many interventional
      cardiologists argue that the transradial procedure is much more time-consuming and difficult.

      Research question: Are there differences in the total procedure time path between radial and
      femoral vascular to perform cardiac catheterizations?.

      This research focuses on the search for information to determine whether there are
      significant differences when the variables under study. This research is justified by the
      need to evaluate the two techniques in use and the lack of studies evaluating and comparing
      the radial arterial access in comparison with femoral access route which is widely used in
      all services hemodynamics national and international. The lack of research on the subject has
      made the use of the transradial procedure routinely not being done, because they have the
      idea that it is much more time-consuming and technically more difficult than the procedure
      performed by the femoral approach, hence Hemodynamics specialists, not everyone wants to
      start implementing the systematic use of the radial approach for cardiac catheterization
      studies.The main objective of this project is to determine the non-inferiority in terms of
      total procedure time path between radial and femoral vascular to perform cardiac
      catheterizations. Secondary objectives: the difference in time of puncture, duration of the
      procedure and recovery. Incidence of vascular complications and techniques between radial and
      femoral, presence of complications at 8 days of follow-up. Our aims to check through the
      results, if the difference in each of the variables favoring either of the two techniques and
      to determine the non-inferiority of one technique over the other in terms of ease and
      effectiveness of both procedures. The type of study is a controlled clinical trial open,
      randomized, non-inferiority. The study population will consist of patients who have been told
      the diagnostic cardiac catheterization, they are sent to the General Clinic Northern
      institution.
