      This study is a multicenter, non-blinded, non-comparative study. Patients who meet the
      eligible criteria will undergo one week observation period followed by four week treatment
      period. In treatment period, patients will receive gabapentin enacarbil orally one daily
      after dinner. After the four-week treatment period with gabapentin enacarbil, a one-week
      post-observation period will be undertaken.
