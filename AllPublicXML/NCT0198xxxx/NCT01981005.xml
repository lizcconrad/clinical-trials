    <textblock>
      This non-randomized, single group, open-label study will investigate the mass balance, routes
      of elimination, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of a single oral dose of RO5424802 and the
      pharmacokinetics of a 14C-labeled tracer in healthy volunteers

          -  Excessive alcohol consumption

          -  Use of any metabolic inducers (including herbals such as St. John's Wort) within 4
