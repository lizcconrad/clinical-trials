  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irisin, a newly discovered myokine induced in exercise, has potential effects in stimulating
      adipose tissue browning, fighting obesity and diabetes. No prior study has reported on the
      role of circulating irisin in healthy individuals in correlation with lean and fat body mass.
      Furthermore, the circadian and seasonal variation of irisin is largely unknown.

      The main aims of this prospective study will be to investigate: 1) circulating irisin levels
      in healthy, young men and women according to their lean and fat mass; 2) the circadian
      variations of irisin levels; 3) the seasonal variations of irisin levels.

    <description>A sub-population of 40 participants of the cohort will receive a standardized meal (Boost) in two different quantities (20 participants will receive 125 ml and 20 participants 250 ml). Serum irisin levels will be measured at baseline and 30 min postprandial.</description>

    <description>A sub-population of 20 participants of the cohort will be subjected to 30 min of aerobic exercise. Serum irisin levels will be measured at baseline and at 30 min.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>After a standardized dinner and an overnight fast, a blood sample for adiponectin and leptin will be obtained the next morning, and body composition (total body fat mass and bone-free lean mass) will be assessed by BIA. Participants will also be asked to complete a validated questionnaire assessing their diet and exercise habits. Correlations between serum irisin levels and the above parameters will be examined</description>
