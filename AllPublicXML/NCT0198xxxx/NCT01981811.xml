    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate adherence to treatment with, and safety and
      tolerability of, the medical information device #1 (MIND1) system in subjects with
      Schizophrenia or Bipolar I Disorder who are currently treated with oral aripiprazole.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to medication is a well-recognized problem in psychiatric patients and is a
      barrier to achieving optimal health. The MIND1 System is being developed to objectively and
      precisely monitor and measure real-time medication adherence; and to potentially enhance
      adherence. The MIND1 System includes oral aripiprazole with an embedded ingestible event
      marker (IEM), a Wearable Sensor, and a computerized device and accessories. This is a trial
      designed to evaluate adherence to treatment with, and safety and tolerability of, the medical
      information device #1 (MIND1) system in subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.
      This 12-week, single-arm trial will include male and female subjects 18 to 65years
      (inclusive) with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder who are currently
      treated with oral aripiprazole.

  <why_stopped>
    The trial was terminated because it was determined that the usability of the MIND1 System in
    the intended population was necessary before conducting this trial.

    <description>All subjects will continue to receive their previously prescribed dose of aripiprazole (10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg) through the trial. Subjects will discontinue dosing of the conventional oral aripiprazole tablet and will begin taking MIND1 (aripiprazole embedded with an Ingestible Event Marker) tablet once-daily for 12 weeks.</description>
