        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed GBM.

          -  GBM in recurrence/progression after surgery (or biopsy), standard radiotherapy and
             chemotherapy with Temozolomide.

          -  Imaging confirmation of first tumor progression or regrowth as defined by the RANO
             criteria.

          -  No more than one prior line of chemotherapy (Temozolomide).

          -  Recovery from the toxic effects of prior therapy.

          -  Patients who have undergone recent surgery for recurrent or progressive tumor are
             eligible provided that:

               1. Surgery must have confirmed the recurrence.

               2. A minimum of 14 days must have elapsed from the day of surgery to registration.
                  For core or needle biopsy, a minimum of 7 days must have elapsed prior to
                  registration.

               3. Craniotomy or intracranial biopsy site must be adequately healed and free of
                  drainage or cellulitis, and the underlying cranioplasty must appear intact at the
                  time of registration.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with the
             study protocol as judged by the investigator.

          -  Karnofsky-PS ≥ 60%.

          -  Stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids within 5 days prior to registration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable to undergo brain MRI scans with gadolinium (iv).

          -  Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy, grade ≥ 2.

          -  History of intracranial abscess within 6 months prior to registration.

          -  Anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the trial.

          -  Treatment with enzyme inducing antiepileptic agents was not allowed. However, patients
             whose anticonvulsant was changed to a nonenzymeinducing antiepileptic drug were
             eligible for entry after a 1-week ''washout'' period
