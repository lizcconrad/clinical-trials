    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Time to Meaningful Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 hours post dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Time to meaningful pain relief is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) captured as part of the double stopwatch method. Participants depress the second stop watch when they experience what they perceive as meaningful pain relief. Instructions to participants are: &quot;Stop the second stopwatch when the sore throat pain relief is meaningful to you. This does not mean you feel completely better, although you might, but when you feel relief of throat pain that is meaningful to you.&quot; Participants who did not have perceived pain relief were censored at 3 hours.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Time of First Perceived Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 hours post dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first perceived pain relief is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) captured as part of the double stopwatch method. Participants depress the first stop watch when they experience any pain relief, termed &quot;perceived pain relief&quot;. Instructions to participants are: &quot;Stop the first stopwatch when you first feel any sore throat pain relief whatsoever. This does not mean you feel completely better, although you might, but when you first feel any relief of the throat pain you have now.&quot; Participants who did not have perceived pain relief were censored at 3 hours.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Time of First Indication of Sore Throat Relief as Measured By Any Reduction in the Sore Throat Scale (STS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 hours post dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Time to first indication of sore throat relief, defined as any reduction or decrease in STS observed during the 3 hours post dose. Participants who did not have any reduction in STS from baseline within 3 hours were censored to 3 hours.
The participant was asked to evaluate his/her sore throat when swallowing using a vertical 0-10 Likert scale, where 0=not sore and 10=very sore. The participant was instructed: &quot;Circle the number that shows how sore your throat is now when you swallow.&quot; The STS was obtained at baseline, every 5 minutes after treatment during the first hour and every 10 minutes during the second and third hours.</description>

    <measure>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Time of First Perceived Pain Reduction on the Sore Throat Scale (STS) Which is Followed by ≥ 20% Pain Reduction on the Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), up to 3 hours post dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Time to pain reduction on the STS (defined as any reduction or decrease observed during the 3 hours post dose) for participants whose improvement was confirmed by a &gt;=20% reduction in pain on the STPIS.
STS: The participant was asked to evaluate his/her sore throat when swallowing using a vertical 0-10 Likert scale, where 0=not sore and 10=very sore. The participant was instructed: &quot;Circle the number that shows how sore your throat is now when you swallow.&quot; The STS was obtained at baseline, every 5 minutes after treatment during the first hour and every 10 minutes during the second and third hours.
STPIS: The participant was instructed to swallow and: &quot;Place a line on the Sore Throat Scale that best characterizes the severity of your sore throat now:&quot; 0mm=no pain and 100mm=severe pain. The STPIS was obtained at baseline, after the participant depressed the second stopwatch, and at 1, 2, and 3 hours postdose.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline at Individual Timepoints in Sore Throat Scale (STS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), up to 3 hours post dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The participant was asked to evaluate his/her sore throat when swallowing using a vertical 0-10 Likert scale, where 0=not sore and 10=very sore. The participant was instructed: &quot;Circle the number that shows how sore your throat is now when you swallow.&quot; The STS was obtained at baseline, every 5 minutes after treatment during the first hour and every 10 minutes during the second and third hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) in Sore Throat Scale (STS) Over the 3 Hours Post-baseline (STS SPID3)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose), up to 3 hours post dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The participant was asked to evaluate his/her sore throat when swallowing using a vertical 0-10 Likert scale, where 0=not sore and 10=very sore. The participant was instructed: &quot;Circle the number that shows how sore your throat is now when you swallow.&quot; STS was obtained at baseline, every 5 minutes after treatment during the first hour and every 10 minutes during the second and third hours, for a total of 24 post-dose measurements.
The time-weighted SPID combines relief magnitude (PID = change from baseline) as weighted by duration interval between ratings. SPID3 refers to measurements taken up to 3 hours post-baseline, and has a full range of -1332 (complete pain relief within 5 minutes of dosing that lasts for 3 hours) to 468 (drug escalates level of pain to a score of 10 and the pain stays at that level for 3 hours) using the mean baseline STS value 7.4 for this study.</description>

        <description>Time to meaningful pain relief is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) captured as part of the double stopwatch method. Participants depress the second stop watch when they experience what they perceive as meaningful pain relief. Instructions to participants are: “Stop the second stopwatch when the sore throat pain relief is meaningful to you. This does not mean you feel completely better, although you might, but when you feel relief of throat pain that is meaningful to you.” Participants who did not have perceived pain relief were censored at 3 hours.</description>

        <title>Kaplan-Meier Estimates for Time of First Perceived Pain Reduction on the Sore Throat Scale (STS) Which is Followed by ≥ 20% Pain Reduction on the Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS)</title>
        <description>Time to pain reduction on the STS (defined as any reduction or decrease observed during the 3 hours post dose) for participants whose improvement was confirmed by a &gt;=20% reduction in pain on the STPIS.
STS: The participant was asked to evaluate his/her sore throat when swallowing using a vertical 0-10 Likert scale, where 0=not sore and 10=very sore. The participant was instructed: &quot;Circle the number that shows how sore your throat is now when you swallow.&quot; The STS was obtained at baseline, every 5 minutes after treatment during the first hour and every 10 minutes during the second and third hours.
STPIS: The participant was instructed to swallow and: “Place a line on the Sore Throat Scale that best characterizes the severity of your sore throat now:” 0mm=no pain and 100mm=severe pain. The STPIS was obtained at baseline, after the participant depressed the second stopwatch, and at 1, 2, and 3 hours postdose.</description>

        <title>Time Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Differences (SPID) in Sore Throat Scale (STS) Over the 3 Hours Post-baseline (STS SPID3)</title>
        <description>The participant was asked to evaluate his/her sore throat when swallowing using a vertical 0-10 Likert scale, where 0=not sore and 10=very sore. The participant was instructed: &quot;Circle the number that shows how sore your throat is now when you swallow.&quot; STS was obtained at baseline, every 5 minutes after treatment during the first hour and every 10 minutes during the second and third hours, for a total of 24 post-dose measurements.
The time-weighted SPID combines relief magnitude (PID = change from baseline) as weighted by duration interval between ratings. SPID3 refers to measurements taken up to 3 hours post-baseline, and has a full range of -1332 (complete pain relief within 5 minutes of dosing that lasts for 3 hours) to 468 (drug escalates level of pain to a score of 10 and the pain stays at that level for 3 hours) using the mean baseline STS value 7.4 for this study.</description>
