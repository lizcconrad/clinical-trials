  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the segregation of the subthalamic nucleus into
      its motor and non-motor regions in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls
      with the aid of ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Voxels of the subthalamic nucleus that are structurally or functionally connected to the motor cortex.</measure>
    <time_frame>One measurement, consisting of 1 MRI scan of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Two brain areas are said to be structurally connected if they are connected by fiber tracks computed from diffusion weighted MRI data.
Two brain areas are said to be functionally connected if they show statistically significantly correlated resting state functional MRI signals.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength of the structural and functional connectivity between the subthalamic nucleus and the motor cortex.</measure>
    <time_frame>One measurement, consisting of 1 MRI scan of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Strength of the structural connectivity is defined as: fractional anisotropy along computed fiber tracks between the subthalamic nucleus and the motor cortex.
Strength of the functional connectivity is defined as: height of the correlation between the resting state functional MRI signals in the subthalamic nucleus and the motor cortex.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain areas structurally and functionally connected to the stimulation zone of the optimal electrode of operated Parkinson's patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>One measurement, consisting of 1 MRI scan of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>This results in a list with brain structures that are functionally and/or structurally connected to the stimulation zone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brain areas that show an activation pattern measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, that is correlated to a motor task.</measure>
    <time_frame>One measurement, consisting of 1 MRI scan of 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>This results in a list of brain areas that are related to the motor task.</description>
