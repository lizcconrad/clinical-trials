  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability of Toca 511 administered
      intravenously to patients with recurrent or progressive Grade III or Grade IV Gliomas who
      have elected to undergo surgical removal of their tumor. Patients meeting all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will receive an initial dose of Toca 511
      administered as an intravenous, bolus injection, followed approximately 11 days later by an
      additional dose injected into the walls of the resection cavity at the time of planned tumor
      resection. Approximately 6 weeks later, patients will begin treatment with oral Toca FC, an
      antifungal agent, and repeated every 4 weeks. All patients enrolled in this study will be
      encouraged to participate in a continuation protocol that enables additional Toca FC
      administration and the collection of long-term safety and response data.

    <description>All patients will receive Toca 511, a retroviral replicating vector that expresses the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene, intravenously and then intracranially. CD converts the antifungal 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in cells that have been infected by the Toca 511 vector. Beginning approximately 6 weeks after the second administration of Toca 511,patients will begin 7-day course of oral 5-FC, repeated every 4 weeks for the duration of the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has the subject given written informed consent?

          -  Is the subject between 18 years old and 80 years old inclusive?

          -  Has the subject had histologically proven HGG with recurrence or progression following
             initial definitive therapy(s) such as surgery with or without adjuvant radiation
             therapy and/or chemotherapy (confirmed by diagnostic biopsy or contrast-enhanced MRI
             and evaluable by Macdonald criteria)? Note, if first recurrence of HGG is documented
             by MRI, an interval of at least 12 weeks after the end of prior radiation therapy is
             required unless there is either: i) histopathologic confirmation of recurrent tumor,
             or ii) new enhancement on MRI outside of the radiotherapy treatment field.

          -  Does the patient have either (1) a single, enhancing tumor recurrence/progression that
             is ≤ 8 cm in greatest dimension, or (2) multiple enhancing tumor
             recurrences/progressions within the same surgical field where the sum of their
             greatest dimensions is ≤ 8 cm?

          -  Does the subject have an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 50 mL/min
             (inclusive) by the Cockcroft-Gault formula?
