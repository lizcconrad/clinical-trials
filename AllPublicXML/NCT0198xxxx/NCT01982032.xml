      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a good alternative treatment for patients
      with severe aortic valve stenosis with similar mid-term success rates as compared to surgery.
      Periprosthetic aortic regurgitation (PAR) after TAVR remains an important limitation of this
      technique. Moderate to severe PAR occurs in 15-45% of the cases and it is an independent
      predictor of mortality after TAVR. Little is known about potential differences in severity of
      PAR among different types of aortic valve prosthesis. The current randomized study aims to
      evaluate potential differences between the Edwards SAPIEN bioprosthesis and the Medtronic
      CoreValve® system with main focus on PAR and additional focus on other clinical and imaging
      endpoints. Primary objective of this study is to investigate the difference in the severity
      of PAR, measured with 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3DTEE), between
      patients undergoing the implantation of the Edwards SAPIEN bioprosthesis versus patients
      receiving the Medtronic CoreValve® bioprosthesis. Secondary objectives of this study include:
      investigating the value of different imaging modalities in evaluating periprosthetic
      regurgitation after TAVR and studying the difference in clinical endpoints according to
      VARC-2 definitions and quality of life after TAVR between two available aortic valve
      prostheses.

        following criteria:

          -  Patient is ≥18 years of age and diagnosed with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis,
             judged inoperable or at high surgical risk (EuroSCORE &gt; 15% or other criteria that
             make surgery high risk by a consensus among cardiologists and cardiac surgeons in the
             heart team) and deemed eligible for transfemoral-TAVI.
