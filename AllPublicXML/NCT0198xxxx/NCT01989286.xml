  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The positional plagiocephaly is a condition involving craniofacial asymmetry. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the spine, the posture and the psychomotor state in children who
      were diagnosed with infant plagiocephaly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Positional infant plagiocephaly is a clinical entity in which the shape of an infant's head
      becomes altered as the result of external forces applied to the malleable bones of the
      cranium and can occur pre- or postnatally. It is characterized by asymmetric occipital
      flattening (one side or the central part of the occiput is flattened)with ipsilateral frontal
      bossing.Viewed from above, this results in a parallelogram deformity of the head. We
      hypothesize that children who had plagiocephaly when they were infants, they have postural
      and spine implications at 3-5 years old.

    <measure>Spine assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The spine alignment, segmental and global angles in the sagittal and frontal planes,and the spinal mobility are going to be assessed by the Spinal Mouse®,a device guided manually on the skin along the spine.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postural evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The postural assessment comprises the static posture and the spinal flexibility by observing different positions and actions of the children.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychomotor assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The psychomotor development test, TEPSI, is going to be used to assess three areas: coordination, language and motor state. The children are asked to perform different activities and the success is registered.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The balance is assessed with the Pediatric Balance Test, asking the children to perform different tasks and observing the execution of these tasks.</description>

    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The parents are going to complete the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire, with different items evaluating the quality of sleep of the children.</description>
