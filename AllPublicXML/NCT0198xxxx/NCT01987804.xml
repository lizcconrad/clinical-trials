  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of all postmenopausal women, experience vaginal drynes, i.e. vaginal atrophy is a
      consequence due to the lack of estrogen. In addition, vaginal atrophy is associated with an
      increased pH, which creates an environment more susceptible to infections . The mucosal
      epithelium shows signs of severe senile atrophy and cytological examination demonstrate
      increased number of the basal and parabasal cells and reduced number of superficial cells .
      Unlike some other menopausal symptoms (for instance hot flushes), vaginal symptoms generally
      persist or worsen with aging.Oxytocin is a peptide hormone and it is released systemically
      via the posterior pituitary. The most well known effects of oxytocin are its roles in female
      reproduction such as facilitation of birth and breast feeding. Oxytocin has also shown to
      exert positive effects on the proliferation of human vaginal mucosal cells from
      postmenopausal women, an effect which could be attributed either to the direct stimulation of
      new cell formation or to an increased production of other growth factors. The primary
      objective is to investigate the dose relationsship of topical administrated Vagitocin on the
      vaginal mucosal membrane, measured in the change (%)of superficial cells up to 7 weeks after
      baseline.
