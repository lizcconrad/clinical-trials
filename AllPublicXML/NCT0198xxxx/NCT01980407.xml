  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In China, S-1 is an novel oral fluoropyrimidine with demonstrated high efficacy on
      gastrointestinal cancer. The new regimen with oxaliplatin and leucovorin is expected to
      achieve more encouraging efficacy on gastric cancer. This study is aimed to evaluate the
      feasibility of the SOL regimen on efficacy and tolerability on Chinese patients with advanced
      gastric cancer.
