    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that using the micropulse laser in patient with Central
      Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC) will prompt resolution of CSC and will be effective in
      significantly minimizing visual recovery time from this disease as well as potentially
      preventing recurrences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that application of 577nm micropulse laser in patients with CSC
      will prompt resolution of CSC as measured by ocular coherence tomography and best corrected
      visual acuity. This will be a pilot study to establish sound methods and provide some
      insights to the safety and efficacy of CSC treatment.

    <description>Central Serous Choroidopathy is a disease that causes fluid to build up under the retina,the back part of the inner eye that sends sight information to the brain. The objective here is to apply 577nm of micropulse laser to see if CSC resolution occurs and measuring it through ocular coherence tomography (retinal imaging), vision score, and visual field testing for retinal sensitivity.</description>
