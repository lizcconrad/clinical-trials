  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin (OT) is a small, naturally occurring peptide currently in clinical use to stimulate
      lactation in breastfeeding women. The intranasal administration of OT has recently attracted
      attention as a potential novel treatment in several psychiatric disorders including autism.
      However, given the anatomy of the nasal cavity, the current design of nasal sprays would be
      expected to provide an inadequate delivery of medication to the areas of the nasal cavity
      where direct transport into the brain via the olfactory nerve could potentially occur.
      OptiNose has developed an intranasal delivery device that provides improved reproducibility
      of nasal delivery, improved deposition to the upper posterior regions of the nasal cavity
      where the olfactory nerve innervates the nasal cavity.

      The primary objective of this study is to identify any differences between single dose 8 or
      24 international units (IU) oxytocin delivered intranasally with the optimised OptiNose
      device and 1 IU oxytocin administered as slow intravenous infusion in healthy volunteers.
      This will be measured in terms of brain activity as measured with functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI), performance on cognitive tests, and physiological markers.

             breastfeeding for the duration of the study. Adequate contraception is defined as the
             usage by the female partner of any form of hormonal contraception or intra-uterine
             device (which should be established prior to the start of the study) plus usage by one
