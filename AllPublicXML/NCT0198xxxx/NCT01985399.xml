    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that older HIV-infected individuals (i.e., &gt;50 years old) on
      efavirenz (EFV)-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) will have significantly worse
      neurocognitive function than older individuals on non-EFV-containing ART.

    <textblock>
      With the aging of the HIV-infected population in the United States and elsewhere,
      neurocognitive dysfunction will likely become an increasingly common problem. Older
      individuals could be at increased risk for efavirenz-associated adverse effects due to
      impaired metabolism, increased drug-drug interactions, and lower physiologic reserve, but
      there are few data on the long-term safety of efavirenz (and other antiretrovirals) in older
      individuals with HIV.

      The Stanford HIV Aging Cohort (SHAC) is an ideal setting to study potential neurologic
      effects of antiretrovirals in aging patients. SHAC is an ongoing longitudinal study initiated
      in 2008 to evaluate aging in virologically-suppressed HIV-infected individuals. The cohort is
      supported through multiple grants including a grant from the State of California's HIV
      Research Program as well as a NIH supplemental grant. As of September 2013, approximately 150
      virologically-suppressed HIV-infected adults have been enrolled. In addition to enrolling
      patients with good adherence to ART, the cohort purposefully excludes subjects with active
      substance abuse, unstable medical conditions, and psychiatric illnesses to limit potential
      confounding the study end points. Recently, an NIH supplemental grant (AI069556) was received
      which will expand the SHAC to 300 HIV-infected subjects. The median age of the subjects in
      the cohort is in the mid-50's allowing an ample number of older subjects for our planned
      studies.

    <description>Neurocognitive function will be assessed using a detailed battery of neuropsychologic tests including timed gait, grooved pegboard with the dominant and non-dominant hands, the Rey auditory verbal learning test trials I-VII, trail making parts A and B, Rey auditory verbal learning test trial VIII 30-min delay, controlled oral word association test and paced auditory serial addition task. This battery has been used extensively in previous studies in HIV. Z-scores for each neurocognitive test, based on age-adjusted norms, and a composite Z-score will be calculated. The Z-score represents the amount, in standard deviation units, that the subject's test result deviates from population means.
In addition to neurocognitive function, the level of depression and anxiety and sleep quality will be evaluated using validated instruments.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrollment into SHAC (Stanford HIV Aging cohort)

          -  Age over 50 years of age

          -  Stable antiretroviral therapy containing EFV- or PI-containing ART (but not both) for
             at least 6 months

          -  HIV RNA levels of &lt;200 copies/mL for at least 6 months excluding blips (i.e., a single
             measurement between 200-500 copies/mL preceded and followed by measurements of &lt;200
             copies/mL) while on ART.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Completed treatment for any acute systemic infection (other than HIV-1) less than four
             weeks before study entry

          -  Any active brain infection (except for HIV-1), brain neoplasm, or space-occupying
             brain lesion.

          -  Any active psychiatric illness including schizophrenia, severe depression, or severe
             bipolar affective disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound
             the analysis of the neuropsychological test results.

          -  Active drug or alcohol abuse that, in the investigator's opinion, could prevent
             compliance with study procedures or confound the analysis of study endpoints.
