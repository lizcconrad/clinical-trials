      The objetive of this study is to determine the minimum amount of Alternaria alternata
      allergen extract producing in a positive skin reaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, unblinded and non-randomized biological assay. The primary objective is to
      assess the concentration of alternaria alternata allergen extract that elicits a wheal size
      equivalent to that of a 10 mg/ml histamine dyhidrochloride solution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Positive clinical history of inhalatory allergy to Alternaria alternata. Subject has
        provided written informed consent, appropriately signed and dated by the subject.

        Subject can be male or female of any race and ethnic group. -Age &gt; and =18 years and &lt; and
        = 60 years at the study inclusion day.

        Positive skin prick test with a standardized commercially available preparation of
        Alternaria alternata allergen extract. The skin prick test will be considered positive if
        the test results in a wheal major diameter of at least 3 mm or wheal area ≥ 7 mm2. Positive
        skin prick test results are valid if performed within one year prior to the inclusion of
        the subject in the study.

        A positive test for specific IgE to alternaria alternata (CAP-RAST major or equal to 2).
        IgE results are valid if performed within one year prior to the inclusion of the subject in
        the study.

        The mean wheal diameters of the obtained with histamine dihydrochloride (10 mg / ml) in the
        forearm ≥ 3 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Immunotherapy in the past 5 years with an allergen preparation known to interfere with the
        allergen to be tested (for example: fungal extracts) Use of drugs that may interfere with
        the skin reactions (e.g., antihistamines). Treatment with any of the following medications:
        oral tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, corticosteroids (major 10
        mg/daily of prednisone or equivalent).

        Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding period and women with positive pregnancy test at
        Visit 1 or 2.

        Dermographism affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit. Atopic
        dermatitis affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

        Urticaria affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit. Diseases of the
        immune system relevant clinically, both autoimmune and immunodeficiencies.

        Serious diseases not controlled that may increase the risk for the safety of the subjects
        involved in this study, including, but not limited to the following: heart failure,
        uncontrolled or severe respiratory diseases, endocrine diseases, clinically relevant kidney
        or liver diseases or hematological diseases.

        Participation in any other clinical trial within 30 days prior to the inclusion of the
        subject in this clinical trial. Patients with diseases or conditions that limit the use of
        adrenaline (heart disease, severe hypertension).

        Severe psychiatric, psychological or neurological disorders. Abuse of alcohol, drugs or
        medicines in the previous year. Subjects who have received anti-IgE (Omalizumab).
