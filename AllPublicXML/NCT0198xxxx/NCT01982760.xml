      This is study looking at the use of a medication, Desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), to reduce
      bleeding, swelling, and bruising in patients undergoing cosmetic nose surgery. DDAVP is a
      drug used in patients with bleeding disorders. It works by activating molecules in the blood
      stream called platelets that promote clotting. In the study, participants who are have
      cosmetic nose surgery (rhinoplasty) will be randomly assigned to receive or not receive
      medication. Photographs taken before and shortly after surgery will be evaluated for the
      amount of bruising and swelling. Patients with heart, lung, kidney, or liver problems are not
      eligible to participate.
