  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to describe the feasibility of the passation of the assessment
      battery of psychomotor functions tests (NP-MOT) in children aged 4 to 11 years with a
      diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder: number and type of evaluable events, number and type
      of tests with a deficit compared to the standard results.

      After informed consent obtention, the children will be submitted to the different tests of
      the battery to evaluate the psychomotor functions. The results will be compared with other
      data collected from the routine practise : socio-demographic data, medical and developmental
      antecedents,psychological tests (KABC II, Rey test, London Tower test, ...), psychomotor
      evaluation (MABC, evaluation of manual praxis, visual abilities, Frostig test), understanding
      data (N-EEL test), neuropediatric examination, clinical assessment (ADI-R, CARS).

      The use of this battery allows this fine discriminative assessment of the psychomotor
      functions involved in the movement. Exploring each function will allow to take into account
      qualitative and quantitative aspects of the movement in every aspects, and this is not
      applied in the routine care until now. Calibration for each event can explore each function
      independently of each other, and will provide information to determine any specific
      developmental characteristics improve care.

    <description>the NP-MOT battery tests include several tests to evaluate 9 motor functions (muscle tone, gross motor, laterality, fine-digit movement, digital tactile gnosis, hand-eye skill, body spatial orientation, pace, auditory attention) with 48 subtests.
We describe:
number and type of evaluable tests, number and type of tests with results with 1 Standard Deviation different from the standard results.
number and type of tests with results with 2 Standard Deviation different from the standard results.</description>

    <description>Children with autism spectrum disorders pass a specific battery test (NP-MOT) for a neuropsychomotor assessment. This neuropsychomotor assessment is administered in a half-day maximum. This battery aims to investigate passive muscle tone (shoulders, limbs, and trunk), standing and synkinesia, static and dynamic balance, tonic laterality (extensibility and dangling of hands and feet to identify the tonic dominant side), laterality of use, fine-digit movements, digital tactile gnosis, and body spatial integration (knowing left from right: for oneself and that of others, and with regard to objects).</description>
