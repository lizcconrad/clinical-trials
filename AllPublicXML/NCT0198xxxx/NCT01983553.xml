      The purpose of this study is to conduct a passive surveillance of hospitalized dengue cases
      in subjects who participated in study CYD23 (NCT00842530).

      The Objectives are:

        -  To describe the incidence of virologically-confirmed hospitalized dengue cases.

        -  To characterize hospitalized dengue cases.

        -  To evaluate the occurrence of related and fatal serious adverse events (SAEs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a passive surveillance of hospitalized dengue cases in subjects who
      participated in study CYD23 (NCT00842530) where subjects were initially randomized to receive
      3 injections of either CYD dengue vaccine or control at 6 month intervals. Any SAE related to
      a study procedure or related to a previous injection from study CYD23, or any fatal SAEs
      (even if unrelated) will be reported to the Sponsor.

      An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will also be involved in the regular review
      of virologically-confirmed hospitalized dengue cases. Any fatal outcome or related SAE will
      be promptly reviewed by the IDMC.

      No study vaccinations will be administered in this protocol.

    <description>Case are defined as (1) An acute febrile illness with fever lasting for at least 1 day (temperature 37.5 C measured at least twice with an interval of at least 4 hours) (2) Virologically confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) or dengue non structural protein 1 (NS1) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Antigen (Ag) test with the addition of serotype strain specific analyses where appropriate and (3) In patient hospitalization</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Classification of dengue cases following participation in Study CYD23</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post vaccination in subjects who participated in study CYD23</time_frame>
    <description>Classification will be based on: (1) Detection of dengue viremia, clinical signs and symptoms, duration of clinical syndrome, duration of hospitalization, neutralizing antibody titers and other pertinent criteria (2) A severity assessment using the World Health Organization (WHO) 1997 severity definition and the IDMC severity definition and (3) A dengue serological profile based on immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM ELISA results in all acute febrile episodes. Neutralizing antibody titers will be assessed in all virologically confirmed dengue cases</description>

    <measure>Number and nature of reported serious adverse events following vaccination in study CYD23</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years post vaccination in subjects who participated in Study CYD23</time_frame>
    <description>This include the occurrence, nature (MedDRA preferred term), seriousness criteria, relationship, outcome, and whether the SAE led to early termination from the study of SAEs related to study procedures or to previous injection from study CYD23 and fatal (even if unrelated) SAEs in all subjects</description>
