             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Subjects with a history of or current positive results for any of the following
             serological tests: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core antibody
             (HBcAb), anti Hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Subjects with a history of autoimmune disorders.

          -  Subjects with a history of allergic or anaphylactic reaction to a therapeutic drug.

          -  History of tuberculosis or active, latent or inadequately treated tuberculosis
             infection.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half lives or 180 days for biologics preceding
             the first dose of study medication.

          -  Pregnant females; breastfeeding females; and females of childbearing potential.
