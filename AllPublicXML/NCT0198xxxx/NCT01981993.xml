      BACKGROUND:

      Early diagnosis and prognostication of acute kidney injury in patients with sepsis is key to
      further our understanding this disease and in the evaluation of new interventions for this
      condition. Many urinary biomarkers have been proposed, but no single one seems to
      consistently provide additional information on top of clinical and routine biochemical
      parameters. Some authors have proposed to use a panel of urinary biomarkers to increase the
      accuracy However, this approach has so far not been tested in a large group of patients with
      sepsis. In addition, newer and more performant analytical techniques have been developed that
      warrant testing in the clinical field.

      PATIENTS AND METHODS:

      At least 150 consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary care intensive care unit (ICU) with
      sepsis will be included. After bladder catheterisation, urinary samples will be collected at
      time points 0, 4 hours and 24 hours after admission, and further daily on day 1-5. Samples
      will be immediately centrifuged and frozen at -80Â°C until analysis. Samples will be extracted
      by removing larger proteins (&gt;20kDa) and de-salting step prior to mass spectrometry analysis.
      Investigators will use capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) to assess urinary
      peptides predictive of AKI: 20 peptides constituting the AKI marker pattern previously
      established from a cohort of ICU patients. Simultaneously, samples will be analysed using
      matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS),
      an alternative platform to CE-MS, which is currently being developed for routine ICU use. A
      proof of concept of the technique involved has been successfully applied to a set of urine
      samples from patients diagnosed with diabetes presenting normoalbuminuria (controls) and
      macroalbuminuria (cases).

      Clinical, demographic and biochemical data of patients will be collected during the first 5
      days.

      PATIENT OUTCOME

        -  in the short term:

             -  development of acute kidney injury according to RIFLE criteria

             -  death

             -  need for renal replacement therapy during ICU stay

        -  on the longer term

             -  death

             -  need for renal replacement therapy

             -  estimated glomerular filtration rate as calculated by MDRD at 3 months, 1 year and
                2 years.

      Using cut-offs , Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, negative and positive predictive
      value will be used to describe diagnostic performance of the biomarker panel alone, or in
      combination with basic clinical and/or routine biochemical parameters. Univariate and
      multivariate logistic regression for death will be used to evaluate prognostication value of
      the biomarker set.

      In addition, new discriminatory cut-offs of proteomic patterns as determined by more recent
      proteomic analysis techniques will be determined in a training set (half of the cohort) and
      validated in the other half of the cohort. Using the MALDI-TOF MS platform, investigators
      will assess urinary peptides that were predictive of AKI in a training set (ca. 75 patients)
      with good diagnostic performance of the marker panel (accuracy above 0.8) . Performance of
      the biomarker panel will be assessed in a blinded test set of ca. 75 patients to evaluate
      validity of the model in AKI detection.
