  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FPCOS is associated with an adverse cardiometabolic profile, consisting of increased total or
      central adiposity, increased insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism. Low-grade
      chronic inflammation predicts cardiovascular outcomes and is observed in women with PCOS.
      However, obesity is also associated with increased inflammatory markers. Obesity is per se
      associated with increased adipose expression and plasma levels of leptin, lower expression of
      adiponectin, and elevated inflammatory markers. To study the insulin resistance、inflammatory
      markers and cardiovascular risk in women with PCOS, body weight status should be considered.
      Investigator therefore conduct this retrospective study to evaluate the insulin
      resistance、inflammatory and cardiovascular markers between PCOS and non-PCOS among obese and
      non-obese women.
