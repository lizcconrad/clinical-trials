  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delirium in the intensive care unit is an acutely developed brain dysfunction affecting up to
      80 % of patients. It is associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality
      during admission and post-discharge. The mechanism behind the condition is poorly understood
      but assumably multifactorial, and the purpose of this study is to investigate the
      pathophysiology further.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology behind delirium in critical illness is not clarified but assumed to
      involve inflammation, changes in cerebral perfusion and neurotransmission, sleep deprivation
      and the use of i.e. sedatives.

      Cortical spreading depression is a phenomenon occuring in critically ill patients with acute
      cerebral trauma and likely associated with significant secondary neuron damage.

      The hypothesis is that

        1. Delirium in critically ill patients without acute cerebral damage is a clinical
           manifestation of cortical spreading depression and can be recorded in a noninvasive
           direct current-electroencephalography

        2. Electroencephalographic alterations or potentially specific signatures occur in delirium
           and thus, delirium can be predicted by recording continuous alternate current
           electroencephalography on admission in an ICU
