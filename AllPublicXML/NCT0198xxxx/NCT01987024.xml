  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It consists of evaluating the advantage of routine detection of phIGFBP-1 to reduce the total
      duration of hospitalization for patients with a risk of preterm labor before 32 weeks of
      gestation without increasing the number of preterm labour.

      Methods Patient with a risk of preterm labor (ultrasound cervical length &lt; 25 mm +/-
      described or recorded uterine contractions) before 32 weeks of gestation will be hospitalized
      to receive tocolytic drugs and antenatal corticosteroid therapy according to our gold
      standard protocol. After 48 hours, they will be assessed by examination, external
      tocodynamometry and the measure of cervical length by ultrasound. Stabilized patients will be
      included and randomized into 2 groups of 210 patients each. The first group &quot;A&quot; will benefit
      from the standard protocol (extended hospitalization of 2 or 4 days according to the clinical
      and ultrasound assessment); whereas the second group, &quot;B&quot;, will have the benefit of the
      detection of phIGFBP-1.If the result proves negative, patients could be discharged early at
      day 2. In the case of a positive result, patients will follow the standard procedure because
      of the low positive predictive value of the test. The main outcome is the total duration of
      hospitalization.

      Study duration The trial period will be 36 months.

      Expected results The use of detection of IGFBP-1 would enable us to select patients at risk
      and to decrease the duration of hospitalization in the case of a negative result.

      Perspectives The negative predictive value of phIGFBP-1 test could be useful to select
      patients with stabilized risk of preterm labor, who could be discharged early. Moreover it
      could be used, in the Perinat Sud network, to decide if patients with a risk of preterm labor
      would benefit from hospitalization in a level II or III maternity ward.
