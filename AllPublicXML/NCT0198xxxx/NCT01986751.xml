  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve blocks are used to decrease the amount of pain you have after surgery. We are asking
      you to take part in a research study. This research study will test whether adding a medicine
      called clonidine to nerve blocks helps to improve them. Nerve blocks typically last less than
      a day after surgery. We are looking for ways to make them work better and last longer.
      Clonidine is approved for use as a blood pressure medicine. Its use in nerve blocks is
      investigational, but it may help nerve blocks to last longer. Adding clonidine to nerve
      blocks may also decrease the amount of pain medicine a person has after surgery. All people
      who enter this study will receive a nerve block with the normal medicine, but half of people
      will also have clonidine added to their nerve block. This study will enroll 60 participants
      from UAB hospitals.
