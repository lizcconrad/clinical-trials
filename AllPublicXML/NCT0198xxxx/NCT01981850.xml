  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PRM-151 is an investigational drug that is being developed for possible use in the treatment
      of myelofibrosis (MF), a disease in which the bone marrow, which is the organ in the body
      that makes blood cells, is replaced by fibrosis, or excess scar tissue.

      The purpose of this study is to gather information on whether PRM-151 has an effect on the MF
      disease, whether it is safe in patients with MF, and how well it is tolerated.

      Stage 2 of this study is ongoing. Stage 2 is a randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study to
      determine the efficacy and safety of three different doses of PRM-151 in subjects with PMF
      and post ET/PV MF. Subjects will be randomized to one of three doses: 0.3 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg or
      10 mg/kg of PRM-151. This is the second stage of an adaptive design study as defined in FDA
      Draft Guidance for Industry: Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics,
      February 2010. Modifications to dose levels, schedule, and regimen have been made in Stage 2
      based on data from Stage 1.

      Stage 1 of this study has completed. Stage 1 was an open-label, Simon two stage, Phase 2
      study to determine the efficacy and safety of two different dose schedules of PRM-151 in
      subjects with PMF and post ET/PV MF. There were two treatment cohorts, each assigned to one
      of two dose schedules of PRM-151. Subjects were assigned to a weekly or every four week
      dosing schedule by the investigator.
