      The impact of medications used for secondary stroke prevention relies heavily upon patient
      adherence. Adherence is defined as &quot;the extent to which a person's behavior - taking
      medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed
      recommendations from a health care provider.&quot; It is said that optimal adherence to
      medications may reduce the risk of a poor outcome by 26%.

      The purpose of this study which is a non-pharmacologic behavioral study is to encourage
      adherence to medications in stroke survivors by tailored and specific SMS reminders. (Short
      Text Messages). These SMS reminders will support and assist stroke patients to take
      medications as prescribed and on time. We hypothesise that SMS will improve the adherence of
      patients to stroke medications by 2 points on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains a major cause of death and disability globally, accounting for 46.6 million
      disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) worldwide. More than 85% of all stroke-related deaths
      occur in low- and middle-income (LMI) countries. In a study from our center in Pakistan, the
      all-cause mortality due to stroke was 12.9% in the first year. Vascular causes in general and
      recurrent stroke in particular accounted for the bulk of the mortality cases. Recurrence of a
      stroke in Pakistan is documented to be as high as 53% in the first year, as opposed to
      international rates of approximately 30% in the first month. Evidence based guidelines
      recommend risk factor control with antiplatelet agents, anti-hypertensive medications, lipid
      lowering drugs and appropriate anti-diabetic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke recurrence.
      When taken together, the combination of an antihypertensive, statin and antiplatelet agent
      can reduce total stroke risk by 80%.

      However, the impact of drugs used for secondary stroke prevention relies heavily upon patient
      adherence. Adherence is defined as &quot;the extent to which a person's behavior - taking
      medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed
      recommendations from a health care provider.&quot; It is said that optimal adherence to
      medications may reduce the risk of a poor outcome by 26%.

      The purpose of this study which is a non-pharmacologic behavioral study is to encourage
      adherence to medications in stroke survivors by tailored and specific SMS (Short Text
      Messages) reminders. These SMS reminders will support and assist stroke patients to take
      medications as prescribed and on time. We hypothesise that SMS will improve the adherence of
      patients to stroke medications by 2 points on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale.

    <description>Intervention is as follows: Drug reminder SMS will be sent to the participants in the intervention arm customised to their stroke prescription. These SMS will be interactive in a way that the participants will have to answer back if they have taken their medicine or not in a &quot;Yes/No&quot; format. Moreover behaviour change SMS will also be sent to the intervention arm twice weekly. In addition , Participants will be encouraged to take medication using a taxonomy of behavioral change intervention techniques.</description>

          -  Give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic Renal Failure (because such patients keep getting admitted often and also have
