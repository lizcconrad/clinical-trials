  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The finding that ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is increased in pre-eclamptic pregnancy
      suggests a role for IMA as a potential biomarker for abnormal placental development related
      to miscarriage.This study was undertaken to evaluate IMA levels in women with recurrent
      pregnancy loss (RPL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) measured by the albumin cobalt binding test is a relatively
      new biomarker in the identification of myocardial ischemia. Experimental studies have shown
      that pregnancies normally develop in a relatively hypoxic intrauterine environment, and the
      subsequent reperfusion and oxidative stress is important for physiological trophoblast
      development. The finding that maternal serum IMA levels are raised so early in pregnancy
      provides further support for IMA as a potential marker for abnormal placental development
      that may be related to early pregnancy loss. In this study, we aimed to evaluate maternal
      circulating IMA levels in women with RPL by comparing them with healthy controls.
