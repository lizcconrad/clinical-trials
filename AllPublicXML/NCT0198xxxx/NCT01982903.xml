  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether urinary connective tissue growth factor
      (uCTGF) can predict the onset of fibrosis in transplanted kidneys.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since March 2004, and as part of routine clinical practice, protocol renal allograft biopsies
      are routinely performed at implantation and at 3, 12 and 24 months after transplantation, in
      all patients who receive a kidney transplant at the University Hospitals Leuven, unless there
      is a medical contra-indication or patient refusal to undergo this procedure. The biopsies are
      scheduled using a dedicated Microsoft Access database (&quot;Biopsy Database&quot;), that is maintained
      on the central servers of the University Hospitals Leuven. Patients who have an unexplained
      change in renal allograft function, undergo additional clinically indicated indication
      biopsies. These biopsies are also recorded in the aforementioned Microsoft Access Database.

      All clinical data, including pretransplant donor and recipient characteristics, and
      post-transplant follow-up data are directly stored and maintained in a prospectively
      collected electronic database (CCL database until 06/2012, transferred to the central KWS
      database in 2012). This electronic database is the only existing clinical database for these
      patients, and contains all clinical patient charts. No written records are collected.

      All renal allograft biopsies will be scored by a single renal pathologist according to the
      most recent Banff classification, blinded for the clinical parameters and timing of the
      biopsy. These rescoring data are directly entered in the dedicated Microsoft Access database
      (&quot;Biopsy Database&quot;).
