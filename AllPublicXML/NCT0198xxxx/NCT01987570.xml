    <textblock>
      Generating critical levels of power is a prerequisite for performing simple daily activities,
      such as rising from a chair or climbing stairs. For a young healthy person these activities
      can be performed easily, however after a prolonged period of forced inactivity (such as
      during the recovery from a sports injury, prolonged bed rest or spaceflight) a loss of muscle
      mass occurs. It has been suggested that this loss may be triggered by oxidative stress. An
      enzyme involved in the production of free radicals in various experimental models, including
      immobilization, is xanthine oxidase (XO). Although allopurinol is an inhibitor of XO widely
      used in clinical practice, its effect on the maintenance of muscle mass after an
      immobilization protocol is unknown. Thus, the major aim of this clinical trial is to
      determine the effect of allopurinol administration on the prevention of muscle mass loss in
      immobilized subjects.

      This is a prospective, randomized study in which fifty young male subjects (aged between 25
      and 40 years) diagnosed with grade II ankle sprain will be recruited. After immobilization
      the patients will be assigned randomly to one of two experimental groups, one treated with
      allopurinol (n=25) and the other with placebo (n=25). The dosage of allopurinol will be the
      same as recommended for gout patients, i.e. 300 mg/day orally, during all the immobilization
      period, which will last fifteen days. This medication will be delivered to the patients when
      they agree to participate in the clinical trial. They will be immobilized by posterior knee
      splint, preventing use of that leg.

      We will determine muscle mass loss by performing two magnetic resonances of both legs before
      and after the immobilization period. We will also take two blood samples (before and after
      immobilization) to measure oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, protein carbonyls,
      and XO activity), inflammatory parameters (IL-6, C-reactive protein and 1-antichymotrypsin),
      as well as vitamin D levels.
