  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effects of Prevena therapy on decreasing groin
      surgical site infections in patients who are obese and /or diabetic having vascular surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are obese and/or diabetic may have poor surgical healing and infection rates
      higher. The PREVENA therapy will be used to evaluate possible reduction of infection rates in
      this patient population
