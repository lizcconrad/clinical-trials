  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treadmill training has been shown to be beneficial for reducing motor symptoms of Parkinson's
      disease (PD). The mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of treadmill training remain
      unknown. However, specific types of intrinsic feedback generated from muscle spindles (detect
      changes in length of muscle) and golgi tendon organs (detect muscle force) seem to be an
      important factor for achieving the reductions in motor scores. This study will compare a
      treadmill program that generates a high rate of intrinsic feedback to a treadmill program
      focused on generating a high magnitude of intrinsic feedback.

    <description>A measure of the motor symptom severity within Parkinsons. UPDRS III is a qualitative assessment performed by a trained clinician. Specifically, a change in UPDRS III from pre to post is the main outcome measure.
The UPDRS-III score is a summation of 27 tasks that are scored from 0-4. 0 meaning no impairment, and 4 representing extreme impairment, inability to complete task. Possible scores on the UPDRS-III range from 0 (no impairment) to 108 (extreme impairment).</description>

    <time_frame>pre test occurs within the week prior to the start of the treadmill training program. Post testing will occur during the week immediately following the 6 week treadmill training program.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will walk on a pressure sensitive GAITRite carpet (Sparta, NJ), at both comfortable and fast paced walking speeds. Changes in gait characteristics from pre to post are what is being examined.
Quantitative measures of gait such as step time, step length, walking velocity, and others will be used in the analysis.
Spotters are always present to ensure safety during this assessment.</description>

        <title>Spatiotemporal Aspects of Gait</title>
        <description>Participants will walk on a pressure sensitive GAITRite carpet (Sparta, NJ), at both comfortable and fast paced walking speeds. Changes in gait characteristics from pre to post are what is being examined.
Quantitative measures of gait such as step time, step length, walking velocity, and others will be used in the analysis.
Spotters are always present to ensure safety during this assessment.</description>
