  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators have established a cohort of patients with recent-onset inflammatory
      arthritis called Early Undifferentiated PolyArthritis (EUPA). This cohort was established to
      define novel biomarkers of poor outcomes. We want to study telomere length and T-cell
      Receptor Excision Circles (TREC) numbers in peripheral blood as new biomarkers.

      This cohort of normal controls was established to be able to define the stability over short
      periods of time of telomere length and TREC numbers in normal individuals, in order to
      compare with arthritis patients.

      It is difficult to establish early on the prognosis of patients with recent-onset
      polyarthritis. We want to know if we can use the length of telomeres in peripheral blood
      cells at baseline as a novel prognostic marker.

      In order to be able to interpret our observations in arthritis patients over time, we need to
      compare these results with those observed in normal human controls adjusted for gender and
      for age groups.

      These patients are first screened for the presence of acute or chronic severe diseases
      (cancer, cardiovascular, articular, et...). They then have genomic DNA extracted from
      peripheral blood at Baseline and at 3 months interval for a year than annually for a total
      duration of 5 years. A complete blood count is collected at each blood draw. At each blood
      draw, the appearance of acute or chronic diseases is noted.
