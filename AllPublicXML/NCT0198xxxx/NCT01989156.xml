      Evaluate if the ad libitum use of the THS 2.2 Menthol (mTHS), a candidate Modified Risk
      Tobacco Product, for 5 days in confinement, and after 86 days in an ambulatory setting, by
      apparently adult healthy smokers results in a reduction in the levels of biomarkers of
      exposure (BoExp) to selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs).

      The main goal of the study is to evaluate if the ad libitum use of the THS 2.2 Menthol (mTHS)
      for 5 days in confinement, and after 86 days in an ambulatory setting, by apparently adult
      healthy smokers results in a reduction in the levels of biomarkers of exposure (BoExp) to
      selected harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) compared to smokers continuing
      smoking their own preferred brand of menthol conventional cigarette (mCC) and smoking
      abstinence (SA). Smokers who remained abstinent from SA were used as a benchmark to provide
      context to the exposure reduction.

      <recruitment_details>Study initiated (first subject screened): 17 December 2013
At admission (Day -2), all the subjects performed a product trial of THS 2.2 Menthol. During the baseline period, they continued to smoke their single preferred brand of mCC. Then, on Day 0, they were randomized to one of the 3 study arms (mTHS 2.2, mCC or SA) in a 2:1:1 ratio.</recruitment_details>
