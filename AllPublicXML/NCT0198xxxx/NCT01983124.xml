  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the activity of Vemurafenib in combination with
      Fotemustine in Patients with unresectable Stage IV melanoma harboring V600 BRAF mutation who
      recurred while in treatment with Vemurafenib. In addition the feasibility and safety profile
      of prolonging treatment of this drugs combination will be assessed.

    <textblock>
      Patients are treated with Fotemustine 100 mg/m2 q21 + Vemurafenib. Vemurafenib will be
      administered continuous oral dosing at 960 mg twice daily or dose administered at time of
      disease progression with Vemurafenib previous treatment (720 or 480 mg).Treatment will be
      continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The Progression-free survival will be
      assessed as primary endpoint, other outcomes(i.e., incidence of grade III-IV toxicity,
      Disease Control Rate, and Overall Survival) will be considered secondary endpoints.
