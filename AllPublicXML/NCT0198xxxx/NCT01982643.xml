      The aim of this 2-stage, 3-site study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of a
      combination of extended-release depot naltrexone plus extended-release bupropion as a
      potential pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine (MA) use disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stage 1 will include 20 individuals with severe stimulant use disorder (methamphetamine type)
      enrolled across three study sites. Following a maximum 30-day screening period to establish
      eligibility, participants will receive a monthly injection of extended-release depot
      naltrexone (XR-NTX; as Vivitrol®) plus once-daily bupropion extended-release tablets (BRP; as
      Wellbutrin XL®) for 8 weeks. Take-home oral study medication (BRP) will be dispensed weekly
      for dosing on non-clinic days. Participants will be asked to attend clinic twice weekly for
      observed BRP dosing, collection of urine samples, assessments, and medical management.
      Following the 8-week active medication phase, participants will complete a follow-up phase,
      including a medication taper and post-medication phase follow-up visit during Week 9. If
      Stage 1 data document success (see criteria below) in at least 3 &quot;responder&quot; study
      participants, Stage 2 will follow utilizing the same protocol as in Stage 1, to enroll an
      additional group of 29 participants. Using the same criteria of &quot;responder&quot; success, if the
      combined stages document success in at least 9 of 49 study participants, the combination
      medication will be considered to have shown sufficient potential to advance to a large-scale
      placebo-controlled trial.
