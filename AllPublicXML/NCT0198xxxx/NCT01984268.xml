    <textblock>
      Adenocorticotrophic Hormone provides safe and effective treatment to induce disease remission
      in rheumatoid arthritis patients with active disease due to an inadequate response to
      methotrexate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic
      drugs such as methotrexate to control joint pain and swelling. Often times rheumatoid
      arthritis patients experience inadequate response to methotrexate with acute or persistent
      joint pain and swelling. In these patients, alternative or additional immunosuppressive
      therapy is needed to induce disease remission. In the present clinical trial, ACTHAR is being
      studied to induce disease remission on rheumatoid arthritis patients who have inadequate
      response to methotrexate therapy.

          -  Subject has had an inadequate response to the continuous use of methotrexate for at
             least 12 weeks prior to study entry with a nonchanging dose for at least 8 weeks prior
             to study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:
