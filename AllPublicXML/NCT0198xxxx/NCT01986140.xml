      Determine that the Orbis Paxman Hair Loss Prevention System is safe and effective in reducing
      chemotherapy-induced alopecia in woman with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant or adjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      Cooling the scalp during chemotherapy may help reduce the chances of losing hair during
      treatment. The investigators are hoping that using the PAXMAN Orbis Scalp Cooling Device may
      stop patients who are undergoing chemotherapy from losing their hair.

    <time_frame>4 to 8 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be success in hair preservation, defined as CTCAE v 4 alopecia grade &lt;2, and will be assessed by a healthcare professional who is blinded to study treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>A safety follow-up for safety data will be done yearly for 5 years looking at time to first recurrence of breast cancer, overall survival, site of first recurrence, and incidence of isolated scalp metastasis. This will be collected during routine clinical observation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Improved Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>4 to 8 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Improved quality of life as a result of reduced hair loss is a primary motivator for developing the Paxman Scalp Cooling device. Quality of life will be assessed at baseline and 2-3 weeks after each course of chemotherapy. Three widely used and validated scales will be used: the EORTC QLQ C-30, HADS and BIS. Subjects will be evaluated at multiple time points and data will be analyzed using descriptive methods with median and inter quartile rang to assess the effect of treatment group and alopecia status on functioning, quality of life and depression.</description>
