    <textblock>
      We are studying &amp; researching the effect of CranioSacral Integrative therapy on Parkinson's
      Diseased Patients for 3 months. With a therapeutic induction via manual CranioSacral
      integrative therapy for 90 minutes per session with a total of 2 session divided equally in a
      month (biweekly intervention). At the end of 3 months each patient will have total of 9 hours
      of CranioSacral Integrative therapy induced, we will document the symptoms and shortcomings
      of the patients at evaluation, before and after therapeutic treatment on a measured scale
      ranging from 1-10. Finally graphically and statistically measure the quality of change in the
      symptoms at the end of 3 months and provide executive summary of the research finding, which
      the investigators expect to be a positive one.

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of the tremors and quality of the coordination of the medial leminiscus system on 1-10 (1 being zero tremors and 10 being out of control tremors) scale at the evaluation and at beginning and at the end of each treatment session and in the end will provide a graphical and statistical display in the change in the tremors relative to the therapeutic induction</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Proprioception</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>will evaluate the patients ability to move within space and time with certain precision and measure it on a scale of 1-10 (1 being very precise with fine motor movement and 10 being out of control fine motor movements)at the time of evaluation and at the beginning and end of each therapeutic treatment and finally document it graphically and statistically, the change in the overall motor movements like walking and quality of gait.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Overall emotional State and sleep quality</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>will evaluate the overall emotional and sleeping habits on the measurement scale of 1-10 where 1 being emotionally stable and positive with 8 hours of quality sleep and 10 being emotionally unstable and have less than 4 hours of sleep at night and at the end of research will graphically and statistically provide the outcome of the above mentioned measure.</description>
