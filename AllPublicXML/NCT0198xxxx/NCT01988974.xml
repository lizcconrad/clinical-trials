  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the psychometric properties of the Knowledge,
      Attitudes, and Beliefs about Atrial Fibrillation Survey (KABAFS) and to generate critical,
      practical knowledge about the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial to test the effect
      of the Alert for Atrial Fibrillation program on treatment-seeking for symptoms of Atrial
      Fibrillation (AF).

      The purpose of the proposed research is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the
      Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs about Atrial Fibrillation Survey (KABAFS), which is an
      instrument designed to tailor the delivery of the Alert for Atrial Fibrillation program. The
      proposed research will also test the feasibility of studying the effect of the Alert for
      Atrial Fibrillation program on treatment-seeking for symptoms of AF in a larger, randomized
      trial. This research is significant, because current research suggests that treatment seeking
      for AF is hindered when people do not recognize symptoms that represent AF, attribute those
      symptoms to alternative causes, or do not believe symptoms are serious enough to require
      medical evaluation. Interventions tailored to modify patient-specific knowledge, attitudes,
      and beliefs that hinder early treatment-seeking are critically needed in order to improve
      early detection of AF. The long term goal of this research is to improve health outcomes of
      those at risk for developing AF.

    <description>The KABAFS assesses patient knowledge of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and the belief factors associated with delay in seeking treatment for AF. Participants will be measured at baseline (before the intervention), and then at 1 and 2 months after the intervention to identify if participants' knowledge and beliefs about treatment seeking have improved and continue to be improved from baseline as indicated by the KABAFS score.</description>

    <description>Participants' baseline knowledge of AF symptoms, and attitudes and beliefs about AF will be assessed using the KABAFS, and patients will receive cognitive-behavioral training directed toward survey responses associated with delay of treatment. Training will incorporate the content developed by the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), and participants will receive education about how to recognize an irregular pulse, and how to record the pulse rhythm in a daily log. The PI/RN coordinator will review the completed KABAFS to assess knowledge deficits, and identify attitudes and beliefs about AF that may hinder early treatment-seeking.</description>
