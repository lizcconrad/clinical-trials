      The study tests a nurse-run case-management intervention targeted towards frequent emergency
      department visitors. The aim is to reduce visits to emergency departments as well as to
      improve quality of life by facilitating coping mechanisms as well as redirecting these
      patients to more suitable health care facilities.
