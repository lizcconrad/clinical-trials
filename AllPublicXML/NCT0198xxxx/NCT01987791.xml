    <description>The primary efficacy outcome was treatment failure, defined as the composite of (1) any platelet count below 50×109/L after four weeks treatment; (2) significant bleeding, defined as grade 2 severity from any anatomical site as per the ITP bleeding scale that defines bleed grades (0, none; 1, mild; or 2, marked) by objective criteria of 9, based on events that occurred since the last study visit; or (3) rescue treatment administered because of severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding, or a planned invasive procedure.</description>
