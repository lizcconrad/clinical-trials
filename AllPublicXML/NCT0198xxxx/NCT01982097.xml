    <textblock>
      This local, prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study documents observational data
      on patients under routine treatment of metastatic RCC with Nexavar before and after
      cytoreductive nephrectomy. It's planned to better understand the impact of cytoreductive
      nephrectomy on Nexavar efficacy and possibly to define patients who get the most benefit from
      Nexavar before cytoreductive nephrectomy.
