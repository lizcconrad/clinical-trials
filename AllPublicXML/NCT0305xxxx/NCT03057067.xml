  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Results of recent systematic reviews suggest favorable results of embolization for the
      treatment of Pelvic Congestion Syndrome (PCS) compared with pre-procedure symptoms for
      several outcomes, including pain reduction, overall patient satisfaction, and technical
      feasibility. Reported complication rates appears relatively low.

      Pelvic vein embolization is a relatively new technology and the results may provide
      background for an evidence based decision to offer embolization of pelvic varicosities for
      women with PCS in Norway.
