  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to assess the role of the genetic and environmental
      factor on circadian system, in free living conditions by the use of a female twin population.
      With the results from this study, the investigators expect to advance in the understanding of
      the role of the endogenicity of the circadian system variables such as temperature, activity,
      sleep and timing of food intake as the main cause of the coincidence of the rhythms. However,
      the investigators expected that some parameters are still dependent on environment to a
      relevant extent and, hence, amenable to change through external interventions.

    <textblock>
      Twin studies are a classic in the analysis of the relative contribution of genetic and
      environmental factors to behavior and other phenotypes. These models are most often used to
      separate genetic from environmental causes in the family resemblance methodology. These
      models based on twins have been previously carried out in chronobiology. In fact, during the
      years 1993 and 1994, Paul Linkowski et al., performed two relevant studies on the circadian
      system to analyze the relative contributions of hereditary and/or environmental factors of
      cortisol secretion and blood pressure, respectively, and concluded that genetic factors
      control some of the characteristics of cortisol and diastolic blood pressure circadian
      rhythmicity. The heritability of other circadian markers has also demonstrated such as
      morningness- eveningness (44%), sleep-related variables have also pointed to a relevant role
      of genetics with heritability estimates of sleep duration between 17% and 55%. However, to
      the investigators knowledge, the heritability of other relevant chronobiological markers,
      measured in free living conditions such as body temperature, actigraphy and sleep has not
      been studied.

      These goals will be achieved through a specific approach:

        -  Observational (Aim 1): To study the potential effect of the genetic and environmental
           factor in the circadian system health in order to improve the chronobiological therapies
           in the clinical practice (n=106).

    <description>Participation was completely voluntary and not remunerated. The subjects were organized into groups of 5 pairs, and were given an appointment at a university facility located in the city center, where informed consent was signed prior to the procedures indicated below. An informational letter was sent to pre-selected individuals. Later a phone call confirmed their availability.
Temperature rhythm was assessed continuously for 7 days using a temperature sensor and programmed to collect information every 10 min.
Body position and rest-activity rhythm were assessed over the same 7 days using a Acceleration Data Logger that record data every min and placed on the non-dominant arm by means of an elastic band, with its X axis parallel to the humerus bone.
Diet and sleep record were completed over the same week, their sleep schedules and their nutritional status.</description>
