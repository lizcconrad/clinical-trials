  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the functional connectivity between the brain regions
      of the default mode network before and after a 40 min nap slot in the afternoon. The
      hypothesis is that connectivity between brain regions will be decreased after the nap as
      compared to before the nap.

    <measure>Measure: Change of correlation values between the BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) signal time series of the brain regions of the default mode network (DMN) between the scans before and after the nap slot.</measure>
    <time_frame>fMRI scans will be acquired 5 min before, 5 min after and 25min after the nap slot.</time_frame>
    <description>The hypothesis is that connectivity between the brain regions of the default mode network will be decreased after the nap as compared to before the nap and that it will be more the case for subjects with a high dream recall frequency as compared to subjects with a law dream recall frequency. fMRI scans will be acquired before and after a 40 min nap slot in the afternoon. Functional connectivity between brain region will be assessed analyzing the scans with the functional connectivity toolbox (CONN) of the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software.</description>
