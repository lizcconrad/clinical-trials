    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of infant formula with higher protein level and improved fat
      blend on growth and feeding tolerance in preterm infants. Half of the subjects will receive a
      standard infant formula, while the other half will receive a infant formula with a higher
      protein level and improved fat blend.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When an infant is born prematurely, the supply of nutrients supporting normal growth and
      development is interrupted. There is less time to accrue adequate nutrient stores and foetal
      tissue. The nutritional goal for the preterm infant is to have satisfactory functional
      development and catch up on growth to match the rate of a full term infant. To achieve this,
      it is recommended for the infant to have adequate protein intake and suitable fat blend.
