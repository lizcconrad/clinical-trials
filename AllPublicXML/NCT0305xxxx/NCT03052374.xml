    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major public health issue. Known as &quot;the thief that steals
      motherhood&quot; since symptoms obstruct a mother's capacity for understanding and enjoying her
      baby, PPD affects approximately 1 in 5 moms. Built via &quot;serve and return&quot; interactions (e.g.
      baby smiles, mom smiles back), sensitive and responsive exchanges are the foundation for
      healthy child development but are diminished by PPD, resulting in interactions that place
      children at risk for behavioural and cognitive problems. Infants perceive PPD as stressful;
      stressors stimulate the brain's hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) and trigger stress
      hormone (cortisol) release, which, in turn, negatively affects developing infant brains by
      decreasing brain volume. Infants' critical periods of brain development are vulnerable to
      long-term effects of cortisol, explaining some of the problematic developmental outcomes
      observed in children of depressed mothers.

      How can the investigators support depressed mothers and their infants? Successfully treating
      PPD does not always benefit mother-child relationships; however, this research builds on a
      successful pilot that demonstrated that nurse-guided video feedback improved mother-infant
      interactions in the context of PPD. By improving interaction quality, depressed mothers may
      be motivated to engage in more play and, in turn, infants who appear interested and ready to
      interact are more likely to elicit positive, enjoyable experiences from mothers. Building on
      the pilot, the investigators will trial the effectiveness of VID-KIDS (Video-Feedback
      Interaction Guidance for Improving Interactions Between Depressed Mothers and their Infants)
      on maternal-infant interaction and infant cortisol patterns as well as infant development,
      maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety, and parenting self-efficacy. If successful,
      future aims are to 1) integrate VID-KIDS into existing services of Calgary Public Health; and
      2) commercialize VID-KIDS for dissemination.

      Background &amp; Rationale: Affecting ~19% of mothers, postpartum depression (PPD) reduces
      maternal sensitivity and positive responsiveness to infant cues and bids for caring
      attention. Infants perceive these behaviours as stressful which stimulates the hypothalamic
      pituitary adrenal axis, triggering cortisol release which, at persistently elevated levels,
      inhibits neurogenesis during critical periods of brain development. Elevated infant cortisol
      of infants of mothers with PPD may explain later poor child cognitive development and
      hyperactivity and anxiety problems into adolescence. The negative developmental outcomes from
      poor quality interactions and disrupted cortisol patterns underscores the urgency for
      intervening. Treating PPD successfully, has not consistently improved maternal-infant (M-I)
      interaction quality and children's development. Parent training promoting sensitive,
      responsive interactions may help infants of depressed mothers develop optimally.

      Research Question &amp; Objectives: Conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with depressed
      mothers of infants aged 2-6 months designed to alter negative M-I interaction and child
      development associated with PPD. Objective: examine effect of the intervention, VID-KIDS
      (&quot;video-feedback intervention to promote improved interactions between mothers and their
      kids&quot;), on: 1) M-I interaction; 2) infant cortisol patterns, infant development, maternal
      symptoms of PPD, anxiety, and parenting stress. Anticipate to improve: 1) M-I interactions
      and infant development, infant cortisol; 2) symptoms of PPD, anxiety, parenting stress, and
      infant development. The investigators will conduct cost-benefit analyses.

      An additional objective is to collect infant buccal cells for future genetic/epigenetic
      analyses. Research has suggested biological sensitivity, assessed via genotyping specific
      genetic variants and alleles may confound effects of interventions of this nature.
      Intervention may affect the epigenome, particularly the number or nature of methylated DNA
      sites, of treated infants differently than untreated infants that may link to infant
      development. This portion of the study is optional for parents—they can opt out of buccal
      cell collection.

      Methods: The study will implement a parallel group RCT compared to resource and referral
      program (standard care) for mothers with PPD and their infants. After baseline assessment,
      over the following 9-weeks, mothers randomized to the intervention will receive
      3-video-feedback sessions during home visits conducted at 3-week intervals. Mothers
      randomized to the control condition will receive standard care. Both groups will be assessed
      at baseline, immediately following the 9-week treatment/standard care interval (post-test),
      then 2-months later (delayed post-test).

      Both control and intervention mothers will have access to standard care over the study
      period. Mothers' use of such health services will be documented. The investigators will
      adhere to CONSORT guidelines.

      Intervention description. Video-feedback interventionists will be trained by Co-PI
      Tryphonopoulos using a manualized curriculum of 7-themed modules offered in a 4-day workshop.
      Training modules will include: 1) Introduction to Video-feedback; 2) NCAST Keys to Caregiving
      Program; 3) Infant Engagement and Disengagement Cues (using NCAST's BabyCues: A Child's First
      Language Cards®; 4) Video-feedback Intervention Protocol; 5) Overview of Behaviours of
      Interest; 6) Case Studies; and 7) Examples of Strengths-Based Feedback.

      The intervention follows an 8-step protocol:

      Ice-breaking. Interventionist initiates rapport with the participant.

      Overview of Infant Engagement and Disengagement Cues. Using NCAST's BabyCues,
      interventionists review coloured photo cards that illustrate and explain the behavioural cues
      commonly seen in infants, including potent and subtle engaging and disengaging cues.

      NCAST Teaching Activity. Using the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS) protocols
      and elements, mothers are asked to perform a teaching task more advanced than their infant's
      age level.

      Recording Interaction. Mothers and infants are observed and video-recorded.

      Initial-Viewing. Specific feedback is not provided during the initial viewing. Mothers are
      asked to reflect on and point out any infant cues they recognize. Interventionist documents
      the presence or absence of infant cues and mother's response for later discussion.

      Second-Viewing. Interventionist and mother co-view the recorded interaction with
      opportunities provided for replay/slow review portions emphasizing sensitivity and
      responsiveness. Interventionist provides feedback: using praise reinforcing desired maternal
      behaviours; information on infant cues; appraisal of maternal response to infant distress;
      and use of cognitive growth fostering language.

      Third-Viewing. The final viewing, integrates all of the concepts discussed in the previous
      screenings, using positive reinforcement to emphasize optimal aspects of sensitivity,
      responsiveness and constructive feedback suggesting areas for growth.

      Post-viewing Debrief. Interventionist and mother conclude the video-feedback session
      discussing whatever interests the mother. Mothers are encouraged to make note their infants'
      engagement/disengagement cues and responses to these non-verbal behaviours.

      Video feedback sessions last 60-90min. Subsequent sessions follow same protocol (new teaching
      activities) and build on the previous interaction guidance discussions.

    <description>Investigators created VID-KIDS for mothers with PPD to improve sensitivity and positive responsiveness towards their infants. Video-feedback has the advantage of being visually concrete yet &quot;distant&quot; because the action and the feedback are not concurrent; this helps mothers maintain an element of objectivity that may minimize guilty feelings associated with potential perceived lack of parenting skills. Video-feedback interventionists are trained by investigators with manualized modules. Including: Introduction to Video-feedback; NCAST Keys to Caregiving Program; Infant Engagement and Disengagement Cues; Video-feedback Intervention Protocol; Overview of Behaviours of Interest; Case Studies; and Examples of Strengths-Based Feedback. VID-KIDS intervention follows an 8-step protocol.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recruitment will be conducted through Calgary Public Health's immunization program.
             Public Health RNs routinely screen mothers for PPD during infants' vaccination clinic
             appointments using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 2, 4, and 6
             months of age. EPDS scores&gt;12 are indicative of probable major depression with
             postpartum onset and make a mother eligible for our study. Approximately 500 mothers
             per year (40/month) screen &gt;12 on the EPDS. The investigators have agreed to support a
             part-time Calgary Public Health staff person to review screening records and contact
             potential participants to determine if they are willing to be contacted by a the
             VID-KIDS Project Manager for further information about the study. If mothers agree,
             then the VID-KIDS Project Manager will contact the mother to explain the study,
             further assess eligibility, and if appropriate conduct the informed consent procedure.

        If the investigators are able to successfully invite 40% of these mothers, then the
        investigators project that the investigators will be able to recruit at least 16
        participants per month, giving us our sample in 20-24 months. Since the inception rate of
        PPD is greatest within the first 12 weeks of delivery, screening mothers at these strategic
        intervals is particularly advantageous. Moreover, Co-I McNeil and Collaborator Philley
        (Director of Research and Director of Nursing, Calgary Public Health, respectively) have
        successful experience with this feasible approach. Eligibility will be based on 1) a
        cut-off of greater than 12 (indicating probable PPD) on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
        Scale (EPDS) 20; and 2) infant aged 2-6 months at baseline. Mothers will not be excluded
        for taking anti-depressants or using other interventions for PPD (i.e., counseling,
        psychotherapy). However, mothers who are receiving other parenting services (e.g., Circle
        of Security program, infant-parent psychotherapy) will be excluded.
