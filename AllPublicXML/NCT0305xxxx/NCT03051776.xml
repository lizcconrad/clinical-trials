  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) tends to become chronic and progressive. Current
      therapies have modest results for this condition. Compression garments (CG) prevent the
      worsening of lymphedema and even improve it, during periods between treatments of physical
      therapy. Kinesio Taping(KT) is being recently used for lymphedema, although little evidence
      backs it. The aim of this study is to compare the reduction of lymphedema volume with both
      therapies.

  <detailed_description>

      Primary end points: to evaluate whether the decrease in BCRL volume is different for a 4-week
      treatment with KT than with CG.

      Research design:

      Randomized quasi-experimental clinical pilot study: initial sample randomly balanced into two
      groups . The initial sample was selected among the patients of &quot;Breast Pathology
      Rehabilitation&quot; at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre . The planned sample size was 30.

      Cross Design: it made possible to evaluate two different treatments in the same patient,
      cancelling intragroup variability.

      Open design: it was impossible to blind patients and physiotherapist researcher because of
      patent visual differences between the two therapies, CG or KT, both during application and
      while being worn, and even in the hours after its removal, due to the marks left on the skin.
      However, at least one external evaluator suitably trained was implemented and performed the
      randomisation of the groups and collected all patient data. Statistical study was also made
      by others (staff of the &quot;Clinique Investigation Unit (i+12)&quot; of Hospital Universitario 12 de
      Octubre) with coded variables to blind the analyst.
