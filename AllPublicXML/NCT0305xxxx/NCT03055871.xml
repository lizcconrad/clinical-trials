  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine physical activity habit formation in parents and if
      this can increase moderate to vigorous physical activity behavior in their children over six
      months.The Primary Research Question is:

      Does the habit formation condition result in increased moderate-vigorous intensity physical
      activity of the child compared to the control (education) and education + planning conditions
      at six months? Hypothesis: Child physical activity will be higher for the habit formation
      condition in comparison to the more standard physical activity education and planning
      conditions at six months.

      Secondary Research Questions

        1. Can group differences among behavioural outcomes be explained through a mediation model?
           Hypothesis: The covariance of the assigned conditions (habit formation, planning +
           education, education control) on child PA will be explained by parental co-activity
           habit, and through the use of consistency and cues regulation strategies (i.e.,
           manipulation check). The habit formation condition will not affect parental support
           intentions or underlying outcome expectations (benefits of PA) for support of child PA
           because its effect on behavior is to tie initial intentions to behavioural action or to
           work independent of goals and intentions.

        2. Is there an intergenerational, seasonal, or gender difference across primary outcomes by
           assigned condition? Hypothesis: Parents in the habit formation condition will show
           higher PA via the activities being performed with their children in comparison to the
           other conditions. No differences in gender or season are hypothesized based on the
           current research at present

    <measure>Change from baseline in children's physical activity to 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Children's physical activity will be quantified by accelerometry. Children will wear an accelerometer for a minimum of 6 hours per day for 7 days at baseline and 6 months. Additionally this measure will assess intermediate outcomes at 6 weeks and 3 months.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in self-reported child physical activity, family-based physical activity and personal physical activity at 6 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The parent will complete a modified Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire by parent proxy report for physical activity of the target child to assess habitual moderate to vigorous physical activity. The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (LSI) will be used to measure self-reported family-based physical activity and physical activity in parents. The LSI contains three questions, which assess the frequency of mild, moderate, and strenuous activity performed for at least 15 minutes during free time in a typical week. Change in self-reported physical activity will be examined (6 weeks minus baseline).</description>

    <description>The habit formation intervention condition will receive the same content as the education control condition and the physical activity planning condition but with additional material on creating physical activity support habits. The material includes a brief discussion of what habits are with some very straightforward examples such as preparing for sleep routines, or initiating to drive a car to work. A key component of the habit section will be based on planning for context-dependent repetition, with pointers on how to maintain repetition as habit forms.</description>

    <description>This arm will receive the control education content, but will also be provided with family PA planning material. This material will include skill training content (workbook on how to plan for family PA). The material includes a brainstorming exercise for parents where they list physical activities they think their children have found fun in the past, as well as activities that they would find enjoyable to do as a family. We also have Canadian parental survey data on the most preferred co-physical activities for children 3-6. We will provide this material as prompts/suggestions. This list helps create the template for PA planning by contextualizing what the parents would like to do with their kids.</description>

             participate and one child between the ages of 3 and 5 who is not meeting current
             physical activity guidelines (&gt;=60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous physical
             activity. There will be no delimitations to the sample based on socio-economic or
             ethnic variables.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion Criteria: If child is meeting the current physical activity guidelines &gt;=60
