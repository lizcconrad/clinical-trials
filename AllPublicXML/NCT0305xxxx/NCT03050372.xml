  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited and screened through ongoing studies in the sleep and anxiety
      disorders clinic. Participants with insomnia will be consented to complete several
      questionnaires, undergo a brief physical exam, provide a urinalysis, and undergo 5 nights of
      active or sham Low Field Magnetic Stimulation (LFMS) followed by an overnight sleep study.
      Each of the two treatment conditions (active versus sham) will be conducted on two
      consecutive nights. There will be no more than 7 days between the adaptation night and the
      first treatment condition and no more than 7 nights between each of the two-night treatment
      conditions . Thus, each participant who completes the full study will spend a total of 5
      nights in the sleep laboratory and the time interval from the first adaptation night to
      completion of the study may range from 5-19 days for any particular individual.
