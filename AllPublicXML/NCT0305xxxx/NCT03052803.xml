    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare different devices available to measure fractional flow
      reserve (FFR) in coronary arteries.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The decision to perform a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is usually based on
      angiographic results alone. Angiography can be used for the visual evaluation of the inner
      diameter of a vessel. Visual evaluation is limited by inter-individual variability.

      Fractional flow reserve provides a functional evaluation, by measuring the pressure decline
      caused by a vessel narrowing.

      The original studies validating the use of FFR were conducted with only one device (St-Jude
      MedicalÂ®). Recently, new FFR devices have been commercialized but have not yet been compared.
