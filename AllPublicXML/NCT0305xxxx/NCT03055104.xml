  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe malnutrition can be seen as a low BMI, great weight loss, and even low levels of
      micronutrients. Current studies on severe malnutrition are mainly in patient with anorexia
      nervosa. The refeeding phase of these high-risk patients bears a further threat to health and
      potentially fatal complications (such as refeeding syndrome, infection and severe
      arrhythmia). The objective of this study is to investigate complications due to refeeding of
      patients with severe malnutrition, as well as their mortality rate, establish and modify the
      guideline for management of severe malnutrition in Peking University Third Hospital.

      Severe malnutrition can be seen as a low BMI, great weight loss, and even low levels of
      micronutrients. Current studies on severe malnutrition are mainly in patient with anorexia
      nervosa. The refeeding phase of these high-risk patients bears a further threat to health and
      potentially fatal complications (such as refeeding syndrome, infection and severe
      arrhythmia).

      Intensive care unit of Peking University Third Hospital (PUTH) has treated several patients
      with severe malnutrition successfully since 2008. Most of these patients had a BMI ＜ 10
      (kg/m2) at admission. After admission, a multidisciplinary team, consisting of specialists in
      the field of intensive care, pharmacy, psychology, and physical therapy assessed all
      patients. Most of the treatment has been regarded successful with a significant BMI gain and
      little in-hospital mortality. Based on long-term clinical experience, as well as on
      evidence-based literature, PUTH nutrition group developed a guideline version 1.0 for the
      treatment of severe malnutrition in August, 2015.

      The objective of this study is to investigate complications due to refeeding of patients with
      severe malnutrition, as well as their mortality rate, establish and modify the guideline for
      management of severe malnutrition in PUTH.

      This is a single-center, ambispective cohort study. Patients who meet the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be included in our registry. As a non-intervention study, these
      information as below will be collected: reason for admission, relevant medical history, basic
      demographic characteristics,anthropometric and clinical data, specific nutrition support
      regimen and outcomes.
