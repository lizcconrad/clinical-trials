  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      single-ascending intravenous (IV) infusions of BIIB076 in healthy volunteers and participants
      with Alzheimer's disease (AD). A secondary objective of the study for both healthy volunteers
      and participants with AD is to assess the serum pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) profile of BIIB076
      after single-dose administration. Another secondary objective is to evaluate the
      immunogenicity of BIIB076 in serum after single-dose administration.

        Key Inclusion Criteria - Healthy Participants

          -  Must be in good health as determined by the Investigator, based on medical history and
             Screening evaluations.

        Key Inclusion Criteria - Participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

          -  Must have a clinical diagnosis of mild AD consistent with the following:

          -  Probable AD, according to the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's Association
             workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for AD criteria [McKhann 2011].

          -  CSF concentrations of AÎ²42, t-tau, and p-tau consistent with diagnosis of AD.

          -  Must have a Mini-Mental State Examination score between 20 and 26 (inclusive) at
             Screening.

        Key Exclusion Criteria - Healthy Participants

          -  Brain MRI performed at Screening that shows showing evidence of acute or sub-acute
             hemorrhage, prior macrohemorrhage, cortical infract, &gt;1 lacunar infarct, history of
             diffuse white-matter disease or any finding that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             might pose a risk to the participant, or might prevent a satisfactory MRI assessment
             for safety monitoring.

          -  History of any clinically significant cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal,
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic,
             dermatologic, psychiatric, or renal disease, or other major disease, as determined by
             the Investigator.

          -  Current enrollment in any other drug, biologic, device, or clinical study or treatment
             with an investigational drug or approved therapy for investigational use within 30
             days (6 months for biologics) or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to Day-1.

          -  Contraindications to having a brain MRI (e.g., pacemaker; MRI-incompatible aneurysm
             clips, artificial heart valves, or other metal foreign body; claustrophobia that
             cannot be medically managed).

          -  Contraindications to having an Lumbar Puncture (LP).

        Key Exclusion Criteria - Participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD)

          -  Any medical or neurologic/neurodegenerative condition (with the exception of AD and
             chronic controlled hypertension) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might be a
             contributing cause of the participant's cognitive impairment (e.g., substance abuse,
             vitamin B12 deficiency, abnormal thyroid function, stroke or other cerebrovascular
             condition, Lewy body dementia, front temporal dementia, and head trauma).

          -  Clinically significant psychiatric illness (e.g., uncontrolled major depression,
             schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder) within 6 months prior to Screening.

          -  History of any clinically significant cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal,
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic,
             dermatologic, or renal disease, or other major disease, as determined by the
             Investigator.

          -  Current enrollment in any other drug, biologic, device, or clinical study or treatment
             with an investigational drug or approved therapy for investigational use within 30
             days (6 months for biologics) or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to Day-1.

          -  Contraindications to having a brain MRI (e.g., pacemaker; MRI-incompatible aneurysm
             clips, artificial heart valves, or other metal foreign body; claustrophobia that
             cannot be medically managed).

          -  Contraindications to having an LP.

          -  History of, or ongoing chronic uncontrolled hypertension

          -  History of unstable angina, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure (New York
             Heart Association Class 3 or 4), or clinically significant conduction abnormalities
             (e.g., unstable atrial fibrillation) within 1 year prior to Day -1.
