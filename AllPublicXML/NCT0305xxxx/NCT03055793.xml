  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The greater efficacy of combination therapy led to the development of fixed combination
      devices which simultaneously carry both glucocorticosteroid and a LABA (eg stable
      combinations of fluticasone-salmeterol, budesonide-formoterol).

      Fixed combinations are easier to use for patients, potentially increasing compliance, and
      ensure that the LABA always accompanied by glycocorticosteroeides1. From the available
      combinations of the combination of budesonide-formoterol can be used both in maintenance
      therapy and for the relief of symptoms due to the rapid onset of action of formoterol
      compared with salmeterol. Both components of budesonide-formoterol combination when
      administered on demand contribute to strengthening protection from severe exacerbations in
      patients receiving combination therapy for maintenance, and enable improvement of asthma
      control at relatively low doses of ICS.

      This prospective observational study of the Greek population to approximately 2,500 patients
      suffering from asthma, aims to collect the characteristics of patients that were selected to
      obtain an inhaled combination of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate in any of
      portions 100 / 6mcg, 200 / 6mcg, 400/12 mcg (Pulmoton®), and to collect data on the quality
      of life to such an inhaled combination through Elpenhaler® device.

      Data will be collected for a period of three months from patients diagnosed with asthma not
      adequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and 'as needed' inhaled beta2-agonists
      short-acting or patients already adequately controlled on both inhaled corticosteroids and
      long-acting beta2-agonists.

      Data will be collected during the period of one (1) to three (3) months (± 2 weeks) from the
      initiation of treatment with inhaled combination include ACQ checklist questionnaire mini
      AQLQ, questionnaire FSI 10, and data any existing comorbidities.
