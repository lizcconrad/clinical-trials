  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will assess the effects of aerobic exercise training (AET), repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or their combination on depressive severity as well
      as locomotor function in persons with post-stroke depression (PSD). Both AET and rTMS are
      established stand-alone treatments for non-stroke related depression, though neither has been
      adequately studied post-stroke. Furthermore, substantive research indicates that AET improves
      post-stroke locomotor function, thus offering a novel approach for treating PSD as well as an
      established vehicle to study the effects of PSD on response to rehabilitation.

      The purpose of this project is to determine the impact of AET, rTMS and their combination
      (AET+rTMS) treatments on post-stroke depressive symptoms and locomotor function so as to
      guide the development of a future clinical trial. A total of 40 depressed post-stroke
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups 1) AET; 2) rTMS; 3) combined AET and
      rTMS (AET+rTMS) or 4) control (sham rTMS) group (n=10 per condition; equally distributed with
      mild and moderate MDD). Further, an additional 10 non-depressed post-stroke subjects will
      complete 8 weeks of AET so as to allow us to determine the effects of PSD on response to
      training (Aim 2). Training (AET, rTMS and AET+rTMS) will take place over an 8-week period,
      three times per week on non-consecutive days. Measures of depression (HRSD17) as well as
      self-selected walking speed (SSWS) will be performed prior to the initial treatment session
      of each week as well as 8 weeks following cessation of treatment. Additional measures of
      locomotor function (walking endurance and amount of daily community stepping) will be
      assessed prior to training (pre), following 4 weeks of training (mid), upon completion of 8
      weeks of training (post) as well as 8 weeks following cessation of training (follow-up),
      allowing determination of the efficacy (and persistence) of training on these outcomes.
