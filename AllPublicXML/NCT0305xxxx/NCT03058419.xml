    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the potential inhibitory/inducing effects of
      JNJ-54175446 after single and repeated dosing on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of a
      cocktail, containing selective probes of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP3A4/A5, CYP2C9,
      CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2B6, and CYP2C19) in healthy adult subjects.

             squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or
             malignancy that, in the opinion of the investigator, with written concurrence with the
             sponsor's medical monitor, is considered cured with minimal risk of recurrence)
