  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of FRC and airway resistance calculate
      values of Spircare device as compared to the conventional body plethysmograph in healthy
      adults and patients with obstructive and restrictive pulmonary diseases/disorders.

    <description>The primary outcome of the FRC and air way resistance of the Spircare device against the plethysmograph will be displayed as scatter plot. A linear regression and the R2 value will be display as well. The associated Bland-Altman plots comparing the FRC and airway resistance of the Spircare device to the plethysmograph with lines that represent width of 0.1 (±1.96*SD).</description>
