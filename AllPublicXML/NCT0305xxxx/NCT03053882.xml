      This single-blind clinical trial study with cross over design total of 88 volunteer dental
      students who complained bad breath and had organoleptic score (&gt;= 2) and higher average test
      scores were enrolled. The students were divided randomly into two groups Green Tea -
      Peppermint were assigned. Organoleptic test in the baseline, on the 7 day, 14 and 21 measured
      after rinsing the mouthwashes .As well as the satisfaction of both plants on the last day was
