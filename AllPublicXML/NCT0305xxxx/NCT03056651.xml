      The Day-Care Unit for Patients With Refractory Heart Failure (DayCare-HF) is an observational
      study on selected patients with advanced refractory heart failure. The purpose of the study
      was to examine the comprehensive management of HF in the day-care unit in terms of the safety
      and its impact on the rehospitalization and mortality rates in patients with advanced
      refractory HF.

      The Day-Care Unit for Patients With Refractory Heart Failure (DayCare-HF) is a single-center
      observational study conducted in the 3rd Department of Cardiology, School of Medicine with
      the Division of Dentistry in Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Silesian
      Centre for Heart Disease in Zabrze, Poland.

      The main objective of the DayCare-HF is to verify the hypothesis that comprehensive and
      multidisciplinary day-care management of patients with refractory heart failure (HF) is safe
      and beneficial in terms of hospital readmission due to HF and al cause mortality.

      The study population is formed by selected patients with heart failure, hospitalized in
      cardiology wards and intensive cardiac care unit of Silesian Centre for Heart Disease, who
      fulfilled eligibility criteria.

      During the scheduled visits comprehensive medical service is provided, including education,
      diagnostic tools (electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography, implanted cardioverter
      defibrillator (ICD) / cardiac resynchronization therapy device (CRT) interrogation and
      additional treatment (intravenous loop diuretic, dobutamine, vasodilators administration).

      The patients are under constant follow-up for major adverse events, heart transplantation,
      hospital readmissions due to HF and all cause mortality.
