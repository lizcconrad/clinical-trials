      This research is being done to find out the best ways to help people with end stage kidney
      disease take care of their daily lives and improve their social functioning.

      Investigators want to learn whether services in the Community Aging in Place, Advancing
      Better Living for Elders (CAPABLE) study such as help with medications, muscle strengthening,
      balance training, pain management, changes to houses and improved social support can be
      tailored to fit the needs of older adults with kidney disease to help improve their ability
      to balance, walk, and take care of themselves.

      People aged 60 years and older who have end stage kidney disease and have been receiving
      dialyses for at least 6 months, may join.

      Questionnaires:

      Participants will be asked to answer questions about:

        -  social support and social functioning

        -  pain and depression

        -  physical function

      Study intervention:

      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like the flip of a coin) to one of two
      groups: participant either will receive SOCIABLE (Seniors Optimizing Community Integration to
      Advance Better Living with ESRD) services now, or will receive the same services in six
      months from now. Participants have a 50:50 chance of getting into each group

      SOCIABLE services involve receiving visits with a nurse interviewer. Participants will decide
      how you want to improve your social function and social support.

      Participants will also receive:

        -  a group of services called CAPABLE which include home visits from a nurse (RN) and an
           occupational therapist (OT) and a handyman for repairs if you need them and

        -  help with improving social support

      All participants will receive 10 home visits (6 OT, 4 RN) plus minor home repairs and
      assistive devices over a 4 month period of time.
