  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicidal behaviors (SB) are a major health problem in France : 10 000 suicides and 220 000
      suicide attempts every year. SB management is therefore a major public health issue.

      Evidence associated dysregulation of the serotonergic system and the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to vulnerability to SB. Recent data point to linke these
      abnormalities with neuroinflammatory clues, glutamatergic function and neuronal plasticity.
      There is a need to better understand the physiopathology and develop diagnostic and
      therapeutic tools in SB.

      The investigators hypothesize that increased peripheral biomarkers of inflammation would
      correlate to a disturbance of the cerebral metabolites, such as glutamate and NAA, especially
      in suicidal patients.

      Our aim is to compare rates of cerebral metabolites, in particular the complex
      glutamine/glutamate, in cerebral areas involved in suicidal vulnerability (the anterior
      cingulate cortex and the orbito-frontal cortex) between person with unipolar disorder with
      and without suicidal attempt.

      69 patients : 23 with suicidal thoughts and attempt, 23 with suicidal thoughts without
      attempt and 23 healthy volunteers.

      2 visits :

        -  Inclusion visit (V0) : (Day 1)

           o Clinical interview : self and hetero assessment questionnaire

        -  Visit V1 (as soon as possible, day 1 if available) :

             -  MRI (spectroscopy)
