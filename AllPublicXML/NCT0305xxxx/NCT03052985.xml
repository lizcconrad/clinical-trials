      RATIONAL Implantable medical devices (meshes) used in pelvic organ prolapse surgery (genital
      prolapse, rectal prolapse), or incontinence surgery may be source of severe complications.

      MAIN OBJECTIVE Estimate the incidence of severe complications during or after surgery of
      urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse in adult women.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Estimate the incidence of severe complications after urinary
      incontinence or prolapse surgery as a function of time since surgery.

      Compare the incidence rates of severe complications considering the type of procedure (with
      or without mesh, vaginal or laparoscopic, etc.), comorbidities, mesh type, surgeon
      experience, and surgical volume centre.

      Estimate the number of annual procedures with mesh for the surgery of urinary incontinence,
      genital prolapse, and rectal prolapse in France.

      Estimate the exhaustivity of the current implantable medical device surveillance compared to
      our reinforced observatory.

      Estimate the accuracy of the surgical procedure coding compared to the title of the surgical
      procedures.

      Estimate the cost of surgical treatment of urinary incontinence, genital prolapse and rectal
      prolapse in France.

      MAIN OUTCOME Per- and post-operative complications (less than 12 months after surgery), or
      late (after 12 months) grade III or higher according to the Clavien-Dindo classification

      OTHER OUTCOMES Estimation of the number of hospitalisations in France will use the data of
      the ATIH (Agence Technique de l'Information sur l'Hospitalisation, French Agency for
      Information on Hospitalization).

      The cost estimate will be based on the analysis of hospital stays (duration and procedures).

      DESIGN Prospective multicentre cohort allowing the constitution and analysis of an
      observatory off surgery for genital prolapse, rectal prolapse and urinary stress incontinence
      in women.

      INCLUSION CRITERIA

        -  Operated for urinary incontinence, genital prolapse, or rectal prolapse in one of the
           centres participating in the observatory

        -  18 years old or more.

      SUBJECTS NUMBER Estimated at 2000 per year during 5 years in 10 participating centres (3000
      per year if the number of centres is increased to 15).

      STUDY LENGTH Duration of the inclusion period: 2 years with the initial grant from ANSM
      (Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des produits de santé, French Medicines and
      Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency), the objective is to obtain an additional funding for
      5 years of inclusion in total.

      Duration of participation of subjects: 2 years with grant from ANSM, but a period of 10 years
      would be preferable.

      Total duration of the study: 3 years with the grant from ANSM, 15 years if a complementary
      funding is found.

      ANALYSIS PLANNED The one-year analysis will be based on multivariate logistic regression
      analysis (considering confounding factors). The 10-year (or intermediate-term) analysis will
      use survival analysis methods to account for delays in complications: Kaplan-Meier curves;
      Model of Cox proportional hazards.

      PERSPECTIVES The observatory should make it possible to precise the tolerance and the short-
      and long-term consequences of the use of these implantable devices (meshes) in pelvic organ
      prolapse or incontinence surgery in women and to specify the risk factors for severe
      complications.

      The observatory will enable to make comparisons between the different types of meshes and
      different surgical procedures, and to identify those that may present problems.

      Clinical practice recommendations may be issued as well as standards for marketing.
