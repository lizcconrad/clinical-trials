      This study will seek to determine the safety and toxicity profile as well as the maximum
      tolerated dose of Helixor® M in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This study is a Phase I study that consists of two phases: a dose escalation phase and an
      expansion phase. The dose escalation phase will be used to evaluate the safety and toxicity
      of Helixor® M (mistletoe extract). An accelerated titration design (ATD) will be utilized to
      determine the MTD. The expansion phase will be used to obtain preliminary efficacy data about
      Helixor® M.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with advanced solid tumors who have had at least one line of therapy for

             treatment)

          2. Have measurable disease

          3. ECOG Performance Status of 0 to 2

          4. Adequate organ function as defined by study-specified laboratory tests

          5. Must use acceptable form of birth control through the study and for 28 days after
             final dose of study drug

          6. Signed informed consent form

          7. Willing and able to comply with study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with a known history or evidence of brain metastases

          2. Patient who has had chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal, or biological cancer therapy
             within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug

          3. Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study of an
             investigational agent or using an investigational device within 28 days of the first
             dose of study drug

          4. Patients who have had surgery within 28 days of dosing of investigational agent,
             excluding minor procedures (dental work, skin biopsy, etc), celiac plexus block, and
             biliary stent placement

          5. Patient is expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic
