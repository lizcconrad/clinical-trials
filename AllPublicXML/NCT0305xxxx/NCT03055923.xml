  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot study evaluates the use of a new device called Inflammacheck and whether it can
      consistently measure hydrogen peroxide levels in exhaled breath condensate. It will also
      assess whether exhaled breath condensate hydrogen peroxide levels as measured by
      Inflammacheck can differentiate people with asthma and COPD from healthy individuals.

    <textblock>
      Hydrogen Peroxide levels in Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC) is a direct biomarker of
      oxidative stress from the airway epithelium. Levels have been shown to be raised in asthma
      and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) both in stable and exacerbating states.

      Previously it has been difficult to measure this volatile compound away from a laboratory
      based setting. However a new device has been developed to measure Hydrogen peroxide levels in
      exhaled breath by the patients side.

      This Pilot study will test this new device in a clinical setting. It will assess whether the
      device can monitor levels consistently and reliably and whether it can distinguish disease
      from healthy individuals.

        Three populations of older adolescent and adult patients (all aged ≥16yrs) will be invited
        to participate:

          1. Asthma patients (n=30)

          2. COPD patients (n=30)

          3. Comparator group (n=30) - Volunteers with no previous history of lung disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a clinician made diagnosis of asthma with symptoms for ≥ 3 months
             supported by objective evidence of airflow variability, reversibility or airway
             hyper-responsiveness

          -  Subject has a confirmed, clinician made diagnosis of COPD for ≥ 3 months supported by
             spirometric evidence of fixed airflow limitation (post-bronchodilator ratio of
             FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7) recorded at any time

          -  Subject has no known history of lung disease (defined as no current clinical diagnosis
             of, or be receiving treatment for, a lung disease).

          -  Subject is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has existing co-morbidities that may prevent them from performing spirometry,
             FeNO or other study measurements (at the discretion of the clinical investigator).

          -  Subject has known other lung, chest wall, neuromuscular, or cardiac disease or
             abnormality (including end-stage disease or cancer) that would confound symptom scores
             and spirometry.

          -  Subject has received treatment for an exacerbation of their respiratory disease within
             the last 2 weeks.

          -  In the opinion of the clinical investigator, participant could be put at risk of harm
             by having to perform any of the study procedures.

          -  Subject is unable to comprehend the study and provide informed consent, e.g.
             insufficient command of English in the absence of someone to adequately interpret.
