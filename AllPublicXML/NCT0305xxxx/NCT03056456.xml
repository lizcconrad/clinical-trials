  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus to investigate how
      the human body processes LY900014, a new blood sugar lowering insulin, and its effect on
      blood sugar levels when it is delivered via an insulin pump. Side effects and tolerability
      will be documented. The study will last about 4 to 11 weeks for each participant.

             second party) in the past 6 months

          -  Have venous access sufficient to allow for blood sampling

          -  Have provided written consent and are willing to follow study procedures and commit to
             the study duration

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have previously participated or withdrawn from this study

          -  Have or used to have health problems or medical test results that, in the opinion of
             the doctor, could make it unsafe to participate, or could interfere with understanding
