      Background:

      Colorectal cancer is a common cancer in the U.S. It causes the second most cancer-related
      deaths. The drug avelumab and vaccine Ad-CEA together help the immune system fight cancer.

      Objective:

      To test if avelumab and Ad-CEA plus standard therapy treats colorectal cancer that has spread
      to other sites better than standard therapy alone.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with untreated colorectal cancer that has spread in the body

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Test to see if their cancer has a certain deficiency

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Scans

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Tumor sample. This can be from a previous procedure.

      A small group of participants will get Ad-CEA and avelumab plus standard therapy. This is
      FOLFOX plus bevacizumab for up to 24 weeks then capecitabine plus bevacizumab.

      The others will have treatment in 2-week cycles. They will be Arm A or B:

      Arm A: FOLFOX and bevacizumab by IV days 1 and 2 for 12 cycles. After that, capecitabine by
      mouth twice a day and bevacizumab by IV on day 1.

      Arm B: Ad-CEA injection every 2-12 weeks. Avelumab by IV on day 1 of each cycle. FOLFOX and
      bevacizumab by IV days 2 and 3 for 12 cycles. Then, capecitabine by mouth twice a day and
      bevacizumab through IV on day 2.

      Participants will repeat screening tests during the study.

      Participants will be treated until their disease gets worse or they have bad side effects.
      Arm A participants can join Arm B. They will have a visit 4 5 weeks after they stop therapy.

      Background

        -  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer diagnosis in the United States
           and accounts for the second most cancer-related deaths.

        -  Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a transmembrane protein that was first identified
           for its role in the maintenance of self-tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity.
           Blockade of the interaction between PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells is expected
           to reverse T cell suppression within tumors. These agents are dependent on underlying T
           cell activation against the tumor cell to be effective.

        -  Avelumab is a fully human IgG1 anti-PDL1 antibody that selectively binds to PD-L1 and
           competitively blocks its interaction with PD-1.

        -  In ongoing phase 1 trials of avelumab, the agent has been well tolerated and has shown
           clinical activity. Clinical trials with anti-PD-1/L1 agents in colorectal cancer have
           resulted in minimal activity in patients who do not have mismatch repair deficiency
           (MMR-D)

        -  Therapeutic cancer vaccines targeting overexpressed proteins offer a potential method to
           activate T cells against tumors.

        -  A novel adenovirus based, CEA-targeting vaccine has demonstrated cytolytic T cell
           responses in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Standard of care agents in first line metastatic CRC have properties been associated
           with improved immune response via immunologic cell death and immunogenic modulation.

      Objectives

      -To determine if there is an improvement progression free survival among patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer lacking a mismatch repair deficiency who are treated with
      standard of care + anti- PDL1 monoclonal antibody + Ad-CEA therapeutic cancer vaccine
      compared with standard of care alone.

      Eligibility

        -  Subjects age 18 and older with previously untreated pathologically confirmed colorectal
           cancer; prior adjuvant therapy is acceptable

        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1

        -  Normal organ and bone marrow function

        -  Subjects with active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment and subjects requiring
           system steroids (except for physiologic doses for steroid replacement) are not allowed

        -  Tumor sample and whole blood sample must be available for proteomics, genomics and
           transcriptomics analyses.

        -  Subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-D or
           MSI-High) will not be eligible

      Design

        -  This is a randomized, multicenter phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the
           potential improvement in progression free survival (PFS) when Avelumab and Ad-CEA
           vaccine are used in combination with standard of care therapy in metastatic colorectal
           cancer when compared with standard of care alone (FOLFOX-A).

        -  A lead in cohort, comprising the first 6 evaluable subjects enrolled, will be treated
           with avelumab + Ad- CEA vaccine + standard of care in order to assess the safety of the
           combination.

        -  If no more than 1 subject in the lead in cohort experiences a dose limiting toxicity
           attributable to the IND agents, 70 evaluable subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis
           to receive either Avelumab + Ad-CEA vaccine + standard of care (Arm B) or standard of
           care alone (Arm A).

        -  Standard of care therapy consists of 6 - 12 two week cycles of bevacizumab + FOLFOX
           (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) followed by two week cycles of bevacizumab +
           capecitabine until disease progression.

        -  Subjects assigned Arm A that have progressive disease will be offered Avelumab + Ad-CEA
           vaccine in combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen.

        -  Kaplan-Meier curves and a two-tailed log-rank test will be the primary analysis methods.

        -  The accrual ceiling for the study is set at 81.

             contraindications to treatment with the standard of care regimen as determined by the
             investigator. Prior adjuvant therapy is acceptable (including immunotherapy), but must
             have been completed at least 6 months prior to metastatic disease diagnosis.

          -  Patients should not be eligible for potentially curative surgical intervention in the
             case of oligometastic disease at the time of enrollment or must have actively refused

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria.

          -  Age greater than or equal to18 years. Because safety data is not known with this agent
             in patients less than 18 years old, children are excluded from this study.
