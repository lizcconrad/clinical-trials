  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation seeks to build upon existing evidence that a relationship exists between
      body mass and timing and the number of erupted teeth.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alteration in the order of teeth eruption denotes a disorder in normal development of the
      teeth, rather than delayed or accelerated growth. The more time deviation of teeth eruption
      from normal, the more possible the presence of a problem in development of teeth. For these
      reasons having a non-invasive tool such as body mass index to determine if development will
      be slower than average, could be helpful to the practitioner.
