      Objective: To determine the association between baseline aqueous cytokine levels and
      treatment intervals for patients under a variable dosing regimen with intravitreal
      ranibizumab in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), macular
      edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and diabetic macular edema (DME).

      Methods: A prospective, single-centre study will be performed containing 3 sub-studies
      according to each study population: nAMD, macular edema secondary to RVO and DME. Inclusion
      criteria are: patients followed at St. Michael's Hospital with the diagnosis of nAMD, macular
      edema secondary to RVO or DME. Patients will be excluded if visual acuity is worse than
      counting fingers, with macular pathologies causing any structural changes to the retina, have
      received anti-VEGF injections or photocoagulation therapy 6 months prior to study,
      intraocular surgery 3 months prior to study, any history of vitreoretinal surgery or ocular
      inflammation in the study eye, use of systemic or topical anti-inflammatory or steroids,
      patients on dialysis for renal failure, allergy to the study drug or fluorescein, &lt;18 years
      old, women who are pregnant. All patients will be treated with ranibizumab intravitreal
      injections on a variable dosing regimen: Patients with DME will be examined monthly and
      receive mandatory injection for the first three months (baseline, weeks 4 and 8). Afterwards,
      they will continue to be seen monthly and the need for new injections will be decided upon
      the clinical findings at each visit. An anterior chamber (AC) tap will be done if an
      injection is required at the visit. Patients with nAMD and RVO will be examined monthly and
      receive mandatory injection for the first three months. From weeks 12 until 72 (month 18),
      the visits will be scheduled at increasing 2-weeks intervals based on the stability of the
      ocular condition and response to treatment. At each visit, an injection and AC tap will be
      performed. The maximum interval in between injections is 12 weeks. If the disease becomes
      unstable, the interval in between injections is shortened and, once it stabilizes, the
      treatment frequency is extended again. In all patients, baseline aqueous humour specimens
      will be obtained prior to the first ranibizumab intravitreal injection and follow-up samples
      will be taken immediately prior to subsequent injections based on the treatment regimens for
      cytokine analysis in the end of the follow-up.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will include patients with 3 different diseases who will receive the same treatment (ranibizumab injections) but that will be independently analyzed. One population will be composed of patients with neovascular age related macular degeneration, the other of diabetic macular edema and the third of patients with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion.</intervention_model_description>
