    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate effects of high rebound mattress toppers (i.e.,
      airweave®) on sleep and sleep-related symptoms.

      The study will compare effects of use of high rebound mattress toppers versus use of low
      rebound mattress toppers on sleep and sleep related symptoms and core body temperature during
      diagnostic sleep studies.
