    <textblock>
      A Phase 2b, 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the
      effect of 3 different dose levels of IX-01 on IELT and patient-reported outcome in men with
      lifelong PE.

      Men with self-reported lifelong PE (International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM)
      definition) and in stable heterosexual relationship will undergo a 4-week run-in period
      during which they will be asked to attempt intercourse at least 4 times. Men with IELT ≤ 1
      minute on at least 75% of attempts at intercourse during the no-treatment run-in period will
      be randomized for the double-blind phase of the study.

      In the double-blind phase of the study, men will be asked to take study drug 1 to 6 hours
      prior to sexual activity. Men and partners will be asked to attempt intercourse a minimum of
      8 times during the 8 week double-blind study treatment. The patient or partner will record
      the IELT on each occasion by use of a stopwatch.
