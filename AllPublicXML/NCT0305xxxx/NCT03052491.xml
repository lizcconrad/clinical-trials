  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label field trial evaluates the effects of treatment with a multi-pathway dietary
      supplement (Stem Cell 100+) that has been commercially available for several years. The
      objective of the intervention trial is to determine if normal subjects over 35 years of age
      experience any observable health benefits from the dietary supplement as to their blood
      pressure, pulse rate, blood cholesterol, lung capacity, stress levels, or self reported
      changes in markers of overall health and life expectancy.

    <textblock>
      Currently, only dietary restriction has been verified to slow the rate of aging and to
      promote general health. This trial is designed to see whether a complex supplement (Stem Cell
      100+) that targets multiple longevity pathways could also have positive effects on several
      markers of successful aging and good health. Multipath causes of aging include: stem cell
      function, telomere loss, chronic stress, inflammation, insulin-like growth factors,
      autophagy, vascular loss, neural dysfunction, and oxidative stress. The goal of the study was
      to test the effects of this novel multipath intervention strategy in a clinical trial of
      healthy people using health markers such as blood pressure, cholesterol status, lung
      function, stress levels, and self-reported health status. Hundreds of published animal and
      human clinical studies have been done with each of the individual active ingredients in the
      formulation, which target many critical causes of aging.

      Based on their published animal studies showing extension of life span in a model animal and
      their laboratory work on adult human stem cells, the investigators believe that Stem Cell
      100+ will provide evidence of efficacy in addressing multiple index markers of health and
      life expectancy outcomes.
