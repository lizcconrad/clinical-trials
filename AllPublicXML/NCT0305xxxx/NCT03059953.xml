  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with moderate plaque psoriasis who are intolerable to, have a contraindication
      to or have failed classical systemic treatments, the current commonly employed management
      strategy encompasses treatment with biologic agents. The direct and indirect costs of
      biologic treatment, accruing, among others, from the high drug acquisition and administration
      costs, the required baseline safety screening and subsequent routine monitoring as well as
      the potential loss of patients' working hours constitute a significant financial burden on
      the public healthcare system. In light of the above evidence, it appears that in routine care
      apremilast may fulfill an important gap in the treatment armamentarium of psoriasis by
      providing a promising treatment option to be employed prior to biologics, which has
      demonstrated efficacy even in hard-to-treat areas such as the scalp, nails, palms and soles,
      and has a limited manageable safety profile, while being more convenient and cost-effective
      than biologics.

      In view of the scarcity of real-world evidence regarding the impact of apremilast on the
      patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and extent and severity of the disease, and
      under the consideration that the moderate psoriasis patient {defined as [10&lt;body surface area
      (BSA)&lt;20 or 10&lt;psoriasis area severity index (PASI)&lt;20] and 10&lt;dermatology quality of life
      index (DLQI)&lt;20}, naïve to biologic treatment was likely underrepresented in the pivotal
      ESTEEM trials since approximately 30% of the enrolled patients had been previously treated
      with biologic therapy, 28-30% had a baseline PASI score &gt;20, and 48-52% had a BSA &gt;20%, this
      study represents an attempt to examine the impact of apremilast in routine clinical practice
      settings in Greece on the patient with moderate plaque psoriasis when this therapeutic
      strategy precedes biologics in the treatment algorithm.

      Specifically, the present study aims to generate novel real-world evidence on the effect of
      apremilast treatment in biologic treatment naïve patients with moderate plaque psoriasis in
      terms of the patients' HRQoL, patient-perceived benefits of therapy, treatment response rate,
      and impact on nail, scalp and palmoplantar psoriatic involvement and severity of pruritus,
      while concurrently assessing apremilast survival rate and cost per PASI-75 responder in the
      routine clinical practice of Greece.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for inclusion in this study have to meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Male and female patients ≥ 18 years of age at the time of informed consent;

          -  Patients diagnosed with moderate chronic plaque psoriasis [(10&lt;BSA&lt;20 or 10&lt;PASI&lt;20)
             and 10&lt;DLQI&lt;20], who failed to respond to or who have a contraindication to, or are
             intolerant to other classical systemic therapy;

          -  Patients naïve to biologic treatments;

          -  Patients for whom the decision to prescribe therapy with apremilast (Otezla®)
             according to the locally approved summary of product characteristics (SmPC) has
             already been taken prior to their enrollment in the study and is clearly separated
             from the physician's decision to include the patient in the current study;

             treatment;

          -  Patients must be able to read, understand and complete the study specific
             questionnaires;
