    <textblock>
      The relative bioavailability of different salbutamol sulphate inhaler formulations will be
      studied in healthy male subjects according to the ethical regulations of World Medical
      Association Declaration of Helsinki (1996) after the approval of the ethical committee,
      Faculty of Pharmacy, The British University in Egypt.

      In this study, 20 healthy, non smoking, adult male volunteers (age: 30-45 years, weight:
      65-80 kg) will carry out screening procedures which include instruction and practice with the
      placebo metered dose inhaler devices that will be used in the study. In addition, all
      subjects were fully informed in writing of the objectives and implications of the trial. No
      subject will be considered for the study if developed any symptoms of allergic disorders.
      Subjects will follow a normal diet and will not receive any other medications. Volunteers
      will be divided into two groups; each group contained 10 volunteers who will receive one
      formula of the selected formulae.

      Each volunteer will inhale eight puffs (4 puffs at -5 min &amp; 4 puffs at 0 min) which are
      equivalent to 0.8 mg of salbutamol sulphate . To inhale through metered dose inhalers,
      volunteers will be trained to exhale slowly to their residual volume (as far as comfortable),
      put the inhaler into their mouth and seal their lips round the mouth piece. Then they will be
      instructed to take a slow deep inspiration to their total lung capacity over approximately
      5-10 seconds. At the end of each inhalation, they will hold their breath for 10 seconds and
      then breathe normally (Ball et al, 2002) . Three milliliters of blood will be withdrawn at 0,
      0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h after administration. The blood will be heparinized immediately
      and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The plasma samples will be stored at freeze
      temperature until analysis. Two different formulae will be compared during the first six
      hours following administration. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), the time required to
      reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) and the area under plasma concentration time curve
      (AUC) will be calculated using validated Excel software.
