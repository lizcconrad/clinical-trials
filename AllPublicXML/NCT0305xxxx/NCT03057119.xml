  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance misuse is a common problem among HIV+ individuals. Research suggests that a
      Screening, Brief Intervention, and Treatment (SBIRT) model can be effective in reducing
      substance misuse in the general older adult population; however these findings have not been
      verified in the more vulnerable HIV+ older adult population. The present study seeks to
      address the problem of substance misuse in older HIV+ adults by piloting a SBIRT model for
      older HIV+ adults in a in a primary care setting. Individual reductions in alcohol and drug
      use can have significant effects on public health and safety when observed over a large
      population at risk for substance use problems. With wider dissemination statewide, a
      relatively low-cost intervention such as SBIRT could offer demonstrated benefits in this
      population.

      The current project will pilot SBIRT with a peer navigator (SBIRT-PN) versus treatment at
      usual (TAU) to increase substance use treatment engagement among HIV-positive adults aged 50
      years and older. The investigators will recruit patients from the Southern HIV and Alcohol
      Research Consortium (SHARC) HIV primary care clinic network.

      In order to develop effective substance use intervention models for HIV care settings the
      specific aims of the current project are:

      Aim1: Examine the feasibility of the SBIRT-PN model at the UF Health Infectious
      Disease-Medical Specialties Clinic. The investigators hypothesize that the SBIRT-PN model
      will demonstrate high feasibility among providers within the UF Health Infectious Disease -
      Medical Specialties Clinic.

      Aim2a: Assess the acceptability of SBIRT-PN. The investigators hypothesize that SBIRT-PN will
      demonstrate high acceptability among patients enrolled in this condition.

      Aim2b: Assess the acceptability of SBIRT-PN among HIV-positive individuals by age cohort
      (younger vs older). The investigators hypothesize that SBIRT-PN will demonstrate higher
      acceptability among older HIV-positive patients enrolled in this condition.

      Aim3: Assess influence of SBIRT-PN model on treatment engagement and substance use compared
      to enhanced treatment as usual (TAU).The investigators hypothesize that those in the SBIRT-PN
      condition will evidence greater treatment engagement and a reduction in substance use.

    <description>To examine ratings of acceptability, the investigators will use the overall acceptability score and percentage of acceptability. Overall acceptability will be assessed by summing ratings from the 10-item questionnaire to provide a total intervention acceptability score for the intervention, such that acceptability scores for the intervention could range from 10 (low acceptability) to 50 (high acceptability). The intervention will be considered to have acceptability if 80% of the participants rank the intervention as acceptable (i.e., 4 or higher) on 80% or more of the scale items. The investigators will then examine each question of the Acceptability Questionnaire separately to determine strengths and weaknesses of the intervention.</description>

    <description>Participants will self-report if they obtained formal substance use treatment (i.e., any services sought to address substance use from individual therapy to 12 step fellowships). The investigators will request treatment facility information and permission to verify treatment. Once treatment has been verified, treatment engagement will be coded as 0= no formal treatment 1= formal treatment engagement</description>
