  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 22 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the sum of complete response [CR] rate (CR+ unconfirmed complete remission [CRu]) + Partial remission [PR] rate as per International Working Group (IWG 2007) criteria. These response criteria are based on the reduction in the size of the enlarged lymph node as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scan and the extent of bone marrow involvement that is determined by bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Complete response [CR] defined as disappearance of all evidence of disease; CRu satisfies CR criteria, however any residual lymph node mass greater than (&gt;)1.5 centimeter (cm) in longest transverse dimension or extranodal site of disease (irrespective of size) must have regressed by more than 75% of the product of the longest perpendicular dimensions compared to the pretreatment baseline. PR defined as at least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses.</description>
