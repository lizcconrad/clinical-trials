  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, opened, positive drug-controlled (Exenatide, Byetta), sequential
      parallel group, multiple dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics of twelve once-weekly subcutaneous doses of PB-119 to subjects with type
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two study phases according to different doses of investigational drug Phase 1：1
      investigational group and 1 control group, i.e.; investigational drug PB-119 injection 25µg
      group and control drug exenatide group.

      Phase 1： Plan to have 1 or 2 investigational group according to the study result from phase
      1, i.e., investigational drug PB-119 injection 50 µg group and control drug exenatide group.

      Subject Number：18 subjects will be randomized to each group, with equal number of females and
      males. 12 subjects will be in PB-119 group, 6 subjects will be in exenatide group.
