  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study rationale is to analyze the extent to which adult U.S. or non U.S. veterans or
      active duty military personnel who participate in the Yoga for Men (YfM) online Yoga and
      meditation classes report changes in symptoms of psychological trauma, depression, anxiety,
      stress, sleep quality, and pain. The serial measurement of symptom status over a 12-month
      period will provide information on the trajectory of change in symptom status, as well as
      insight into the extent to which this program may be an effective modality for veterans and
      service members who are experiencing symptoms of psychological trauma, depression, anxiety,
      stress, sleep quality, and pain. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the
      existing YfM online program is helpful to study qualifying veterans with symptoms of PTSD and
      related conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yoga is an ancient Indian science and way of life that includes the practice of specific
      postures, regulated breathing, and meditation. It is designed to bring balance and health to
      the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions of the individual.

      A recent systematic review of 17 studies published between the years 2011-2013 reported that
      most studies of yoga demonstrated positive changes in psychological or physiological outcomes
      related to stress. In addition, the practice of yoga also seems to be associated with
      moderate improvements in cognitive function , which in turn, may be expected to positively
      impact overall psychological well-being. These selected results provide a strong rationale to
      examine the effects of yoga for a range of health conditions, in addition to across various
      setting and by use of different delivery methods.

      Much of the research on mindfulness has been in the area of anxiety and depression. Evidence
      suggests that mindfulness-based stress reduction, an intervention that teaches individuals to
      attend to the present moment in a nonjudgmental, accepting manner , can result in reduced
      symptoms of depression and anxiety .

    <time_frame>Accessing a change from pre, one month, six month and at one year</time_frame>
    <description>There are several different ways of interpreting the scores given by the PTSD Checklist-5.[5] For a person to have a probable diagnosis of PTSD sufficient criteria must be at least moderately met in each of the four symptom groups.[1] This means you need to have one or more symptoms from questions 1 to 5, either question 6 or 7, two or more from questions 8 to 14, and two or more from questions 15 to 20, each of which must be met moderately, quite a bit or extremely.[1] In addition, a score of 38 or higher indicates probable PTSD in veterans.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PSQI: 15-item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Accessing a change from pre, one month, six month and at one year</time_frame>
    <description>measures quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It takes an estimated 3 to 6 minutes to complete. A global PSQI score greater than 5 has yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% (kappa = 0.75, p&lt;0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers. Internal consistency reliability has been estimated to range from .77 to .81.</description>

    <description>Short Form is a reliable and valid instrument that contains 19 primary pain items that are rated on an 11-point (0-10) Likert-type scale and one demographic question. In addition to a total pain score, six subscale scores can be calculated that correspond to: pain intensity (1 item), pain-related impairment in mobility (4 items), pain-related impairment in performing activities of daily living (4 items), sense of impairment in activity and energy levels (3 items), dysphoric affect and associated symptoms (5 items), and pain-related fear and avoidance (2 items)</description>
