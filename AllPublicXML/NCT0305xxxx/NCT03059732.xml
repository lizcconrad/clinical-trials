  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The differences in patient's clinicopathological characteristic between high and low
      prevalence of gastric cancer region should be further examined to elucidate factors that
      associate with poor survival rate of patients with gastric cancer. Therefore, this study
      aimed to evaluate characteristics of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and factors
      associated with different outcome in Thailand and Japan to find a clue to improve patients'
      survival in low prevalence country such as Thailand.

      This is a retrospective cohort study. It was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial
      Hospital, Thailand and Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease, Japan.
      Eligible cases were selected by using standardized search protocols: formal computer searches
      of all patients seen at out-patient clinic and/or hospitalized for gastric cancer between
      2010 and 2014.Two physicians, who were informed the definition of each variable, individually
      reviewed chart of patients.
