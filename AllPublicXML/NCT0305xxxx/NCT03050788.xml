  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate a novel diagnostic approach for Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)
      that may be eventually deployed with portable, point-of-care techniques. This approach
      features confocal microscopy. The investigators will compare this new approach with the gold
      standard of histology from a traditional skin punch biopsy (which is standard of care) to
      determine the sensitivity and specificity of portable confocal microscopy in diagnosing KS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a cross-sectional study of 500 patients in routine clinical
      care settings who are suspected to have KS on clinical grounds and for whom skin punch biopsy
      and histopathological examination is indicated as part of standard of care. Patients will be
      evaluated with both the gold standard for diagnosis of KS (skin punch biopsy followed by
      histopathology) and portable confocal microscopy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        i. â‰¥ 18 years old ii. Clinically suspected KS iii. Presence of suspected KS lesions in
        areas which are considered safe to biopsy by the Ugandan providers, which means all areas
        of the skin except for the mouth and eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        i. Presence of suspected KS lesions exclusively on the mouth or eye unless clinical
        specialists trained in biopsy of the mouth or eye are available locally to biopsy the mouth
        or eye. Oral and eye sites would typically only be biopsied when clinical diagnosis has
        proved to be problematic and definitive diagnosis is needed to inform a treatment plan.
