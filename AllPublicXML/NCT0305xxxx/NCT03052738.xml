      This study proposes to do a prospective observational cohort study evaluating the quality of
      life (QOL) of children with Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors and their families who choose
      to self-medicate with marijuana-derived products while undergoing treatment at Children's
      Hospital Colorado (CHCO).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO) Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders (CCBD) is a
      national leader in pediatric cancer therapy. The CHCO Neuro-Oncology program treats more that
      90% of Coloradan children with Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors and a large percentage of
      children with CNS tumors from the surrounding five states. Due to advances in therapy,
      approximately two-thirds of children with CNS tumors treated at CHCO will be cured. Although
      medical marijuana has been legal for more than a decade in Colorado, the publicity around the
      more recent legalization for general adult use, increasing literature, and anecdotal reports
      of patients with terminal CNS tumors cured with medical marijuana, have prompted a recent
      increase in interest of current CHCO patients and their families. There has been an influx of
      pediatric cancer patients and their families moving to Colorado to obtain these
      marijuana-based products to self-medicate.

      The Investigators will administer PedsQLTM questionnaires and diaries to gather data
      regarding use practices, method of delivery, strain used, dosing and frequency, and family
      financial impact on all enrolled patients. The Investigators will also collect peripheral
      blood samples to evaluate for evidence of immuno-modulation by cannabinoids in patients who
      may already be immunocompromised and to assess blood cannabinoid levels.

      This study will provide novel exploratory data regarding use patterns, impact on families and
      resources, and potential clinical benefits and harms associated with the growing marijuana
      use in the pediatric neuro-oncology population. Such information may guide future children
      afflicted with CNS tumors and their families to make decisions about whether to pursue
      cannabinoid treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 2 years and &lt; 18 years at the time of study enrollment.

          2. Parents/legal guardian(s) that will be completing the questionnaires must sign
             consent. There are no age parameters for parent/legal guardians' participation on
             study.

          3. Patients must have a diagnosis of central nervous system (brain or spinal) tumor

          4. Patients must be ONE of the following:

               -  Undergoing disease-directed therapy or disease surveillance as prescribed by the
                  Pediatric Neuro-Oncology physicians at CHCO

               -  Planning to transfer medical care to Pediatric Neuro-Oncology physicians at CHCO
                  from outside facilities

               -  Receiving palliative care services that are managed in conjunction with
                  physicians at CHCO

          5. Interest in marijuana use has been discussed by the patient or parents.

          6. Patient has not used any marijuana products or synthetics in the last 14 days (a
             washout period of 14 days is permitted for those interested in participating on this
             study)

               1. An exception to this rule is if patients took their first dose within 72 hours of
                  signing consent. These patients will be eligible for study without going through
                  a washout period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Use (or planned use) of synthetic marijuana products as sole cannabinoid therapy
