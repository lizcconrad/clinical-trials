      Determine if adding a video game component to an electrical stimulation therapy improves hand
      function in stroke patients

      A single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be carried out to assess the effects of 12
      weeks of Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (CCFES) +Hand Therapy
      Video Games (HTVG) compared to CCFES. Dexterity, upper limb impairment, and activity
      limitation will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 3, 6, 9, 12 (end of treatment), 24, and 36 wks.
      Cortical activation (measured with fMRI) will be assessed at 0 and 12 wks. The treatment dose
      will be the same for both groups: 10 sessions per week (7.5 hrs) of self-administered
      treatment at home plus 2 sessions per week (3 hrs) of group-specific occupational therapy in
      the lab.

    <description>CCFES uses surface electrodes over the paretic finger and thumb extensors to deliver stimulation with an intensity that is proportional to the degree of opening of the contralateral unimpaired hand wearing an instrumented glove. Thus, volitional opening of the nonparetic hand produces stimulated opening of the paretic hand. CCFES enables stroke survivors to open and close their paretic hand and practice using it in therapy sessions. The treatment regimen includes CCFES-mediated: 1) home-based self-administered hand opening exercises, and 2) lab-based therapist-guided functional task practice.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -&gt; 6 months since a first clinical cortical or subcortical, hemorrhagic or nonhemorrhagic
        stroke

          -  age 21-80 years old

          -  unilateral upper limb hemiparesis with finger extensor strength of grade &lt;=4/5 on the
             Medical Research Council (MRC) scale AND a score of &gt;=1 and &lt;=11/14 on the hand
             section of the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment

          -  adequate active movement of the shoulder and elbow to position the hand in the
             workspace for table-top task practice (necessary for the lab task practice sessions)

             impairment)

          -  surface stimulation of the paretic finger and thumb extensors produces functional hand
             opening without pain (this will exclude those who have degree of flexor hypertonia
             that prevents stimulated hand opening)

          -  Functional passive range of motion (minimal resistance) at elbow, wrist, fingers, and
             thumb, i.e., there exists enough passive range of motion to reach and acquire

          -  intact vision and hearing

          -  medically stable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  co-existing neurologic diagnosis of peripheral nerve injury, Parkinson's disease,
             spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, or multiple sclerosis

          -  uncontrolled seizure disorder

          -  severely impaired cognition and communication

          -  uncompensated hemineglect

          -  arm or forearm skin breakdown or edema (to avoid edema-related shunting of current)

          -  insensate forearm (to avoid risk of electrical burns)

          -  history of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias

          -  implanted electronic systems (e.g. pacemaker)

          -  botulinum toxin injections to any upper extremity muscle within 3 months of enrolling

          -  pregnant women due to unknown risks of surface NMES during pregnancy

          -  participating in occupational therapy or other rehabilitation therapies to the upper
             extremity

          -  severe shoulder or hand pain
