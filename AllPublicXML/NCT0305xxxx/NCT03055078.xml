      This study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Umbilical Cord Derived Mesenchymal Stem
      Cells transplantation in aplastic anemia.

    <textblock>
      Aplastic anemia (AA) is a disorder thought to be caused by an immune-mediated bone marrow
      failure. Not all people with AA are eligible for today's standard treatments. One new
      treatment approach uses umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells—specialized cells
      capable of developing into other types of cells—to provide the basis for clinical
      application. The aim of the present study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of vein
      infusion of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells in patients with AA .
