               -  Metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma, progressive after at least the first-line
                  therapy (the drug will be used as a second or subsequent therapy lines);

             In addition, by investigator's decision, patients with the following malignancies can
             also be enrolled in the study :

               -  Pleural mesothelioma progressive after at least one therapy line (the drug will
                  be used as a second or subsequent therapy lines);

               -  Metastatic bladder cancer progressive after at least one therapy line (the drug
                  will be used as a second or subsequent therapy lines);

          5. Measurable disease (at least one lesion) according to RECIST v. 1.1 ;

          6. Resolved toxicity events from the previous therapy or adverse consequences of surgical
             interventions to ≤ grade 1 CTCAE v. 4.03, except for chronic/irreversible adverse
             events not affecting the safety of the study therapy (e.g. alopecia);
