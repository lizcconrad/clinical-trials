  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity interventions with older adults can improve brain health; however most
      interventions have been performed in gym-like settings that reach a small sector of the
      senior population. Since not everyone can access a gym, it is important to study whether
      brisk walking in real world environments can also help brain health. This study will use
      mobile health devices to help older adults independently walk for brain health, thus
      representing a critical step towards the dissemination of physical activity intervention
      programs aimed at preserving cognitive function in aging.

    <textblock>
      Physical activity interventions conducted in supervised settings (laboratories and group
      settings) with older adults have consistently shown improved cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular health and improved cognitive function. What is lacking is the development of
      interventions that take place in real world environments and that take advantage of new
      technologies to help objectively track real time physical activity behaviors. Real world
      physical activity interventions have the potential to reach a larger segment of the
      population and to enhance maintenance after the intervention period ends. This study will
      develop a novel physical activity intervention using mobile health technologies to promote
      physical activity levels likely to affect cerebral blood flow and cognition in real world
      environments in cognitively normal older adults. A randomized controlled trial will be
      conducted with 30 participants being assigned to the mobile health physical activity
      condition (walking in free-living environments tracked via mobile health technologies) and
      another 30 to an education control condition (at home reading about healthy aging materials)
      for 3 months.
