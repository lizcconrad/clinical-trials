  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the psychometric properties (content and construct
      validity, reliability, measurements error, as well as possible floor and ceiling effects) of
      both the assessments MMT8 and the myositis activity profile in patients with IM.

      This study evaluates the validity and reliability of two health related instruments that
      assess disease relevant functions and disabilities in patients with IM: the manual muscle
      testing 8 (MMT8) and the myositis activity profile (MAP). This study is needed to determine
      the psychometric properties of these two assessments. Provided that both the MMT8 and the MAP
      show good psychometric properties, these assessments could be used in the rehabilitation
      process and intervention programs of patients with IM to determine progress in muscle
      strength and activity in daily life.

      Methodology: Reliability (Test re-test study and validity (cross sectional study) of a short
      form of MMT 8 and a questionnaire to assess difficulties in activities of daily life (MAP) in
      myositis patients.
