  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using eye-tracking technology, the aim of this observational study is to compare the visual
      interests between attending physicians and residents watching a Cannot Intubate/Cannot
      Oxygenate (CICO) scripted and simulated scenario

    <textblock>
      Attending physicians and residents, from the department of Anesthesiology at the Université
      de Montréal were recruited on a voluntary basis. A 13-minute video based on a suggested CICO
      algorithm from the Difficult Airway Society to manage unanticipated difficult intubation in
      adults (3) was produced at the University of Montreal Simulation Centre using high-fidelity
      settings. The scenario was about a patient, with a cervical collar, in the post-anesthesia
      care unit. Throughout the video, the patient presents increasing respiratory distress
      worsening to respiratory failure. The anesthesiologist fails to ventilate, intubate and
      insert a laryngeal mask leading to a cricothyroidotomy. All participants were looking at a
      screen on which the scenario was broadcast. The screen was equipped with TobiiEyeX®, an
      eye-tracking system that automatically aggregates gaze data.

    <description>The screen was equipped with TobiiEyeX®, an eye-tracking system that automatically aggregates gaze data. The display was divided in seven Areas of Interest (AOI). Data were collected using the Tobii Studio® program to obtain the total view duration (TVD) of the various AOIs.</description>
