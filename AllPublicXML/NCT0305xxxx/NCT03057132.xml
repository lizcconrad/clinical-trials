    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of 3M™
      Cavilon™ Advanced Skin Protectant when used in the management of damaged skin exposed to
      caustic body fluids from an ostomy, drain site or fistula.

      This is a pilot study evaluating the product, 3M™ Cavilon™ Advanced Skin Protectant, for the
      management of skin around an ostomy, drain and/or fistula. All subjects will receive the
      product for up to 14 days. The primary site must have red skin with breakdown (i.e. skin
      erosion and denudation or denudation of skin alone). Secondary sites can have red skin with
      or without breakdown. Product will be applied twice/week or more frequently if additional
      applications are needed due to leakage, skin irritation or standard of care. Skin assessments
      (including photography) will be completed at baseline and at all follow-up visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is the subject 18 years of age or older?

          2. Does the subject have red skin with breakdown (i.e. skin erosion and denudation or
             denudation of skin alone) at the primary site of an ostomy, drain and/or fistula?

          3. Is the subject willing to have photographs taken of their skin and permit use of
             photographs in potential publication?

          4. Is the subject willing to release rights to 3M for the use of the photos?

          5. Is there a reasonable expectation that the subject will be in the hospital or
             available for follow-up visits during the 14 day study period?

          6. Has the subject signed an Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent/assent
             document and authorized the use and disclosure of protected health information?

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. If female, is the subject pregnant or breast feeding or has she given birth within the
             3 weeks preceding the screening visit?

          2. Does the subject have a known allergy to acrylates or cyanoacrylates?

          3. Does the subject have a preexisting skin disease on the areas affected that may make
             skin assessments for this study difficult?

          4. Does the skin area affected require treatment with a concomitant medication or
             product?

          5. Has the subject received antifungal powders in the area affected within 24 hours prior
             to enrollment?

          6. Has the subject received cyanoacrylate based skin protectant (such as Marathon) within
             72 hours prior to enrollment?

          7. Does the subject have any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator
             should exclude him/her from participating in the study?

          8. Has the subject been enrolled in any investigational study where product was applied
             to proposed study sites within 30 days of the screening visit?
