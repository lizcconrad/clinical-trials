  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the
      accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Current consensus is that the AD
      pathological process begins decades before clinical symptoms occur. This long &quot;preclinical&quot;
      phase of AD might first become detectable in middle-age as deposits of hyperphosphorylated
      tau (P-tau) in the transentorhinal cortex and subcortical nuclei such as the locus coeruleus
      (LC) and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. There is strong preliminary evidence showing that
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of orexin-A (OxA) are associated with increased P-tau
      (r=.52, p&lt;.01) and total-tau (T-tau) (r=.42, p&lt;.01) in cognitively normal older adults (mean
      age: 69.6±8.6 years).

      This study poses that onset of tauopathy in the LC results in down regulation of orexin
      receptors, leading to a homeostatic increase of OxA production by the hypothalamus, which
      results in changes in core body temperature (CBT) and sleep disruption that cause further
      neurodegeneration. This hypothesis will be tested by demonstrating that increases in CSF
      P-tau are associated in vivo with tau PET uptake, and that tau binding in the LC is
      associated with increases in CSF OxA (Aim 1); and second, by analyzing the downstream
      consequences of increased central nervous system (CNS) OxA on sleep architecture and CBT (Aim
      2). To test these hypotheses, 19 older adults (age 55-75) balanced by sex, will first perform
      a full clinical evaluation and PET-MRI where Tau burden will be analyzed by PET-MR using
      18F-MK6240 (visits 1-2). Subjects will later undergo 7 days of actigraphy followed by
      nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) for 2 consecutive nights (N1-2) during which we will measure
      CBT (visits 3-4). A morning lumbar puncture (LP) will be performed after N2 to obtain CSF.

      There is the potential to identify: 1) an association between CSF P-tau and in vivo
      18F-MK6240 uptake; 2) a mechanism by which tau pathology may contribute to orexin
      dysfunction; 3) evidence that orexin dysfunction disrupts sleep and CBT rhythm; and, 4) CNS
      orexin dysfunction as a new therapeutic target for AD prevention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects with normal cognition and 55-75 years of age will be
             enrolled.

          -  Subjects will be within normal limits on neurological and psychiatric examinations.
             All subjects enrolled will have both a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)=0 and a MMSE≥27

          -  All subjects will have had a minimum of 12 years of education. Among minority subjects
             &gt;80% of the elderly individuals coming to the NYU-ADC meet this criterion. (The
             education restriction reduces performance variance on cognitive test measures and
             improves the sensitivity for detecting pathology and disease progression using the
             robust norms available at NYU. Given the majority of subjects will meet this criterion
             we do not consider this a major selection bias or generalization limitation for this
             study).

          -  An informed family member or life-partner (preferably bed-partner) will be interviewed
             over the phone or on the first or second visit to confirm the reliability of the
             subject interview.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of brain tumor, MRI evidence of brain damage or brain disease including
             significant trauma, hydrocephalus, seizures, mental retardation or other serious
             neurological disorder (e.g. Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders). Subjects
             with a Fazekas scale &gt;2 will be excluded109.

          -  Significant history of alcoholism or drug abuse.

          -  History of psychiatric illness (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar, PTSD, or life-long
             history of major depression).

          -  Geriatric Depression Scale (short form)&gt;5.

          -  Insulin dependent diabetes.

          -  Evidence of clinically relevant cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine or hematological
             conditions (e.g. low platelet levels).

          -  Physical impairment of such severity as to adversely affect the validity of
             psychological testing.

          -  Any prosthetic devices (e.g., pacemaker or surgical clips) that constitutes a hazard
             for MRI imaging or CBT measurements.

          -  History of a first-degree family member with early onset (age &lt;60 years) dementia.

          -  Irregular sleep-wake rhythms (based on the actigraphy recordings) or significant OSA
             (AHI4%≥15).

          -  Medications affecting cognition or sleep.

          -  Presence of any known or suspected obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract,
             including but not limited to diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease.

          -  History of disorders or impairment of the gag reflex.

          -  Previous gastrointestinal surgery.

          -  Previous felinization of the esophagus.

          -  Subjects who might undergo Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) or MRI scanning during the
             period that the CorTemp® Disposable Temperature Sensor is within the body.

          -  Subjects hypomotility disorders of the gastrointestinal tract including but not
             limited to Ileus.
