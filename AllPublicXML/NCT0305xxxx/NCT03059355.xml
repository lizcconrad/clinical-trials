  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the safety and efficacy of UCMSCs and BMMSCs administered
      intravenously in patients to evaluate cytokine suppression in patients with chronic
      inflammation. Cells administered via intravenous infusion (IV) and will be tested in 37
      patients in two phases (Pilot and Randomized).

    <textblock>
      In this Study, cells administered via intravenous infusion (IV) will be tested in 37 patients
      in two phases (Pilot and Randomized):

      The pilot phase will consist of 12 subjects and the randomized phase will consist of 25
      subjects.

      Subjects in each pilot phase group (Group 1, 2, 3 and 4) will not be treated less than 5 days
      apart and will each undergo full evaluation post infusion to demonstrate there is no evidence
      of treatment emergent SAE's prior to proceeding with the treatment of further subjects.

      For subjects randomized to Group 3, 4, C and D (BMMSCs); the cells will be derived from a
      sample of the subject's bone marrow (obtained by iliac crest aspiration) approximately 4-6
      weeks prior to infusion.

      Duration of Study Participation will be 12 months (Follow-up will be at 2 weeks, 1 Month, 3,
      6, and 12 months.)
