  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The associations between female inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and human papilloma
      virus (HPV) infection and cervical neoplasia (dysplasia or cancer) were unclear. Especially
      there was no data for Chinese IBD population. So we investigated the incidence and risk
      factors of HPV infection and cervical neoplasia (dysplasia or cancer) in female IBD patient.

    <description>The difference of the incidence of cervical neoplasm between healthy control and IBD patients was not clear.All the controls and patients are going to perform Thinprep Cytology Test which could detect intraepithelial neoplasia of cervix.</description>

    <measure>Find drugs relating to HPV infection of IBD patients</measure>
    <time_frame>July 2015 to July 2017</time_frame>
    <description>Most IBD patients used steroid, infliximab or immunosuppressant to manage the disease. We separate patients into two groups according to using a certain drug or not. Then we compare the HPV infection rate between the two groups by Pearson-X2 test using SPSS 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA).P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</description>

        All consecutive female adult patients betwween 20-60 year old were recruited from July 2015
        to July 2017. Female persons who performed physical examination in our hospital with the
        same age were recuited as control. All of the received HPV DNA testing and TCT. The case
        and control were matched 1:3
