      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system (CNS) and is one of the most common neurological diseases, often leading to
      disability of the patients. The MS pathogenesis includes vascular and inflammatory
      components, however recently also the role of mitochondrial dysfunction being a hot topic in
      neurodegeneration.

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central
      nervous system (CNS) and is one of the most common neurological diseases, often leading to
      disability of the patients. The MS pathogenesis includes vascular and inflammatory
      components, however recently also the role of mitochondrial dysfunction being a hot topic in
      neurodegeneration. Current project is based on our previous project results, where we found
      signs of insulin resistance (IR) with hyperinsulinemia in patients with MS, which seems not
      to be related to chronic inflammation or low physical activity. Therefore aim of present
      project is to elucidate impact of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of impaired
      insulin action and its role in the neurodegenerative process. To test our hypothesis we will
      assess mitochondrial function, endothelial function, changes in membrane proteins and
      function of autonomic nervous system. Those parameters will be measured non-invasively and in
      samples of blood, cerebrospinal fluid and skeletal muscle. MS patients will be examined at
      the time of diagnosis and after 12 months of treatment, healthy subjects will be used as
      controls. We expect elucidation of insulin resistance cause and the role of mitochondrial
      dysfunction in pathogenesis of disease. Potential outcome of the project could be the answer,
      if pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention might lead to improvement of
      mitochondrial function and therefore represent a new approach to prevent MS progression.

    <description>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was developed for rating overall disability in MS. Patients are graded on the basis of presenting symptoms in eight different functional systems (FS), including pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, mental, and other functions. Scoring of the EDSS uses a 0 to 10, 20-step scale, with 0 equal to normal neurological function, 6.0 requires an assistive device for walking and 10.0 equal to death due to MS. The final score is based on grades obtained in the FS assessment.</description>
