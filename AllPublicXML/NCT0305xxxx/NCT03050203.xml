  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence suggests the efficacy of &quot;custom pack&quot; procedure on the operators reduction
      time and on the contamination risk due to the opening of many sterile packs. Nevertheless
      ,the studies available are sponsored by the industry and their results are very few. The aim
      of this study is to evaluate the correlation and reliability of spine surgery &quot;custom pack&quot;
      efficacy in adult patients obtained in the reduction of surgery time, relative risks, and
      materials wasted compared with the standard surgical field procedure practice .
