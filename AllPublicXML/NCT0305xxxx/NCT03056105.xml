  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine how participation in a 1 month intensive Insight
      (vipassana) Meditation retreat (a) affects biological markers of cellular aging, social
      affiliation, and inflammation, which are important for physical health, longevity, and
      behavior, and (b) to relate observed biological changes to baseline levels and changes in
      psychological traits, which may underlie improvements in personal adaptive functioning.

      The investigators are specifically assessing the effects of retreat on telomere length and
      telomerase levels in participants' white blood cells, as well as plasma levels of
      interlukin-6 (IL-6), to assess how the retreat experience impacts these markers of cellular
      aging and inflammation. The hypotheses are that retreat participation will increase both
      telomere length and telomerase activity, but decrease IL-6 levels. The investigators will
      also assess the impact of retreat participation on oxytocin—a hormone involved in a number of
      physiological and behavioral processes, including affiliative bonds and stress responses—the
      hypothesis being that participation in the retreat will increase plasma oxytocin levels. The
      investigators will then explore how these and other biomarkers relate to psychological
      processes and personality traits, which may also be altered by participation in the
      meditation retreat.

    <description>Retreats at Spirit Rock Meditation Center were led by teams of 6 experienced teachers. Participants practiced &quot;noble silence&quot;—refraining from eye contact as well as verbal and written communication—except during meetings with teachers. Teachers lead guided Insight meditation practices, as well as meditations on loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity. The daily schedule consisted of sitting and walking meditation sessions (30-45 mins) totaling 8-10 hours/day, meals, and short work meditations (sweeping, dishes, etc.). Seated meditation was practiced as a group in a meditation hall with approximately 80 participants. Walking meditation took place in adjoining halls or on the grounds. Participants lived on-site during the retreat and were provided with a vegetarian diet.</description>
