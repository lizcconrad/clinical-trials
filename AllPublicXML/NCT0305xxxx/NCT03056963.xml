  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a guided imagery paradigm for
      reducing negative ways of thinking about the self. There will be at least 60 participants
      enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin. Participants will be randomly selected to
      receive one of two types of trainings, each over the course of two weeks. Participants will
      undergo the training exercises at home. The training exercises will help them to think
      differently about themselves.

      Participants will be able to determine if they are eligible, and then participate, by filling
      out a screening questionnaire online.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study uses a randomized controlled trial to compare two types of guided imagery. One
      intervention is an active intervention; the other is intended to be inert. These
      interventions were developed based on extensive research indicating the efficacy of using
      imagery in depression, and a perceived lack of treatments targeting biased self-referential
      processing.

      This protocol aims to develop a novel intervention which can be used on its own or as an
      adjunct to existing treatments. Common treatments for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are
      diffuse; this paradigm instead aims to specifically target negative self-schema, a part of
      the cognitive model of MDD. This study focuses on participants with elevated depressive
      symptoms.

    <measure>Change in response on the Self-Referent Encoding Task (SRET)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will complete the SRET at baseline, after one week, and after two weeks. Change will be assessed primarily as SRET at two weeks MINUS SRET at baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The SRET is a task that asks participants to categorize words as self-referential or not. Its outcomes are focused on behavioral response and reaction time. We have shown that it has good test-retest reliability over the course of one week.</description>

    <measure>Depressive Symptomatology</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will complete measures of depressive symptoms at baseline, after one week, and after two weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Measures of depressive symptoms will be measured with the CESD, a self-report questionnaire used in the literature to measure levels of depression. This questionnaire has good test-retest reliability, and reliably changes with symptoms.</description>
