    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase II study of durvalumab in combination with
      lenalidomide for treatment of relapsed/refractory NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL). The study will
      employ a 2-stage Simon Optimal design with 80% power and type 1 error rate (significance
      level) of 5%. Stage 1 will involve 8 patients and will require at least 2 patients to achieve
      the primary end point of overall response in order to proceed onto to stage 2, which will
      have a target enrolment of 14 patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically proven NK/T-cell lymphoma that has relapsed after at least one cycle of
             induction chemotherapy.

          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.

          3. Previously treated with at least one cycle of chemotherapy that includes

             infiltration of the bone marrow or hemophagocytic syndrome related to NKL) within 30
             days prior to signing informed consent, including:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.0 x 109/L

               2. Platelet count ≥ 50 x 109/L

               3. Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL
