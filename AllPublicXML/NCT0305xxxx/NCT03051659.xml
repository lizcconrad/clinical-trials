      This research study is exploring chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy (a therapy
      that uses the body's own immune system to control cancer) as a possible treatment for
      metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      In this research study, The investigators are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of
      Eribulin mesylate with or without Pembrolizumab in metastatic hormone receptor positive
      breast cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of
      Pembrolizumab and Eribulin mesylate for Breast Cancer.

      The FDA has not approved Pembrolizumab for this specific type of breast cancer but it has
      been approved in the United States for other diseases.

      The FDA has approved Eribulin mesylate as a treatment option for this type of breast cancer.

      Pembrolizumab is a medicine that may treat cancer by working with the immune system. The
      immune system is the body's natural defense against disease. The immune system sends types of
      cells called &quot;T cells&quot; throughout the body to detect and fight infections and diseases,
      including cancer. For some types of cancer, the T cells do not work as they should and are
      prevented from attacking the tumors. Pembrolizumab is thought to work by blocking a protein
      in the T cells called PD-1 (&quot;programmed death 1&quot;), which then may allow these cells and other
      parts of the immune system to attack tumors.

      Eribulin mesylate is developed from a natural substance found in a sea sponge. Eribulin
      mesylate works by preventing cancer cells from multiplying.

      The combination of Pembrolizumab and Eribulin mesylate is investigational. The study drugs,
      when given separately, work in different ways to stop the cancer cells from growing and
      spreading. However, it is not known if giving the two study drugs at the same time will have
      a better anti-cancer effect than giving each treatment on its own.

          -  The effects of eribulin mesylate and pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are
             unknown. Pre-clinical data was suggestive of a teratogenic effect of eribulin
             mesylate. For these reasons women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for
             the duration of study participation and 4 months after the last dose of eribulin
             mesylate and/or pembrolizumab. Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual
             lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.

               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
                  partner is participating in this study, the treating physician and principal
                  investigator should be informed immediately.

               -  While on the study, women must not breastfeed.

               -  Subjects of childbearing potential are defined as those who have not been
                  surgically sterilized and/or have had a menstrual period in the past year

             negative urine or a negative serum pregnancy test within seven (7) days of first dose
             of pembrolizumab. If a urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a
             serum pregnancy test will be required.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy-related or radiation-related toxicities that have not resolved to Grade 1
             severity or lower, except for stable sensory neuropathy (≤ Grade 2) and alopecia.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Previous treatment with eribulin mesylate or any anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 agent or
             participation in any MK-3475 Merck studies.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to eribulin mesylate or pembrolizumab.

          -  Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control
             symptoms. Participants with previously diagnosed brain metastases are eligible if they
             have completed treatment at least 4 weeks prior to registration, are neurologically
             stable and absence of new neurologic symptoms for the last 4 weeks prior to study
             entry, and have recovered from the effects of radiotherapy or surgery. Any
             corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued without the
             subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the first study drug. Treatment
             for brain metastases may have included whole brain radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or a
             combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to uncontrolled
             hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive
             heart failure-New York Heart Association Class III or IV, active ischemic heart
             disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months, uncontrolled diabetes
             mellitus, gastric or duodenal ulceration diagnosed within the previous 6 months,

          -  Medcial condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or on any other form
             of immunosuppressive medication. For example, participants with autoimmune disease
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppression agents should be excluded.
             Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  History or evidence of active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required treatment with
             steroids.

          -  History of interstitial lung disease.

          -  Participants known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             Hepatitis B antigen (HepBsAg), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA. HIV-positive
             participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Pembrolizumab and/or eribulin
             mesylate. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections.

          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed
             within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed
             with the study sponsor to determine eligibility.
