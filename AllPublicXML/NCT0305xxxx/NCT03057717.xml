  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Administration of corticosteroids is standard practice for pregnant patients at risk of
      preterm labour to reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular
      hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis and neonatal mortality. However, there is an unknown
      effect of antenatal steroids on both fetal and neonatal immune function. The purpose of this
      study is to demonstrate the effect of antenatal steroids on the size of the fetal thymus
      gland.

    <textblock>
      Women with a singleton pregnancy in the twenty-forth to thirty-fourth week of gestation who
      are at risk for preterm labour, requiring the administration of Betamethasone twelve
      milligrams intramuscularly every twenty-four hours for two doses will be included in this
      study along with an equal number of gestational-age matched controls not at risk for preterm
      delivery and therefore not requiring the administration of Betamethasone. A 2-D ultrasound
      assessment of the fetal thymus size with measurements of the maximum transverse diameter and
      thymus perimeter in the three-vessel view will be performed as a baseline measurement within
      36 hours of the administration of the first dose of corticosteroids. For each patient
      enrolled, a gestational-age matched control will have a similar ultrasound assessment. These
      measurements will be repeated 2 weeks after the first baseline ultrasound, and then only
      patients who received corticosteroids will have subsequent ultrasound measurements every 2
      weeks until delivery.
