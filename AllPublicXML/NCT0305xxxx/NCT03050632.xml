  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested about the degree to which individuals can persist with
      individualized treatment goals when their cues (external such as food, or internal such as
      anxiety) are high for impulsive/maladaptive behavior (e.g., purging, not eating, etc.). The
      investigators want to find specific high-difficulty situations in which to assess whether
      participants remain mindful of the big picture and are willing to work toward therapeutic
      goals. Also, the investigators want to rate the participants degree of success (e.g.,
      proportion of calories eaten) assessed more objectively.

      The theory is that working memory capacity (WMC) modulates the ability to keep longer-term
      goals in mind when faced by current stress/temptations. For example, the ability to control
      drinking when one has an implicit urge to drink is predicted by WMC. The ability to apply a
      novel emotional regulation skill at a time of stress is also predicted by WMC. Indeed, the
      generic ability to pursue goals in the future (as assessed by the discounting of the value of
      future goals) is reliably predicted by WMC. There is also evidence that activation of brain
      regions associated with WMC (by direct activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex via
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or by having a person complete a relevant cognitive
      task) improves delay discounting.

      Accordingly, the investigators are proposing a study that both assesses the link between WMC
      and relevant the clinical measures noted above, as well as changes in these measures
      following activation of WM with a cognitive prime (WM task). The overall design calls for an
      initial WMC assessment, followed by randomization to complete 3 days of a WM prime and then 3
      days of a no prime group, or vice versa. The investigators then assess the clinical outcomes
      noted above across the following 6 days, with a WM prime first or no prime first occurring
      prior to the targeted behaviors. The investigators will prime WM prior to participant's
      evening meal, with the WM intervention offered during the free time before this meal.

    <description>Participants will complete the working memory priming task either for the first 3 days of the intervention or the last 3 days of the intervention, with order counterbalanced across participants. The working memory prime is the N-back test, a measure of working memory in which individuals need to make a response to targets which are repeated letters either in a row (i.e., one-back) or in every-other-letter format (i.e., two-back) (Jaeggi et al., 2010).</description>

    <description>Participants will complete this non-working-memory control task either for the first 3 days of the intervention or the last 3 days of the intervention, depending on counterbalanced order. The task consists of a procedure developed by Wegner and colleagues (1987) in a study of thought suppression, which instructs participants to inhibit thoughts of a white bear, and to indicate with a pencil mark every time the thought of the white bear occurs to them.</description>
