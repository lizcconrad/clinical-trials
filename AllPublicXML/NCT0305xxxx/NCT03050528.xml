  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined Exercise and Acceptance
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT) programme, compared to a standalone supervised exercise
      intervention for patients with chronic pain. Chronic pain is a common problem, which can have
      a significant impact on quality of life. While there are many treatments available for
      chronic pain, research has shown that improvements are often modest and short-term.

      Exercise therapy is known to be helpful for many chronic conditions and is recommended in
      clinical guidelines for the management of chronic pain. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
      (ACT) is a form of psychological therapy, which focuses on improvement of function, rather
      than symptom reduction. There is an emphasis on psychological flexibility, values and
      mindfulness. This approach may be well suited to chronic pain, where symptoms can be beyond a
      person's control, but there is a need for further research, particularly with regards to
      combining ACT with a physical intervention.

      This study will take place in a Dublin University hospital. Patients will be randomly
      allocated to a combined exercise and ACT treatment group or a standalone exercise group. Both
      groups will have weekly treatment for eight weeks and will be assessed before and after
      treatment, and again twelve weeks later. Questionnaires will be used to measure the effects
      of the treatment on the degree to which pain interferes with various aspects of daily life.
      Activity trackers will be worn to measure daily physical activity levels. A purposeful sample
      of participants from both groups will also be invited to participate in a qualitative study
      following treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, two-armed, parallel group, single-centre Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT)
      will assess the effectiveness of a combined Exercise and ACT programme, in comparison to a
      standalone supervised exercise intervention for chronic pain. One hundred and sixty patients
      aged 18 years and over, who have been diagnosed with a chronic pain condition by a medical
      doctor will be recruited to the trial. Participants will be individually randomised to one of
      two group interventions. The combined group will take part in eight, weekly psychology
      sessions based on the ACT approach, in addition to supervised exercise classes led by a
      physiotherapist. The control group will also attend eight, weekly supervised exercise classes
      but will not take part in ACT programme. All participants will be assessed at baseline,
      immediately post intervention and at twelve-week follow-up. The primary outcome will be pain
      interference at twelve-week follow-up, measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Interference
      Scale. Secondary outcomes will include self-reported pain severity, pain related
      self-efficacy, quality of life, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance,
      committed action, patient global impression of change, patient satisfaction with treatment,
      depression and anxiety. The number of investigations and pain related visits to healthcare
      professionals in the preceding three months will be recorded at baseline and twelve-week
      follow-up. Physical activity levels (average daily step count, distance travelled and active
      minutes) will be measured for all participants using Fitbit Zip activity trackers for one
      week prior to starting treatment and for the duration of the eight week intervention period.
      Participants will be invited to wear the activity trackers for one further week at the
      twelve-week follow-up time point.

      Estimates of treatment effects at follow up time-points will be based on an
      intention-to-treat framework, implemented using a linear mixed effects model. A purposeful
      sample of participants will be invited to attend individual interviews and focus groups,
      twelve weeks following completion of the interventions. Semi-structured interviews will be
      conducted, with the aim of exploring the views of participants of both interventions in order
      to enhance understanding of how these types of interventions work.

The education/advice sessions will cover topics such as pacing and goal setting and the physiotherapist will answer any queries from the participants in relation to physical activity over the course of the eight weeks. The exercise component will involve the provision of individualised exercises based on each participant's personal goals and the sessions will feature a combination of aerobic, stretching and strengthening exercise in a pool and a gym setting.</description>

    <description>Participants will attend weekly group psychology sessions for an eight-week period. Each session will be two hours in duration and will delivered by a Senior Psychologist trained in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The sessions will feature an ACT treatment process that is designed to promote psychological flexibility through various methods including acceptance and values awareness. The overall aim is to promote behaviour change, enhancing patient engagement in meaningful activities and reducing pain-avoidant behaviours. There is an emphasis on mindfulness, experiential learning and the use of metaphor which is unique to ACT.</description>
