  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 1 first-in-human (FIH) dose escalation study will determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of KO-947 in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic, relapsed
      and/or refractory, non-hematological malignancies. If an MTD cannot be identified, a
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. In addition, two tumor specific extension
      cohorts may be conducted to further characterize the safety and tolerability of KO-947 and
      provide preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity.

      This phase 1 first-in-human (FIH) dose escalation study will determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of KO-947 in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic, relapsed
      and/or refractory, non-hematological malignancies. If an MTD cannot be identified, a
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. In addition, two tumor specific extension
      cohorts may be conducted to further characterize the safety and tolerability of KO-947 and
      provide preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity. Screening evaluations will be completed
      following signing of informed consent and within 4 weeks (28 days) of Cycle 1 Day 1.
      Evaluations performed as part of the standard of care within 28 days of dosing but prior to
      consent do not need to be repeated. By signing the consent form, study subjects agree to the
      collection of standard of care health information.

      The study will consist of three parts: dose escalation, MTD expansion and tumor specific
      extension.
