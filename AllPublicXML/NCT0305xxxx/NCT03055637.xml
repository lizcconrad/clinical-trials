      Up to 6 hours before the scheduled arrival time, formula-fed babies may be given formula. Up
      to 4 hours before the scheduled arrival time, breastfed babies may nurse. Up to 2 hours
      before the scheduled arrival time, give only clear liquids. Clear liquids include water,
      Pedialyte®, Kool-Aid® and juices you can see through, such as apple or white grape juice. In
      the 2 hours before the scheduled arrival time, give nothing to eat or drink. Induction of
      general anaesthesia will be administered followed by local anaethesia. Then, Surgical
      prodecure will be done either following the conventional two flap palatoplasty technique or
      the Furlow double-opposing z-plasty technique.

    <description>* Furlow, (1986) has described a technique for palatoplasty combining the principles of mucosal lengthening with creation of an intact muscular sling in the palate with double opposing Z-plasty. On the soft palate, mirror image Z-plasties are drawn, one for the nasal musoca and the other oral flaps, the nasal flaps are developed and closed first .The oral flaps are then approximated. The defect created usually closes readily. The closure lines of the two soft plate layers do not overlap, minimizing the potential for contracture. Also, this repair permits closure of the hard palate without lateral incisions</description>
