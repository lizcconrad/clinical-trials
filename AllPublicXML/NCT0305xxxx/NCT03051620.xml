    <textblock>
      The study is a cohort study comprising 140 patients with osteoporosis stopping treatment with
      alendronate. The study will contribute with new knowledge about biochemical markers of bone
      turnover as predictors of bone loss after stopping treatment with alendronate.

    <textblock>
      Background: Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures. Alendronate reduces the risk of
      both vertebral- and hip fractures by approximately 50%. It has, however, become evident that
      long-term anti-resorptive may lead to serious side effects such as atypical femoral fractures
      or osteonecrosis of the jaw. The alendronate extension study (FLEX) showed that despite
      stopping treatment after five years the anti-fracture efficacy regarding non-vertebral and
      radiological vertebral fractures persists for an additional five years in patients with bone
      mineral density (BMD) T-score &gt; -2.5 at the femoral neck, no fractures during treatment, and
      no previous vertebral fracture. It is therefore now clinical practice, that treatment is
      discontinued after five years in patients that fulfil these criteria. Based on the
      alendronate extension study it was assumed, that bone turnover monitored by biochemical
      markers would stay suppressed for years after stopping treatment, however, other studies have
      demonstrated that there is a great variability in the change in bone turnover markers seen
      after stopping treatment with alendronate in a real-life setting.

      Aim: To investigate the predictive value of markers of bone turnover on bone loss 12 months
      after stopping alendronate therapy.

      Methods: The study is a cohort study comprising 140 patients with osteoporosis stopping
      treatment with alendronate.

      Perspectives: The study will contribute with new knowledge about biochemical markers of bone
      turnover as predictors of bone loss after stopping treatment with alendronate. It will thus
      be possible to identify patients who will experience a decrease in BMD during treatment
      break, and for this particular group of patients treatment can be re-initiated earlier so
      further loss of bone will be avoided. On the other hand, the biochemical markers of bone
      turnover could also shed light on who can tolerate treatment break, thereby avoid long-term
      treatment with alendronate, which may be associated with serious side effects. Finally, the
      use of blood samples rather than DXA will reduce the use of X-rays.
