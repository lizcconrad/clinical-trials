  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-third to one-half of patients with AML relapse and in general relapsed AML patients have
      a poor prognosis. The treatment of relapsed AML consists of induction chemotherapy followed
      by Allogenic Stem Cell Transplant (ASCT). However, at present there is no standard salvage
      chemotherapy regimen for relapsed AML, as no study has shown any one regimen to be
      significantly superior. Anthracyclines, Fludarabine, Etoposide and cytarabineare active
      agents in AMLand have been used as monotherapy and in combination in refractory and relapsed
      AML patients. According to previous studies the present CR rate of different regimens ranges
      from 50-70%. A retrospective analysis (unpublished) conducted at IRCH, AIIMS on relapsed AML
      patients treated with ADE (Cytarabine, Daunorubicin and Etoposide) chemotherapy showed the CR
      rates of approximately 70%. Therefore, we have planned this study to test the efficacy and
      toxicity of ADE induction chemotherapy in relapsed AML patients in a prospective manner.
