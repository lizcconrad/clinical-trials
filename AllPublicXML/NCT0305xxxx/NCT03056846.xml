  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of a daily supplement of
      probiotics (Lactobacillus gasseri KS-13, Bifidobacterium bifidum G9-1, Bifidobacterium longum
      MM-2) on stress-associated gastrointestinal function in university students during the time
      of semester exams.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, undergraduate students planning
      to take a fall final exam will receive a daily probiotic combination, individual probiotic,
      or placebo for 6 weeks. Questionnaires will assess gastrointestinal symptoms, immune health,
      stress and stress management, quality of life, diet, adverse events, and compliance. In a
      subset of subjects, stool samples will be collected at baseline and at week 5 of the
      intervention (the week before final exams) to characterize microbial communities.
