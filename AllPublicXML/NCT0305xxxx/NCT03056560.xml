    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an innovative video bystander program, which has the potential to be
      implemented broadly and cost-effectively across college campuses. Half of the participants
      will receive the video bystander program, and the other half will not.

    <textblock>
      Sexual violence, which includes both sexual coercion and assault, is a significant problem on
      college campuses due to its high prevalence and adverse consequences. This research will
      evaluate an innovative video bystander program, which has the potential to be implemented
      broadly and cost-effectively across college campuses. We will recruit first-year college
      students from each of 4 college campuses (Southern Methodist University, Marquette
      University, William Paterson University, and Stony Brook University).

      The video bystander program (TakeCARE) starts with a narrator acknowledging the various
      demands placed on students in attempting to balance adult responsibilities with the social
      opportunities of college, as well as the importance of keeping safe while engaging in these
      social activities. The program describes how likely it is that people they know may become a
      victim of sexual violence and how they can help &quot;take care of their friends&quot; to help prevent
      victimization. TakeCARE includes 3 video vignettes that demonstrate ways that students can
      intervene when they see sexual coercion, relationship violence, or other situations that
      might result in harm.

      After a baseline assessment, students will be randomly assigned to view one of two video
      programs: TakeCARE (the video bystander program) or a control video program. A post-treatment
      assessment will be completed within a week of viewing the video program, and follow-up
      assessments will be completed 2 months and 6 months after baseline.
