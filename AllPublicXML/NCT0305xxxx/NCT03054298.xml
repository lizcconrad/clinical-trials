      Phase I study to establish safety and feasibility of intravenous or intrapleural administered
      lentiviral transduced huCART-meso cells with or without lymphodepletion. Intravenous
      administration of huCART-meso cells is planned with or without cyclophosphamide as
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells in 5 cohorts with and without cyclophosphamide in a 3+3 dose escalation
      design.

      Cohort 1 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x107 /m2 lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

      Cohort 2 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x107 /m2 lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 grams/m2 of cyclophosphamide
      administered 2-4 days prior to huCART-meso cells (day - 4 to day -2).

      Cohort 3 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x108 /m2 lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

      Cohort 4 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x108 /m2 lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m2 of cyclophosphamide
      administered 2-4 days prior to huCART-meso cells (day -4 to day -2).

      Cohort 5 subjects (N=up to 6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x107 /m2 lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells on day 0 by intrapleural infusion (IP) through an indwelling pleural
      catheter without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen. Subjects in this cohort will be
      enrolled after safety is demonstrated at this dose level by completion of Cohorts 1 and 2.

      Subjects in Cohort 5 may be enrolled in parallel to Cohorts 3 and 4.

      The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 0-1 DLT occurs in 6
      evaluable subjects tested within the dose range of this study. In order to gather additional
      data for the MTD dose level, the respective cohorts (both with and without lymphodepletion)
      may be expanded to treat up to 6 evaluable subjects.

      Adverse events will be collected and evaluated during the protocol specified adverse event
      reporting period.

             institutional guidance.

          -  Patients requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.

          -  Prior therapy with lentiviral gene modified cells.

          -  Any clinically significant pericardial effusion, Class II-IV cardiovascular disability
             according to the New York Heard Association Classification (see Appendix 2) or other
             cardiovascular condition that would preclude assessment of mesothelin induced
             pericarditis or that may worsen as a result of toxicities expected for this study.
             This determination will be made by a cardiologist if cardiac issues are suspected.

          -  Any clinically significant pleural or peritoneal effusion that cannot be drained with
             standard approaches. An indwelling drainage device placed prior to enrollment is
