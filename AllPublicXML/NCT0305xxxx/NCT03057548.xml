  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study it to learn whether pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) along with
      ablation of the posterior left atrial wall (PLAW) will reduce the likelihood of atrial
      fibrillation (AF) recurrence in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent AF one
      year after an ablation procedure in comparison to a PVI ablation procedure, alone.

      The investigator hypothesizes that the combination of PVI plus PLAW isolation will result in
      a reduction in recurrence of atrial arrhythmias at one year after ablation.

      Patients with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation will be enrolled in
      this study. All patients are required to be in atrial fibrillation (AF) on the day of the
      ablation procedure. After ablation (isolation) of the pulmonary veins (PVI) is complete, and
      while still in the electrophysiology lab, all patients are randomized to either PVI, alone
      [Group 1] or the combination of PVI plus ablation of the posterior left atrial wall (PLAW)
      [Group 2]. For those patients randomized to PVI, their ablation procedure is complete at this
      time. For those patients randomized to PVI plus PLAW, they will have the additional ablation
      to the posterior left atrial wall performed.

      All study patients have the same follow-up after their ablation procedure: clinic visits at
      3, 6, and 13 months; a heart event monitor is worn for 7-14 days before these visits. An
      echocardiogram is done at 4-6 months after the ablation procedure. Blood thinners are usually
      recommended for three months after the ablation procedure and then the need for continued use
      of blood thinners will be based on individual patient's medical history, stroke risk and the
      judgement of their study doctor. Information about patient's medical history, heart
      arrhythmias, and atrial fibrillation will be collected during the study. This information
      will be analyzed as part of the study.
