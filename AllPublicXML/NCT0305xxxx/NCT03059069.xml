      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Gliatamin (chonline alphoscerate) on
      depressive mood in type 2 diabetes patients and demonstrate the impact of improved depressive
      mood could be influence the patient's quality of life and glycemic control.

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of depressive disorder is higher in individuals with chronic diseases, and the
      screening and management of depression is emphasized. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a class of
      chronic disease and the incidence of DM has been increasing. According to previous study,
      31.1% of patients with DM accompanied with depressive disorders which was higher than that of
      subjects without DM. Furthermore, DM as well as depression is known for risk factor for
      dementia.

      The choline metabolism involves in neuropathology of depressive disorders and individuals
      with depressive disorders showed the lower level of choline concentration. Choline
      alphoscerate is cholinergic precursor and showed the favorable clinical results in dementia
      management.

      As pseudodementia can be presented as depressive disorder and choline alphoscerate would be
      an option for these cases. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of
      Gliatamin (chonline alphoscerate) on depressive mood in type 2 diabetes patients and
      demonstrate the impact of improved depressive mood could be influence the patient's quality
      of life and glycemic control.
