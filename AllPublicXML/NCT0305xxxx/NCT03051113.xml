  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromas are frequent after trauma and surgery, including amputation and can be identified by
      high-resolution ultrasound. The role of neuromas as the cause of neuropathic pain is
      uncertain. In this observational cohort study, the investigators wish to explore if the
      prevalence of neuromas are higher in patients with pain after peripheral nerve injury and
      amputation, than in patients with the same conditions but without pain.
