  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an observational, prospective trial that will measure the cerebral
      oxygenation of infants scheduled to undergo general anesthesia at Boston Children's Hospital.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data will be collected from the Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitor and the patient's
      medical record. When the NIRS sensor is attached to the patient's forehead the oxygenation of
      brain tissue will be continuously monitored. All other information will be routinely recorded
      as standard clinical care and this information will be obtained from the patient's medical
      record. The NIRS monitor data will by time synched to the anesthesia record and downloaded to
      a secured password protected file.

      In the post-operative period, patient data will be collected including: 1) any skin findings
      related to the placement of the NIRS or pulse oximetry probes 2) any unanticipated need for
      hemodynamic support, 3) laboratory values including hemoglobin levels, electrolytes, and
      blood gases, 4) new neurological findings (seizures etc.)
