    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the intratumoral administration of escalating doses of a novel,
      experimental drug, INT230-6. The study is being conducted in patients with several types of
      refractory cancers including those at the surface of the skin (melanoma, head and neck,
      lymphoma, breast) and tumors within the body such (pancreatic, colon, liver, lung, etc.).
      Sponsor also plans to test INT230-6 in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      INT230-6 is comprised of a 3 agents in a fixed ratio - a cell permeation enhancer and two,
      potent anti-cancer payloads (cisplatin and vinblastine sulfate). The penetration enhancer
      facilitates dispersion of the two drugs throughout injected tumors and enables increased
      diffusion into cancer cells. (Nonclinical safety studies showed no findings following drug
      injection into healthy tissues.)

      Historically physicians administer the two active drugs comprising INT230-6 by intravenous
      (IV) infusion to achieve a systemic blood level at the limit of tolerability. The objective
      is destroy both visible tumors and unseen circulating cancer cells (micro-metastases).
      Unfortunately, dosing drugs IV delivers only a small amount with a low concentration at the
      tumor site. This approach especially for late stage cancers is not highly effective and often
      quite toxic to the patient.

      Attempts at direct intratumoral injection with chemotherapeutic agents have not shown the
      ability to treat the injected tumor, non-injected tumors or micro-metastases. This lack of
      efficacy for local administration is due possibly to poor dispersion and a lack of cell
      uptake of the agents.

      Due to the use of the novel cell penetration enhancing agent INT230-6 treatment demonstrates
      strong efficacy in animals having large tumors. The Sponsor's in vivo, non-clinical data
      shows that INT230-6 thoroughly saturates and kills injected tumors. In addition, the drug
      induces an adaptive (T-cell mediated) immune response that attacks not only the injected
      tumor, but non-injected tumors and unseen micro-metastases. Cured animals become permanently
      immunized against the type of cancer that INT230-6 eliminates.

      Clinical trial IT-01 will thus seek to determine the safety and potential efficacy of dosing
      INT230-6 directly into several different types of cancers. In addition animal studies showed
      a strong synergy of INT230-6 with immune modulation agents. Thus as part of study IT-01 the
      Sponsor will seek to understand the safety and efficacy of INT230-6 when administered in
      combination with immuno-therapeutic agents such as antibodies that target Programmed Cell
      Death (PD-1 or anti-PD-1) receptors.

      This study seek to understand whether tumor regression can be achieved and patient outcomes
      improved.

    <intervention_model_description>There are up to 9 cohorts of subjects in the escalation portion of the protocol. The first is a superficial tumor cohort with a low tumor load (1:4 ratio of drug to tumor). The 2nd,3rd and 4th cohorts are in superficial and deep tumors that escalates the total dose and maximal dose per any one tumor. Cohort 5/6/7 will explore a higher drug load (1:2 ratio) and will escalate the total dose and maximal dose per any one tumor. The 8th cohort is reserved for combinations with anti-PD1 agent(s). The 9th optional cohort will be added if a more frequent schedule would be deemed beneficial.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple intratumoral doses of INT230-6 in subjects with advanced or recurrent malignancies. This will be assessed by the rate of ≥ grade 3 AE's attributed to INT230-6 and not the underlying disease.
All recorded adverse events will be listed and tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and dose and coded according to the most current version of MedDRA. The incidence of adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance.
Adverse Events will be summarized for all reported data and by study period: a) up to and including 28 days post last dose of initial treatment, and b) from first dose of re-initiation of treatment, for subjects who re-initiate study therapy while in follow-up, up to 28 days post-dose of the last re-treatment dose.</description>

    <description>INT230-6 is clear sterile solution administered by injection directly into the tumor to be treated.
The product contains a cell permeation agent with cisplatin and vinblastine sulfate at fixed concentrations.
The drug is stored frozen and must be dosed at room temperature.
Escalation of the drug dose and number of injected tumors is possible in subsequent treatment sessions.
The drug dose to be administered is set by the tumor volume of the target lesions - not the subject's body surface area</description>
