    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify the following in adult epilepsy participants with
      partial-onset seizures (with or without secondary generalized seizures) or primary
      generalized Tonic-clonic seizures who receive long-term treatment with Fycompa:

        1. unknown adverse drug reactions (ADRs);

        2. occurrence of ADRs;

        3. factors that are likely to affect safety and efficacy;

        4. occurrence of dizziness, balance disorders, ataxia, muscle relaxation-related adverse
           events, and falls as priority investigation items;

        5. occurrence of psychiatric adverse events as priority investigation items (eg,
           aggression).

    <description>The usual oral dosage for adults and children 12 years of age or older is initially 2 milligrams (mg) once daily as perampanel at bedtime, and the daily dose may then be increased by 2 mg at intervals of 1 week or longer. The maintenance dose is 8 mg once daily in the absence of concomitant antiepileptic drugs that accelerate the metabolism of this product, or 8 to 12 mg once daily in the presence of such concomitant drugs. The dosage may be increased or decreased as necessary by 2 mg at intervals of 1 week or longer depending on symptoms, but the maximum daily dose should not be over 12 mg.</description>
