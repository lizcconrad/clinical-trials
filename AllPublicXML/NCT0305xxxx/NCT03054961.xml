  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to describe the relationship of regional cerebral oximetry
      and cytoximetry, measured using near-infrared spectroscopy, with seizure activity in the
      periictal period in children with epilepsy.

    <textblock>
      Pediatric subjects with partial (focal) epilepsy seizure disorders who are being admitted to
      the epilepsy monitoring unit will be studied using near-infrared spectroscopy for cytochrome
      c oxidase (CCO) redox state and blood oxygen saturation. Along with routine EEG monitoring, a
      set of light sensors, called optodes, attached to a net that goes over the head will be put
      on. These optodes will send out very weak red light signals, which will pass through the
      scalp and bounce back to detectors on the netting. The changes in the light signals will be
      used to calculate the changes in the various forms of the enzyme CCO, as well as the amount
      of oxygen in the blood. We hope to use these measurements to study changes in blood flow and
      cellular energy usage in the brain during seizures, which might help us to understand
      epilepsy better in the future and design better treatments.

        Study subjects will include pediatric patients from birth to 18 years of age with a known
        seizure disorder who are being admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) or the ICU

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Study subjects will include pediatric patients from birth to 18 years of age with a known
        seizure disorder who are being admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) or the ICU
        for further workup or medication management of their epilepsy. Subject will be eligible for
        the study if:

          1. they have a diagnosis of partial (focal) epilepsy

          2. standard of care long- term EEG monitoring is planned

          3. during the past 3 days to 1 week prior to EMU admission, have had an average of at
             least one seizure per day at time of admission to EMU.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. history of unrepaired or palliated congenital cyanotic heart disease

          2. history of traumatic head injury to the extent that precludes safe and consistent
             placement of NIRS-EEG probes.

          3. diagnosis of Primary generalized epilepsy

          4. Allergy or sensitivity to tape or adhesives

          5. Guardian or patient do not give consent/assent to participate in the study

          6. Clinical care provider or investigator determines the patient is not appropriate
             candidate for the study
