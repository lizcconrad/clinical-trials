  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main study objective is to assess the content validity and the psychometric
      characteristics of the Insomnia Daytime Symptoms and Impacts Questionnaire™ (IDSIQ™).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zolpidem will be used as an active intervention to assess the sensitivity to change of IDSIQ™
      in patients suffering from insomnia disorder.

      IDSIQ™ will be administered during the screening period (within 14 days before enrollment in
      the study) and the treatment period (from Day 1 to Day 14). End of study (phone call) will
      take place 30-37 days after the end-of-treatment.
