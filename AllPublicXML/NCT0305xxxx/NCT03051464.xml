      A randomized study of 40 patients. Patients with a clinical T2-3 N0 rectal cancer will be
      randomized to two arms (arm A: standard chemoradiation (45 Gy in 25 with concomitant 5-FU or
      Xeloda chemotherapy) and an external beam boost of 9 Gy compared to arm B: standard
      chemoradiation (45 Gy in 25 with concomitant 5-FU or Xeloda chemotherapy) and followed by a
      brachytherapy boost of 30 Gy in 3 fractions).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is becoming clear that there is a now an international consensus that rectal cancer
      research efforts need to be more focused in optimizing a non-surgical approach. This concept
      is very relevant to an ageing patient population with multiple co-morbidities regularly seen
      at the Jewish General Hospital and across the province. We are therefore proposing a pilot
      study of 40 patients to compare the two best known radiation dose escalation strategies and
      to achieve a complete clinical response. Patients with a clinical T2-3 N0-1 rectal cancer
      will be randomized to two arms (arm A: standard chemoradiation (45 Gy in 25 with concomitant
      5-FU or Xeloda chemotherapy) and an external beam boost of 9 Gy compared to arm B: standard
      chemoradiation (45 Gy in 25 with concomitant 5-FU or Xeloda chemotherapy) and followed by a
      brachytherapy boost of 30 Gy in 3 fractions). Patients that have a high risk of recurrence or
      with more advanced stages of the disease will be excluded from the study, as only the local
      disease is being treated. The primary outcome for this proposal is rectum preservation in
      treated patients.
