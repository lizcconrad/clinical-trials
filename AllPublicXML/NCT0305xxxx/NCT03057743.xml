    <textblock>
      Pilot study using [18F]ISO-1 PET/CT to image sigma-2 receptor binding in metastatic breast
      cancer. Correlate baseline uptake and change in uptake after therapy with time to progression
      and standard and experimental pathology assays of biopsy or surgical tissue. The target
      population is up to 30 adult patients at least 18 years, with at least one site of disease
      outside the liver by at least one type of standard imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Biopsy proven or clinically documented metastatic breast cancer with at least one
             lesion outside the liver by standard imaging (e.g. CT, MRI, Bone Scan, Ultrasound, FDG
             PET/CT)

          -  Plan to start new systemic therapy for metastatic disease.

          -  Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and be
             willing to provide written informed consent and participate in this study in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior to study-specific
             procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant at the time of screening will not be eligible for this study,
             urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed in women of child-bearing potential at
             the time of screening.

          -  Inability to tolerate imaging procedure in the opinion of an investigator or treating
             physician.

          -  Serious or unstable medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the
