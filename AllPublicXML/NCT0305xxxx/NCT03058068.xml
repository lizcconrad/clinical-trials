      A Safety Run-In will be followed by a Double-Blinded Randomized Phase. All subjects shall
      meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and will be evaluated prior to the scheduled infusion
      to establish baseline.

      There will be 3 subjects in the safety run-in phase and 15 subjects in the double-blinded
      phase.

      Primary objective is to demonstrate the safety of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) intravenously
      administered to subjects with cystic fibrosis.

      Secondary Objective is to explore if MSCs can improve the symptoms of cystic fibrosis,
      including lung function, the rate of pulmonary exacerbation, systemic and local inflammation
      and symptom-related quality of life.

      The Safety Run-In will be performed to evaluate the safety of MSC infusion into subjects with
      cystic fibrosis. 3 subjects will participate and they will receive a single administration of
      allogeneic MSCs given through intravenous infusion.

      In the randomized phase the subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1:1 into 3 cohorts to
      receive infusions. There will be a total of 15 subjects in 3 cohorts.

      The total duration for each subject after infusion is 12 months, plus up to an additional 2
      months for the Screening and Baseline Visits. Approximately 9 visits in total.
