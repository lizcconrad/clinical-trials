    <textblock>
      This study was conducted on 24 patients who have ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, underwent
      non cardiac surgery in the lower half of the body under the effect of combined spinal
      epidural anesthesia at Assiut university hospital. Intraoperative Hemodynamic monitoring
      including invasive blood pressure, heart rate, and CVP was established, in addition to pre
      and postoperative, 12 lead ECG, echocardiography, and venous sampling for Brain natriuretic
      peptide measurement were done .

      This study tried to assess the safety of this anesthetic technique on such group of cardiac
      patients along over the hospital stay period and up to 6 months postoperatively, in addition
      to the predictability of Brain natriuretic peptide as a cardiac biomarker regarding to the
      major adverse cardiac events and cardiac mortality for these group of patients .

    <textblock>
      Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by ventricular dilatation and impaired systolic
      cardiac function. Anesthetic management, of patients with cardiomyopathy with reduced
      systolic function, is challenging and may be associated with high mortality.

      Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of combined
      spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, underwent vascular
      surgery in the lower half of the body, in addition to assess the safety of this anesthetic
      technique in the early postoperative period.

      Method: After approval by local research ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, and
      informed written consent obtained from all patients, 24 patients having dilated
      cardiomyopathy, subjected to vascular surgery in the lower half of the body under CSEA. The
      effects of CSEA on hemodynamics; IBP, HR and CVP (measured at base line and then every 10
      min), in addition to cardiac complications during the hospital stay period were studied.
