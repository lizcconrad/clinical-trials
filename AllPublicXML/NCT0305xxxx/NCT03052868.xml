  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data for this study will be obtained from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
      Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Participants will be recruited through Simmons Cancer
      Center. One hundred female breast cancer patients who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy
      will be enrolled. In order to reach this number, it is estimated that up to 125 eligible
      participants will need to be recruited. The study will last approximately two years.
      Participants will undergo one cognitive testing session, and each subject's total
      participation time will last no more than two hours.

      The study visit will be scheduled for three to six months after completing adjuvant
      chemotherapy treatment. At the study visit, informed consent will be obtained and
      neurocognitive attention testing will be performed. The assessments chosen were carefully
      selected based on breadth, psychometric properties, standardized broad clinical use, good
      external validity and time efficiency. The testing time for the battery of neuropsychological
      tests is approximately 45-60 minutes. Participants will also be asked to complete a packet of
      several questionnaires including several self-rated measures of mood and quality of life, in
      addition to a brief questionnaire to obtain information about exercise, sleep, and education
      and employment backgrounds. It is estimated that questionnaire completion will require no
      more than 30 minutes. Participants will be seen on only one occasion, and may receive, upon
      request, written feedback about the results of the evaluation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women;

          -  diagnosed with breast cancer Stages I-IV; and

          -  completed a treatment regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy three to six months prior to
             evaluation.

        Patients may be receiving anti-hormonal treatment. All subjects will be native speakers of
        English who have a minimum of a high school education (or GED equivalent) in order to
        ensure the validity of the neuropsychological tests that will be administered. In order to
        limit age effects, participants will be between the ages of 40 and 70 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a previous history of stroke, head injury with loss of consciousness
             greater than 30 minutes, major surgeries within the past 6 months unrelated to their
             breast cancer treatment, pre-cancer major Axis I psychiatric disorder, diagnosis of
             adult Attention Deficit Disorder, or other pre-existing disorder with known cognitive
             impairments (e.g. dementia, intellectual disability) will be excluded.

          -  Non- English speakers and subjects under the age of 40 or over the age of 70 will not
             be included.
