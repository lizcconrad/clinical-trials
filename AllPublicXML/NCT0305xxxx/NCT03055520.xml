  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized placebo-controlled trial of arithmetic training (with the Kumon Method) as an
      errorless learning method for improvement of cognition in schizophrenia. Outpatients were
      included after signing an informed consent. The trial consisted of 48 sessions of arithmetic
      training (twice a week, for 6 months) or placebo (nonspecific recreation, 48 sessions). The
      patients were evaluated with a neuropsychological battery at baseline, after 6 months (end of
      intervention) and after 12 months after baseline. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
      (PANSS) and the Personal and Social Performance scale (PSP) were applied at baseline, after 6
      months (end of intervention) and 12 months after baseline. Primary outcome was the
      performance on three cognitive domains (attention, executive functions and working memory).

    <description>The Kumon method (www.kumon.com) of arithmetic calculation employs the errorless-learning (EL) strategy and consists of a structured, hierarchical series of exercises, beginning with simple ones (e.g. addition and subtraction) and then proceeding to more complex exercises (e.g. advanced algebra, calculus).</description>
