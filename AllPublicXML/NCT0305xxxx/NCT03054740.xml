  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if by offering a vapocoolant (cold spray)
      to hospital outpatients prior to an intravenous catheter (IV) insertion will increase patient
      satisfaction of IV insertion as well as determine if pain of insertion is decreased.

      This is a single blind interventional study with a post design using a convenience sample of
      patients undergoing a Nuclear Medicine Stress Test. The patient selection and intervention
      will be randomized in order to ensure a high validity study. The interventional treatment
      used will be a ethyl chloride mist spray manufactured by the Gebauer Company. The placebo
      spray that will be used is manufactured by BioLogic Aqua Research Technologies International
      Inc. The spray is called Nature's Tears Mist and is a sterile water. The patient's for this
      study are required to have intravenous cannulation (IV) access. This is a painful and
      invasive procedure in which a vapocoolant may confer benefit for the relief of pain.
