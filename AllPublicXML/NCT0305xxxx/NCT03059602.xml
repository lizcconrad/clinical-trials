    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the biopsychosocial impact of caregivers in patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, and cervical/thoracic/lumbar
      spine surgery.Defining such impacts may offer opportunities to enhance caregiver capability
      to provide care following surgery on a loved one.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study with the goal of enrolling 50 caregivers in each surgical
      subgroup, with a total of 150 subjects. Caregivers for patients undergoing the above
      surgeries will be administered Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System
      (PROMIS) measures preoperatively, 7 days postoperatively, 14 days postoperatively, and 1
      month postoperatively. PROMIS item banks will include Global Health, Anxiety, Fatigue,
      Depression, Self Efficacy, Social Satisfaction, and Sleep Disturbance. If the caregiver
      reports the presence of persistent pain, Pain Interference and Physical Function will be
      administered.
