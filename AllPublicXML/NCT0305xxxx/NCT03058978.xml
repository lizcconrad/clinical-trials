  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate how the ovaries may be functioning while using the the
      Implanon®/Nexplanon® during the three years beyond the FDA approved duration. Ovarian
      function will be assessed with weekly serum progesterone levels. Participants will undergo
      weekly venipuncture for a total of four draws. Participants will be followed for 30 days.

      This prospective cohort will evaluate the ovarian function of 210 ENG users during the three
      years beyond the FDA approved duration. Participants enrolled in the current study, EPIC
      (Evaluating the Prolonged Use of IUD and Implant for Contraception, NCT02267616), will be
      contacted via telephone, screened and scheduled to enroll in person. After the signed consent
      is obtained participants will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire on demographic
      information and bleeding patterns. Participants will undergo a blood draw to assess serum
      etonogestrel and serum progesterone levels.

      Follow up visits will include a weekly blood draw for three weeks to assess serum
      progesterone levels. Participants will also complete a bleeding diary to assess daily
      bleeding patterns for the 30 day study period.

      The investigators will enroll participants at seven time points; at method expiration (3
      years of use), and in six-month intervals through six years of use.
