  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to analyze patient:provider communication surrounding the
      discussion of difficult clinical conversations such as knee replacement options. This study
      will also examine how using the teach-back communication technique can improve communication
      between patients and providers. Orthopedic residents, fellows, physician assistants, and
      attendings that agree to participate will be consented. Patients, who are likely to engage in
      a difficult clinical conversation, such as those who have a clinical indication for a Total
      Knee Replacement or a Partial Knee Replacement, will be recruited from participating
      providers clinical schedules. Patient:provider interactions will be recorded and then the
      providers will attend a 1 hour education lecture about how to use teach-back. After attending
      the lecture, additional patient:provider interactions will be recorded and analyzed via a
      qualitative approach. Additionally, providers will participate in a semi-structured interview
      to capture their perceptions of teach-back and what challenges and benefits they may derive
      from using it.
