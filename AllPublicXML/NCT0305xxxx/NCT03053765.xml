  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to develop and validate an instrument to measure quality and adherence
      to IPT for research and training purposes. The measure is now being used to evaluate training
      in IPT.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized trial comparing 4 different methods of follow-up training in IPT.
      Following initial 2-day training, participant therapists will be randomized to either
      individual supervision, group supervision, an internet-based training program, or
      autodidactic training. Participants will be followed for a year to determine their use of
      IPT, outcomes with patients, and adherence and quality of IPT in 4 case portfolios. The
      adherence measure for IPT developed in Phase I of the project is being used as the gold
      standard measure of IPT fidelity.
