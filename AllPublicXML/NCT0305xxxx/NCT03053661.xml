      The IRECT trial is a non-interventional, prospective clinical trial using modern immune
      monitoring techniques over the course of the standard of care for HNSCC. The dynamics of
      host/tumor immune interactions during the conventional standard treatment will be analyzed to
      find the most promising target antigen and to develop a strategy how and when specific
      immunotherapy should be added to the current treatment schedule.

      The results from this trial will help to understand how state of the art treatment can be
      complemented using cancer-testis antigen specific vaccines and immune-modulating drugs to
      improve the outcome of head and neck cancer patients.
