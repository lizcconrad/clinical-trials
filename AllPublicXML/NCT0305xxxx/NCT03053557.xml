  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test a new device called the Social Skills Coach that is being created to
      help mental health consumers with social skills and community functioning. People diagnosed
      with schizophrenia and clinicians will be included as participants in this study. Mental
      health consumers (diagnosed with schizophrenia) will be randomly assigned to either test the
      new device or to participate in a social skills training course. Data will be collected from
      participants through surveys before participants either use the device or participate the
      course and afterwards. Individual interviews will be conducted with a sub sample of mental
      health consumers and clinicians. The study looks to test the credibility and acceptability of
      the new device to help mental health consumers and clinicians. it will also influence future
      research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I pilot study tests the feasibility, credibility, and acceptability of the
      prototype version of Social Skills Coach in terms of its use among mental health consumers
      and clinicians. The intervention aims to improve social and daily living skills and community
      functioning among people diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. A mixed methods
      approach will be taken to collect quantitative data at baseline and follow-up. Quantitative
      data collection includes the use of surveys that comprise validated instruments. Qualitative
      data collection will occur at the end of the study and will include the use of
      semi-structured interviews to capture experiential information. Study participants will be
      randomly assigned to either a social skills training course (control group) or to a study arm
      using the Social Skills Coach program (treatment group). The study aims to demonstrate proof
      of concept for a larger effectiveness trial.
