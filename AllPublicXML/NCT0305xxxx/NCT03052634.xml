    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from the first day of study treatment (Day 1) to first documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. If a patient did not experience disease progression or die, PFS was censored at the day of the last tumor assessment that a patient was known to be progression free.</description>
