      Investigators try to assess the safety of 6-months or 12-months maintenance of dual
      antiplatelet therapy (DAPT, aspirin + clopidogrel) in patients undergoing percutaneous
      coronary intervention using the Zotarolimus-eluting, Resolute Integrity™ stent (Medtronic
      Vascular Inc, Santa Rosa, CA) or the BioMatrix™ stent (Biosensors. Singapore).

    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has proven the most effective treatment in reducing
      thrombotic complications after drug eluting stent (DES) implantation. Although the optimal
      duration of antiplatelet therapy is still under investigation, late stent thrombosis (ST)
      with DES has pushed the recommendation for duration of clopidogrel therapy for one year or
      more, in patients without risks for bleeding. However, recent controversies regarding the
      risk of stent thrombosis in patients receiving DES has brought up the issue of the
      appropriate duration of antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention, and a
      recent study reported that the use of extended DAPT for a period longer than 12 months in
      patients who had received DES was not significantly more effective than aspirin monotherapy
      in reducing the rate of myocardial infarction (MI) or death for cardiac causes.

      Zotarolimus-eluting stent (Resolute Integrity™) and biolimus-eluting stent with biodegradable
      polymer system (BioMatrix™) share several similarities. Both stents are flexible thin strut
      stents eluting sirolimus-analogue drugs targeting at mammalian target of rapamycin. The
      advantages that Resolute Integrity™ stent strut is quite thin and coated with highly
      biocompatible polymer and BioMatrix™ stent has the abluminal drug coating system with
      biodegradable polymer might provide clinical studies showing that both stents are quite safe
      as well as efficacious. Moreover, recent report showed that continuation of clopidogrel for
      only 3 months after implantation of Endeavor stent seems to be safe in low-to-moderate
      coronary artery risk group. Based on these clinical evidences, the duration of DAPT
      continuation for 12 months or less after implantation of Resolute Integrity™ or BioMatrix™
      stent, 'the second generation DES', would be safe, however, there are no data available about
      this. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the safety of 6-months or 12-months
      maintenance of DAPT in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using
      Resolute Integrity™ or BioMatrix™ stent.

    <description>Cardiac death: Any death due to proximate cardiac cause (eg, MI, low-output failure, fatal arrhythmia), unwitnessed death and death of unknown cause, and all procedure-related deaths, including those related to concomitant treatment, will be classified as cardiac death.
MI Classification and Criteria for Diagnosis is defined by the Academic Research Consortium
TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or bypass surgery of the target vessel performed for restenosis or other complication of the target lesion. All TLRs should be classified prospectively as clinically indicated* or not clinically indicated by the investigator prior to repeat angiography. An independent angiographic core laboratory should verify that the severity of percent diameter stenosis meets requirements for clinical indication and will overrule in cases where investigator reports are not in agreement.</description>
