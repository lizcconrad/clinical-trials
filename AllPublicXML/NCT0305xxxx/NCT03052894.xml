  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the accuracy of a hydraulically coupled twitch
      monitor compared to the EMG twitch monitor in current use to measure the extent of
      neuromuscular blockade in patients undergoing general anesthesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis) is necessary for many surgical procedures to provide
      optimal surgical conditions. The extent of paralysis typically assessed during routine
      clinical care by examining the muscle response of the thumb (&quot;twitch&quot;) following delivery of
      a series of the &quot;train-of-four&quot;.

      Quantitative assessment of neuromuscular block can be assessed using electromyography (EMG)
      This technique measures action potential in the muscles of the thumb.

      The proposed method is a simple technique that can constructed with equipment that is readily
      available in most operating rooms. If validated, it would provide a simple method to assess
      quantitatively the extent of neuromuscular blockade and recovery of muscle strength.
