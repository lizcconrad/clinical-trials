      Investigator-initiated study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prostate artery
      embolization for the treatment lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with benign prostatic
      hyperplasia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II, single center, prospective, single arm, investigational study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of prostate artery embolization (PAE) for treatment of
      severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in
      patients that have either failed or are intolerant to medical management. Once eligibility is
      confirmed, patients will undergo PAE with Embosphere Microspheres. Embolization will consist
      of a minimally invasive angiogram and treatment of the prostate arteries with the Embosphere
      particles to reduce blood flow to the prostate. Following treatment, patients will return for
      follow-up visits at 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post PAE.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Prostate volume between 40 and 300 cm3

          2. Diagnosis of BPH with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) defined
             as at least one of the following:

               -  a. IPSS greater than 18

               -  b. IPSS Quality of Life (QoL) assessment greater than 3

               -  c. Qmax less than 12 mL/sec

          3. Refractory or intolerant to medical management

          4. Ineligibility for or refusal of surgical management

          5. One of the following criteria:

               -  a. Baseline prostate specific antigen (PSA) ≤2.5 ng/mL

               -  b. Baseline PSA &gt;2.5 ng/mL and ≤10 ng/mL AND free PSA ≥25% of total PSA

               -  c. Baseline PSA &gt;2.5 ng/mL and ≤10 ng/mL AND free PSA &lt;25% of total PSA AND
                  negative 12 core prostate biopsy in the past 12 months

               -  d. Baseline PSA &gt;10 ng/mL AND negative 12 core biopsy within the past 12 months.
