  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to enroll approximately 450 subjects to see if a behavioral
      weight management program is successful in helping military female personnel who are pregnant
      or post-partum to manage their weight during and after their pregnancy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will randomize 450 consented participants to 1 of 3 interventions: a) a
      gestational weight gain intervention (GWG-only); b) a postpartum weight loss intervention
      (PPWL-only), or c) a combined gestational weight gain and postpartum weight loss intervention
      (GWG+PPWL) to determine the efficacy of the interventions on GWG as well as PPWL.

      Procedures: Interested individuals will be directed to call the study telephone number to
      learn more and determine whether eligibility criteria is met. Individuals who meet the
      telephone screening eligibility criteria will be invited to schedule a Screening Visit,
      during which written informed consent will be obtained. At this visit, eligibility will be
      assessed and measures will be administrated. The potential participant will also be asked to
      complete a one-week dietary and exercise self-monitoring run-in and receive medical clearance
      from their obstetrician to participate. Should she continue to be interested, she will return
      for a Baseline Visit and will be randomized.

      Randomized participants will have 5 in person scheduled visits after their Screening Visit
      and Baseline Visit to the Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center (WHASC) or San Antonio
      Military Medical Center (SAMMC) Obstetrics (OB) clinic. These visits will be scheduled at
      gestational week 32, 36, as well as at 6- weeks, 6-months, and 12- month postpartum. At these
      visits, physical measurements will be collected and participants will complete various
      questionnaires.

    <description>At all measurement visits, weight will be recorded in kilograms. Weight will be measured on a calibrated digital scale in duplicate, with the participant wearing light clothing and no shoes. While Investigators obtain the mother's weight at baseline, there will also be a self reported pregravid weight (before the last menstrual period).</description>

    <description>Program satisfaction will be assessed using the Investigators program evaluation form to offer insight into program acceptability as well as barriers and facilitators to participation in each intervention arm. Participants will be given 10 statements to rate their experience using a 5 point scale of 1 being not at all and 5 being extremely. In addition, there will be four qualitative questions where the participant can provide feedback.</description>
