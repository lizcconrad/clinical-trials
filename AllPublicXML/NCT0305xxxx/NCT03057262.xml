  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intra-articular temporomandibular disorders are often related to pain in the area of
      temporomandibular joint, ear and temple. The aim of the study was to investigate the
      efficiency of anterior repositioning splints for the management of pain related to
      temporomandibular joint disc displacement with reduction.

      The research material consisted of 112 patients, aged 24 to 45 years, of both genders, who
      reported to the treatment in Consulting Room of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunctions at the
      Jagiellonian University in Cracow, between 2014-2016, due to the pain and clicking of
      temporomandibular joints with comorbid hypertension of masticatory muscles. Subjects were
      examined according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders protocol and
      after inclusion with painful disc displacement with reduction and masticatory muscle
      contracture assigned randomly to the study or control group (56 patients in each). In the
      study group was used the anterior repositioning splint on the lower arch for 20 hour usage
      per 4 months. In the control group a non-invasive therapy was applied using biostimulation
      laser in the form of 12 session, performed every second day, on the area of the
      temporomandibular joints with opened mouth and performing muscles self-exercises with a
      dominant protrusive position of the mandible. Pain intensity was evaluated using verbal
      numerical rating scale (VNRS) immediately before the treatment and then after 4 and 16 weeks.
      The obtained data were analyzed using U Mann-Whitney test (p â‰¤ 0,005).

    <description>Study group consisted of 56 subjects of both genders with unilateral or bilateral disc displacement(s) with reduction and pain in the area of temporomandibular joint. Patients were recruited from the Consulting Room of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow during the years 2014-2016. In the study group was used the typical acrylic anterior repositioning splint fabricated in tete-a-tete (incisal) jaws position, covered the lower teeth arch to recapture a displaced disc(s) and decrease the intensity of pain. The anterior repositioning splint was recommended to 20 - hour use for a period of four months.</description>

Patients were recruited from the Consulting Room of Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow during the years 2014-2016. In the control group the investigators used the biostymulation laser (Terapus 2, Accuro, Poland), wave length 808 nm, power 32 J in the form of 12 session (duration of a single session was 3 min 45 s), performed every second day, on the area of the both temporomandibular joints (distance to the skin was 1 cm) with opened mouth and systematic performing of muscles self-exercises with a dominant protrusive position of mandible.</description>
