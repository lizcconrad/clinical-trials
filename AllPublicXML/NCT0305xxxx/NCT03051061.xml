    <textblock>
      The optimal antithrombotic treatment for Coronary Heart disease (CHD) patients combined with
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is unresolved at present. Although the European and American
      guidelines have given a hand for us, there is absence of real-world data on the safety and
      efficacy of antithrombotic therapy in Asian populations. Only a few clinical trials are
      available to guide difficult decision on antithrombotic therapy in patients with combined AF
      and CHD，the investigators highlight the need for the rapid development of clinical trials to
      close the large gaps in evidence. This research aims to know the real-world use of
      antithrombotic treatment and clinical prognosis in Coronary Heart Disease patients
      complicated with Atrial Fibrillation.

      1. Our study is an observational, retrospective Study.

        2. Key date elements and definition of each variable were in line with the American Heart
           Association(AHA)/European Society of Cardiology(ECS） recommendation on AF and CHD. To
           reflect the contemporary antithrombotic management of AF and CHD in the past five years,
           the following data were collected: basic socio-demographic information, symptoms and
           signs relating to AF, medical history, results of physical examination and laboratory
           test.

        3. Follow-up time is at least 12 months. The patients will be asked about their medications
           and clinical outcomes by telephone interview or outpatient clinic. Then we will analyze
           the relative safety and efficacy of the various antithrombotic regimens.

        4. Based on the largest prospective study by Denmark about this issue, we anticipate an 30%
           incidence of composite outcome in the triple therapy arm. To achieve a precision of 10%
           with an α=0.05 and the rate of defaulters is 10%. The final estimated sample size was
           986.

        5. Henan institute of cardiology epidemiology is responsible for design, date quality
           control and statistical analysis.
