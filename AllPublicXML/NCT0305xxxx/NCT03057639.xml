      This research trial studies the Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Cancers Clinical Model in
      evaluating clinical, psychosocial, and health economic factors in adolescent and young adult
      patients with cancer. Studying the Adolescent and Young Adult Cancers Clinical Model may help
      doctors learn more about the effect of the AYA services on patient care, including clinical
      (nurse navigation), psychosocial (social work), and economic (financial) areas.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide economic understanding of the AYA at University of Southern California (USC)
      model of care. (Norris)

      II. To evaluate the existing AYA at USC program to determine the direct and indirect impact
      on cost of care. (Norris)

      III. To utilize the results of objective (i) to identify cost effectiveness and efficiencies
      to patient and institution. (Norris)

      IV. To identify specific processes within our model of care that can be improved. (Norris)

      V. To improve healthcare access to AYA-specific cancer care for patients ages 15-39 served by
      the Los Angeles County (LAC)+USC oncology pilot clinics. (LAC+USC)

      VI. To improve the psychosocial outcome of AYA-specific cancer care patients. (LAC+USC)

      VII. To provide AYA specific elements of care routinely and proactively to AYA cancer
      patients. (LAC+USC)

      VIII. To improve care quality through patient satisfaction. (LAC+USC)

      IX. To improve resource utilization and care coordination through improved patient navigation
      through efficiency and patient navigation. (LAC+USC)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires at referral, week 4-8, week 10-12, and at the completion of
      systemic therapy.

    <description>Direct health care costs analyses will be performed from the Total Costs of Care payer perspective. Direct cost will be estimated from paid claims in the extracted electronic medical records, which will include costs for all health care utilization such as outpatient, procedures, laboratory, emergency room visits, hospitalization, and pharmacy. As the healthcare utilization and costs will likely be extremely skewed, healthcare utilization and cost measures will be estimated by using an econometric model (e.g., a negative binomial regression model for utilization count data [number of services</description>

    <measure>Incremental cost (Norris)</measure>

    <description>The incremental cost between AYA enrolled and non-enrolled will be calculated. In addition to estimation the magnitude of the variability attributed to the different sources of variation, we will also generate an influence diagram (also known as tornado diagram) to display which variables exert the most influence on cost driver.</description>
