    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), including gefitinib
      demonstrate excellent effect on the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
      with EGFR mutations. However, patients who are initially sensitive to the drugs eventually
      become resistance. Apatinib is a highly selective VEGFR2 inhibitor and reduces the
      angiogenesis of tumor efficiently. In this study, the investigators aim to explore the
      efficacy and reasonable dosage of apatinib combining with EGFR-TKI in advanced non-squamous
      non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR-TKI resistance.
