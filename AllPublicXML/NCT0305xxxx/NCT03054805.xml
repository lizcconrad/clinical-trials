      To compare the differences of fecal microflora between constipated and non-constipated
      healthy children, and evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in reducing symptoms of
      constipation and the influence of intestinal microflora in children with functional
      constipation.

      The investigators performed a monocentric, prospective, randomized controlled trial including
      120 pediatric patients (aged 6 months - 10 years old) with functional constipation and 30
      healthy age-matched healthy children as control. The investigators shall evaluate the
      children according to the Rome III Diagnostic Criteria for functional constipation.

      The 120 enrolled patients are randomized in to two groups: Group A receiving magnesium oxide
      and probiotics (MIYAIRI-BM), Group B receiving only magnesium oxide. Each patient is assigned
      the evaluation constipation symptoms and detection of microflora (beneficial and harmful
      bacteria) in fecal samples at the enrollment, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Patients who take less
      than 80% of the appropriate dose of medications are withdrawn from the study. All patients
      included in the study will be given informed oral consent before entering the study.

      The data of the fecal microflora evaluated in 60 healthy children are used as control.
