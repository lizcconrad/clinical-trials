  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control study will investigate the health outcomes of adolescents with Down
      Syndrome who participate in a karate class as measured by ALPHA fitness testing and various
      PROMIS parent proxy questionnaires to assess participants mobility, physical activity, and
      overall affect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with Down syndrome suffer from a set of health problems including heart disease,
      sleep disturbances, and obesity. Their decreased cardiovascular fitness and exercise capacity
      limits their ability to perform activities of daily living. Exercise interventions in this
      population of children have been shown to improve muscle strength, balance, and
      cardiovascular fitness. Prior research has helped better define physical activity barriers in
      this population which include: requiring parental supervision, lack of accessible programs,
      seasonal activities and reduced physical skills of the child. Karate is an indoor activity
      that can be performed at different skill levels without parental involvement. The
      investigators hypothesize that adolescents with Down syndrome who participate in karate will
      show improved health outcomes compared to those who did not participate. Furthermore, the
      investigators hypothesize that the majority of participants will continue the activity
      outside of the research window. This randomized controlled trial will enroll 30 adolescents
      with Down syndrome. Participants will be randomly assigned to a 3 month karate program or the
      control group with no intervention. Measurements are taken at baseline, 3 months, and 6
      months using validated ALPHA fitness testing and in addition parents will complete PROMIS
      questionnaires to assess overall participant's activity level, mobility, and generalized
      affect. An independent statistician will analyze the groups. This research will help
      physicians provide adolescents with Down syndrome appropriate recommendations for an
      individualized physical activity regimen that does not have similar limitations to other
      exercise programs.
