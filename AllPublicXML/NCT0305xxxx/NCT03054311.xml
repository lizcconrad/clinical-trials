  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle Matters is an occupational approach to healthy ageing, which helps older people to
      get the most out of life. The intervention is based on an American model of health promotion
      called Lifestyle Redesign. This was found to be highly effective in enhancing the physical
      and mental health, occupational functioning and life satisfaction of community living older
      adults in Los Angeles, USA.

      Weekly group meetings provide older people with the space, time and opportunity to share
      their experiences. Through a process of peer exchange and guidance, participants have the
      opportunity to reflect upon the range of activities that they engage with. They are then
      helped to begin to understand how these activities might impact on their health and
      well-being. However this approach alone cannot meet the complex needs of individual older
      people, and their specific and personal concerns. In recognition of this, the programme also
      includes monthly individual sessions with one of the group facilitators. The older person in
      partnership with the facilitator identifies a tailored programme to meet their individual
      needs, including the means by which they might work towards their personal goals. The
      individual programme is updated and refreshed in subsequent meetings over the months.

      During 2004/5 researchers at Sheffield Hallam University in partnership with other
      researchers in York and Leeds, and clinical colleagues in Sheffield explored the feasibility
      of delivering this intervention to older people living in the UK. The project was funded
      through the Sheffield Health and Social Research Consortium. The summary below is an account
      of the process and outcomes of delivering a Lifestyle Matters programme to two groups of
      community living older people during 2004/5.
