  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession is a common defect among the American population. It is also a major cause
      for root decay, hypersensitivity, contributes to tooth mobility and low self-esteem.
      Acellular dermal matrix, a human-derived grafting material has been put on the market for the
      treatment of gingival recession. Treating gingival recession with this material has been a
      validated treatment option for years.

      However, treatment outcomes in two patient populations, namely those with thin biotypes and
      those with thick biotypes, has not been investigated. This study will observe the primary
      treatment outcomes in the two patient groups at 5 time points - 3 months, 6 months and 12
      months post-surgery to observe short term outcomes; additional 24 months and 48 months
      post-surgery to observe long term outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aim is to evaluate and compare the use of acellular dermal matrix, a material used
      for treating gum recession, in two study populations, namely thin or thick gingival biotype.
      Short term outcomes and the long term stability of ADM in recession repair between thick and
      thin biotypes will be evaluated.

      There will be two study groups, namely thin and thick groups. The included subjects will be
      divided in two groups according to gingival thickness: Thin gingival biotype group (TnB): &lt;
      0.8 mm, thick gingival biotype group (TkB) ≥ 0.8 mm. Each subject will be in one of the two
      groups only.

      Randomization will not be used to assign the subjects to the study groups, because the
      intervention will be the same for both groups, namely ADM applied beneath a coronally
      advanced flap.

      The short term (3 months, 6 months post-surgery) outcomes and the longer term (12 months, 24
      months and 48 months post-surgery) outcomes will further be compared within the groups and
      between the groups.

Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM) will be used according to manufacturer's instructions during mucogingival surgery. Subjects will be anesthetized using local anesthesia. An envelope flap design will be involved with no releasing incisions. The ADM will be placed beneath the flap. The flap will then be advanced to the level of cemento-enamel junction (CEJ). The area will be sutured.
Mean root coverage, CPD, CAL, RH, RW, KTW, GT, and CRC will be measured and compared at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 48 months post-surgery.</description>
