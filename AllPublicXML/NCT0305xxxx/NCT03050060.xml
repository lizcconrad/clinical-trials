    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well image guided hypofractionated radiation therapy works
      with nelfinavir mesylate, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab in treating patients
      with melanoma, lung cancer, or kidney cancer that has spread. Hypofractionated radiation
      therapy delivers higher doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill
      more tumor cells and have fewer side effects. Nelfinavir mesylate may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Giving hypofractionated radiation therapy, nelfinavir mesylate,
      pembrolizumab, nivolumab and atezolizumab may work better in treating patients with melanoma,
      lung, or kidney cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Safety, tolerability and preliminary assessment of overall response rate (ORR) to
      combination of hypofractionated radiotherapy with PD1/PDL1 immune checkpoint and nelfinavir
      mesylate (nelfinavir).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate overall response rate (ORR) with: smoking status, underlying genetic mutations
      if known (e.g.: Kras, BRAF) circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA), circulating
      tumor cells, PDL-1 expression in tumor and peripheral blood T cell receptor repertoire by
      sequencing.

      II. Progression-free survival (PFS)-6 (systemic control): the proportion of patients who are
      free from progression at 6 months.

      III. Overall survival.

      IV. The type and frequency of adverse events.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 7-14 days prior to start of pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab, patients
      receive nelfinavir mesylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 up to 11-12 weeks.
      Patients also receive pembrolizumab, nivolumab or atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14-21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy over 3-14
      days starting after course 1 and before course 3 of pembrolizumab, nivolumab or atezolizumab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months for up to 2 years.
