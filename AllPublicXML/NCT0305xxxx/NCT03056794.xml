  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and adults with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiency are participating in
      a research study seeking to better understand the genetic causes, symptoms, usefulness of
      current treatments, and outcomes for these disorders. The research project involves
      completing a questionnaire about the individual or family's medical history and experiences
      with PDC deficiency, review of medical records by the researchers, and in some cases,
      advanced genetic testing. A blood draw will be requested, and an optional skin biopsy is part
      of the study for some participants.

    <textblock>
      Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) deficiencies are a major class of mitochondrial
      diseases, limiting oxidation of carbohydrate for energy production, which is especially
      important in the brain. So far, there is not a definitive treatment for these disorders. This
      study, &quot;Natural History and Advanced Genetic Study of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex
      Deficiencies,&quot; will create a database with information that is collected over a long period
      of time about patients with PDC deficiencies. This database will be a part of the existing
      North American Mitochondrial Disease Consortium (NAMDC) Patient Data Registry and
      Biorepository database. The study will collect data specific to PDC deficiencies, including
      data that is derived from patients/families. Approximately 150-200 subjects with confirmed
      PDC deficiencies will be enrolled over 4 years. The genetic basis and pathophysiology will be
      explored in up to a third of confirmed PDC deficient patients, who currently have not been
      found to have an identified mutation in DLD or any of the five &quot;primary&quot; PDC-specific genes
      (PDHA1, PDHB, DLAT, PDHX, and PDP1), and who might benefit from different treatments.

      The specific aims are:

        1. Create a Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) Deficiencies specific database within the
           NAMDC Patient Data Registry

        2. Use advanced genetic analysis technologies to find mutations in those people in whom
           none has been found

        3. Identify connections between these clinical and genetic findings to see if there are
           different types of PDC deficiencies that may respond to different treatments, and to
           identify outcomes and forms of treatment that could be tested in ongoing and future
           studies.

      About this Study:

      This study will collect comprehensive (complete) longitudinal natural history clinical data
      for proven Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) deficiencies, including data about diagnoses,
      symptoms, and outcomes. The study will include data from patients/parents as well as medical
      data. The investigators will use medical records and a detailed questionnaire targeted to
      collect in-depth information about critical outcomes. This questionnaire will collect
      information from the subject and parent about the importance of different outcomes and allow
      families to discuss other outcomes that they may consider important at home. These data will
      be updated cyclically on an annual basis (every 6 months in infants) from medical and
      laboratory records and family questionnaires/interviews.

      Additional details of treatment will be sought to maximize our knowledge about their effects.
      The investigators will obtain from enrolled subjects, on an annual basis, deproteinized whole
      EDTA-blood samples for analysis of lactate, beta-hydroxybutyrate (Î²OHB), thiamine and
      thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), as markers of disease status and treatment efficacy.

      Data analysis will focus on the spectrum of neurological manifestations of PDC deficiency,
      clinically relevant outcome measures, and responses to therapeutic interventions. Such
      analyses will serve to inform future clinical trials.
