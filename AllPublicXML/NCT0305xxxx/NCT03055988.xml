      The objectives of the study are to explore the effect of treatment with tiotropium +
      olodaterol fixed dose combination (FDC) compared to fluticasone propionate + salmeterol FDC
      on:

        -  reversal of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction assessed with cardiac magnetic
           resonance (CMR) imaging,

        -  measures of arterial stiffness assessed by CMR and pulse wave analysis (PWA),

        -  reduction of hyperinflation assessed with body plethysmography and

        -  post dose spirometry.
