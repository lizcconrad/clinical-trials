  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to examine the effect of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP)
      initiation for newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in hospitalized heart failure
      patients on reducing 30-day hospital readmission rate through a clinical trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following consent adult patients hospitalized with a medical history of heart failure and
      meeting study eligibility criteria will be screened for obstructive sleep apnea using the
      Ohio Sleep Medicine Institute Preoperative Questionnaire.

      If the probability of sleep apnea is high (Sleep apnea clinical Score &gt;15) then participants
      will complete the Epworth Daytime Sleepiness scale and the Minnesota Living with HeartFailure
      questionnaire. The patient will then be evaluated by the sleep medicine team with a portable
      polysomnography monitor which has been shown to be equivalent to standard in-laboratory
      polysomnography. All participants with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) â‰¥ 5events/h in whom sleep
      disordered breathing is confirmed by sleep medicine physician will be eligible for
      randomization.

      Participants will be randomized into an auto-adjusting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
      (CPAP) group or standard of care (control) group.

      CPAP Arm (Intervention): CPAP education and discharge with auto-adjusting Continuous Positive
      Airway Pressure (CPAP) in addition to usual standards of clinical care for heart failure. The
      auto-CPAP group will be scheduled for follow-up with a phone call at 2 - 3 weeks post
      discharge, then in sleep medicine clinic at 1 month (+2 weeks) and 6 months (+2 weeks) to
      assess their progress on CPAP.

      Standard of Care Arm (Comparator): CPAP initiation per standard of care based on approval by
      insurance company and DME company with management as per usual standards of clinical care for
      heart failure. This group will be scheduled for follow-up with a phone call at 2- 3 weeks
      post discharge and then in sleep medicine clinic at 1 month (+2 weeks) and 6 months (+2
      weeks) to assess their progress.
