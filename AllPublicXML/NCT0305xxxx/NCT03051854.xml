  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beside the home, the school is often the second important setting for the development and
      education of children and adolescents. Students spend a large part of their life at school.
      However, there is recurrent occurrence of violence against children and of harsh discipline
      measures used in home and school settings. These may result into negative consequences.
      Hence, prevention strategies against the use of harsh discipline use in schools become a
      priority.

      In the baseline of this study the investigators will therefore examine the prevalence and
      consequences of violence against children in Southwestern Uganda. The study will be conducted
      in schools and common disciplinary measures used by teachers, and the perceptions of
      teachers' and students' in relation to commonly used and experienced disciplinary measures we
      will be investigated.

      In the second phase, the investigators then will implement and assess the effectiveness of an
      intervention aimed at reducing the use of harsh and violent disciplinary measures in schools.
      ICC-T training in the long-term aims at fostering better relations amongst students and
      teachers. Based on feasibility studies, ICC-T intervention is expected to result into better
      teacher-student relationships, change in teachers' attitudes and behaviors concerning the use
      of violent disciplinary measures in the school setting.

      Study participants (i.e., teachers and students) will be recruited from six districts in
      southwestern Uganda. The sample will include 12 government-aided secondary schools from which
      60 students and 15-25 teachers will be recruited. The final sample will have 720 students and
      180-300 teachers. Investigators will assess data in the baseline (i.e., prior to
      intervention) and three months after the intervention.

      Study measures will cover the following topics: socio-demographic data, common disciplinary
      measure used at home and at school, students' mental health problems, students' and teachers'
      attitudes towards violent discipline measures, and students' exposure to peer and sexual
      violence. Questionnaire for teachers will have additional items that measure attitudes
      towards teaching and teacher stress. Additionally, the investigators will also assess the
      demand, acceptance and feasibility of the training.
