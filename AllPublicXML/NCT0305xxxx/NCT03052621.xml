  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Locally advance breast cancer and extensive locoregional recurrence are still considered as
      complexity of reconstruction. Although previous studies concluded that omental transposition
      was considerably indicated in poor vascularity in irradiated tissue, secondary infection and
      large defect become the obstacles of local tissue flaps. While some centres showed the
      excellent healing of omental transposition. Meanwhile, many studies showed the preferable
      outcome in escalating radiotherapy in term of locoregional control. In the investigators'
      institute, omental transposition in breast cancer has been developed for twenty years. The
      only institute in Thailand enhanced using this procedure in order to closure of large primary
      breast cancer and chest wall recurrence. This procedure is undertaken by single surgeon (Dr.
      K.J.). The investigators' protocol of omental transposition is including preoperative
      chemotherapy, preoperative accelerated radiation up to 80 Gy, approval of breast cancer
      centre committee, and meticulous wound care including vacuum assisted wound dressing,
      non-adhesive dressing. As a result, survival time could be improved.
