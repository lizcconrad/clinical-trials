      NOTE: This is a research study and is not meant to be a substitute for clinical genetic
      testing. Families may never receive results from the study or may receive results many years
      from the time they enroll. If you are interested in clinical testing please consider seeing a
      local genetic counselor or other genetics professional. If you have already had clinical
      genetic testing and meet eligibility criteria for this study as shown in the Eligibility
      Section, you may enroll regardless of the results of your clinical genetic testing.

      While it is well recognized that hereditary factors contribute to the development of a subset
      of human cancers, the cause for many cancers remains unknown. The application of next
      generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has expanded knowledge in the field of hereditary
      cancer predisposition. Currently, more than 100 cancer predisposing genes have been
      identified, and it is now estimated that approximately 10% of all cancer patients have an
      underlying genetic predisposition.

      The purpose of this protocol is to identify novel cancer predisposing genes and/or genetic
      variants. For this study, the investigators will establish a Data Registry linked to a
      Repository of biological samples. Health information, blood samples and occasionally leftover
      tumor samples will be collected from individuals with familial cancer. The investigators will
      use NGS approaches to find changes in genes that may be important in the development of
      familial cancer. The information gained from this study may provide new and better ways to
      diagnose and care for people with hereditary cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  Establish a registry of families with clustering of cancer in which clinical data are
           linked to a repository of cryopreserved blood cells, germline DNA, and tumor tissues
           from the proband and other family members.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  Identify novel cancer predisposing genes and/or genetic variants in families with
           clustering of cancer for which the underlying genetic basis is unknown.

      During the study, blood samples will be obtained from participants, as well as medical and
      family histories. When possible, leftover tumor samples will also be collected. If
      participants agree to be re-contacted in the future, they will be asked about once each year
      to update their health information and family history.

      A blood sample will be drawn at St. Jude or at a convenient place of the participant's
      choice. Blood will be stored in the St. Jude Biorepository. The DNA of the samples will be
      studied to determine if there are changes in specific genes that might explain the cancers in
      the participant or their family members. When available, and if consent is given by the
      participant, previously collected and stored leftover tumor samples, bone marrow samples or
      stored DNA may be analyzed.

      Genetic variants of interest include: 1) mutations in known genes that may have escaped
      detection through prior clinical genetic testing; 2) coding mutations predicted to disrupt
      protein function, particularly in genes and pathways known to be associated with cancer; 3)
      potential mutations in regulatory regions of the genome, as predicted by epigenetic studies.
      In some cases, individuals with known predisposing mutations exhibit milder, more severe or
      atypical phenotypes. Family members who harbor a predisposing mutation but are discordant for
      a cancer phenotype will be selected for cellular and genetic studies. These will include DNA
      sequencing and possibly also creation and analysis of induce pluripotent stem cells (iPSC),
      transcriptome or epigenetic analysis.

      All samples will be identified by a code after removal of all personal identifiable
      information. Samples will remain in the repository for current and future study.
