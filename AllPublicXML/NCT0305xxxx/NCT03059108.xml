  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed as a consecutive enrollment prospective one-center study. A minimum of
      30 patients will be included in the study. At implant installation, the implant will be
      randomized to one of the groups (Control: conventional loading, 8 weeks; Test: early loading,
      4 weeks). Samples of peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) and intrasulcular plaque will be
      collected at -14, 0 (Baseline: prosthesis delivery), 7 days and 1, 3, 6, 12 months.
      Prosthesis will be fabricated and delivered as usual, i.e., approximately two weeks after the
      impressions are taken.
