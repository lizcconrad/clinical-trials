    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders are among the non-motor signs more common in Parkinson's disease (PD). This
      case series evaluated the effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) on
      acupoints in the self-assessment of sleep in 14 PD patients classified between stages 1 and 3
      of Hoehn and Yahr original (HY). Patients were assessed using the Sleep Scale for Parkinson's
      Disease (PDSS) and subjected to treatment with eight TENS sessions on acupoints, with the
      current Burst. We used the paired sample t-test, considering p ≤ 0.05.

    <description>A self-administered scale designed to assess nighttime sleep problems, sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleep. Consists of 15 items represented by a ruler (10 cm) where the patient indicates the frequency of the symptom from 0 (always)- 10 (never).</description>

    <description>Eight sessions were held, once a week, lasting twenty minutes. For this purpose, the electrodes of the acoustic surface Taichong (LR-3), Hé gǔ (Ll-4), Yanglingquan (GB-34) and Neiguan (PC-6) connected to the TENS equipment (EL 608, brand NKL). The current of choice for a BURST type, with intermittent pulses, isolated at a frequency of 2 Hz, ranging from 1 to 10 mA.</description>
