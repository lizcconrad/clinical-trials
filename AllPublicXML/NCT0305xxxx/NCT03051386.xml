      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of VEE vaccine, Live,
      Attenuated, dried TC-83, NDBR 102, Lot 4, Run 3, and collect data on the incidence of
      occupational VEE virus infection in vaccinated personnel.

      This protocol is replacing NCT00582504.

      The study population will consist of USAMRIID and qualified extramural participants who are
      at risk of exposure to VEE virus. This study will be performed at the USAMRIID SIP Clinic.
      This open-label study represents a continuation of previous research conducted at USAMRIID.
      Subjects will be vaccinated with 0.5 mL of VEE vaccine, Live, Attenuated TC-83, NDBR 102, Lot
      4, Run 3 subcutaneously in the upper outer aspect of the triceps region. Subjects will
      contacted the following day and weekly for 4 weeks to assess for adverse events.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be 18-65 years old at time of consent.

          2. Have VEE virus PRNT80 &lt; 1:10.

          3. If female of childbearing potential, must agree to have a serum pregnancy test on the
             same day before vaccine administration. (Exception: documented hysterectomy or ≥ 3
             years of menopause.) The results must be negative. Females must agree not to become
             pregnant for 3 months after receipt of the vaccination.

          4. Be considered at risk for exposure to VEE virus and who have submitted a Request for
             IND Vaccines for the VEE vaccine.

          5. Sign and date the approved informed consent document and HIPAA Authorization.

          6. Have in their charts:

               -  medical history (including concomitant medications) within 60 days of planned
                  first administration of vaccine

               -  physical examination and laboratory tests within 1 year

               -  previous chest radiograph results and electrocardiogram

          7. Be medically cleared for participation by an investigator. Examinations or tests may
             be repeated at the discretion of the PI.

          8. Be willing to return for all follow-up visits.

          9. Agree to report any AEs that may or may not be associated with administration of the
             vaccine for at least 28 days after administration and agree to report all SAEs (for
             example, resulting in hospitalization) for the duration of the subject's participation
             in the study.

         10. Agree to defer blood donation for 1 year after receipt of the vaccine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have received VEE vaccine.

          2. Have family history (first degree relative) of diabetes mellitus (any type), a
             personal or family history of gestational diabetes, a confirmed elevated fasting serum
             glucose test (&gt; 125 mg/dL), or a hemoglobin A1c &gt; 5.6%. (At the principal
             investigator's discretion, a subject may participate if the family history of diabetes
             is only of late onset in an elderly parent.)

          3. Have clinically significant abnormal laboratory results (including evidence of
             hepatitis C, hepatitis B carrier state) or elevated liver function tests (two times
             the normal range or at the discretion of the PI).

          4. Have a personal history of an immunodeficiency or received treatment with an
             immunosuppressive medication, such as systemically administered glucocorticoids (eg
             prednisone) within 1 month before planned administration of the vaccine or with other
             immunosuppressive therapies within 6 months of planned administration of the vaccine.
             Other immunosuppressive therapies include all cancer chemotherapeutic agents, drugs to
             prevent transplant rejection, interferons, monoclonal antibodies, protein kinase
             inhibitors, methotrexate, TNF (tumor necrosis factor) inhibitors, and any other drug
             determined to be immunosuppressive by the PI. Current administration of topical,
             inhalational, or intranasal glucocorticoids is not excluded.

          5. Have confirmed HIV infection (antibody positivity).

          6. Have a positive pregnancy test or a breastfeeding female.

          7. Have any known allergies to components of the vaccine:

               -  Neomycin sulfate

               -  Guinea pig heart cells

               -  Streptomycin

               -  Human serum albumin

          8. History of serious allergic reaction to guinea pigs or guinea pig products. (Subjects
             who have known allergies to guinea pigs will be evaluated. The vast majority of
             individuals who are allergic to guinea pigs are allergic to the dander from the
             animals. An individual with a past serious allergic reaction to guinea pigs will be
             excluded.)

          9. Have administration of another vaccine or investigational product within 28 days of
             VEE vaccination.

         10. Have any unresolved AE resulting from a previous immunization.

         11. Have a medical condition that, in the judgment of the PI, would impact subject safety.
