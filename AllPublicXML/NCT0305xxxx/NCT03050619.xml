  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, was launched in the
      United Kingdom (UK) in August 2014. It can be expected that patients initiating empagliflozin
      may differ in their characteristics from patients initiating other glucose lowering drugs
      (GLDs) that have been on the market longer (e.g. patients may have poorer glucose control).
      Therefore, the proposed study aims to characterize patients with T2DM in the UK initiating
      empagliflozin in terms of baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and
      comorbidities compared to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) initiating other
      SGLT-2 inhibitors or other non-insulin GLDs. Due to the mode of action, some patients taking
      empagliflozin have experienced weight loss in clinical trials. A theoretical possibility
      exists that empagliflozin may be used by patients without T2DM. Therefore, this study also
      aims to assess the potential off-label use of empagliflozin compared to other non-insulin
      GLDs.

        Inclusion criteria:

        All patients will be required to meet all of the following criteria:

          -  At least 12 months of continuous registration prior to the index date in a practice
             contributing up to standard (UTS) data to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink
             (CPRD). Infants younger than 1 year will not be required to have 12 months of
             continuous UTS registration in the CPRD.

          -  A new user of one of the index prescriptions (empagliflozin, other SGLT2 inhibitor, or
             non-insulin GLDs) or a fixed dose combination (FDC) with metformin.
