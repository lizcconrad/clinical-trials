  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, endoscopic techniques have been applied for diagnosing and treating a variety of
      gastrointestinal diseases, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and endoscopic
      mucosal resection (EMR)technique for removing early gastrointestinal mucosal cancers.
      Endoscopic procedure associated gastrointestinal perforation is one of the the most severe
      complications, which is associated with high morality and needs timely detection and
      effective treatment in clinical practice.Over 90% procedure associated gastrointestinal
      perforation occurs immediately within 24 h after endoscopic procedure.Endoclips have been
      widely used in closing the immediate gastrointestinal perforations, but the location of the
      endoclips could influence the effective rate, limiting its application. In addition, multiple
      endoclips should be placed under endoscopy for a relatively large perforation, which could
      increase the medical cost and the procedure time. At recent, a new purse string suture device
      (LeoMed, China) has been developed by us and introduced to the clinicalmanagement of such
      patients with procedure associated gastrointestinal perforations. Clinical data validated
      that the usage of this new purse string suture in treating immediate procedure associated
      perforations was greatly convenient and effective with very low reoperation rate and
      postoperative complication rate. A specially designed loop was equipped in this device, which
      could be tightened under endoscopy. Thus, compared with the placement of endoclips, this
      device could be more convenient and effective in completely closing the gastrointestinal
      perforations.This study will test whether purse string suture device will increase the
      effectiveness of closingimmediate procedure associated gastrointestinal perforationsunder
      endoscopyin a randomized controlled trialby comparing the use of purse string suture
      deviceand endoclips.

      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the use of purse string suture device versus
      endoclips for closing procedure associated gastrointestinal perforation under endoscopy,
      which is one of the most severe complications and needs timely treatment. Endoclips have been
      widely used in closing the gastrointestinal perforations, but the location of the endoclips
      could significantly influence the effective rate. In addition, multiple endoclips will be
      needed for a relatively large perforation, which could increase the medical cost and the
      procedure time. At recent, a new purse string suture device has been developed and introduced
      to the clinicalmanagement of such patients with gastrointestinal perforations. A loop was
      equipped in this device, which could be tightened. Thus, compared with endoclips, this device
      could be more convenient and effective in completely closing the gastrointestinal
      perforations. This study will test whether purse string suture device will increase the
      effectiveness of treating procedure associated gastrointestinal perforations under endoscopy
      in a randomized controlled trial.
