      Objectives: 1-year multidomain health promotion on prevention of physical and cognitive
      decline for community-living older people.

      Design:

      Methods: Randomized controlled trial

      Setting:

      Five cities(Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung, Kinmen, I-Lan) in Taiwan Participants: age 65 or
      older community-dwelling prefrail or frail adults Intervention: 1-year multidomain health
      promotion (physical, cognitive, nutritional intervention)

      Measurements:

      Primary outcome includes frailty status and cognitive performance. Secondary outcomes include
      depressive symptoms, nutrition assessment, and functional capacity; All the variables were
      measured at 0, 6, 12 months. The effect of intervention was investigated by
      intention-to-treat analysis.

      Eligibility criteria includes: community-dwelling older people aged 65 or older, and those
      with confirmed diagnosis of dementia or dependent on activities of daily living were
      excluded.

      Primary outcome includes frailty status measured by CHS frailty score. general and sub-domain
      cognitive performance measured by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary outcomes
      include depressive symptoms, nutrition assessment, and functional capacity; which were
      evaluated by 5-item Geriatric Depression scale(GDS-5), Mini-nutrition Assessment(MNA), and
      instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) individually.
