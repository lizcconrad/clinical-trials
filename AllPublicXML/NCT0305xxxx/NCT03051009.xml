    <intervention_model_description>The trial is designed as partly an extension trial for subjects completing trial 000129 (female subjects) and 000130 (male subjects) and partly as a trial for new female and male subjects.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>One dose level (25 μg desmopressin OCD) is included for female subjects and will be open-labelled for all female subjects.
Two different dose levels (25 μg desmopressin and 50 μg desmopressin ODT are included for male subjects in a double-blinded manner. Male subjects continuing from trial 000130 will continue their randomised treatment and subjects who received placebo will be randomised to one of the 2 dose levels (25 μg desmopressin or 50 μg desmopressin ODT).
New male subjects will be allocated to receive 50 μg desmopressin ODT in an open-labelled manner.</masking_description>
