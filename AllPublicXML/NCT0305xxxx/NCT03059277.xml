      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept injections
      administered in a treat and extend fashion in eyes that have persistent center involved
      diabetic macular edema following at least 4 intravitreal injections of 0.3 mg ranibizumab
      over 24 weeks.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 4 prospective, nonrandomized, open label, interventional clinical trial to
      determine the efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept (IAI) administered in a treat and extend
      fashion in eyes that have persistent centered involved diabetic macular edema despite at
      least 4 intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.3mg over 24 weeks prior to enrollment.
      Patients will receive intravitreal injections of aflibercept (2mg/0.05cc) at baseline and
      monthly until an eye has reached stability defined as: &lt; 10% change in the Spectral Domain
      Optical Coherence Tomography (SD OCT) central retinal thickness (CRT) reading from the
      previous 2 visits (can include baseline) and less than a 5 letter decrease in Best Corrected
      Visual Acuity (BCVA) from best BCVA from prior visits. Once an eye has reached stability
      criteria, a treat and extend protocol will be used and treatment will be rendered on every
      visit. The duration between treatments will be extended by 2 weeks from the last visit if SD
      OCT extension criteria are met: &lt; 10% change in CRT over 2 consecutive visits and &lt; 5 letter
      decrease in BCVA from baseline

      If at any return visit subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid recurs that causes the CRT to
      increase by &gt; 10 % from its lowest level in the previous 2 consecutive visits, or CRT
      increases by &lt; 10% due to subretinal and/or intraretinal fluid but is associated with a
      decrease of BCVA of &gt; 5 letters from baseline then the eye will receive IAI and the treatment
      interval will be decreased by 1 week. If the eye has not improved or worsened for at least 2
      consecutive visits and the SD OCT central subfield thickness is ≥ 300 microns or visual
      acuity is worse than 20/20, the following will be done:

      Prior to the 24-week visit, an injection will be given. At and after the 24-week visit, an
      injection will be given and modified grid laser can be given at the discretion of the
      investigator within 7 days of IAI based on rescue criteria
