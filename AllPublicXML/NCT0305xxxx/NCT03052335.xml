  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main objective is to improve colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme in the Czech
      Republic and decrease the disease incidence and mortality. The secondary aim is to verify the
      effectiveness of incorporation of the new minimally invasive device in the prevention
      programme.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multicentre, multidisciplinary (3 gastroenterology units; biostatistics department;
      cooperation with general practitioners), prospective study is focused on examination of
      individuals with average colorectal cancer (CRC) risk (asymptomatic, age 50-75 years).

      In years 2017 - 2019, there will be 230 persons with positive semi-quantitative
      immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (FIT; QuikRead, Orion Diagnostica Oy, Finland) with
      cut-off level 75 ng/ml involved. Every person will be examined by second generation colon
      capsule endoscopy (CCE2) and optical colonoscopy afterwards.

      Main objective is to show that the negative predictive value (NPV) of the CCE2 applied in
      patients with positive FIT results is sufficient to include this method in the National CRC
      screening as filter test with aim to reduce the necessity of subsequent optical colonoscopy.

    <description>The second generation of PillCam colon capsule endoscopy (CCE-2) is 11.6 mm × 31.5 mm in size and has two imagers, that each have a 172° angle of view, allowing for almost 360° visual coverage of the colon. CCE-2 has an adaptive frame rate from 4 to 35 images per second. This means that the camera is able to capture up to 35 pictures while in motion whereas 4 images per second are captured when it is virtually stationary. During the examination the patient wears a sensor array which is attached to the abdomen and a data recorder for storage of the information generated by the ingested capsule. After the examination the data are downloaded into the workstation and a video is generated.</description>
