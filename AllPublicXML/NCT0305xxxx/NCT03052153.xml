      This study will evaluate if an association exists between levels of blood flow through the
      pulmonary veins and the incidence of graft dysfunction post operatively.

    <textblock>
      Lung transplantation surgery can be fraught with a multitude of early as well as delayed
      complications leading to increased morbidity and mortality. During lung transplant surgery,
      trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) is routinely used to identify cardiac anatomy and
      measure blood flow through the pulmonary veins. This blood flow is assessed both before and
      after the lung has been transplanted. Blood flow through these small caliber vessels can be
      impacted by many variables with a resulting reduction in blood circulating to the lung,
      although currently there is no agreement on an acceptable level of flow. This study will look
      at retrospective data from lung transplant surgeries undertaken at this institution since Jan
      1st 2014 until November 18th 2016 with the goal of determining if an association exists
      between levels of blood flow through the pulmonary veins and the incidence of graft
      dysfunction post operatively.

        The study population will include all surgical patients 18 years of age and older who
        underwent single or bilateral lung transplantation surgery during the period January 1st
        2014 to November 18 2016 at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Database screening
        for patient inclusion in retrospective analysis will be performed by designated personnel
        from the Anesthesiology Department or co-investigators entitled to work with patients'
