    <textblock>
      An implementation project to scale-up delivery of antiretroviral-based HIV-1 prevention
      methods to Kenyan HIV-1 serodiscordant couples in HIV-1 care centers. Pre-exposure
      prophylaxis (PrEP) as a bridge to antiretroviral therapy (ART) HIV-1 prevention strategy will
      be introduced into 24 public HIV-1 care centers in central and western Kenya according to
      national guidelines using a stepped wedge design, stratified by region.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PrEP as a bridge to ART strategy will be introduced into 24 Kenyan public HIV-1 care centers
      according to national guidelines, in staged fashion, stratified by region (a stepped wedge
      design). Monitoring and evaluation activities will identify implementation barriers and
      solutions, characterize costs, and provide best practices for further scale-up. A research
      component will establish prospective open cohorts of couples at each clinic (up to 200) to
      study how the program is effectively implemented. Follow-up in the cohorts will be for up to
      36 months at each care center and will evaluate impact, costs, and facilitators and barriers
      to implementation at patient, provider and health system levels.

    <description>The PrEP as a bridge to ART intervention will be introduced into clinics according to Kenya national guidelines using a stepped wedge design, stratified by region. The components of the intervention are: a) Couples' HIV-1 counseling and testing; 2) PrEP as a bridge to ART: PrEP offered prior to ART initiation in couples in which the HIV-1 infected partner is not on ART due to refusal/delay, during the first 6 months after ART start during viral decline, and then discontinuation; 3) ART at any CD4 count, offered to all HIV-1 infected partners, with ongoing promotion/counseling for those delaying/declining;4) Standard of care HIV-1 prevention services</description>

    <description>A fixed-dose, oral co-formulation of emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is the approved and preferred regimen for HIV-1 prevention in Kenya and the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends TDF-containing medications as PrEP, which includes TDF combined with FTC as well as potentially TDF alone and TDF combined with lamivudine (or 3TC, a medication closely related to FTC). Any TDF-containing medications that align with WHO and Kenya national guidelines for PrEP will be used. PrEP medication will come from clinic stocks.</description>
