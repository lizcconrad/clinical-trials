  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the mass balance (that is, cumulative excretion of
      total radioactivity [TRA] in urine and feces) of pevonedistat following a single 1-hour
      infusion of 25 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) [14C]-pevonedistat intravenous (IV)
      solution containing approximately 60 to 85 microcurie (mCi) (approximately 2.22-3.145
      megabecquerel [MBq]) of TRA in participants with advanced solid tumors in Part A.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Pevonedistat. Pevonedistat is being tested to
      treat people with advanced solid tumors.

      The study will enroll approximately 4 to 6 pharmacokinetics (PK)-evaluable participants in
      part A. After completion of the mass balance and absorption, distribution, metabolism,
      excretion (ADME) assessment in Part A of the study, eligible participants will have the
      opportunity to continue into Part B at a secondary study site, which would begin in
      approximately 2 weeks of completion of Part A.

        -  Part A: Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2

        -  Part B (optional): Pevonedistat in combination with chemotherapy regimens (Pevonedistat
           25 mg/m^2 + docetaxel 75 mg/m^2 or pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + carboplatin 20 mg/m^2 +
           paclitaxel 175 mg/m^2)

      All participants will receive study drug via intravenous route. This multi-center trial will
      be conducted in Hungary. Participants will remain confined to the study site for 9 to 14 days
      in Part A. Participation in Part B is optional, participants will be re-evaluated for
      inclusion/exclusion criteria before administrating treatment. Participants will undergo
      treatment in Part B for a maximum of 12 cycles (21 days cycle each) and will include
      approximately 36 weeks for Part A and B combined. Participants will attend an end of study
      visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug in both Part A and B.
