      2.1 Primary Objectives

        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum recommended dose of SF1126 in
           adult patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) HCC and Child-Pugh A or
           Child-Pugh B7 cirrhosis.

        2. To determine the recommended phase II dose of SF1126 in patients with advanced
           (unresectable or metastatic) HCC and Child-Pugh A or Child-Pugh B7 cirrhosis.

      2.2 Secondary Objectives

        1. To describe the safety and tolerability of SF1126 in adult patients with underlying
           liver disease by ongoing evaluation of adverse events.

        2. To determine pharmacokinetics in HCC patients.

        3. To assess the effect of SF1126 on progression-free survival and overall survival.

      2.3 Endpoints

      Primary Endpoint

      The primary endpoint is the rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at within 56 days of
      starting treatment, and the maximum tolerated dose or maximum recommended dose of SF1126.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SF1126 is a dual inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pan-isoform specific) and
      bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) which simultaneously disrupts two key MYC-mediating
      factors that promote cancer cell growth.
