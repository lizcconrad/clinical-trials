  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent urinary tract infections are quickly becoming a public health obstacle in our aging
      population. Almost 50% of women have at least one urinary tract infection in their lifetime;
      following this first infection, there is a 25-35% chance that she will have another infection
      in the subsequent 3-6 months. With each documented infection, a patient receives anywhere
      from a three to seven day course of antibiotics for treatment. Repeated courses of
      antibiotics often lead to the development of multi-drug resistant infections that are
      difficult to treat with our arsenal of oral medications. It is theorized that most, if not
      all, urinary tract infections are caused by bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract. If
      there is a generalized gut dysbiosis due to repeated courses of oral antibiotics, it will
      likely be difficult to ever adequately treat repeat urinary tract infections. This same
      theory led to the development and utilization of fecal microbiota transplantation in the
      treatment of refractory Clostridium difficile diarrhea. There are now several studies that
      have reported on the efficacy of fecal transplantation in the treatment of C.difficile
      infections as well as the correction of gut dysbiosis. Given this positive response in
      treatment of refractory infectious diarrhea, the investigators propose that the correction of
      gut dysbiosis can also treat refractory recurrent urinary tract infections. Therefore, the
      investigators propose this pilot study to determine the effectiveness of fecal
      transplantation in the treatment of refractory, recurrent urinary tract infections.

    <measure>Change in frequency of culture proven urinary tract infections following fecal transplant</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recurrent urinary tract infections are defined as 2 or more urine culture proven urinary tract infections in 6 months or 3 or more culture proven urinary tract infections in 12 months. To assess complete treatment success following fecal transplant, the investigators will collect urine cultures 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after fecal transplantation, as well as with any symptoms of a urinary tract infection, to determine the frequency of culture proven urinary tract infections over a 6 month time period following fecal transplant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of fecal transplant in transforming recurrent urinary tract infection bacteria profile to that of pan-sensitive organisms on urine culture specimens</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Often, patients with refractory recurrent urinary tract infection become infected with bacteria that are multi-drug resistant and therefore difficult to treat. To assess if a fecal transplant can alter the bacterial antibiotic susceptibility profile, the investigators will evaluate urine cultures 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after fecal transplant to test for infection and then to assess the antibiotic resistance profile.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the gut microbiome following fecal transplantation measured via 16s sequencing of stool samples</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The gut microbiome is an evolving field of research, especially following a fecal transplant. The investigators will collect a stool sample prior to fecal transplant and then at regular intervals following fecal transplant (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post-transplantation) to determine how a patient's gut microbiomes (via 16s sequencing) is affected by fecal transplantation.</description>

    <description>Enrolled and screened patients will receive a donor directed fecal transplant via retention enema. This procedure will take place at the University of California Irvine Women's Health Center on the day of the participant's choosing.
The day prior to the procedure, the participant will undergo a bowel prep and stop all prophylactic antibiotics. On the day of procedure, the patient will present to the clinic and undergo a simple, retention enema. This procedure takes about 30-40 minutes to complete and does not require any anesthesia or sedation.</description>
