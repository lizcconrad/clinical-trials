      The purpose of this study is to assess and determine the influence of pelvic inclination on
      sit to stand task in stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a crucial need to have a better understanding of effect of pelvic inclination on sit
      to stand activity and to know the important factors to be considered to improve the patients'
      treatment and performance. Forty five participants are recruiting to assess the pelvic tilt
      angles in stroke patients during sitting position and to analyze the influence of pelvic tilt
      angles on ability to perform sit to stand task during rising from a chair in stroke patients.
