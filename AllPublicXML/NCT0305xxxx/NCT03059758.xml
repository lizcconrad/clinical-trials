  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies to date that have examined the factors underlying math achievement in children
      have focused on basic numerical knowledge. Yet, math skills are clearly not limited to basic
      numerical knowledge and recent behavioral studies suggest a relationship between math and
      deductive reasoning skills. The goal of this study is to determine the neural mediators of
      this relationship using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The investigators will ask
      children from 8 to 14 to complete a standardized math achievement test, and measure their
      brain activity while they process deductive arguments. The investigators will then correlate
      brain activity during reasoning to individual math skills to identify the brain regions in
      which activity during reasoning is modulated by math skill.
