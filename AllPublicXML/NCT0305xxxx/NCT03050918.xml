  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to quantify the impact of post-hospital discharge follow-up phone
      calls on hospital readmission, ED visits, patient satisfaction, and mortality in a general
      medicine inpatient population. We will obtain exploratory information on patient sub-groups
      at high risk for hospital readmission and on those experiencing high benefit from the
      follow-up phone call intervention. In addition, we will obtain data on discharge plan
      implementation assistance needed to support a successful transition from inpatient to
      outpatient care among those reached by the intervention phone call.

      RATIONALE

      In the current medical literature, it is unclear how follow-up calls influence these outcomes
      in a general medical population. Some studies have attempted to address this question, but
      are limited in that they target very specific patient populations, are of insufficient
      quality, or evaluated follow-up calls as part of a larger care bundle. We will conduct a high
      quality, real-time clinical care study to determine the efficacy of a follow-up phone call
      program.

      STUDY DESIGN

      This is a single center, pragmatic, randomized, controlled clinical trial to investigate
      whether a structured post-hospital discharge follow-up phone call can improve patients'
      transition from in-hospital to outpatient care and improve satisfaction with their care. We
      will also identify the discharge implementation assistance given to those in the intervention
      (Phone Call) group.

      Outcome Measures Primary Outcome for this study is readmission event rate within 30 days.
      Secondary Outcomes include patient satisfaction which will be measured as mean Hospital
      Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) patient satisfaction scores,
      all cause VUMC emergency department (ED) visits, the need for assistance with discharge plan
      implementation, and 30 day mortality.

    <description>Follow-up phone call intervention: Patients will first be called within 72 hours discharge with a maximum of 3 call attempts by the study nurse made up until post-discharge day 7. The semi-structured script imbedded within the Discharge Phone Call Starform is used to guide a conversation to obtain information on potential causes of hospital readmission that can be identified and addressed to improve each patient's transition to outpatient care.</description>
