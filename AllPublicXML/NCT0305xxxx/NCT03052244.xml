    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) will be
      applied for patient who suffer from neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury The tDCS
      treatment will be coupled with a video of a man walking (creating a visual illusion) in order
      to enhance functional ability and reduce pain

    <textblock>
      Non-invasive cortical brain stimulation is a promising method for treating cases of
      neuropathic pain in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). Transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) appears to modulate cortical
      excitability and can reduce pain levels following SCI, however its effects remaining for
      short-term and may not be useful for the rehabilitation progress in these patients.

      Recent findings suggest that M1 stimulation combined with visual illusion (VI) enhances the
      reduction in pain which maintain up to 3 month following treatment. The current study aims to
      reveal whether reduction of neuropathic pain in patients with SCI through tDCS have
      beneficial effect on functional ability during rehabilitation program.

      In the present study the investigators will use anodal stimulation of the M1 via neuroConn DC
      stimulator. Current intensity of 2mA or sham stimulation will be given during 20 min in
      parallel to a visual illusion of walking legs (or neutral video for sham stimuli).

    <description>The anode will be placed over C3-C4 (EEG 10/20 system) to target M1 and the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital area. The stimulation will apply to the hemisphere which contralateral to the more painful hemi body. 2mA will be delivered over 20 min via neuroConn DC stimulator combined with video presenting walking legs. A total of 10 sessions (5 per week) will be administrated at the same manner.</description>
