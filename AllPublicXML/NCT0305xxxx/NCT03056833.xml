  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that concurrent ribociclib treatment and chemotherapy will enhance
      the response to platinum-based therapy and maintenance therapy will slow ovarian cancer tumor
      growth leading to prolongation in progression free survival.

    <time_frame>56 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be observed for the first two treatment cycles (2, 28 day cycles) and maximum tolerated dose will be determined.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants that respond to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) will be analyzed. The number of patients that respond to treatment (exhibit Partial Response (PR) or Complete Response (CR)) will be recorded. PR is defined as at least a 50% reduction in CA 125 levels (response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days) and/or at least 30% decrease in the sum diameters of target lesions. CR is defined as normalization of CA125 levels ((response must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days) and disappearance of all target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time from treatment until disease progression or death</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Progression is defined as one of the following:
Patients with elevated CA-125 pretreatment and normalization of CA-125 must show evidence of CA-125 greater than, or equal to, 2 times the upper limit of the reference range on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart or
Patients with elevated CA-125 before treatment, which never normalizes, must show evidence of CA-125 greater than, or equal to, 2 times the nadir value on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart or
Patients with CA-125 in the reference range before treatment must show evidence of CA-125 greater than, or equal to, 2 times the upper limit of the reference range on 2 occasions at least 1 week apart
Increase in at least 20% in sum of diameters of target lesions or any new lesions or unequivocal increase in non-target lesions.
Response determined via measurable disease (measurement of target and non-target lesions) takes precedence over CA125 criteria Stable Disease (SD): CA</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants encountering toxicity at each dose level</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will potentially be treated with 3 different dose levels of ribociclib in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>Ribociclib (LEE-011) will be used as concurrent therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.
