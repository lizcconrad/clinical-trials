  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess analgesic efficacy of ASP0819 relative to placebo as
      well as the safety and tolerability.

      This study will also assess treatment differences in physical function as well as the
      improvements in overall subject status (e.g., fibromyalgia symptoms and global functioning)
      of ASP0819 relative to placebo.
