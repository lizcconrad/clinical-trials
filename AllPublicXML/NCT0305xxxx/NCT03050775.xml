    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patients' temperatures after using one of two
      ventilator circuits (breathing systems): the ANAPOD™ Heat and Humidification System (ANAPOD™
      system) or the standard ventilator circuit with a heat-moisture exchanger (standard
      ventilator). The ANAPOD™ system will provide additional heat and humidity to patients through
      their breathing tube while the standard ventilator will not. The investigators are doing this
      research study to find out if the ventilator circuit providing additional heat and humidity
      will keep patients warmer during surgery and after surgery.

      Patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group prior to
      surgery. Prior to induction, patients in the control group were given inspiratory gas at
      ambient air temperature (20-22 degrees Celsius) and patients in the treatment group were
      given inspiratory gas at warmed temperatures (40-41 degrees Celsius). All patients were
      induced with general anesthesia in the supine position and repositioned prone following
      endotracheal intubation and placement of an esophageal stethoscope with a temperature sensor,
      as per usual hospital practice. Esophageal temperatures were recorded within 30 minutes of
      the baseline esophageal temperature and every 10 minutes thereafter for the first hour
      post-induction. All patients had a blanket and forced air warming applied to their lower
      extremities and upper back at 43 degrees Celsius after draping. All patients had esophageal
      temperature measurements recorded every 30 minutes until the patient was repositioned supine.
      Core temperatures were recorded four hours post-induction for those patients reaching that
      timeframe.

    <masking_description>Patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group prior to surgery. Group randomization was performed using a randomization schedule prepared by the Division of Clinical Statistics with patients randomized in blocks of four. For consented and enrolled patients on the day of surgery in the admit areas, a participant was assigned the next sequential participant ID number and the appropriate sealed envelope was opened to reveal the participant's randomized intervention. This occurred before the patient was transferred to the operating suite. Individuals who performed data analysis were blinded to treatment group.</masking_description>

There are six categories in the classification system, the higher the number, the more severe illness is indicated. I=normal healthy patient, II=patient with mild systemic disease, III=a patient with severe systemic disease, IV=a patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life, V=a moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the operation, VI=a declared brain-dead patient whose organs are being removed for donor purposes.</description>
