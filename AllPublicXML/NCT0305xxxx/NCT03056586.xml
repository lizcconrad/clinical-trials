  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genital prolapse is a common complain. 30-40% of women will complain of uterine prolapse or
      cystocele or rectocele, or mixed. About half of them will require surgical repair for the
      prolapse, with or without hysterectomy. Of these patients about 30-40% will have recurrence
      of the prolapse, which in some cases requires second operation.

      In this study the investigators want to investigate whether a vaginal pessary inserting in
      the end of the primary surgery, for 4 weeks, will reduce the recurrence rate.

    <textblock>
      All patients going for vaginal surgery for genital prolapse, stage 3-4, with cystocele,
      rectocele or uterine cervix prominent from the vagina. These patients, after signing an
      informed consent, a vaginal pessary will insert at the end of the operation and will stay for
      4 weeks post-op.

      After 4 weeks the pessary will be removed, and the patient will followed for 2 years, for
      recurrence of prolapse.
