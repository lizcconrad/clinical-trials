    <textblock>
      The data collection of physical evaluations after regular practice of the fencing at patients
      having surgically been treated for breast cancer highlighted encouraging results both on the
      functional drawing, and on the improvement of the quality of life.

    <textblock>
      Recent scientific works show that a regular physical activity decreases the rate of second
      offense of breast cancer from 20 to 50 % at the women beforehand treated for breast cancer.

      The objectives:

        -  participate as a supplement to the physiotherapist in the mobilization of the operated
           shoulder

        -  act in association with the surgical and medical team to release the adhesions
           superficial

        -  welcome these women hurt through a participative sports project

        -  get them a fencing adapted in a friendly atmosphere

        -  offer them personalized exchanges

        -  to propose a consequent energy expenditure but according to each and to the context

        -  have a practice of the operated side

        -  make them practise a sport with pleasure and without fatal effects

      By the practice of the sports activity, investigators wish to help these people upset in
      their life to find the joy of life, to have projects, to find some pleasure to share moments
      of user-friendliness. Having led a fight against the disease to help them to lead a new fight
      of fencer happy to have a practice.
