      The aim of our study was to evaluate the technical and clinical effectiveness of PTA in the
      management of ischemic foot ulcers. All consecutive patients presenting with a foot ulcer at
      the outpatient Vascular surgery clinic of our hospital were evaluated. If non-invasive
      parameters suggested peripheral arterial disease (PAD) anatomic imaging (CTA and/or DSA) was
      performed and a PTA was carried out when feasible during the same session. All patients were
      followed until healing, amputation, death, or for at least two years. Short-term and
      long-term clinical success of PTA was evaluated based on ulcer size and appearance. Patients
      with worsening ulcers after PTA underwent bypass grafting or amputation.

      The aim of our study was to evaluate the technical and clinical effectiveness of PTA in the
      management of ischemic foot ulcers.

      Methods: All consecutive patients presenting with a foot ulcer at the outpatient Vascular
      surgery clinic of our hospital were evaluated. Preoperative evaluation included foot pulse
      assessment, ankle-brachial-index (ABI) and duplex scanning. If non-invasive parameters
      suggested peripheral arterial disease (PAD) anatomic imaging (CTA and/or DSA) was performed
      and a PTA was carried out when feasible during the same session. All patients were followed
      until healing, amputation, death, or for at least two years. Short-term and long-term
      clinical success of PTA was evaluated based on ulcer size and appearance. Patients with
      worsening ulcers after PTA underwent bypass grafting or amputation.
