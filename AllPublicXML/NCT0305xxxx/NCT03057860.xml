  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) constitutes significant burden to patients, families, and healthcare
      systems.

      About 60% of all patients with AD are adults. Patients with moderate-to-severe AD cannot be
      sufficiently controlled with topical treatments alone and require intermittent or continuous
      treatment with systemic immunomodulating agents or UV-therapy.

      Systematic reviews indicate that although 12 different interventions for moderate-to-severe
      AD have been studied in clinical trials, strong recommendations are only possible for the
      short-term use of cyclosporin A (CSA).

      Methodological limitations in the majority of trials such as the choice of non-validated
      outcomes and outcomes that are not most relevant to patients prevent evidence-based clinical
      decision making.

      Pharmaceutical treatment of patients suffering from AD is diverse and frequently not in line
      with the current guidelines (for example S2-guideline in Germany).

      Systemic anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory therapies include several conventional
      immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticosteroids, CSA, methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine
      (AZA), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), and mycophenolate
      mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolate acid. Dupilumab is the first biologic treatment for AD with
      very promising results in clinical trials. Other biologic treatments are currently being
      developed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD.

      Large head-to-head trials are missing so that long-term effectiveness of systemic
      interventions for moderate-to-severe AD is speculative.

      In this situation, clinical registries can provide valuable information for evidence-based
      clinical decision making.

      Objectives: Establishment of a national evidence-based clinical registry and research network
      with the following objectives:

        1. Characterization of medical care and pharmaceutical therapies of adults suffering from
           moderate-to-severe AD. The perspective of the patient (utility, treatment goals, quality
           of life, and treatment satisfaction), sequence of treatments, and change of treatments
           will be a primary focus.

        2. Investigation of comparative effectiveness, tolerability and safety of systemic
           therapies for moderate-to-severe AD.

        3. Development of a platform for further investigations, such as pragmatic clinical trials,
           epidemiologic studies, outcomes research, immunologic and molecular research (given
           approval of responsible ethics commission).

      Study procedures:

      No study related intervention will be performed. Included patients will be prospectively
      followed for at least 24 months. A maximum duration of follow-up is not intended.

      During the observation period standardized study visits are performed to prospectively
      document patient characteristics, clinical data, patient-reported outcomes, physician's
      reasons for treatment decisions, and satisfaction with treatment.

      The first study visit is scheduled at patient inclusion (baseline-visit; V1). The second and
      third study visits are scheduled 3 and 6 months after baseline, respectively. (V2 after 3
      months, V3 after 6 months). Thereafter, study visits are scheduled after 3 months (if a new
      systemic treatment was initiated) or after 6 months (in case no new systemic treatment was
      prescribed).

      In a subset of patients biosamples for molecular analyses including blood, swabs and stool
      will be taken at baseline and at V6, as well as skin biopsies prior to and 3 months after
      systemic therapy initiation. This optional module requires separate patient information and
      informed consent.

      Data assessment:

      Prospective electronic documentation of disease course and severity, medical care and
      pharmaceutical treatment of AD.

      Pseudomized data will be stored at the registry center (Center for Evidence-based Healthcare,
      Dresden).

      Study assessments include:

        1. A short physician report form to document patient history and clinical parameters such
           as the objective severity of clinical signs, affected body regions, physician's global
           assessment of disease severity, course of disease and medical treatment of AD including
           adverse events.

        2. A patient report form to assess important subjective parameters, patient reported
           outcomes such as symptoms, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, patient's assessment
           of global disease severity, totally/partial well-controlled weeks.
