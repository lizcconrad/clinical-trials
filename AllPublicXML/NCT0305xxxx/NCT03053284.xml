      This is a small controlled pilot study to assess the effect of subcutaneous pasireotide on
      preventing hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism, including congenital hyperinsulinism and
      insulinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pasireotide is a somatostatin analog with affinity for several somatostatin receptors
      including those on pancreatic beta cells; when activated these receptors affect the secretion
      of glucagon and insulin. Pasireotide is also known to decrease glucagon-like peptide 1
      (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) secretion. Hyperglycemia is a
      well-documented adverse effect of pasireotide in its approved indications for treatment of
      Cushing's disease and acromegaly.

      In light of this, the investigators hypothesize that pasireotide may be an effective therapy
      for hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism. Therefore a small controlled pilot study to assess
      the effect of subcutaneous (s.c.) pasireotide on preventing hypoglycemia due to
      hyperinsulinism over 7 hours of observation in both fasting and fed states is proposed.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Male or female patients aged 18 to 70 years old

          2. Patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia due to either congenital hyperinsulinemic
             hypoglycemia or insulinoma, as determined by an endocrinologist

          3. If no prior diagnosis of either insulinoma or congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
             by an endocrinologist, the participant must meet the following criteria:

               -  A history of symptoms of hypoglycemia, (with or without a blood glucose &lt;50mg/dL
                  at time of symptoms)

               -  Improvement of symptoms with ingestion of carbohydrates

               -  At least one documented blood glucose &lt;50mg/dL with concomitant insulin &gt;3 mmol/L
                  and c-peptide &gt;0.2nmol/L, with a negative sulfonylurea screen

               -  At least 1 episode of glucose &lt;50mg/dL in the last year

          4. Written informed consent obtained prior to treatment to be consistent with local
             regulatory requirements

          5. No evidence of significant liver disease:

               -  Serum total bilirubin &lt; 2 x ULN

               -  INR &lt; 1.3 unless on anticoagulation

             treated with anti-hypoglycemic therapy are also eligible

          8. Patients with insulinoma who are operative candidates are eligible if surgery is not
             emergently needed, and study participation would not delay the timing of a surgical
             intervention

        Exclusion criteria:

         10. History of another primary malignancy, with the exception of locally excised
             non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of uterine cervix unless there is no

             this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to
             prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
