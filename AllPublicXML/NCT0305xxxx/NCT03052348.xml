  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease that occurs most
      commonly during early infancy and childhood. It is frequently associated with abnormalities
      in skin barrier function, allergen sensitization and recurrent skin infections. AD is a major
      public health problem worldwide, with prevalence in children of 10-20% and 2-5% of the
      general population. The skin of AD patients is susceptible to colonization and infection with
      Staphylococcus aureus (SA )which contribute significantly to the severity of the clinical
      manifestations of eczema, triggering a vicious cycle.

      Fusidic Acid (FA) cream is a topical antibiotic widely used in the treatment of skin and soft
      tissue infections and infected atopic dermatitis. However in recent years, the emergence of
      drug-resistant organisms, e.g. Methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has led to
      scrutiny of antibiotic use. Prolonged use of topical FA has been linked with emergence of
      FA-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (FRSA) . Fusidic acid is a natural antibiotic, extracted
      from cultures of Fusidium coccineum, which has a powerful antibacterial action. Topical use
      of Fusidic acid is fully in line with therapeutic strategies that recommend the use of an
      antibiotic with the narrowest activity spectrum to minimize the risk of resistance. In AD
      with infected lesions, combined treatment with antibiotic and steroid demonstrates greater
      efficacy over the use of steroid.

      Trial Design: A three-center, double blind, randomized ,phase II , parallel group, efficacy
      trial.

      Type of Intervention: A triple compounded cream containing a topical antibiotic , topical
      steroid and moisturizer.

      Type of control: Active control containing a double compounded cream comprising a topical
      steroid and moisturizer .

      Study population and Setting: A sample of 78 subjects will be recruited from Red Cross
      Children's Hospital , Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital and King Edward Hospital Estimated
      duration of trial: 12 months. Duration of participation: Each subject will participate in the
      trial for a maximum of 140 days.

      Primary endpoint: reduction in SCORAD scores; frequency of clinical flares for AD and
      improvement in the quality of life at 140 days.

      The benefit of this trial is that it provides a simple and effective approach to the
      management of atopic eczema.
