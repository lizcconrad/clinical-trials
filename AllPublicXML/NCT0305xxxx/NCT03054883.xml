  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of treatment of patients
      with newly dg. mantle cell lymphoma not eligible for high-dose therapy and autologous stem
      cell transplantation. Scheme of treatment: alternating cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab,
      cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, oncovin, prednison) and R-AraC (rituximab, cytarabin):
      R-CHOP / R-AraC / R-CHOP / R-AraC / R-CHOP / R-AraC. The study was proposed based on the
      previously published data in the younger patients, which demonstrated improved outcome after
      implementation of Ara-C into induction.

      This is an observational study considered for patients with mantle cell lymphoma meeting the
      basic inclusion criteria. The study will enrol patients who will be treated according to
      standard protocol used in the hematologic department. Scheme of treatment: alternating cycles
      of R-CHOP and R-AraC: R-CHOP / R-AraC / R-CHOP / R-AraC / R-CHOP / R-AraC.

      Baseline procedures:

        -  CT or PET-CT (positron emission tomography with computed tomography)before starting
           treatment, after 3 cycles and at the end of treatment (after 6 cycles)

        -  bone marrow examination before therapy, after 3 cycles and after completion of induction

        -  maintenance rituximab based of standards of each centre

      The study was proposed based on the previously published data in the younger patients, which
      demonstrated improved outcome after implementation of Ara-C into induction.

      Primary objectives include response after induction by PET-CT and PFS (progression-free
      survival).

      Secondary objectives include OS (overall survival), and prognostic significance of minimal
      residual disease detection after completion of induction
