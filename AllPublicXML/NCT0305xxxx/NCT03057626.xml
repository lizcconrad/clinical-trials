    <textblock>
      This research trial studies late effects after treatment in patients with previously
      diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma. Studying late effects after treatment may help to decide
      which treatments for high-risk neuroblastoma are better tolerated with less side effects over
      time.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the prevalence of organ dysfunction, subsequent malignant neoplasm (SMN),
      growth impairment, abnormal pubertal development, and neurobehavioral dysfunction in a large
      cohort of representative 5-year survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma treated with modern
      therapy.

      II. To identify the demographic, clinical and treatment-related risk factors associated with
      increased risk of organ dysfunction, SMN, growth impairment, abnormal pubertal development
      and neurobehavioral dysfunction in long-term survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma.

      III. To explore the impact of new biologic therapies and diagnostics including immunotherapy,
      immunocytokines, isotretinoin (cis-retinoic acid) and iobenguane I-131 (131 I-MIBG) on the
      risk of late effects.

      IV. To determine the impact of impaired organ function, physical growth, pubertal
      development, and neurobehavioral function on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in
      long-term survivors of high-risk neuroblastoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a cohort of high-risk neuroblastoma survivors, with stored peripheral blood
      samples, who were treated with multi-modal therapies since the year 2000 as a resource for
      future investigation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood and urine samples on day 1. Patients also undergo
      clinical assessments, laboratory, radiographic, and other ancillary studies on day 1.

    <description>Will calculate as the number of patients with SMN divided by the number with known status of that endpoint. Will be analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistics: mean, standard deviation, quartiles for continuous endpoints, proportions and confidence intervals for binary, ordinal, and categorical endpoints. Using data from ANBL00B1, a descriptive comparison will be performed of patients who did not enroll on the study versus those who did enroll, in terms of standard clinical and biological neuroblastoma risk factors from the time of diagnosis.</description>

                  received therapy for refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma, or treatment for an
                  SMN; however all cytotoxic anti-neuroblastoma therapy should have been
                  administered &gt;= 2 years of the enrollment date; SMN therapy may be completed or
                  ongoing at the time of enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

             chemotherapy

          -  Patients must not have received anti-neuroblastoma cytotoxic chemotherapy within the
             last two years

               -  Note: cytotoxic therapies include (but are not limited to) chemotherapy (platinum
                  agents, alkylators, anthracyclines, topoisomerases, vinca alkaloids, other
                  cytotoxic chemotherapy), any kind of transplant, MIBG therapy, and/or radiation
                  therapy

               -  Non-cytotoxic (biologic/targeted/differentiating/other) therapies are permitted
                  at the time of enrollment; for example, patients receiving oral differentiating
                  agents, antiangiogenic therapy, immune modulators, holistic therapies,
                  difluoromethylornithine (DMFO), other minimal residual disease (MRD)
                  therapies/relapse-prevention therapies are eligible

          -  Patients with current active neuroblastoma relapse are ineligible

          -  The patient or a parent/guardian must have receptive and expressive language skills in
             English, French, or Spanish since the assessment instruments are available in these
