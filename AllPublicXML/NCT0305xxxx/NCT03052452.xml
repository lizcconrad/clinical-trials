      The proposed My Nutritional Health (MNH) app is a unique tool for consumers interested in
      tracking their food intake and linking diet to symptoms.

      The investigators will test this app for developmental purposes among a sample of 100
      participants who are patients of dieticians at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) and the
      University of Michigan (UM) with varying presentation of GI symptoms and suspected food
      intolerances. The MNH app will be used as a data collection platform for this study and can
      be utilized by any device supporting iOS (tablets, ipads, iphones, and Android. The
      investigators will use the data collected in the app testing to develop population level FAST
      scores.

      The MNH app includes two integrated functions:

        1. Patient Symptom and Food Consumption Reporting

        2. FAST Score calculation It is important to note that, per this protocol, the MNH app will
           only be evaluated for developmental purposes. It is currently not meant to serve as a
           diagnostic tool, nor to provide referrals for patients with food and symptom patterns
           that may suggest a food intolerance. In this respect, our test app is not governed by
           FDA or other regulatory bodies, as it does not make diagnoses or offer specific
           guidance. The purpose of this study is only to develop normative scoring distributions
           of FAST within the context of patients visiting GI dieticians as part of routine care.

      The study aims are:

      AIM 1 - To validate FAST Instrument against existing patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures.

      AIM 2 - To assess sensitivity of FAST instrument to changes in patient diet.

      Investigators will collect information about food intake and related symptoms using the MNH
      App, for validating the FAST instrument, and assessing its sensitivity to change in patient
      diet. For this study, 100 participants who are scheduled to see dieticians at either
      Cedars-Sinai Medical Center or the University of Michigan will be recruited.

      You will be asked to report information regarding your food intake for two weeks (one week
      pre- and post-dietician visit). The MNH app will prompt you (through push notifications) at
      three time points during each day, asking you to log into the app to report food intake and
      any physical symptoms that you are experiencing. Investigators will reach out to you on day
      3, during the first week of enrollment via telephone to inquire about your progress, assist
      in trouble shooting for technical difficulties, and answer any questions you may have.

      At the end of each week, you will be asked to respond to a standardized questionnaire about
      GI symptoms (the 15-item Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale; GSRS)(1) and a questionnaire
      about general health status (the PROMIS-10, a 10-item questionnaire developed by NIH-PROMIS,
      the National Institutes of Health - Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System)
      through the MNH mobile app.

        Patients will be identified from those who have made new patient appointments with
        dieticians at CSMC and UM. Patients will be recruited by email by the dietician
        approximately two weeks before their scheduled appointments. If interested, they will be
        asked to click on a link to a website to check eligibility, review and complete consent
        forms, and answer general demographic and clinical questions. The site guide patients to
        download the MNH App required for the study after the patient has reviewed the online
        consent, and selected &quot;Yes&quot; to all assurances. Since this study is app-based, participants
        must have modern smartphones with internet access to be eligible for study participation.
