    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the combination of a study drug, venetoclax, and a standard
      chemotherapy regimen, EPOCH-R, as a possible treatment for Richter's Syndrome.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Venetoclax

        -  EPOCH-R:

        -  Etoposide

        -  Prednisone

        -  Vincristine Sulfate (Oncovin)

        -  Cyclophosphamide

        -  Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Hydroxydaunomycin)

        -  Rituximab

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      Tumor cells from patients with Richter's Syndrome are often resistant to chemotherapy. One
      reason for this may be that a protein called BCL-2 can prevent cancer cells from dying after
      being exposed to chemotherapy. Venetoclax is an oral drug that specifically targets BCL-2. It
      has already been shown to be highly effective at killing tumor cells from CLL patients whose
      cells are resistant to chemotherapy, leading to its FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration) approval for these patients. A small number of patients with Richter's
      Syndrome have been treated with venetoclax as a single drug, and some of these patients had
      improvement of their cancer with this treatment.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether adding venetoclax to a
      standard chemotherapy regimen, R-EPOCH, will help this chemotherapy work better to more
      effectively kill tumor cells in patients with Richter's Syndrome. Venetoclax is not approved
      for Richter's Syndrome or for use in combination with chemotherapy, which is why its use in
      this trial is considered to be investigational.
