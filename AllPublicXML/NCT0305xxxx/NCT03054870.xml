      Phase 3 within-subject non-inferiority trial of Technegas ventilation imaging compared to
      Xenon-133 (Xe-133) ventilation imaging to demonstrate the non-inferiority of Technegas
      compared to Xe-133 ventilation studies with respect to subject pulmonary ventilatory
      distribution. Subjects will undergo site-specific standard of care (SOC) Xe-133 imaging per
      medical needs followed by Technegas ventilation imaging per study protocol.

      This is a Phase 3 within-subject non-inferiority trial of Technegas ventilation imaging
      compared to Xenon-133 (Xe-133) ventilation imaging to demonstrate the non-inferiority of
      Technegas compared to Xe-133 ventilation studies with respect to subject pulmonary
      ventilatory distribution. Subjects will undergo site-specific standard of care (SOC) Xe-133
      imaging per medical needs followed by Technegas ventilation imaging per study protocol.
      Primary assessments of efficacy will be based on three blinded readers' assessments of the
      Technegas and Xe-133 ventilation images in independent reading sessions.

          -  Subject must be willing and able to provide informed consent.

          -  Subject must be stable and able to undergo Xe-133 planar imaging and Technegas planar
             imaging.

          -  Subject must be willing and agree to complete study procedures, including returning
             for all 24-hour follow-up safety assessments, such as physical examination and

             test.

          -  Subject has had or is scheduled to have a chest X-ray within 24 hours prior to the
             investigational imaging study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has been administered any other radiopharmaceutical within a timeframe that
             might cause interference with study imaging.

          -  Subject is a pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Subject has received Technegas in the past.

          -  Subject has received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to dosing.

          -  Subject is hemodynamically unstable.
