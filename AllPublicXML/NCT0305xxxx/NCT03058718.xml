    <description>Patients were divided into 2 subgroups:
No infection group (including patients with procalcitonin&lt;0.1 ng/ml at enrollment, and patients with 0.1 ng/ml ≤procalcitonin ≤0.25 ng/ml at enrollment who are with stable respiratory and hemodynamics, and without serious complications) : the group is not given the application of antibiotics.
Infection group (including patients with procalcitonin&gt;0.25 ng/ml at the time of enrollment, and patients with 0.1 ng/ml ≤ procalcitonin≤0.25 ng/ml at enrollment who have severe disease, unstable hemodynamics, and severe complications or intensive care unit treatment): the group is given the application of antibiotics. According to the guidelines for severe sepsis / septic shock treatment, the standard for discontinuation of antimicrobial agents: If the procalcitonin level falls below &lt;0.1 ng/ml or more than 80%, compared with the baseline before enrollment, it is recommended to discontinue the antimicrobial agent.</description>
