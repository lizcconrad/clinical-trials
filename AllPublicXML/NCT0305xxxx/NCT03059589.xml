  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this patient registry is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of food oral
      immunotherapy in food allergic patients. Factors that lead to adverse reactions will be
      identified. The frequency of rescue epinephrine use will be recorded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each participating US clinic is assigned a site number and patients starting food oral
      immunotherapy will be given a four digit number starting at 0001 within each site. All data
      will be collected and reported electronically at each clinical site.
