  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to further elucidate the genetic mutations that drive
      melanocytic nevi (benign melanocytic neoplasms, moles). This will be performed by whole
      genome, whole exome, or targeted sequencing of de-identified specimens.

      Herein, the investigators plan to isolate DNA from de-identified skin biopsy specimens and
      blood samples:

        1. From melanocytic nevi collected by skin biopsy (a shave or punch biopsy). A part of the
           tissue will be submitted for routine diagnostic dermatopathology and investigational
           histomorphologic and immunohistochemical analysis.

        2. From corresponding normal tissue (blood). DNA isolated from blood will be used as a
           normal control when analyzing sequencing data to identify somatic mutations in lesional
           tissue.

        Subjects seen in UC Davis dermatology clinic diagnosed as having melanocytic nevi will be
        recruited from the clinic during their routine visit. Subjects identified in clinic will be
        approached after their clinic visit.
