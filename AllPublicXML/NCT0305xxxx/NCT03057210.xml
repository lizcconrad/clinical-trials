  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Post-exercise recovery techniques have been extensively investigated in order
      to optimize the restoration of various body functions and consequently of performance.
      Massage represents approximately 45% of the time spent by a sports physiotherapist in the
      field, however, their mechanisms are not well established and studies present divergent
      results in the literature.

      Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyze and compare the effects of massage when
      applied immediately or 1 hour after physical exertion, on functional, clinical and metabolic
      variables.

      Design: A cross-over randomized clinical trial.

      Participants: Forty men aged 18 to 30 years, healthy and that fulfilling the eligibility
      criteria.

      Procedures: Participants will be randomized into five groups (n = 8 per group): (GA, GB, GC,
      GD and GE), which will perform the 5 stages of the study at randomized times, one stage per
      session. Stage 1: control; Stage 2: Participants will receive the massage protocol; Stage 3:
      physical exercise protocol; Stage 4: Participants will perform the physical exercise protocol
      and immediately after, will receive the massage; Stage 5: Participants will perform the
      physical exercise protocol and 1 hour after the end of the exercise they will receive the
      massage. Sessions will occur with a 1-week interval between them.

      Measurements. The primary outcome measures will be measured 2h after the start of each stage,
      and the secondary outcome measures will be measured at specific times during each stage. The
      primary outcome includes measures of functional performance, and the measures of secondary
      outcome includes clinical and metabolic variables.

      Introduction: Post-exercise recovery techniques have been extensively investigated in order
      to optimize the restoration of various body functions and consequently of performance.
      Massage represents approximately 45% of the time spent by a sports physiotherapist in the
      field, however, their mechanisms are not well established and studies present divergent
      results in the literature.

      Objectives: The objective of this study is to analyze the magnitude of the effects of massage
      on functional, clinical and metabolic variables. The secondary objective is to compare the
      effect of manual massage as a post-exercise recovery technique applied at different times (1.
      Immediately after physical exertion; 2. 1 hour after the end of intense exercise) on the
      functional, clinical and metabolic outcomes of physically active subjects

      Design: A cross-over randomized clinical trial.

      Participants: After fulfilling the eligibility criteria, forty male participants will
      participate in the study. The inclusion criteria include: healthy male, aged between 18-30
      years, with level of physical activity within the group average. The exclusion criteria
      include: presence of anemia, inflammatory process, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
      alcoholics, smokers, users of illicit drugs, chronic users of anti-inflammatory drugs and
      occurrence of muscle injuries in the lower limbs and/or trunk in the last six months.

      Procedures: Participants will be randomized into five groups (n = 8 per group): (GA, GB, GC,
      GD and GE), which will perform the 5 stages of the study at randomized times, one stage per
      session. Stage 1: control; Stage 2: Participants will receive the massage protocol; Stage 3:
      physical exercise protocol; Stage 4: Participants will perform the physical exercise protocol
      and immediately after, will receive the massage; Stage 5: Participants will perform the
      physical exercise protocol and 1 hour after the end of the exercise they will receive the
      massage. Sessions will occur with a 1-week interval between them.

      Intervention: The first three stages of the study (E1, E2 and E3) will be performed to know
      the basal behavior of the study variables and / or before the two different stimuli (massage
      and physical exercise). In stages 4 and 5 will be performed the analysis of the effects of
      massage on post-exercise recovery, and the comparison of the effects of massage when
      performed immediately after exertion or 1 hour after exertion. The sequence of performance of
      the functional tests will always be the same, regardless of the stage of the study, being the
      following order: 1st Vertical Jump Test; 2º Maximum Isometric Voluntary

      Measurements. The primary outcome measures will be measured 2h after the start of each stage,
      and the secondary outcome measures will be measured at specific times during each stage. The
      primary measures includes the Strength and power test, Maximal voluntary isometric
      contraction (MVIC) and Squat jump. The secondary measures includes the subjective pain
      assessment, perception of recovery, psychological questionnaire, belief questionnaire and de
      analysis blood lactate concentration.

      Analysis: The normality of the data will be evaluated through the Shapiro-Wilk test. For the
      analysis of the clinical, functional and metabolic parameters between the groups in the case
      of normal distribution, one-way ANOVA with post-test of Tukey and Kruskal-Wallis will be
      adopted with Dunn post-test if there is no normal distribution. For the analysis of these
      parameters, however, within the groups (moments of analysis) will be used ANOVA for repeated
      measurements with Tukey post-test for normal data and Friedman's test with Dunn post-test for
      non-normal data. The level of significance was set at p &lt;0.05 for all tests.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Squat jump</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; and 2h after the stress protocol.</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will make a jump keeping the knees extended (180º of angulation) and back until touching the platform again. He will start by the position with the soles of the feet in contact with the heel platform (Multisprint, Hidrofit, Brazil), hands at the waist, erect trunk and lower limbs flexed at 90º. Three complete tests with a 30-second rest interval will be performed between each repetition. The best measurement of jump height will be adopted.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>In Stage 1 (Baseline), Immediately 2h after the initiation of the massage protocol in Stage 2, and Immediately 2h after the initiation of the stress protocol in Stages 3, 4 and 5.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be positioned with the dominant leg on the isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 4 Pro, New York, USA). As suggested in the protocol by Baroni et al., 201015, prior to the MVIC evaluation, participants will conduct a warm up consisting of 10 repetitions of knee flexion-extension at 180°.s-1 throughout the range of motion. The MVIC will be determined by the highest maximal isometric torque over three contractions of five seconds at 60° of knee flexion (with 0° corresponding to the maximum extension). The repetitions will be separated by a 2-minute rest interval. Participants will be instructed to perform maximal contractions and verbally encouraged by the researcher during the evaluation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength and power test</measure>
    <time_frame>In Stage 1 (Baseline), Immediately 2h after the initiation of the massage protocol in Stage 2, and Immediately 2h after the initiation of the stress protocol in Stages 3, 4 and 5.</time_frame>
    <description>With a vertical squat with a guided bar the strength and power tests will be performed. The participant should perform a squatting in continuous motion until the legs reach the 90° angle, and then perform the opposite movement, returning to the upright position. Participants will wear a protective belt. The distance taken eccentrically and the concentric velocity of each repetition will be recorded by means of a linear velocity transducer (T-Force System, Ergotech, Murcia, Spain). The mean velocity of the eccentric phase will be controlled (approximately 0,5 m/s) and in the concentric phase the velocity will be maximum.</description>

    <time_frame>In Stage 1 (Baseline), Immediately before the initiation of the massage protocol in Stage 2, and Immediately before the initiation of the stress protocol in Stages 3, 4 and 5.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a psychological questionnaire that aims to document, subjectively, the readiness for exercise, fatigue, vigor, sleepiness, and pain. Participants will be instructed to mark an &quot;X&quot; on a 10-cm visual analog scale between two extremes, with 'zero' corresponding to 'least possible' and '10' 'most possible' for each rating.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Belief Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before the initiation of the stress protocol in Stages 4 and 5.</time_frame>
    <description>It is a questionnaire designed to measure a belief about an effectiveness of the technique that is exposed. Participants were instructed to respond with &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Do not Know&quot; the following question: &quot;Do you have a massage will be beneficial to your muscle recovery after intense exercise?&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <description>Participants will be submitted to an exercise protocol consisting of a jumping program and a maximum short cycle test (ALMEIDAetal). The jumping program consists of 10 sets of 10 jumps with one minute interval between sets. The participants will then perform the Wingate Anaerobic Test protocol, which will be performed on a Biotec 2100 cycle ergometer (Cefise, Nova Odessa, Brazil). A 5-minute warm-up will be carried out where the participant will pedal at a speed of 60 to 90 rpm with a fixed load of 1.0 kg and perform sprints in the 2nd and 4th minute and the test itself, which consists of a maximum of pedals In 30 seconds with a stipulated load of 0.075 kP · kg-1 of the participant's body mass.</description>

    <description>the present protocol will have a total of 12 minutes duration, being six minutes in the anterior region of the thigh (three minutes for each limb) and six minutes in the posterior region of the trunk.
Surface and deep sliding techniques will be used, the latter being presented in two intensities, moderate or intense, gradually increased. The massage will be performed towards the muscle fibers, from distal to proximal and following the lymphatic flow. In addition to the standardization of the intensity of the massage performed by the physiotherapist, in order to avoid causing discomfort and possible variations in the application of the technique, participants should report their level of comfort from a scale that considers the technique &quot;light&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;Intense&quot;, corresponding respectively to surface slip, Deep Slip 1 and Deep Slip 2.</description>
