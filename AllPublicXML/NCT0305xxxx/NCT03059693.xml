  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by a disturbance
      of epidermal-barrier function that results in intensely pruritic subacute and chronic
      eczematous plaques. As the most common cause of chronic inflammatory skin diseases, AD is a
      major cause of morbidity and suffering, affecting upto 30% of children, and increasing in
      prevalence throughout the world. It is estimated that the direct cost of AD in the US alone
      ranged from $0.9 billion to $3.8 billion every year. The current therapy of AD is reactive,
      where the flares are treated through symptomatic management with topical corticosteroids and
      calcineurin inhibitors. Given that these medications have long-term side-effects, and given
      the chronically relapsing immunopathogenic nature of AD, there is an imperative need for
      safer anti-inflammatory medications. Haus Bioceuticals (Haus) has developed a topical
      treatment for eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD) denoted HAT1, and have demonstrated that HAT1 is
      safe and profoundly effective in the treatment of AD, controlling signs and symptoms in 85%
      of patients with AD. This study is aimed to further evaluate the potential of developing HAT1
      as an integral part of AD therapy.

      This study is a 17 week (119 days) randomized, double-blind, in home use study among 48 male
      and female subjects with moderate to severe active atopic dermatitis (AD). The study will
      include subjects with ages 12 - 65 years old inclusive. Group assignments will be balanced by
      disease severity, age, and body location of AD lesions (listed in order of importance). The
      study will consist of a 1 week washout period, 12 week treatment phase and a 4 week
      regression phase. During the treatment phase, subject will be provided one of the two test
      products to use twice daily on all lesions and non-lesional areas as instructed. No
      additional creams, lotions or soaps other than provided test products will be allowed
      throughout the duration of the study. Measurements, expert visual assessments and
      self-assessments will be taken as described below. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated
      by incidence of AE's (defined per CTCAE), exacerbations, application site
      reactions/infections, and lab evals. There will also be consumption/compliance checks and
      dermatological evaluations at each visit.

    <masking_description>The Sponsor will send all washout and test products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices directly to the clinical facility prior to the start of the study. Study procedures will be in place to ensure double-blind administration of study treatments. Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled. The quantity of all study material shipped to the clinical facility will be documented on the shipping and receiving form included within the shipment. Due to the objectives of the study, the identity of test and control treatments will not be known to investigators, care provider, outcomes assessor, research staff, or patients. Packaging and labeling of test and control treatments will be identical to maintain the blind. Products will be identified with the codes generated by the randomization.</masking_description>
