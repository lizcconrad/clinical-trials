    <textblock>
      Single-blind, randomised, single centre, 2-way crossover study to collect post-market
      clinical follow-up data on the CE-marked Lamelleye dry eye drops medical device.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 2-way crossover design comprising 2 treatments: the CE-marked Lamelleye dry
      eye drops, and a CE-marked comparator product. All Participants will be allocated to a
      treatment group in a random order.

      This study design allows observations to be made between the treatments at both an intra- and
      inter-patient level regarding relationships between the patients' disease specific quality of
      life, symptoms and adverse events.
