    <textblock>
      Aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the correlation between postoperative
      spirometry values and pulmonary complications after anatomic lung resections. In addition,
      the investigators compared postoperative pulmonary function changes between open and
      minimally invasive approaches.

      All patients undergoing an anatomical lung resection at the investigators' institution were
      evaluated for this study. Underage patients and those undergoing extended resections
      (including resection of the chest wall and/or diaphragm) and/or bronchoplastic procedures
      were excluded.

      In every eligible patient undergoing an anatomic lung resection, preoperative spirometry was
      performed using a handheld spirometer on the day before surgery and on every second day after
      surgery was performed until patient discharge. The absolute values of FEV1 were recorded by
      an independent study nurse and noted on a separate sheet not available to the treating
      doctors.

      At the end of the study period FEV1 values were evaluated especially with focus on their
      correlation with postoperative pulmonary complications (i.e. pneumonia, acute exacerbation of
      COPD, air leak and atelectasis). Furthermore lung function values of patients undergoing
      'open' resections were compared with patients undergoing minimally invasive resections.
