    <textblock>
      The aim is to examine whether intranasal oxytocin will influence the individuals' emotion
      regulation ability and related neural mechanisms.

      In the present study, the investigators plan to conduct a between-subject, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled experiment to investigate the effects of oxytocin on neural, physiological
      and behavior activity related to emotion regulation. The emotion regulation ability will be
      assessed by emotional go-nogo task and cognitive reappraisal task. The neural activity will
      be explored by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). And the investigators will
      record participants' heart rate during fMRI to investigate the effects of oxytocin on heart
      rate variability in emotion regulation process.

      All subjects completed a range of questionnaires measuring personality and affective traits
      and levels of anxiety before self-administration, including Positive and Negative Affect
      Schedule (PANAS) , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) , Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
      Cheek and Buss shyness Scale (CBSS), Autism Spectrum Quotient (ASQ), Empathy Quotient (EQ),
      Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), Action Control Scale (ACS), Emotion Regulation
      Questionnaire (ERQ), Berkley Expressivity Questionnaire (BEQ), and so on.
