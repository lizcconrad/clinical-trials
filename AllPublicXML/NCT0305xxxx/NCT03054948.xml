  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soybean oil based IV fat emulsion (IVFE) has been one of the sole sources of IVFE in the US.
      Soybean oil based IVFE has higher ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids and can be
      associated with a number of complications including inflammation, abnormal liver function
      tests (reflecting steatosis, cholestasis, etc.), and metabolic abnormalities. Recently the
      FDA has approved SMOFlipid which contains a mixture of soybean oil, medium chain
      triglycerides, olive oil, and fish oil. It provides a more positive ratio of omega-3 to
      omega-6 fatty acids and has been shown in short term trials to be beneficial in cases of
      intolerance to soybean oil IVFE. This study is designed to investigate the impact of
      SMOFlipid in prolonged use.
