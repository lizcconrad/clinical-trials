  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a tissue bank library for patients with parathyroid disease who have undergone
      surgery and/or biopsy, and/or who may undergo surgical intervention at M. D. Anderson Cancer
      Center or outside centers, and/or all patients seen through the Parathyroid Center at
      participating sites, whether or not the patients undergo treatment for their disease. The
      tissue bank will contain both normal parathyroid tissue and diseased tissue, and will provide
      a resource for the ongoing study of parathyroid disease and management.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fresh residual tissue samples will be obtained during parathyroid and/or pancreas tumor
      intervention (for pancreas tumor intervention in MEN1 patients with hyperparathyroidism and
      pancreatic lesions).

      In addition, outside paraffin tissue blocks or slides will be requested from patients
      presenting to MDACC, or to participating family members who have had prior surgery outside of
      MD Anderson.

      Forty cubic centimeters (40 ccs) of whole blood will be obtained from individuals for
      peripheral blood lymphocyte, plasma, and serum separation and analysis per event. Collections
      may be made at any or all of the following timepoints: preoperatively, during intervention,
      and/or at subsequent follow-up visits for up to fifteen years.

             who have been diagnosed with parathyroid disease and who have had surgery at other
             centers, and who provide a signed authorization to obtain the tissue from outside
             facilities AND/OR who begin care at MD Anderson and will be having intervention at MD
             Anderson.
