  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can result in right ventricular failure and death.
      Anakinra has been used in patients with left sided heart failure, and the present study looks
      to determine if anakinra is safe and effective in patients with PAH. To accomplish this goal,
      we plan to evaluate for exercise improvement (as assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing) in 10 patients with PAH on anakinra.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension will undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing
      (CPET) at baseline and at 2 weeks. After the initial CPET, all patients will receive anakinra
      as a daily injection for 2 weeks. Patients will be instructed in the use of anakinra during
      their initial visit. Our primary outcome will be the difference in the exercise capacity of
      patients with PAH, as measured by maximal uptake of oxygen on CPET.

    <description>Patients will be treated with anakinra, injected SQ daily in a dose of 100mg for 14 days. Before and after this intervention, patients will undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing (as well as echocardiography, EKG analysis, and serologic analysis). Subjects will be assessed for changes in exercise capacity, as determined by peak oxygen uptake and ventilatory efficiency to CO2 production slope.</description>
