    <textblock>
      This is an interventional and prospective study. The study is designed to evaluate the
      additional benefits of a combination of IPL treatment and local application of Bromonide
      0.33% gel in the treatment of erythematotelangiectatic (ETR) and papulopustular (PPR).

    <textblock>
      Patients would be treated with full face application of bromonide 0.33% gel once daily for
      three months. In addition half of the patients' face would be subjected to three IPL
      treatment sessions three weeks apart from each other.
