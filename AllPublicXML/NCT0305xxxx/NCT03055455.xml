  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In critically ill children with severe sepsis, neurophysiologic derangements often proceed
      undetected and can lead to irreversible brain injury causing neurocognitive and behavioral
      deficits. The etiology of these impairments is unclear, however, it is likely that some of
      this neural injury is preventable. The overarching goal for this study is to show that acute
      acquired structural and microstructural brain injury occurs in critically ill children with
      severe sepsis, and that this injury is related to neuropsychological deficits and impaired
      cerebral autoregulation (CAR). Subjects will complete Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging within
      2-10 days of recognition of their severe sepsis. Subjects will undergo serial interrogation
      of CAR for up to 10 days. CAR will be determined by the correlation of arterial blood
      pressure with middle cerebral artery flow velocity measured by transcranial doppler
      ultrasonography and cerebral oximetry derived from near-infrared spectroscopy. Subjects will
      also participate in a neuropsychological evaluation 6 months after enrollment to evaluate
      multiple domains of behavior and cognition.
