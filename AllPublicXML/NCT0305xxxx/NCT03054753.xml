  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The postoperative shoulder rehabilitation in an abduction brace after rotator cuff
      reconstruction of the shoulder is crucial for a successful healing of the reconstruction.

      In this study the investigators want to analyse the abduction brace-wearing time using a
      electronic sensor, which is implanted in the abduction brace. The participants will be
      informed about the sensor after completion of the abduction brace rehabilitation 6 weeks
      postoperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After arthroscopic reconstruction of a rotator cuff tear the healing depends on a tension
      free positioning of the reconstructed tendon. Therefore a abduction brace is administered
      routinely for 6 weeks. The re-rupture rate of rotator cuff reconstruction is about 30%. One
      of the reason may be mechanical overuse caused by non wearing of the abduction brace. From
      experience the investigators suggest that the abduction brace wearing behaviour differs among
      patients. The participant´s wearing compliance has been evaluated by Silverio et al. with a
      questionary but never with a sensor. In this study the investigators want to analyse the
      participant´s abduction brace wearing compliance by using an sensor, which is implanted in
      the abduction brace and monitors the wearing time, which reveals the objective wearing time.

      The sensor is a certificated sensor, which measures temperature in °C every 15 min. If the
      abduction brace is worn by the participants the body temperature can be captured by the
      sensor. If the measured temperature is over 33°C the sensor capture the time period as a
      &quot;worn&quot; time. With this measurements the abduction brace wear time should be captured
      objectively. A similar kind of sensors were used to evaluate the wearing time of
      scoliosis-braces in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (Miller DJ eta al., Morton
      A et al., Takemitsu et al.) With a questionary the participants are asked of the wearing time
      before they will be informed about the implanted sensor. This answer represents the
      subjective wearing time.

      The first endpoint of the study is the evaluation of the objective and subjective abduction
      wearing time. The second endpoint is the evaluation of the correlation between compliance and
      subjective outcome.
