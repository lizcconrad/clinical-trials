  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate cognitive function and determine the
      feasibility of neurocognitive assessment using a select CogState test battery in patients
      with primary intracranial malignancies receiving photon- or proton-based cranial irradiation
      with curative intent. The investigators will use the CogState software to quantify changes in
      verbal learning, memory, and executive function over the initial months and years following
      radiation treatment. Cognitive changes and temporal patterns of function will be compared to
      baseline performance for each patient. Data regarding cognitive function, fatigue, quality of
      life, and standard patient reported outcomes will be collected to characterize the daily
      impact of treatment. In addition, observed outcomes will be correlated with dosimetry values,
      radiation dose volumes, and anatomic dose distribution.
