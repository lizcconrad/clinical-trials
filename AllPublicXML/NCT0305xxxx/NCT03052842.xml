    <textblock>
      A single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study to evaluate oral microbiology
      and safety of multiple C16G2 Strip applications in male and female dental subjects 12-75
      years of age.

      The study will compare multiple study drug administrations of 9.2 mg, 18.4 mg, and 36.8 mg
      C16G2 Strip or Placebo in Study Arms 1 through 3, respectively. Enrollment of subjects in
      Study Arms 1 through 3 will occur sequentially in an ascending dose-escalation manner. Before
      dosing of study drug, eligible subjects will receive professional dental prophylaxis between
      Days -7 and -2. Subjects will receive 11 doses administered over approximately two weeks.
      Each subject will receive a single dose on Day 0, followed by 5 days of AM and PM dosing
      starting on Day 7. To evaluate the durability of S. mutans suppression, study subjects will
      be followed for microbiology for up to 1 month after the last study drug administration.

      Clinic visits include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -30 to -1), Visit 2 (Prophylaxis/Day -7 to -2),
      Eligibility Confirmation &amp; Baseline Visit 3, Follow-up Visits 4-7 (Safety and Microbiology),
      Visits 8-17 (Study Drug Administration), Follow-up Visits 18-20 (Safety and Microbiology) and
      Follow-up Visits 21-22 (Microbiology only).

             examination (general, extraoral, head and neck) during Screening Note: Subjects on a
             stable dose of medication may be eligible for screening and will be assessed by the
             medical monitor on a case-by-case basis.

          7. Have a minimum of 12 bicuspids and molars with a minimum of 8 molars and bicuspids NOT

          9. Have a salivary S. mutans of 1.0 x 10E5 CFUs/mL or greater at Screening using MSB agar
             plating

         10. Willing to refrain from using non-study dentifrice and other non-study oral care
             products (oral care rinses, fluoride products, etc.) during the study

         11. Willing to postpone elective dental procedures (e.g., dental cleanings) between
             Screening and final post-treatment visit (End of Study or Early Termination)

         12. Willing and able to comply with oral hygiene and diet instructions

         13. Able to communicate with the Investigator/study center personnel, understand and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Advanced periodontal disease

          2. Active caries lesion(s) within 30 days prior to study drug administration (confirmed
             by comprehensive caries examination including standard radiographs). Subjects
             presenting with insipient, non-cavitated lesion(s) are not excluded Note: If
             radiographs are deemed appropriate for the study and taken within 6 months prior to
             the Screening visit, these may be used for determining eligibility and are not
             required to be repeated at Screening

          7. Use of systemic antibiotics, topical oral antibiotics, or use of other drugs, which in
             the opinion of the Investigator could influence the study outcome, beginning 30 days

             an observational study is not necessarily excluded)

         10. Presence of any condition or concurrent illness, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would compromise normal immune function (e.g., diabetes, rheumatoid
             arthritis, lupus, liver disease, organ transplant, etc.), interfere with the use of
             study dentifrice and oral care products, or interfere with the ability to comply with
