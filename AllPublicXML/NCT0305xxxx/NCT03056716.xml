  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In thoracic surgery, it is usual to place apical and basal drains for complete drainage of
      air and fluid out of the pleural cavity. The routinely used drains are mainly made of
      plastic. Recently silastic drains of smaller size are used without any complication. The
      investigators designed a prospective randomized trial to compare the draining properties of
      the two types of drains following various resections in thoracic surgery.

      Following the Institutional Review Board permission (permission no: 2009/27) the
      investigators started to recruit patients for the study in June 2009. Pneumonectomy,
      decortication, and diaphragm plication patients were not included in this study. The patients
      were consecutively placed in one of the two groups. In Group I, an apical 28FR size CD, and a
      basal 19FR SD were placed following surgery. In Group II, the apical drain was 28FR, and the
      basal drain was 32FR CDs. Basal drains were removed out when daily serous fluid drainage
      became 200 ml or less, and the apical were removed 48-72 hours following the cessation of air
      leak. The patients were discharged on the day after drain removal. The data concerning
      gender, age, diagnosis, operation side, type of operation, amount of fluid drainage, duration
      of fluid and air drainage, length of hospital stay, and complications if any, were noted.

    <description>Apical drains will be identical in size and material, and the basal drains will be different in groups. The patients will be followed for daily amounts of fluid drainage, duration of air leaks and fluid drainage, and duration of hospitalization, and the results will be compared statistically to asses any possible relationships with the outcome and the type of basal drain used.</description>
