  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration of labor is decisive for maternal and fetal health. Poor progression often
      results in tired mothers, bad experience, delivery complications and a demand for cesarean
      section in next pregnancy. Proactive support of labor is a method originally from the
      Netherlands.

      The main idea is to define start of active labor earlier than the traditional &quot;3-4 cm opening
      of the cervix and regular contractions&quot; to be cervix &lt; 0.5 cm in length, and 1 cm opening and
      painful contractions. From this point, it is expected to be a progress of 1cm/hour opening of
      cervix. If not, progress is supported by amniotomy or stimulation of contractions.

      This method is embraced by several clinics with great enthusiasm. However, there are no
      randomized controlled trials to prove that this method is better than others.
