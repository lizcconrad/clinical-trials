  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect disease activity on resting energy
      expenditure (REE), body composition, inflammatory markers, food intake and quality of life in
      subjects affected by Crohn's Disease (CD)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a common sequel among patients affected by Crohn's disease (CD). The
      pathogenic mechanisms include poor dietary intake, increased resting energy expenditure
      (REE), nutrient malabsorption and loss. So far, few studies have been carried out in CD adult
      patients, assessing the effect of disease activity on both REE and body composition. Vaisman
      et al (2006) studied sixteen CD patients in remission (&gt; 3 mo) and showed no effect of REE on
      lower BMI, although in the presence of similar energy intake in according with previous
      studies (Al-Jaouni et al., 2000; Schneeweiss et al., 1999). While, Gong et al., 2015 found
      that patients with active disease had an increase in REE compared to patients in remission as
      already shown by Rigaud et al., 1993; Kushner and Schoeller, 1991. Overall, the effect of
      disease activity on REE is still uncertain and requires further investigation.
