  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of this study is to determine the minimal dwell time needed for adequate
      detection of hexaminolevinulate HCL avid tumors using protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) near infrared
      fluorescence (NIRF).

    <description>During the transurethral resection of the bladder procedure, the bladder will initially be examined in a systematic meridian fashion. Suspicious tumors identified by white light only, NIRF only, and both will be identified. If intense fluorescence is observed in the initial patient(s) at 10 min, dwell duration will be reduced to 5 min for the next patient(s); if abundant fluorescence is detected there as well, dwell duration will be shortened again to 2.5 min. At least three patients will be studied at each duration to document intense fluorescence before proceeding to shorter instillation durations in subsequent patients.</description>

    <intervention_name>Hexaminolevulinate HCL</intervention_name>
    <description>Intravesical instillation of 100 mg hexaminolevulinate HCL will be performed via foley catheter at the initiation of the procedure. Although NIRF is more sensitive than bluelight cystoscopy, the current FDA approved dose will be used. Hexaminolevulinate has a favorable safety profile at this dose.</description>
