      The goal of the COMprehensive EXercise (COMEX) pilot study is to test feasibility,
      tolerability and adherence of this novel video-based intra-dialytic chair exercise program
      for hemodialysis patients over 3 months.

      The investigators incorporated patient-provider preferences of the key stakeholders, and used
      a multi-disciplinary team with experts in physical therapy, psychology and nephrology to
      develop a comprehensive exercise program for HD patients. Aim of this pilot study is to
      assess the feasibility, tolerability and adherence to COMEX over 3 months and inform design
      of future randomized controlled trial. A secondary goal is to explore molecular mechanisms in
      muscle and blood of exercise adaptation in HD patients
