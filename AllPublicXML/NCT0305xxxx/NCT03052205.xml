             have previously received treatment with one of these therapies.

             a. Melanoma Dose Expansion: Patients must have histologically confirmed metastatic
             melanoma (ocular melanoma not included) which has progressed on or after treatment

             expansion cohort.

          4. Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          5. Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ≤2.

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ANC ≥1.5 x 109/L (≥1500/mm3)

               2. Platelet count ≥75 x 109/L (≥75,000/mm3)

               3. Hemoglobin ≥8.0 g/dL (≥4.96 mmol/L)

               4. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or calculated 24-hour creatinine clearance ≥60
                  mL/minute

               5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤2.5 x ULN; ALT ≤2.5 x ULN or AST/ALT &lt;5 x ULN
                  if liver involvement

               6. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN, except in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who must
                  have a total bilirubin &lt;3 mg/dL (51.3 μmol/L)

             methods from Screening throughout the study treatment period and until at least 4
             weeks after the last dose of study drug.

          8. Patients must be willing and able to provide signed informed consent and comply with

          4. Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring disease-modifying therapy.

          5. Patients requiring concurrent systemic steroid therapy higher than physiologic dosage
             (&gt;10mg/day of prednisone or equivalent).

          6. Patients with another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 3
             years, unless approved by the Idera Medical Monitor. The following are exempt from the
