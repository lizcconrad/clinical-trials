  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-protein test using mass spectrometry (MS) for multiplexed protein quantitation is
      being developed. This test and the accompanying decision-aid software will provide Transient
      Ischemic Attack (TIA) results rapidly for a fraction of the price of neuroimaging. With
      guidance provided by this test, Emergency Department (ED) physicians can manage medical
      imaging questions such as the use of Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) prior to ED
      discharge and appropriate (timely) referral to stroke clinics for consultation and follow-up
      care. The right patients will receive the right treatment, reduce unwarranted imaging risks
      and costs, and reduce the burden of stroke.

  <detailed_description>

      This study represents an initial Verification study, in which Mass Spectrometry will be used
      to quantify a large number of blood proteins previously implicated in ACVS and mimic
      conditions in patients who are consented and enrolled in the Emergency Department within 24
      hrs of symptom onset. 560 patients will be enrolled, and grouped into two cohorts (Cohort 1A:
      220; and Cohort 1B: 350).

      In Cohort 1A, each consented participant provides three blood samples: on arrival, 4-6 hours
      later, then ~24 hours after that, but no later than 32 hours from symptom onset. In cohort
      1b, each patient provides only a single blood sample up to 24 hours from symptom onset.

      A positive diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or
      definite ischemia on Computed tomography (CT) or vascular occlusion on CTA will be used as
      proof of ischemia to classify the clinical phenotype into three groups (see below). A
      neurologist will adjudicate all cases according to a study defined adjudication protocol.
