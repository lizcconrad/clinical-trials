  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a high protein, high fiber
      dietary supplement on weight and fat loss in healthy overweight adults. Half of participants
      will receive a high protein, high fiber supplement twice a day for 12 weeks, and half of the
      subjects will receive a placebo (that contains the same amount of calories as the supplement)
      twice a day for 12 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female of 18-50 years of age

          2. If female, the subject is not of child bearing potential, which is defined as females
             who have had a hysterectomy or oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or are
             post-menopausal (natural or surgically with &gt; 1 year since last menstruation) OR

             Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically approved method of
             birth control and have a negative urine pregnancy test result at screening. Acceptable
             methods of birth control include:

               -  Hormonal contraceptives including oral contraceptives, hormone birth control
                  patch (Ortho Evra), vaginal contraceptive ring (NuvaRing), injectable
                  contraceptives (Depo-Provera, Lunelle), or hormone implant (Norplant System) for
                  at least 3 months

               -  Double-barrier method

               -  Non-hormonal IUDs

               -  Hormonal IUD methods must be a stable dose for at least 3 months

               -  Vasectomy of partner

               -  Non-heterosexual lifestyle

          3. A BMI between 27.0-33.0 kg/m2 (inclusive). Subjects must meet exactly the inclusion
             BMI at screening, or be screen failed, however; subjects who meet the BMI requirement
             at screening and present at run-in and baseline with a BMI of 27.0-33.5 kg/m2
             (inclusive) will be included in the study

          4. Subjects with body fat percentage &gt;25% for males and &gt;30% for females, as determined
             by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) performed at the screening visit

          5. Subjects that have had a stable weight for the past 6 months. A stable weight is
             defined as not having gained or lost more than 5 kg of body weight throughout the past
             6 months (cycling of weight, for example, continuously up and down anything less than
             5 kg is considered stable)

          6. Agreement to comply with dietary recommendations from nutritionist throughout the
             duration of the study that include a 500 kcal energy deficit from their predicted
             total energy requirements
