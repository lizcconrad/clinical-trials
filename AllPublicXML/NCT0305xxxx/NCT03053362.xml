  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of the THINC-it tool, in measuring
      change in cognitive deficits in individuals with MDD after receiving vortioxetine.

      Vortioxetine is used in this study as an antidepressant to improve mood, cognition and
      quality of life. &quot;Cognition&quot; refers to intellectual functions such as thinking,
      understanding, learning and remembering. Vortioxetine is approved by Health Canada for the
      treatment of MDD. In addition, vortioxetine has been reported to have a beneficial effect on
      cognitive areas such as executive function, attention/speed of processing, and memory, that
      are commonly affected negatively by MDD. Vortioxetine is recognized by Health Authorities in
      the EU and many other countries as having a benefit on cognitive dysfunction (loss of
      intellectual functions) in patients with MDD.Cognitive dysfunction is a highly persistent,
      pervasive and progressive abnormality in young adults (i.e., 18-65 years) with MDD.

      It has also been shown that among adults with MDD who are gainfully employed, measures of
      cognition are a greater determinant of overall workplace performance than is total depression
      symptom severity. Several lines of evidence indicate that cognitive deficits that persist
      between episodes of depression are critical determinants of functional recovery in the
      workplace. The functional implications associated with cognitive impairment provide the
      impetus for systematic evaluation, measurement and assessment of the domains of cognition
      expected to be impaired in this patient population.

      To date, no measurement tool has been sufficiently validated and/or determined to be
      sensitive to the cognitive deficits in younger adults with MDD. Major limitations of
      available comprehensive psychometric tools include relative lack of availability, cost, lack
      of access to most healthcare providers, and above all else, the lengthy time to administer.
      Moreover, the need for a psychometrist to interpret the results adds to the complexity and
      the costliness of such an endeavor.

      It is imperative that any tool recommended for clinical utility be aligned with the busy
      nature of a high-volume clinical practice. The ideal gold standard tool for assessing the
      presence of cognitive dysfunction in MDD in the clinical environment should include, but not
      be limited to, features such as good conceptual coverage of cognitive domains affected in
      MDD, good sensitivity and reliability, and it should be relatively uninfluenced by culture
      effects and practice effects. The tool would also need to be brief, easy to administer and
      interpret, and complement busy clinical practice.

      It is anticipated that the THINC-it tool will be free of charge and downloadable from the
      THINC-it website for use in the primary care and specialty setting. The THINC-it tool will be
      accessible via computers/tablets, will take 20 minutes to self-administer in a clinical
      setting, and the performance results will be immediately available.

    <description>The Endicott Work Productivity Scale (EWPS) is a a brief (25-item) selfreport questionnaire designed to assess the degree to which a medical condition, such as a depressive disorder, affects the work functioning of a subject. The individual items of the scale have face validity as measures of different ways that work activities may be altered so that productivity and efficiency are reduced. The total score is a sensitive measure that will (1) discriminate among subjects who have varying degrees of difficulty in accomplishing their work due to an illness (rather than lack of training, skills, or aptitude) and (2) reflect even small changes in behavior related to work productivity. The items are rated on a 5-point scale of how often the behavior or feeling, or attitude has been manifested during the past week. he total score ranges from 0 (best possible score) to 100 (for the worst possible score).</description>

    <description>The WHO-5 is a short questionnaire consisting of 5 simple and non-invasive questions, which tap into the subjective well-being of the respondents. The WHO-5 only contains positively phrased items. The respondent is asked to rate how well each of the 5 statements applies to him or her when considering the last 14 days. Each of the 5 items is scored from 5 (all of the time) to 0 (none of the time). The raw score therefore theoretically ranges from 0 (absence of well-being) to 25 (maximal well-being).</description>
