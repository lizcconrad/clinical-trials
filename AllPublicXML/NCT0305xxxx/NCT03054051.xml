    <textblock>
      This project will test the feasibility of an electronic game to prevent HIV among African
      preadolescents, delivered via inexpensive Android smart phones. In order to collect
      feasibility data for a future randomized controlled trial, this study involves the
      pilot-testing of the intervention with a sample of young people in Nyanza region, Kenya,
      where 11.4% of young women ages 15-24 are HIV-infected. This feasibility study will be
      carried out with the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will test the feasibility of an electronic game for preadolescents, delivered
      via inexpensive Android smart phones. The game is informed by socio-behavioral and
      pedagogical theories, evidence-based practice, and formative research on youth sexual culture
      in sub-Saharan Africa. It is designed to: educate young players, ages 11-14, about sexual
      health and HIV/AIDS; build risk-reduction skills and related self-efficacy for prevention of
      HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unintended pregnancy; challenge harmful
      gender norms and HIV stigma; and foster dialogue with parents and caregivers.

      The proposed feasibility test will be conducted in Western Kenya. Sixty preadolescents will
      be enrolled in the trial, 30 in the study arm and 30 in the control arm. In addition, 30
      parents (one for each preadolescent in the study arm) will be enrolled to provide feedback on
      their experience of the study via focus group discussions. The Kenya Medical Research
      Institute (KEMRI) has established community advisory boards (CABs) in Kisumu, which will be
      available to the proposed study.

      Data collection will take place at KEMRI offices, health clinics, or in the meeting room of a
      local community-based organization (CBO). In addition, data on game-play will be
      automatically collected on mobile phones given to preadolescent study participants.
