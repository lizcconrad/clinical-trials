  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the percent change in baseline bone
      mineral density (BMD) starting at one year after parathyroidectomy and all the following
      available dates in patients presenting with primary hyperparathyroidism. The secondary
      objective is to identify patient factors associated with change in BMD.

      The research plan is for a retrospective review to be performed of a prospectively maintained
      parathyroid database within the Department of Surgical Oncology at the University of Texas MD
      Anderson Cancer Center. The patient cohort for this study consists of all patients with
      primary hyperparathyroidism who underwent parathyroidectomy and also had pre- and
      post-operative DEXA studies performed. The database will be reviewed to obtain patient and
      disease characteristics, laboratory values, DEXA imaging results, and surgical outcomes.

    <description>Retrospective, uncontrolled pre- and post-test design in a case series of approximately 250 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy at MD Anderson Cancer Center (years 1990 - 2013 ) and had bone density measures recorded at baseline and at one year post-surgery. Data extracted from the surgical oncology database for bone mineral density measures for each patient at multiple sites including the lumbar spine, total hip (right/left), femoral neck (right/left), and distal 1/3 radius. All measures recorded from two time points: presurgical (baseline) and postsurgical (all follow-up available dates beginning at 1 year post-parathyroidectomy).</description>
