  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lacerations are one of most common trauma in children presenting to the emergency department
      (ED). Currently, there are wide variations regarding sedation and analgesia practices when
      suture are required. Even though topical anesthesia is very useful to reduce pain, it does
      not obviate the use of pharmacologic agents to decrease stress in anxious children undergoing
      laceration repairs in the ED.

      There is a growing interest in the intranasal (IN) route of administration in the pediatric
      population. It bypasses the first hepatic passage and thus provides medications direct access
      to the systemic circulation leading to higher and faster serum concentrations than would the
      oral route. Also, intravenous (IV) cannulation can be avoided reducing the pain associated
      with it and the need for nursing time and procedure delay. IN fentanyl and midazolam are two
      agents that can be combined for this procedure, but respiratory depression is a feared
      adverse effects. Ketamine is the most commonly used IV agent for procedural sedation, and can
      offer potent analgesia and sedation while maintaining respiratory drive and protective airway
      reflexes. Few studies have evaluated IN ketamine for procedural sedation. There is a wide
      range of dosing reported from 3 to 9 mg/kg. This raises the question as what is the lowest
      possible dosage that can be used to successfully repairs laceration in children with minimal
      restrain and no adverse events, as described by the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada
      (PERC)/ Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) consensus.
