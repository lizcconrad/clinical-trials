  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an initial validation study of the Personal Nutrition Project (PNP) algorithm in a
      North American population with recently diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). This is a 2-stage,
      single-group feeding study in 20 individuals, including 10 participants managed with
      lifestyle alone, and 10 managed with lifestyle plus metformin.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PNP algorithm, which uses a machine learning algorithm to predict postprandial glycemic,
      may be efficacious for generating tailored dietary advice to moderate the participant's
      glycemic response to food.

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators will recruit approximately 5 cohorts of 4 participants each for the sample size of 20 participants. A new cohort will be randomized approximately every 4 weeks. The maximum number of study participants at any point in the study will be 10.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Observed incremental area under the curve (iAUCobs) at 2 hours following each meal and snack will be evaluated via CGM using the Medtronic Enlight Pro, which captures interstitial glucose every 5 minutes. A sensor is inserted into the participant's abdomen. Participants will be blinded to glycemia tracings.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;21 years to &lt;70 years

          -  Diagnosed with T2DM within 2 years with an HbA1c&lt;7%

          -  Diabetes management by metformin or lifestyle intervention

          -  Fasting C-peptide ≥ 0.5 mg/mL (0.17 nmol/L) (to exclude those for whom hyperglycemic
             exposure is driven by β-cell failure rather than dietary behaviors, as well as those
             requiring escalation of the medication regime)

          -  Ownership a smart phone and are willing to use it to monitor multiple factors
             influencing glycemic response to glycemia (e.g., sleep, physical activity, diet,
             stress, medication, and hunger)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  are unable or unwilling to provide informed consent;

          -  are unable to participate meaningfully in an intervention that involves
             self-monitoring using software available in English (e.g., due to uncorrected sight
             impairment, illiterate, non-English-speaking, dementia);

          -  are pregnant, are currently trying to become pregnant, or who become pregnant during
             the study

          -  are institutionalized (e.g., in a nursing home or personal care facility, or those who
             are incarcerated and have limited control over self-management)

          -  have had or are planning to have bariatric surgery during the study

          -  have a history of heart disease, kidney disease, or retinopathy (to rule-out those
             with long-standing, undiagnosed T2D)

          -  those with an active infection requiring antibiotics in the last 3 months or who
             develop an active infection requiring antibiotics during the study;

          -  those who use acetaminophen and are unwilling or unable to discontinue its use during
             the study (acetaminophen affects CGM accuracy)39

          -  immunosuppressive drugs within three months prior to participation and

          -  Chronically active inflammatory or neoplastic disease in the three years prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Patients with known food allergy.
