  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is difficult to assess pain and agitation in the NICU population because for a multitude
      of reasons including the pre-verbal nature of the patient population, the atypical pain
      response of premature infants, and the use of muscle relaxing medications that exclude motor
      response in pain assessments. Current assessment tools are based on physical exam and vital
      signs. The investigators propose to study the role of EEG and palmar conductance (PD) as
      additional tools in the assessment of pain and agitation

      This is a prospective, non-interventional study designed to assess noxious-specific
      neurophysiologic responses and clinical signs following procedural pain in infants requiring
      hospitalization in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) following elective surgery.

      The main goal of the study is to develop a method that reliably quantifies the level of pain
      induced from clinically-required noxious procedures to infants hospitalized in the NICU. This
      method will use measures of neurophysiological, autonomic, and behavioral responses to
      non-noxious and clinically-required noxious stimuli in order to guide the pharmacological
      treatment of NICU patients with analgesic agents, sedatives and/or muscle relaxants.

      The investigators hypothesize that resting state activity and physiological responses to
      noxious and non-noxious stimuli provide a more reliable assessment of the level of pain of
      infants hospitalized in the NICU compared to behavioral-based pain scores.

    <description>To assess pain-specific brain activity and autonomic responses post surgery in response to an acute noxious procedure in newborn infants admitted to the NICU. This outcome will be correlated with current behavioral and physiological based pain assessment tools as follows:
Procedural-specific brain activity in infants with varying conditions with pre or post-operative pain. EEG: amplitude of noxious-event related potential evoked by a time-locked noxious stimulus. Pain-specific electro-dermal activity (EDA), electromyography (EMG) and subdermal skin flow; Pain-evoked behavioral measures including: Body movement; Eye squeeze, brow bulge and nasolabial furrow duration. Pain-evoked physiological measures including: Respiration rate; Heart rate; Blood pressure; Oxygen saturation; Observational pain scores (PIPP); EMG activity.</description>

    <measure>Resting State Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Characterize resting state activity in post-operative or control subjects as follows:
Baseline brain (EEG) activity (power spectra of baseline EEG signal) in post operative or control subjects. Baseline EDA, EMG and subdermal skin flow; Baseline behavioral measures including: Presence of body movement, eye squeeze, brow bulge and nasolabial furrow. Baseline physiological measures including: Respiration rate; Heart rate; Blood pressure; Oxygen saturation; Observational pain scores (PIPP).
The relationship with resting brain activity, electrodermal activity, behavior, physiological, and observational pain scores will be evaluated.</description>
