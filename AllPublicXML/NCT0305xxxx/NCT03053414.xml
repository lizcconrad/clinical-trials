  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease
      (CD), are chronic relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is
      thought to result from a complex interaction between genetic, immune, microbial and
      environmental factors. There is emerging data suggesting Vitamin D may not only play a role
      in bone health but may also be involved in gut health as well. While there are guidelines
      regarding the recommending doses of Vitamin D for supplementation and maintenance in bone
      health, these strategies are unknown in those with inflammatory bowel disease. The
      investigators seek to determine a dosing strategy for this population using doses within the
      recommended guidelines for bone health.

      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease
      (CD), are chronic relapsing inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is
      thought to result from a complex interaction between genetic, immune, microbial and
      environmental factors. The role of vitamin D in bone health and calcium homeostasis is well
      documented. However, emerging data suggests that vitamin D may also regulate immune
      responses, which may play a role in the pathogenesis and disease activity of IBD.

      The investigators seek to identify CD or UC patients with mild disease or in clinical
      remission who have vitamin D levels &lt;30 ng/ml and not on any type of vitamin repletion
      therapy. The investigators will randomize the participants into one of four arms: (1) Oral
      50,000 vitamin D IU every week for 12 weeks (2) Oral 50,000 vitamin D weekly for 12 weeks
      than oral 800 vitamin D IU/d (3) Oral 50,000 vitamin D IU weekly for 12 weeks then 5,000
      vitamin D IU/d (4) Oral 5,000 vitamin D IU/d and check vitamin D levels and inflammatory
      markers as part of standard of care follow- up every 3 months for nine months. Every
      participant will receive dietary counseling throughout the study duration. Our aim is to
      identify an optimal dosing strategy for repletion and maintenance of vitamin D levels in the
      subset of IBD patients. Based on clinical experience, doses higher than the recommended doses
      for bone health are needed to achieve and maintain optimal levels of Vitamin D in IBD
      patients, even patients are in remission or do not have small bowel (malabsorption)
      involvement.
