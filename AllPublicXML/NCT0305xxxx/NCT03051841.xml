    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose(MTD), dose limiting toxicity(DLT),
      safety and pharmacokinetics(PK) profile of a single agent CKD-581 injection in Combination
      with Bortezomib and Dexamethasone in patients with Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose escalation study. Cohort of 3~6 patients receive escalation doses
      of CKD-581 until the maximum toleated dose(MTD) is determined. The MTD is defiend as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.
