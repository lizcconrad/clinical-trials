    <description>An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. A serious adverse event is defined as any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: results in death; is life threatening; results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life function; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or can be defined as any other important medical event.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with an abnormal, clinically significant laboratory test value</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening; Baseline; Days 4, 8, 11, 14, 20 (Out-Patient Follow-up), and 35 (Termination/Visit 5); up to Day 62 (unscheduled Follow-up visits)</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory test values will be assigned a low/normal/high (LNH) classification according to whether the value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter's reference range. Clinical significance will be determined by the Investigator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with an abnormal, clinically significant vital sign value</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening; Baseline; up to Day 62</time_frame>
    <description>Vital sign measurements (ie, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [millimeters of mercury (mmHg)], heart rate [beats per minute], respiratory rate [breaths per minute], body temperature [centigrade]) will be obtained in the supine position by a validated method. Clinical significance will be determined by the Investigator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with an abnormal, clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) finding</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening; Baseline; up to Day 62</time_frame>
    <description>Twelve-lead standard ECGs will be recorded in triplicate. ECGs will be recorded after the participant has been in the supine position for at least 10 minutes before and during the reading. In addition, all ECGs will be obtained before blood draws. Clinical significance will be determined by the Investigator.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>

    <description>The suicidality rating scale will rate a participant's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot; The decision to classify an isolated suicidality rating scale response as an adverse event will be exercised through medical and scientific judgment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean quality of sleep score per the Waketime Questionnaire, if necessary</measure>
    <time_frame>up to Day 62</time_frame>
    <description>Participants reporting adverse events (AEs) relating to abnormal dreams, nightmares, or sleep terrors will be questioned using the Waketime Questionnaire which is comprised of 5 individual questions. A participant is asked to rate the quality of their sleep as: 1, Very sound or restful; 2, Sound or restful; 3, Average quality; 4, Restless; or 5, Very restless.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
