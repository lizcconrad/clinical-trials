      The purpose of this study was the evaluation of inflammatory and healing profile after root
      coverage using of Enamel Matrix Derivative. 16 volunteers were selected and submitted to root
      coverage surgery with subepithelial connective tissue graft, with and without enamel matrix
      derivative. The patient screening was based in the following inclusion criteria: bilateral
      recessions in maxillary anterior homologous teeth with aesthetical complaining ou
      hypersensitivity, non-smokers, healthy and no use of any medication that compromises
      periodontal health or healing. The split-mouth randomized model was followed in relation to
      test and control sites. The following clinical parameters were analyzed at baseline and
      6-month post-surgery: recession height, recession width, width of keratinized tissue, probing
      depth, clinical attachment level, and gingival thickness. In addition to the surgical
      analysis, evaluations of the following inflammatory markers were performed: IL-1β, IL -1RA,
      IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, EOTAXIN, FGF,
      GCSF, GMCSF, IFN-y, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP 1a, PDGF-bb, MIP 1b, RANTES, TNF-α e VEGF. These
      evaluations were performed at baseline, 7 and 14 days after surgery.
