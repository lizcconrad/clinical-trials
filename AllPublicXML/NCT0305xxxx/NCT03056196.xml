      Introduction

      Undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to significant morbidity and mortality,
      including death from DVT-associated massive pulmonary embolism (PE). While several validated
      clinical prediction rules, blood test and imaging modalities exist to investigate a potential
      DVT, there is currently a lack of rapid, accessible and reliable methods to exclude the
      possibility of DVT without resorting to formal venous duplex scanning.

      Currently, the use in the ED of a validated clinical prediction rule combined with
      high-sensitivity D-dimer test has a poor predictive value, as 75-90% of patients suspected of
      DVT have a negative formal venous duplex scan.

      Compression bedside ultrasound has however recently been shown to be a safe, rapid and
      accurate method for the diagnosis of proximal DVT in the emergency department with a high
      sensitivity and specificity (combined sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 96.8%,
      respectively1).

      Research Question

      In the present study, the investigators will primarily assess whether two-site compression
      POCUS combined with a negative age-adjusted D-dimer test can accurately rule out DVT in ED
      patients regardless of the Wells criteria.

      Methods

      This is a single-center, prospective, observational study carried out over one year in the
      Emergency Department of the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Quebec. The investigators
      aim to enroll a convenience sample of 475 patients aged 18 years and older presenting to the
      ED with symptoms suggestive of a DVT. All enrolled patients will receive the standard of care
      required for a lower leg DVT presentation. After calculating Patients DVT risk using modified
      wells criteria, all patients will undergo POCUS for DVT followed by a D-dimer test. Based on
      their results, patients will either undergo formal duplex scanning, or will be discharged
      without further testing and receive a three-month phone follow-up.

      A true negative lower leg DVT will be defined as follows:

        1. Negative follow-up phone questionnaire for patients who were sent home with no formal
           duplex venous scanning.

        2. Negative formal duplex venous scanning for patients who were deemed likely to have lower
           leg DVT using the Wells score, with a negative D-dimer and POCUS

      Age-adjusted DVT was added to account for below knee DVT and avoid the need for patients to
      return for fellow up duplex study in 1 week.

      To estimate our technique's sensitivity with a 4% margin of error with 95% confidence
      intervals, 92 confirmed DVT patients are needed. The investigators expect to recruit a total
      475 patients within one-year period at the JGH (95 DVT-positive patients and 380 DVT-negative
      patients).

      Impact

      The use of compression bedside ultrasound with a negative age-adjusted D-dimer test to rule
      out DVT in the ED may accelerate the decision regarding patient disposition and significantly
      decrease the length of patient stay in the ED. In addition, it may help avoid unnecessary
      medical interventions and diagnostic tests, thus representing potential quality of care and
      cost-saving improvements as well.
