  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive alcohol consumption is common in patients admitted to the intensive care unit
      (ICU). Among patients who survive an ICU admission, excessive alcohol consumption is
      associated with a higher risk of being admitted the hospital. In this study, the
      Investigators will compare an intervention designed to address excessive drinking in ICU
      survivors to usual care. This intervention combines motivational interviewing (MI) and shared
      decision making (SDM). MI and SDM share several core components including the development of
      a therapeutic alliance and promotion of autonomy. MI can be employed in the context of
      motivating a patient to change their drinking. Once this decision has been made, SDM can be
      employed to help a patient decide amongst multiple reasonable treatment options. The
      Investigators long-term goal is to test whether MI-SDM is better than usual care and whether
      multiple sessions of MI-SDM are better than a single session. This pilot clinical trial will
      demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a larger efficacy study to test these hypotheses.

Note: The first 10 subjects will not be randomized and will be assigned to this Arm. The purpose of this is to ensure the fidelity of the intervention. The remaining 60 subjects will be randomized equally among the three Arms. Data from the first 10 subjects will not be considered for the outcome measures.</description>
