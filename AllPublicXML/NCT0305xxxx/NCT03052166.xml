      Brief Summary: The QT Ultrasound system is an automated scanner which transmits pulsed
      ultrasound plane waves through the breast, as well as collects reflected ultrasound output.
      As the patient lays prone on a table, the breast is submerged in a warm water bath. The
      transmitter and receiver assembly moves around the suspended breast to record data for
      successive sub-volumes of targeted tissue. More than 2000 elements in the curvilinear
      transducer's array encircle the breast to gather data from the tissue structures of the
      breast, from nipple to chest wall. Information gathered from this automated QT scan
      encompasses the entire breast which is currently not commercially available using any other
      ultrasound technology.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, multi-arm case collection study, with IRB approval. The
      study will follow an adaptive design with an initially planned total enrollment of
      approximately 600 cases to include both benign and malignant cases, representative of all
      tissue densities.

      The images and clinical data accrued in this prospective case collection will be used for
      creation of a database to facilitate future reader's studies, publications, building teaching
      files, and future marketing for QT Ultrasound.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA All Subjects

          1. Female

          2. Age 18 or older

          3. Willing to receive a QT Ultrasound Breast Scan

          4. Willing and able to provide written Informed Consent prior to any research-related
             procedure(s)

        Cohort A and B Subjects that do not meet these Inclusion Criteria will be evaluated for
        Inclusion in Cohort C

          1. Eligible for routine screening mammography as per ACR guidelines

          2. Willing and able to submit or complete at the clinical site a Digital Mammography with
             Digital Breast Tomosynthesis exam (to include Craniocaudal (CC) and Mediolateral
             Oblique (MLO) views - for one or both breasts, within 3 months, before or after, their
             QT scan.

        Cohort C

        1. Willing and able to submit available breast imaging - for one or both breasts, before or
        after, their QT scan.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA All Subjects

          1. Pregnancy

          2. Currently breastfeeding

          3. Allergies to device materials

          4. Physical inability to tolerate the procedure on the scanner, i.e. inability to lie
             prone and still for up to 30 minutes at a time

          5. Open wounds, sores or skin rash present on the breast(s) or nipple discharge from the
             scanned breast

          6. Breasts too large for scanner, i.e. inability to successfully &quot;fit&quot; breast after the
             subject is placed on scanner

          8. Has a concurrent disease or condition which in the judgment of the Principal
             Investigator disqualifies the subject, from participating in the study

          9. Magnetic material in the chest which in the judgement of the Principal Investigator
             would interfere with or be impacted by the magnets within the study device.

        Cohort A and B Subjects that meet any of these conditions below will not be eligible for
