  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motivation deficits are a strong determinant of poor functional outcomes in people with
      schizophrenia. Mobile interventions are a promising approach to improving these deficits, as
      they can provide frequent cues and reinforcements that support goal-directed behavior. The
      primary aims of this study are to conduct a pilot study using a randomized design to 1) Test
      the feasibility and acceptability of a personalized mobile text message intervention, Mobile
      Enhancement of Motivation in Schizophrenia (MEMS) and to 2) Test the preliminary
      effectiveness of MEMS compared to a control condition.

      Objectives: Motivation deficits are one of the strongest determinants of poor functional
      outcomes in people with schizophrenia. Mobile interventions are a promising approach to
      improving these deficits, as they can provide frequent cues and reinforcements that support
      goal-directed behavior. The objective of this study is to conduct a pilot study using a
      randomized design to 1) Test the feasibility and acceptability of a personalized mobile text
      message intervention, Mobile Enhancement of Motivation in Schizophrenia (MEMS) and to 2) Test
      the preliminary effectiveness of MEMS compared to a control condition. Methods: Up to forty
      outpatients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder will be recruited. All participants will
      set individualized recovery goals to complete over an eight-week period; those randomized to
      receive MEMS will also receive three sets of personalized, interactive text messages each
      weekday to reinforce and cue goal completion. Before and after the eight-week period,
      participants in both groups will complete validated measures of motivation. Both groups will
      also report their goal attainment after eight weeks. Results: It is anticipated that those in
      the MEMS group will demonstrate greater goal attainment and improvements in motivation
      compared to the control group. Discussion: This project will test the initial feasibility,
      acceptability, and effectiveness of a novel intervention for improving one of the most
      debilitating aspects of schizophrenia.

    <description>The MAP-SR is a self-report measure 15-item self-report measure that assesses participant's level of motivation and pleasure in several domains, including work and recreational activities. It has been found to be valid and reliable in a schizophrenia-spectrum sample (Llerena, et al., 2013).</description>
