      Investigators plan evaluate whether PCSK9 inhibitors, a medication that can lower
      lipoprotein(a) and control dyslipidemia, can inhibit the progression of aortic stenosis,
      through a randomized controlled trial.

    <textblock>
      Aortic valve disease is the most common form of heart valve disease and is a major burden to
      society. Aortic valve disease is also expected to become more prevalent with the aging. Among
      aortic diseases, 'aortic stenosis (AS)', which is a narrowing of the aortic valve, and leads
      to symptoms of heart failure and sometimes death.

      For treatment of AS, the valve in replaced in a surgical to percutaneous method. Regardless
      of the method, valve replacement has its potential costs and complications that is an
      important issue that needs to be solved. Therefore, controlling the progression of AS and
      increasing the efficacy of medical therapy before valvular replacement is needed, is an
      important medico-social problem.

      Regarding the pathophysiology of AS, an elevation of lipoprotein(a) and dyslipidemia have
      been reported to be associated with the progression of cardiovascular calcification.

      PCSK9 inhibitors, which is a medication that can control both lipoprotein(a) and dyslipidemia
      may be a effective medication to control the progression of AS.

      Therefore, investigators will perform a randomized control trial, to compare the effect of
      PCSK9 inhibitors vs. placebo in its influence to AS progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient agrees to participate in this study by signing the informed consent form.
             Alternatively, a legally authorized patient representative may agree to the patient's
             participation in this study and sign the informed consent form.

          2. The patient has a working diagnosis of aortic stenosis (mild to moderate), and has
             fair treatment compliance.
