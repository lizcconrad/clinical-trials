  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a rheumatologic disease characterized by generalized chronic pain,
      hyperalgesia and allodynia. Physical exercises are recommended as the first choice of
      non-pharmacological therapy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness
      and cost-effectiveness of modified Pilates method exercises compared to aerobic exercises in
      the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia. The hypothesis is that Pilates exercises will be
      as effective as aerobic exercise in the improvement of clinical outcomes, and that this
      improvement will be maintained over the medium to long term. It is also expected that aerobic
      exercises will be more cost-effective.

      Fibromyalgia is a rheumatologic disease characterized by generalized chronic pain,
      hyperalgesia and allodynia. Physical exercises are recommended as the first choice of
      non-pharmacological therapy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness
      and cost-effectiveness of modified Pilates method exercises compared to aerobic exercise in
      the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia. For this, the following outcomes of 98 patients
      will be evaluated by a blinded evaluator at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 and 12 months after
      randomization: fibromyalgia impact assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, pain
      intensity assessed by the Pain Numerical Rating Scale, kinesiophobia assessed by the Tampa
      Scale for Kinesiophobia, specific disability assessed by the Patient-Specific Functional
      Scale, functional capacity assessed by the 6-minute Walk Test, quality of sleep assessed by
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and health-related quality of life assessed by the
      EQ-5D-3L and SF-6D questionnaires. Participants will be randomly divided into Aerobic Group,
      who will perform aerobic exercises on treadmills and/or stationary bikes, and Pilates Group,
      which will perform exercises of the modified Pilates method. Both groups will be treated for
      eight weeks, twice a week. The hypothesis is that Pilates exercises will be as effective as
      aerobic exercise in the improvement of clinical outcomes, and that this improvement will be
      maintained over the medium to long term. It is also expected that aerobic exercises will be
      more cost-effective.

    <measure>Fibromyalgia impact</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be evaluated by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) which is composed of 10 items. Item 1 contains 10 questions related to functionality, each of these issues being evaluated by a 4-point Likert scale, which ranges from 0 (always) to 3 (never). In items 2 and 3, the patient scores the number of days that felt well and that was unable to work due to fibromyalgia in the last seven days. Items 4 to 10 are composed of numerical scales that assess difficulty for work, pain, fatigue, morning tiredness, stiffness, anxiety and depression. The FIQ score ranges from 0 to 100 points and the higher values indicate greater fibromyalgia impact on quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks, six and twelve months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be evaluated by an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, in which 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot; The participant will classify his average pain in the last 7days.</description>

    <description>This outcome will be evaluated by an 11-point scale ranging from 0 to 10, in which 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;pain as bad as it could be.&quot; The participant will classify his average pain before and after each treatment session .</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assessed using the 6-Minute Walk Test. Two cones will be used, which will mark the starting point and 30 meters, where the patient will turn around and continue walking without hesitation. The area of the test will also have markings every 3 meters. The patient should walk for 6 minutes, as fast as he can, without running, while the evaluator will control the time (for 6 minutes) and count how many laps the patient performs (each turn corresponds to 60 meters). When the stopwatch is stopped, the evaluator will say &quot;stop&quot; and mark the point where the patient stopped with a tape. After the test, the evaluator will request that the patient answer to the Borg's range of effort perception. The measurement of the walked distance will be made by the number of laps added to the meters walked until the patient stops.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinesiophobia</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks, six and twelve months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be evaluated by a 17-item questionnaire. The score of each question varies from 1 (&quot;strongly disagree&quot;) to 4 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;) points. For the total score, the scores of the questions 4, 8, 12, and 16 should be inverted. The final score can vary from 17 to 68 points, and the higher the score, the greater the degree of kinesiophobia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks, six and twelve months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, where the patient will report sleep quality in the last month. The questionnaire consists of 19 self-evaluation questions. The 19 questions are classified into seven components (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, sleeping medication use and daytime dysfunction), which are rated at a score ranging from 0 to 3 (0 = none in the last month, 1 = less than 1 time/week, 2 = 1 or 2 times/week, 3 = 3 or more times/week). The sum of the scores for these 7 components ranges from 0 to 21, where the highest score indicates poorer sleep quality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Specific disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks, six and twelve months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be evaluated using the Patient-Specific Functional Scale. The participants will identify 3 significant activities that are difficult or that are unable to perform because of fibromyalgia. Next, the participants will rate how able they feel to perform these activities on an 11-point scale (0 to 10), with 0 representing &quot;unable to perform activity&quot; and 10 &quot;able to perform the activity at preinjury level.&quot; The final score is the mean of the 3 ratings, and the higher the score, the greater the specific ability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life using the EQ-5D-3L</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks, six and twelve months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be evaluated by the Euroqol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D-3L). The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire is a generic measure that assesses health-related quality of life through five dimensions, and each dimension with three levels. Health states are labeled with a five-digit numeric code that represents the severity level in each dimension.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life using the SF-6D</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks, six and twelve months after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be evaluated by the Short-Form 6 dimensions (SF-6D). The SF-6D questionnaire also measures health-related quality of life, through six domains: functional capacity, global limitation, social aspects, pain, mental health and vitality. The SF-6D score represents the strength of an individual's preference for a particular health condition, ranging from zero to one, where zero corresponds to the worst health condition and one corresponds to the best health status.</description>
