  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will access the safety and efficacy of the Viatar™ Oncopheresis System to remove a
      meaningful quantity of circulating tumor cells from the blood of subjects' with breast, colon
      or prostate solid tumor cancers in a single treatment. CTC reduction will be measured as the
      change in circulating tumor cells as determined before and after treatment.

    <description>Metastatic breast, colon or prostate cancer patients will have their CTC levels determined on 3 days before treatment with the Viatar Oncopheresis System to establish a baseline value, a pretreatment value, a post treatment value and on 4 additional instances over a period of 7 days post treatment to establish a CTC rebound profile using the CellSearch System.</description>
