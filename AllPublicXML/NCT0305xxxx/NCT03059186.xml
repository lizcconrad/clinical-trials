  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the proposed research is to investigate the extent to which a one-week
      online gratitude intervention can improve levels of wellbeing in individuals living with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). A secondary aim was to investigate the extent to which
      dispositional gratitude influences levels of coping and wellbeing and to what extent this
      mediates the effect of the intervention. Participants with IBD will be randomized to either
      treatment or control group. Participants will complete measures pre- and post- intervention,
      and follow-up (eight weeks) measuring: gratitude (state and trait), illness severity, mood,
      stress and coping.
