  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS) has become a well-documented syndrome since 2004 and is
      expected to increase in prevalence with continuing liberalization of marijuana and
      recognition of the disease. Regardless of whether the association with heavy cannabis use is
      recognized, there is well-documented resistance to traditional anti-emetic treatment. Given
      promising reports of the use of intravenous haloperidol, a randomized controlled trial
      comparing it to the commonly administered anti-emetic ondansetron will contribute to the
      management of CHS
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded, randomized, cross-over clinical trial that will enroll
      approximately 80 subjects from at least four different research sites. Patients who have been
      diagnosed with CHS and enrolled in our study will act as their own controls upon their return
      to the ED for a subsequent bout of CHS for up to 3 visits per subject. Each patient will be
      allocated in a 1:1:1 fashion into one of three treatment groups: high- or low-dose
      haloperidol, or ondansetron, with a minimum 7-day washout period between treatments. As CHS
      tends to be a recurrent syndrome (presumably given the continued use of cannabis despite
      recommendations to taper and abstain), it is expected that most subjects will return at least
      once again, and a substantial subset of the study population will complete all three
      treatment visits during the trial.
