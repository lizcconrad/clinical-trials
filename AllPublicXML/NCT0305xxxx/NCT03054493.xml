      1. Prevalence of non-nutritive sucking habits (NNSH) in a group of Egyptian children aged
           3-8 years old in Giza Governorate.

        2. Assessment of factors associated with NNSH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have reported on the prevalence of non-nutritive sucking behaviors among
      infants and young children in different populations. Non-nutritive sucking is regarded as a
      normal part of development, and early studies of its prevalence generally found that 70-90%
      of children had some history of a non-nutritive sucking habit. Like these early studies, most
      recent studies have used retrospective methods to assess the prevalence of non-nutritive
      sucking habits.

      Prolonged duration of non-nutritive sucking behaviors may have consequences in regard to the
      developing orofacial structures and occlusion. Little is known as to why some children have
      sucking habits beyond the first 2 to 3 years of life.

      Prevalence of NNSH and associated factors in Egyptian children might be different.
