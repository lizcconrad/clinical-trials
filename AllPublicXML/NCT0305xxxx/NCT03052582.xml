      The aim of the project is to investigate the effects in humans of a daily intake of whole
      milk compared to skimmed milk primarily and secondarily respectively on:

        -  Blood lipids: total-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides

        -  Risk markers of diabetes type 2: plasma glucose and insulin

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized controlled 2 x 3 weeks crossover intervention study with no
      wash-out period, as the lipids in the blood are known to adjust after 2 weeks. The effects of
      a diet containing 0.5 L of whole milk (17.5 g of milk fat/day) will be compared with a diet
      containing 0.5 L of skimmed milk (1.5 g of milk fat/day). Blinding is not possible since the
      appearance of the test foods cannot be concealed. The study subjects will receive the two
      test foods in random order, decided by draw of lots. Blood samples will be drawn on the first
      day of the period and in the end of the period for each 3 week-periods.
