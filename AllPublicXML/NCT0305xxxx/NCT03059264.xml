  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital Myotonic Dystrophy (CDM) is a multi-systemic, dominantly inherited disorder caused
      by a trinucleotide repeat expansion (CTGn) in the DMPK gene. CDM occurs when the CTGn
      increases between the adult myotonic dystrophy type-1 (DM1) parent and the child. Children
      with CDM present at birth with respiratory insufficiency, talipes equinovarus, feeding
      difficulties and hypotonia. There is a 30% mortality rate in the first year of life. As
      children grow, they are at risk for intellectual impairment, autistic features,
      gastrointestinal symptoms, and motor delay.

      The investigators will enroll children with CDM between ages 0-15 with visits at baseline and
      one year to evaluate appropriate physical functional outcomes, cognitive function and quality
      of life over time. Functional outcome measures will be correlated with potential biomarkers
      in the children. Completion of these specific aims will extend the understanding of disease
      progression in CDM and will provide the requisite information for successful therapeutic
      trials in children with DM.

        This study proposes a longitudinal evaluation of 100 children with CDM and 50 healthy
        controls, stratified into the following age cohorts: 0-2 years, 11 months; 3 years to 6
        years, 11 months; and 7 years and older. The age cohorts are created to ensure an even
        distribution across all ages.
