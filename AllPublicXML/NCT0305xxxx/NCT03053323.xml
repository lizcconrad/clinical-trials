      The purpose of the Preconception and Pregnancy Obesity Treatment and Prevention Among Women
      with A History of Depression preliminary study is to provide a lifestyle intervention for
      women with a history of depression who are trying to conceive or are pregnant in order to
      prevent excessive pre-pregnancy weights, avoid excessive gestational weight gain, and to
      improve other markers of metabolic health. The treatment program consists of 10 private
      sessions with a trained clinician at no cost to participants.

      The investigators are evaluating a new lifestyle intervention to help women with a history of
      depression who are pregnant or trying to conceive to learn to exercise, eat well, and live a
      healthy lifestyle. They are interested in examining if this therapy-based program can
      positively impact eating and exercising habits and see if the treatment is enjoyable. All
      participants will receive this intervention.
