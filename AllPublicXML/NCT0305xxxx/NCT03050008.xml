  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advantages already demonstrated by FLACS, these surgeries still require
      ultrasonic devices for fragmentation of the lens. The ultrasonic energy used during
      phacoemulsification may induce complications such as reduction of endothelial cells and
      corneal edema. In this sense, it would be beneficial to develop surgical techniques that
      eliminate the need for ultrasound. The group of surgeons of Alfredo Tranjan Ophthalmic
      Center, recently developed a surgical technique of cataract that optimizes the use of the
      laser, eliminating the need for ultrasound during the surgical procedure. Thus, the
      crystalline fragmentation process does not involve ultrasound being performed by the laser
      itself. It is expected that this procedure will reduce the complexity of cataract surgery,
      and be safer in terms of potential corneal lesions. The present study intends to evaluate the
      benefit and safety of FLACS without use of ultrasound (USFREE), compared to traditional
      phacoemulsification surgery using ultrasound in patients with senile cataract. In this sense,
      it is intended to primarily compare the volume of balanced saline solution (BSS) between
      surgeries.

      Study hypothesis:

      In cataract surgery, the FLACS USFREE technique is not inferior to the traditional
      phacoemulsification technique using ultrasound.

      Primary Objective:

      To compare non-use ultrasound FLACS (USFREE) versus traditional phacoemulsification surgery
      using ultrasound in eyes undergoing cataract surgery relative to the volume of BSS measured
      during surgery.

      Secondary objective (s):

        -  To compare cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) used between eyes submitted to FLACS
           USFREE versus traditional phacoemulsification with ultrasound.

        -  Compare eyes submitted to FLACS USFREE versus traditional phacoemulsification surgery
           using ultrasound, relative to phacoemulsification time.

        -  Comparing eyes subjected to FLACS USFREE versus traditional phacoemulsification surgery
           using ultrasound 1, 7 and 30 days after surgery, for the following parameters:

             -  Endothelial cell count.

             -  Visual acuity.

             -  Corneal topography.

             -  The corneal pachymetry.

             -  Intraocular pressure.

        -  Compare the safety profile of FLACS USFREE versus phacoemulsification surgery with
           ultrasound.

      Study design:

      Interventional, randomized, open and controlled study.

      Study participants will be divided into 2 groups (FLACS without ultrasound and traditional
      phacoemulsification with ultrasound) and the following visits will be conducted:

        -  Visit -1 (pre-operative visit - day -30 to day -1 of surgery). Assessment in both eyes.
           If the two eyes of the research participant are eligible for the study, the eye with the
           least visual acuity that is designated by O1 will be selected and operated first. The
           second operated eye will be designated O2.

        -  Visit 0 (O1 surgery).

        -  Visit 1 (day 1 [+ 2 days] after O1 surgery).

        -  Visit 2 (day 7 [± 2 days] after O1 surgery).

        -  Visit 3 (day 30 [± 2 days] after O1 surgery).

      Research participants with the second eligible eye (O2) will further perform the following
      assessments:

        -  Visit 4 (O2 surgery, which will occur on the same day of Visit 3 [+ 45 days]).

        -  Visit 5 (day 1 [± 2 days] after O2 surgery).

        -  Visit 6 (day 7 [± 2 days] after O2 surgery).

        -  Visit 7 (day 30 [± 2 days] after O2 surgery). Randomization process The included study
           participants will be allocated to one of the 2 treatment groups through
           computer-generated randomization (1: 1 randomization). In research participants with
           both eyes eligible, the surgical procedure will always be the same for both eyes.

      Previously randomized and operated trial participants may not be randomized again in the
      study.
