    <textblock>
      This was an open label, randomised, single dose study, comprising Part A (undertaken in two
      separate three-period crossover cohorts denoted as A1 and A2) and Part B (undertaken in one
      four-period crossover cohort), to evaluate the PK of Chronocort® in healthy male volunteers.
      The washout interval in both Part A and Part B was 1-week in between each treatment period.

             previous study and the first dose of the next study)

          -  Subjects who have consumed more than 2 units of alcohol per day within seven (7) days
