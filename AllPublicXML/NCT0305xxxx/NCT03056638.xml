  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a very precise form of radiation therapy that
      allows the physician to deliver more radiation dose in a single session. Because of this, the
      number of radiation sessions can be reduced from the typical 45-48 sessions, as in
      conventional daily session radiation, to 5 sessions given every other day over a week and a
      half. Giving the radiation at a higher dose during each treatment may be more effective in
      killing the prostate cancer cells than the standard way of using external radiation therapy
      where a small amount of radiation is given over many sessions.

      Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) or hormonal therapy is one of the methods to treat
      intermediate risk prostate cancer. This therapy works by reducing the level of testosterone
      and stopping them from affecting your cancer. The ADT used in this study is known as
      Degarelix. Degarelix is an approved medication that reduces the body's production of
      testosterone; this medication is usually given to all men with intermediate risk prostate
      cancer getting external radiation.

      This study is a randomized study to find out whether combining stereotactic (also known as
      precision) radiation to the prostate cancer combined with a short course of Degarelix will
      result in a greater likelihood of killing the cancer in the prostate compared to stereotactic
      radiation therapy given alone. It has been shown that the combination of radiation with
      medications that interfere with testosterone production and its effects makes prostate cancer
      cells more sensitive to the radiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy proven intermediate risk prostate cancer, which includes patients with any one
             of the following variables:

          -  Gleason 7 disease

          -  PSA 10-20 ng/ml

          -  Clinical T2b-T2c disease Note: Patients who only have radiographic evidence of T3
             disease (i.e. extracapsular extension, or seminal vesical invasion radiographically)
             will not be excluded.

          -  Serum testosterone ≥ 240 ng/dL determined within 2 months prior to enrollment

          -  Prostate size as determined on MRI to be &lt; 90 cc. Prostate size can be determined on
             CT scan if MRI is not available.
