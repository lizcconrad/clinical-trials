    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a possible new
      treatment for Essential Tremor (ET) using external wearable sensors, which have the
      capability of recording acceleration and Electromyography (EMG). This therapy is called
      Responsive Deep Brain Stimulation (R-DBS). R-DBS systems will communicate with a computer,
      and apply stimulation when the computer detects patterns associated with tremor. This
      detection will suppress pathological activity and improve or alleviate the tremor.

      Currently, DBS is approved for the treatment of ET; however, stimulation is delivered
      continuously even when tremor or other symptoms are absent. Continuous DBS can lead to
      unwanted side effects such as stuttering and gait\balance problems. On the other hand, R-DBS
      will turn on only if activity associated with ET from the external sensors is detected.

      The overall purpose of this application is to capture pathological activity related to
      essential tremor using external wearable sensors to responsively initiate or terminate DBS.
      To this end, we propose to use the Nexus-D system, which requires a firm ware update to an
      Activa Implantable Neurostimulator (INS), and it will in a smart way turn DBS on/off in
      patients. We will recruit subjects with Activa Single Channel (SC) implants during 6
      post-operative programming visits. Our research group is already familiar with and is in
      possession of the Nexus-D system, and we have successfully performed responsive DBS in two
      patients with Tourette syndrome (TS) and in four patients with Parkinson's disease in acute
      settings. Our lab is also equipped with wireless wearable sensor and amplifier systems, such
      as a 16-unit wireless EMG+ acceleration+inertia Trigno Wireless Bio Acquisition System
      (Delsys Inc, Natick, MA). We aim to combine these signal modalities to capture pathological
      symptoms and generate commands to initiate or terminate DBS (also record adverse side
      effects, if any). Our goal is to characterize the clinical efficacy, side effect profile, and
      battery life of closed-loop DBS in acute settings using wearable sensors in essential tremor
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  You provide informed consent.

          -  You are over 21 years of age.

          -  You are diagnosed with a postural-intention (essential) tremor for at least 3 years
             and meet strict diagnostic criteria and have been seen and examined by a movement
             disorders fellowship trained neurologist.

          -  You have had a significant disabling medical-refractory upper extremity tremor with no
             evidence of supraspinal central nervous system disease or injury (tremor not
             adequately controlled by medications for at least three (3) months before implant).

          -  You have had a postural or kinetic tremor severity score of at least 3 out of 4 in the
