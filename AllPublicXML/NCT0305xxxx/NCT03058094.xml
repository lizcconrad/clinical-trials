      A Phase III, Open-Label, Randomized Multicenter Study to Compare AC0010 and
      Pemetrexed/Cisplatin in Patients With Advanced NSCLC Who Have Progressed Following Prior EGFR
      TKI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, open label, randomized study assessing AC0010 (300 mg, BID) versus
      pemetrexed/cisplatin (4-6 cycles) in patients with advanced NSCLC, who have progressed
      following prior therapy with EGFR-TKI.

      Patients must provide a biopsy for central confirmation of T790M mutation positive. Eligible
      patients will be randomized (2:1) into AC0010 group or pemetrexed/cisplatin group. Patients
      in chemotherapy group can cross-over to AC0010 treatment when patients experience disease
      progression or intolerability of chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study is to
      compare the PFS of AC0010 and pemetrexed/cisplatin.
