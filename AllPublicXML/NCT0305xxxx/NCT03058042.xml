    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effect of outpatient pelvic floor muscle
      training versus home pelvic floor muscle training in the treatment of stress urinary
      incontinence. The hypothesis of this study is that home pelvic floor muscle training is as
      effective as outpatient pelvic floor muscle training for the treatment of stress urinary
      incontinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Success with the pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is hampered by non-adherence, which is
      related to factors such as inability to contract the pelvic floor muscles and lack of
      motivation. Thus under supervision by a physiotherapist (outpatient training), PFMT has the
      potential of improving adherence to training and has been demonstrated to be more effective
      when compared to unsupervised PFMT (home training). The objective of this study is to compare
      the effect of outpatient pelvic floor muscle training versus home pelvic floor muscle
      training in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. This is a randomized controlled
      trial and which will be conducted at the Division of Urogynecology and Reconstructive Pelvic
      Surgery at the Federal University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. As a primary endpoint, the
      standardized volume test pad (250 mL) will be used. To assert that one of the groups (home
      PFMT or outpatient PFMT) is superior to the other, it will be necessary to find 38.5% more
      patients cured when the groups are compared. Secondary outcome measures will be used,
      assessment of the pelvic floor muscles function, urinary symptoms, quality of life and
      subjective cure.

    <description>Patients will perform strength training of the pelvic floor muscles daily at home. The training protocol consists of three sets of 30 slow contractions (type I muscle fibers), with maintenance contraction according to the initial evaluation, followed by three rapid contractions (type II muscle fibers) after each slow contraction. The protocol will account for 90 contractions of the pelvic floor muscles per day. At the end of one month, the patients will return for consultation, in which the MAP evaluation and training progression will be performed.</description>
