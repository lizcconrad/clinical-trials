    <textblock>
      Cohort study using data from Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The study cohort
      includes all patients who received at least one prescription for ticagrelor for the first
      time between December 2010 and March 2015, following ACS. Patient baseline characteristics
      will be described: (Age, Gender, Body Mass Index, Smoking status, Sociodemographic status),
      type of ACS and interventions, CV history and comorbidities, bleeding and respiratory
      history.

      The following outcomes will be examined: Incidence of vascular events (composite MI, Stroke,
      vascular death, specific vascular event and all cause death), incidence of bleeding and
      incidence of dysponea. Time to event for vascular events, bleeding and dyspnoea.
