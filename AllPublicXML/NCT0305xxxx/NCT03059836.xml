  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the influence of n3 PUFA supplementation on the rate of muscle
      atrophy in women undergoing 2 weeks of unilateral limb immobilization. Assessments in
      skeletal muscle strength and skeletal muscle volume will also me made before, after and in
      recovery from immobilization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biological aging is associated with the loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength resulting
      in compromised metabolic function and mobility. Throughout life, individuals will also
      experience periods of reduced physical activity/muscle disuse that independently lower muscle
      mass and strength accelerating the aging process. The losses in muscle mass with aging and
      disuse are underpinned by feeding-induced declines in rates of muscle protein synthesis.
      Thus, strategies to enhance muscle protein synthesis could have clinical implications for
      those who wish to maintain metabolic health and function during times of muscle disuse.

      Supplementation with n3 PUFA-enriched fish oil has been shown to potentiate rates of muscle
      protein synthesis in response to simulated feeding in both younger and older adults. Fish oil
      supplementation also has been efficacious in enhancing skeletal muscle strength during a
      period of resistance exercise training. However, no study has examined the impact of fish oil
      supplementation to enhance muscle protein synthesis and offset declines in muscle
      mass/strength during a period of immobilization.
