  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore whether active transcranial direct current
      stimulation during cognitive rehabilitation tasks can boost cognitive enhancement without
      severe side effects in mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia patients.

      This study explores the additive effect of transcranial direct stimulation compared to sham
      stimulation during cognitive rehabilitation tasks in mild cognitive impairment or mild
      dementia patients. Potential participants are recruited by physicians' referral or
      self-entry. Informed consent by a clinical research coordinator and research physician is
      performed followed by screening. Participants who passed screening go through 10 sessions of
      active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation and are evaluated their cognitive
      function at screening, at the end, and two weeks after the intervention. For quality
      assurance, independent researcher regularly monitor and audit as participants are enrolled in
      the trial.
