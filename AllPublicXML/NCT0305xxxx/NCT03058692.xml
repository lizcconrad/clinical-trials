  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 120 males and
      non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, who are in good health and meet all
      eligibility criteria. This clinical trial will be conducted at 3 United States sites and is
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of two priming doses of
      M-001 followed by a seasonal quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4). The duration
      of this trial for each subject will be approximately 7 months. The entire study duration will
      be approximately 24 months. The primary objectives are: 1) To assess the safety as measured
      by vaccine related adverse events, reactogenicity, and laboratory adverse events of two doses
      of M-001 vaccine, each dose administered approximately 21 days apart; and 2) To assess the T
      cell responses to M-001 component peptides following two doses of M-001.

      objectives are: 1) To assess all serious adverse events (SAEs) following receipt of each dose
      of M-001 vaccine or placebo, each dose separated by approximately 21 days, through the end of
      the study; 2) To assess all unsolicited non-serious AEs following receipt of each dose of
      M-001 or placebo, each dose separated by approximately 21 days, through 21 days after each
      dose of M-001 or placebo; and 3) To assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses to the
      2018-2019 IIV4 vaccine viruses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for
             all study visits.

          3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive.

          4. Are in good health, as determined by medical history and targeted physical examination
             to evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions,
             defined as those that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the
             assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations.
             Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days. This
             includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result
             of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to
             enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,
             insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same
             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as
             determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will
             not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic
             or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator
             or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or
             assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of
             medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment
             and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the
             subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there
             is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses
             to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the
             exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria,
             herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted).

          5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees F.

          6. Pulse is 50 to 100 bpm, inclusive.

          7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mm Hg, inclusive.

          8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive.

          9. Women of childbearing potential* must use an acceptable method of contraception** from
             30 days prior to vaccination until 60 days after the second of dose of M-001 or
             placebo.

         10. Women of childbearing potential* must use an acceptable method of contraception** from
             30 days prior to receipt of IIV vaccination, and must plan to use until 28 days after
             the IIV.

             *Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, or
             successful Essure placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal sterilization with
             history of documented radiological confirmation test achieved or with use of another
             approved birth control method if confirmation test not confirmed) and still
             menstruating or &lt; 1 year of the last menses if menopausal).

             **Includes, but is not limited to, non-male sexual relationships, abstinence from
             sexual intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with a vasectomized
             partner, male condoms with the use of applied spermicide, intrauterine devices,
             NuvaRing, and licensed hormonal methods such as implants, injectables, contraceptive
             patches or oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;). Method of contraception will be captured
             on the appropriate data collection form.

         11. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to study vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have an acute illness*, as determined by the site PI or appropriate sub-investigator,
             within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.

             *An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms remaining
             is allowable if, in the opinion of the site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, the
             residual symptoms will not interfere with the ability to assess safety parameters as
             required by the protocol.

          2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site PI or
             appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study participation**.

             **Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting for
             at least 90 days, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury,
             render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere
             with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this study.

          3. Have immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, or use of
             anticancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy (cytotoxic) within 3 years prior to study
             vaccination.

          4. Have known active neoplastic disease or a history of any hematologic malignancy.
             Non-melanoma skin cancers that are not active are permitted.

          5. Have known HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.

          6. Have known hypersensitivity or allergy to eggs, egg or chicken protein, or other
             components of the study vaccine.

          7. Have a history of severe reactions following previous immunization with licensed or
             unlicensed influenza vaccines.

          8. Have a history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome.

          9. Have a history of alcohol or drug abuse within 5 years prior to study vaccination.

         10. Have any diagnosis, current or past, of schizophrenia, bipolar disease, or other
             psychiatric diagnosis that may interfere with subject compliance or safety
