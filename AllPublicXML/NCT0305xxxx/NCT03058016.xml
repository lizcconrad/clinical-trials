    <textblock>
      This clinical study is designed to evaluate the providing of a computational prediction
      engine for optimization of personalized nutrition

      Personalized recommendations for effective diet, lifestyle and activities based on the
      patient's parameters measurements and reactions will be provided on a bi-weekly basis, all
      Lab tests and dietician control will be performed twice a month.

      Pre-diabetic and pre-metabolic syndrome patients will be recruited to the study for a period
      of one year.

      After measurement of individual's parameters changes as blood tests, gut microbiome, urine
      tests, blood pressure, heart performance, body circumferences, mood and mental status as well
      as monitoring each individual's food intake - a model to predict individual's body reaction
      according to lifestyle, eating and activity habits will be built.

      Personalized recommendations for effective diet, lifestyle and activities based on the
      patient's parameters measurements and reactions will be provided on a bi-weekly basis, all
