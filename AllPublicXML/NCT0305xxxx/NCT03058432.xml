    <description>A combined primary end point, named &quot;therapeutic success&quot;(TS), was used; it took into account activity, toxicity, and compliance.A TS was defined as a patient completing radiotherapy at the planned dose and schedule (no re-treatment delays beyond 2 weeks), and having an objective response (either complete or partial based on RECIST criteria) without (1) grade 3-4 nonhematological toxicity, (2) complications associated with hematologic toxicity such as febrile neutropenia, infection, bleeding, or transfusion, or (3) any toxicity leading to hospitalization or death.</description>
