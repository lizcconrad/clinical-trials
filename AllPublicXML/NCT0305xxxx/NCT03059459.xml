  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have demonstrated the association between atmospheric pollution and chronic
      respiratory diseases. The magnitude of this association and its dependence of local factors
      are still unknown in Argentina, particularly for obstructive lung diseases like asthma and
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The objective of this study is to assess the
      effect of atmospheric pollution due to particulate matter (PM) on asthma and COPD
      exacerbations in adults. A prospective cohort study will be carried out in patients attending
      the pulmonary service of a public hospital located in San Nicolas, Buenos Aires province,
      Argentina. Patients will be followed for 12 months after recruitment. The outcome variables
      will be the frequency of hospitalizations or emergency department consults for asthma or COPD
      exacerbations and related conditions, and the impact of COPD on a person's life as measured
      by the COPD assessment test (CAT) questionnaire. The exposure will be the pollution level in
      the particular address, measuring PM10 concentrations with portable equipment. Other
      variables as air temperature, humidity, and individual patient risk factors will be
      considered as potential confounders or effect modifiers. The associations will be estimated
      through regression models, i.e. logistic and Poisson regressions and recurrent event survival
      analysis. The results of this study should provide elements to estimate the risk of chronic
      respiratory diseases associated with atmospheric pollution, and to evaluate strategies for
      risk assessment in the local community.
