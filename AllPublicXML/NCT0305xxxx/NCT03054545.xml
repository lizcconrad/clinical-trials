      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel chemical synthetic agent
      iguratimod as treatment of refractory lupus nephritis. All subjects should have at least one
      failed immunosuppressive treatment and suffer active nephritis at the screening stage. The
      study period is 52 week. All the subject will receive therapy of iguratimod combined with
      steroids.
