On Day 2 (24 hours postdose), ECGs will again be extracted from the Holter device (24 hours postdose). High-precision QT analyses (HPQT) will be performed using data extracted from the 24-hour Holter recording. QT interval corrected for heart rate using Friderica's formula (QTcF) intervals will be estimated and used for the HPQT analyses. Other correction methods such as QTc (individual) and QT beat-to-beat (QTbTb) may be used if QTcF is not deemed to be appropriate. Mean change from Baseline is calculated as the post-Baseline visit value minus the Baseline value.</description>
