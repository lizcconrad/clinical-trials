    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an early rehabilitation program in surgical
      intensive care unit is safe and effective in preventing critical care illness and intensive
      care unit acquired weakness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the complications like intensive care unit-acquired weakness, critical illness
      polyneuropathy and neuropsychiatric disease of critical care, many organizations focus on
      rehabilitation in critically ill patients' management. Despite the good outcomes from papers,
      there are debatable issues of method, safety and efficacy of rehabilitation. The
      investigators developed an early rehabilitation program (ERP) in our surgical ICU management
      and assessed safety and efficacy of it.

      The ERP started in November 2014 in our 14-bed surgical ICU in Asan Medical Center. The
      investigators focused on early and 5-step rehabilitation program for patients who were
      admitted to SICU for at least 3 days. The investigators enrolled 69 patients (pre-ERP group)
      for 6 months before November 2014 and 62 patients (post-ERP group) for 6 months 1 year after
      the ERP started. The main measures were safety issues, delirium days, 28-d ventilator
      free-days, 28-d ICU free-days, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU mortality, in-hospital
      mortality and 1 year mortality.
