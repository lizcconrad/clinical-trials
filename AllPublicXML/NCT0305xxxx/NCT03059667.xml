  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy still constitutes the backbone of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) therapy,
      particularly in the extensive disease (ED) stage (ED-SCLC). Despite the fact that a
      substantial complete response rate could be achieved in SCLC patients receiving etoposide -
      cisplatin doublet, cure remains the exception. Overall survival in patients receiving this
      combination is 10 months and progression free survival 6.3 months. At time of progression two
      options are hitherto accepted: reinduction of carboplatin - etoposide doublet or, for
      patients unfit for reinduction, topotecan single-drug regimen. However, in both clinical
      cases, median survival hardly achieves 33 weeks. Consistent data using anti - PDL1
      (Programmed death-ligand 1) or anti PD1 (programmed cell death 1) antibodies suggest that
      they are active as single drug regimens in many malignant diseases. Taking into account the
      rich tumor infiltrating lymphocyte in pathological specimens of SCLC, we can hypothesize that
      experimental use of ATEZOLIZUMAB (MPDL3280A) in patients is ethical pending that it
      demonstrates activity in the second line setting.
