  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The refinement of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has highlighted its
      merit in terms of learning programs as a treatment for aftereffect augmentation.
      Nevertheless, the efficacy of synchronous rTMS protocol integrated with computer-integrated
      speech training is not well understood. It is also not clear regarding the efficacy of
      compound bi-hemispheric stimulation protocol. The aim of the study is to investigate language
      response to these new strategies and to determine the longevity of the therapeutic outcome.
      Advanced MR neuroimaging techniques, such as fMRI and DTI, are powerful tools to evaluate the
      concomitant nervous changes after rTMS treatment on aphasic patients. The knowledge from fMRI
      and DTI microstructural evolution provides insight into underlined mechanism operating the
      language improvement.
