  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the feasibility of using novel/existing imaging technologies focused on
      hypoxia measurements to determine &quot;response to therapy&quot; in pediatric soft tissue sarcomas as
      a pilot study. Specifically, the investigators will compare the sensitivity of Blood Oxygen
      Level Dependent [BOLD], Diffusion-Weighted [DW] MRI, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)
      and 18F-FAZA PET-MRI with that of conventional MRI to detect measurement changes between the
      start and completion of neoadjuvant therapy (&quot;response to therapy&quot;) in children and
      adolescents (7-18 years) with suspicion of sarcoma tumors. Clinicians and scientists may use
      results of the proposed hypoxia-imaging surrogate markers to adjust/modify therapeutic
      schemes to patients on a personalized basis.
