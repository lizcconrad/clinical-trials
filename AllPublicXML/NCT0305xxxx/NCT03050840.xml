  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity [Body mass index (BMI kg/m2 ≥ 95th percentile)] affects 1 in 5 adolescents in the
      United States, with 13 million suffering from severe obesity (BMI ≥ 120% &gt; 95th percentile or
      ≥ 35 mg/kg2). Adolescents are able to lose weight with behavioral changes in diet and
      physical activity, but change in these behaviors requires self-monitoring and support, and
      weight loss is not always successful.

      Parent involvement and parent weight-loss can help their children to lose weight and
      successfully change their behavior. Guidance from pediatricians can also help to facilitate
      weight loss among obese adolescents. That said, treatment of obesity through behavior change
      within the time constraints of a Pediatric practice visit is limited by treatment adherence
      and clinic visit attendance. Therefore, finding cost-effective, timely, methods to keep
      adolescents with severe obesity engaged in therapy outside of standard practice is a critical
      need.

      The effects of monetary incentives through games (gamification), and a comprehensive remote
      digital monitoring system on sleep, physical activity, and dietary intake, has been
      successful in adults, but has not been tested in adolescents with obesity.
