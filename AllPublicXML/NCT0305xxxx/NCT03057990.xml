  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study designed to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pyrimethamine
      and provide the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the treatment of intermediate/high-risk
      MDS that is refractory to or relapsed after treatment with azanucleosides.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of pyrimethamine in intermediate / high-risk / relapsed or
      azanucleoside-refractory MDS within the confines of a phase I study.

      Pyrimethamine self-administered by participants orally once per day in morning with food.
      Phase 1 study will start at dose of 50 mg once per day. (NOTE: For participants at dose level
      of 50mg, the dose reduction, if needed is 25 mg.)

      Intra-patient dose escalation is permitted (not beyond the highest dose allowed) if Complete
      Remission/Response (CR) is not reached in week 1 of Cycle 3 and there is no significant
      toxicity. (NOTE: In this study, the term &quot;intra-patient&quot; indicates within each participant
      and not between different participants; i.e., dose escalation will be done within each
      individual participant.) The decision to escalate intra-patient doses will be based on safety
      and dose tolerance assessments made at the end of one treatment cycle (28 days of continuous
      drug administration) for all 6 participants. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as the
      occurrence of two consecutive grade 2 or 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) not recovered within
      24 hours at a given dose. MTD will be defined as the dose where no DLT is observed among
      three consecutive participants, or no more than one DLT among six participants. Participants
      will be treated initially for one 28-day cycle followed by a toxicity evaluation - Toxicity
      and adverse effect assessments will be made on Day 1 and Day 28 of every cycle of therapy.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of child-bearing potential must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90
             days following completion of therapy. If a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

               -  A woman of child-bearing potential is any female (regardless of sexual
                  orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice)
                  who meets the following criteria:

                    -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months
                       (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Male and Female patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline will
        be excluded from study participation:

          -  Current or anticipated use of other investigational agents

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from clinically significant adverse
             events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier. The Principal
             Investigator or treating investigator will determine if any abnormal laboratory values
             or toxicities are due to prior agents administered vs. disease and if they are
             clinically significant.

          -  History of allergic reactions or sensitivity to pyrimethamine

          -  Patients with a history of folic acid deficiency, currently on folic acid replacement
             therapy or a previous history of megaloblastic anemia thought related to folic acid
             deficiency

          -  Current use or anticipated need for treatment with any medications or substances that
             are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C9.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant or nursing. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pyrimethamine
             is a class C agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. As
             pyrimethamine is also secreted in breast milk, lactating women are also excluded from
             the study. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pyrimethamine, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued if the mother is treated with pyrimethamine. These potential risks may
             also apply to other agents used in this study. There is a potential for congenital
             abnormalities and for this regimen to harm nursing infants
