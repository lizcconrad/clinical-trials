  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective, observational study the investigators compared resistance values measured
      using the airway perturbation device (APD) to impulse oscillometry and spirometry. The
      investigators also created reference equations for normal APD resistance ranges using the
      data from clinically normal volunteers.
