    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the clinical effects of Ozone-oxygen therapy as
      therapeutic substance for nucleolysis application in the patients with cervical disc hernia
      who had chronic pain and weakness on the neck, shoulders and arms

      This is a retrospective, single-center study that is going to be conducted from November 2013
      to May 2016 on patients visiting the pain clinic of the hospital who were treated with
      Ozone-oxygen therapy for cervical discogenic or radicular pain.

      Data collected from medical record forms and electronic medical record system of the hospital
      were used in the retrospective analysis of medical data with regard to age, gender,
      complications.

      A resident who has not involved in the study interviewed each patient by telephone on the
      follow up to collect the related information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  continuous radicular pain radiating to the upper limb, with a duration ≥8 weeks and an
             intensity &gt;4/10 as rated by the patient on a visual analog scale (VAS)

          -  resistant to appropriate conservative treatment combining antiinflammatory drugs, and
             confirmed by imaging with CT or MRI of a herniated disc putting pressure on a nerve
             root consistent with the clinical pain.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  history of surgery at the cervical spine, contraindication to percutaneous
             chemonucleolysis (coagulopathy or infection), imaging results that did not support the
             clinical results, the presence of a herniated disc excluded or calcified on imaging,
             possible interference with pain evaluation due to any medical condition or treatment,
             involvement of incomplete data collection
