      This prospective, multi-center, observational study is designed to assess the real world
      effectiveness and safety of paritaprevir/r - ombitasvir with dasabuvir (3DAA [direct-acting
      antiviral agent] ABBVIE REGIMEN) without ribavirin (RBV) in participants with chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b (GT1b) infection and compensated liver cirrhosis in
      Russia.
