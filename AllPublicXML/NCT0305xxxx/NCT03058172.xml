  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to better understand the reciprocal influence of visual
      and olfactory systems on cerebral activity evoked by odors and visual stimuli. Given the
      importance of olfacto-visual learning in expert situations, the degree of expertise in
      olfaction will also be considered. In addition, the investigators will try to better
      understand the differences between expert and non-expert populations in olfaction through
      different levels of approach: sensory, genetic and cerebral. To achieve this, the
      investigators will use psychophysical tests, genetic analyzes and a non-invasive technique,
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the brain activity of human subjects
      - novices or experts in olfaction - in response to different visual and olfactory stimuli.

    <description>Several different odors will be diffused by an olfactometer under the participants' nostrils, though a controlled airflow, and synchronously with the participants' respiration. fMRI designs require repeated stimulus presentation. Odors will also be presented (in flasks or in odor pens) outside the scanner.</description>
