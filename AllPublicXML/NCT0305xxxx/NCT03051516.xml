    <textblock>
      This randomized phase IV trial studies how well human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine therapy
      works in interrupting progression in patients with high-grade vulvar or anal lesions.
      Vaccines made from HPV peptides or antigens may help the body build an effective immune
      response to kill tumor cells and decrease the chance of vulvar or anal lesions to progress or
      come back.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test if the recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine (9vHPV vaccine) delivered
      after treatment for high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) reduces the risk of
      histologically confirmed recurrent neoplastic lesions (HSIL) by 50% in the vaccinated versus
      (vs.) placebo arms.

      II. Evaluate safety of the HPV vaccine in HSIL participants.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive recombinant human papillomavirus nonavalent vaccine intramuscularly
      (IM) at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IM at baseline, 2 months, and 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at months 7, 12, 18, 24, 36,
      and 42.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Will compare the rate of recurrence in each arm of the study. Will include all recurrences, not just first recurrences using Poisson regression with a robust variance estimate, comparing the total number of recurrences for each arm over the total follow-up per arm.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Human papillomavirus (HPV) antibody level</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Will evaluate placebo and vaccine recipients separately. Will assess whether presence and amount of HPV antibody, detected at baseline in the placebo arm, is protective against recurrence. For the vaccine arm, will assess whether magnitude of vaccine antibody levels month 1 following the third vaccination in the vaccine arm affects recurrence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Human papillomavirus (HPV) persistence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Will evaluate whether risk of recurrence is more frequent among those with HPV persistence. Persistence will be measured by HPV genotype or HPV16 variant lineage from swab samples collected at months 0, 18 and 36. Will use Cox proportional hazards, but including a time-dependent covariate of HPV persistence by deoxyribonucleic acid detection from swab samples.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AEs) graded according to the Food and Drug Administration criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Will monitor safety by comparing type and frequency of AEs in the two study arms.</description>
