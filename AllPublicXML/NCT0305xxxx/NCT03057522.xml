  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot study to determine if a 6 week home training program can increase
      preferred step rate (cadence) in recreational runners. Increase in step rate has been
      correlated with decreased stress at lower limb joints in runners. This has the potential of
      decreasing overuse injuries in this population.

      Research participants will have their preferred cadence evaluated at the beginning of the
      study. The athletes will be randomly assigned to two groups. One group will continue to train
      without intervention and the other group will train at a cadence of 10% higher than their
      preferred step rate.

      At the end of 6 weeks the participants will have their preferred cadence reevaluated using
      the same method as pre-participation cadence was determined.

      The investigators hypothesis the preferred running cadence of recreational runners following
      the intervention will be 5-10% greater than prior to the intervention and the increased
      cadence will be maintained for 6 months following the intervention.
