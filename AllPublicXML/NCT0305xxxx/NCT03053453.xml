  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate and compare patients undergoing total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA) with sensor guidance versus that of a standard technique. Each patient
      will be assessed for the difference between passive, soft tissue controlled, pressure balance
      and muscle activated pressure balance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective study looking at the impact sensor guidance has on the
      outcome of patients and comparing to that of patients with a standard technique. The study is
      also designed to evaluate the difference between passive, soft tissue controlled, pressure
      balance and muscle activated pressure balance. Prior to the randomized study, there will be
      an observational pilot of 25 patients. These patients will not be randomized and will receive
      standard of care anesthesia. The reason for the 25 pilot patients is to perfect the sensor
      guidance so all subsequent study patients will have a streamlined, consistent measurement.

    <measure>Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS consists of 5 subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in sport and recreation (Sport/Rec) and knee related Quality of life (QOL). The previous week is the time period considered when answering the questions. Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale (scoring instructions are available in a separate document: KOOS Scoring).</description>

    <description>The Verasense Knee System device (OrthoSensor inc., Dania Beach, Florida) is a sterile sensor system that replaces the tibial insert trials used during surgery. The sensor contains a microprocessor and integrated nanosensor system, which wirelessly transmits real-time data to a portable graphic display unit used for read-out of the data. The sensor measures and localizes peak load at the medial and lateral tibiofemoral joint interfaces. Loading data is thereby captured intra-operatively through the full range of movement (ROM) using the sensor system.</description>
