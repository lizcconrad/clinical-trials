      Prospective, randomized Study of tunneled cuffed hemodialysis catheter removal and delayed
      replacement, versus exchange over a guidewire to treat catheter related blood stream
      infection

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of catheter-related (CRBSI)
      managed with two different strategies: Guidewire exchange of the infected catheter with a new
      one over a guidewire versus catheter removal with delayed replacement.
