    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted as an extension of the phase II clinical trial
      SRPL/CLI/10-11/001 (NCT01484574). The CDSCO has recommended flexibility for continued
      clinical study in consultation with ICMR, as per recommendation of Cellular biology based
      therapeutic drug evaluation committee (CBBTDEC).

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of intramuscular injection of stempeucel(R)
      (Ex vivo cultured adult bone marrow derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells) in Critical
      Limb Ischemia due to Buerger's Disease

  <why_stopped>
    Form 46 from DCGI for the manufacturing &amp; commercial marketing of Stempeucel® directs
    Stempeutics to conduct PMS study. Hence this study is being terminated.
