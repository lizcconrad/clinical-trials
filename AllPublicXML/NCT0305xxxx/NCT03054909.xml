  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized phase II study of an IL-15Rα-Fc super-agonist complex
      (ALT-803) given as maintenance therapy after the completion of 1st line IV/IP chemotherapy
      for the treatment of advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study all patients receive four 8 week cycles of ALT-803 consisting of 4 weekly doses
      followed by a 4 week rest (no treatment). As it is not known how intraperitoneal (IP)
      administration (a route of drug administration frequently used for gynecologic cancers) of
      ALT-803 compares to subcutaneous (SQ) administration, both routes of administration will be
      tested. The primary objective of this trial is to select one method of delivery for further
      testing.
