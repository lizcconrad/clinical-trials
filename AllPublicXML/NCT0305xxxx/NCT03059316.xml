  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlled hypotension has been used as a mean of reducing intraoperative blood loss and
      better visualization of the surgical field in nasal surgeries. Perfusion index has been
      considered a useful tool for monitoring changes in peripheral perfusion using Masimo set and
      serum lactate for central perfusion. Many medications were used to induce hypotension. In
      this study we will compare the effects of tridil and labetalol on the perfusion.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to detect the degree of hypotension that helps the surgeon and
      dosen`t impair patient`s perfusion and to compare the hypotensive effects of both tridil and
      labetalol infusions on the perfusion.
