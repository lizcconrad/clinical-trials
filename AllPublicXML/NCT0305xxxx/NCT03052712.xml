  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of disorders of socio-emotional processes in cerebral diseases such as Alzheimer's
      disease, frontal temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, traumatic
      brain injury, stroke, focal lesions, has been recognized recently. Social cognition refers to
      a large group of emotional and cognitive abilities regulating inter-individuals relationships
      and it includes mainly theory of mind, emotional information processing and empathy. However,
      assessment of socio-emotional processes is still largely based on experimental tests that are
      not validated for clinical purpose. In addition their long duration of administration is not
      adapted to clinical examination. Finally these tests have not been standardized and
      normalized in French-speaking population.
