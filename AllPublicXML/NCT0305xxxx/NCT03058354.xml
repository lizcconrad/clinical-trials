  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol is a commonly used anaesthetic with rapid recovery and less side effects and total
      intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol is a common technique now. The reduction on
      certain serum pro- inflammatory cytokines may lead to more smooth post- surgical recovery.

      Recent case report proved the analgesic effect of propofol infusion. However other animal and
      clinical studies showed controversial result.

      The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate the postoperative analgesic effects and
      side effects of intraoperative TIVA with propofol in patient undergoing surgery at Queen Mary
      Hospital, Hong Kong between 2014 to 2016.

      Objectives:

        1. To investigate the analgesic effects of propofol.

        2. To evaluate the effect of propofol on postoperative adverse events.

      Methods:

      Retrospective audit.

      Data Collection:

        1. Demographic data;

        2. Types of analgesic techniques;

        3. Type of pain relief modalities;

        4. Pain score up to 72 hours postoperatively;

        5. Postoperative opioid consumption;

        6. Incidence of adverse events during APS care;

        7. Patients' satisfaction on pain relief.
