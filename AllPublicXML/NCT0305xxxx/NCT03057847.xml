  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incorporating HCV treatment into opioid maintenance treatment program clinical protocols is
      an innovative health care delivery model that has been associated with improved HCV treatment
      uptake in non-pregnant, drug-using populations. This &quot;medical home&quot; approach would combine
      HCV and opioid maintenance treatment into one treatment regimen and incorporate the expertise
      of obstetricians, hepatologists, substance abuse treatment providers and pediatricians into
      one comprehensive clinical care model. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      feasibility/acceptability of a combined, peripartum HCV and opioid maintenance treatment
      program on adherence to HCV treatment regimens and evaluate the rate of IVDU recidivism, HCV
      reinfection and health related QOL in women with OUD during the first postpartum year.

      The protocol involves three separate study phases. All 3 study phases will occur with support
      from hepatology providers at Magee-Womens Hospital. Phase 1 involves screening, enrollment
      and a baseline assessment of liver function, HCV infection (genotype, viral load) and blood
      and urine studies in HCV-infected patients during pregnancy. In Phase 2, subjects will
      undergo 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy initiated at 2 weeks postpartum.
      Feasibility/acceptability and adherence to sofosbuvir/velpatasvir will be assessed at 4, 8
      and 12 weeks of therapy. In Phase 3, subjects will continue to be followed for 15 months
      after treatment completion. Treatment effectiveness and SVR will be evaluated at 3 months and
      rates of IVDU recidivism, HCV reinfection and patient centered outcomes such as health
      related quality of life (QOL) will be assessed at 6, 9 and 12 months following treatment
      completion.
