  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Approximately half of head and neck cancer patients are 65 years or older at
      diagnosis. Treatment decisions in this older HNCA population are challenging, because of the
      lack of evidence-based guidelines. Surgery is often the treatment of choice in a HNCA setting
      where curative treatment is intended. Though chronological age per se has not been reported
      as a contraindication for surgery, data are limited and often the result of retrospective
      studies. Measurement of functional age, through a comprehensive geriatric assessment, has
      been suggested by several international cancer organizations to be a better prognostic
      indicator. At the divisions of maxillofacial surgery and otorhinolaryngology, a geriatric
      assessment is part of routine preoperative staging for patients of 70 years old or older.

      Objectives The investigators aim to determine the value of G8 to predict 30-day postoperative
      comorbidity in an older HNCA population undergoing elective curative surgery. Moreover, they
      aim to examine the vulnerability profile of patients undergoing elective head and neck
      surgery for an oncology diagnosis.

      Study design All patients of 70 years and older, presenting at the divisions of maxillofacial
      surgery and otorhinolaryngology for curative surgery of a solid head and neck tumour undergo
      a geriatric consult as part of routine preoperative staging. The presence of postoperative
      morbidity and mortality within the first 30 days after surgery will be collected as a primary
      endpoint.

      At 30±10 days postoperative, all patients will be re-evaluated with the G8 and the CGA.
      Patient' quality of life will also be re-examined within 30 days postoperative and again at 6
      and 12 months postoperative.

      Conclusion There is still no consensus whether older HNCA patients should receive a different
      treatment compared to younger patients. Data related to the vulnerability profile of older
      patients requiring HN surgery, and the predictive value of geriatric screening for
      postoperative morbidity could enable better patient selection in the future.
