      This is an open-labeled, non-randomized feasibility study to evaluate the safety of prostate
      artery embolization (PAE) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to
      benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

      This pilot study will be a single center, open labeled, non-randomized feasibility study to
      evaluate the initial safety of PAE for the treatment of symptomatic bladder outlet
      obstruction. 30 adult male subjects will be enrolled in this study. If eligible patients will
      undergo the prostate artery embolization procedure in the Interventional Radiology
      department. An angiogram of the prostate arteries will be done. Small beads called Bead Block
      microspheres will be injected into the prostate artery to slow blood flow to the prostate in
      the hope of providing relief with minimal side effects and complications, for lower urinary
      tract symptoms caused by BPH. After the procedure the patient will be followed at 4 weeks, 12
      weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post procedure.

    <description>The number and the severity of adverse events will be recorded to evaluate safety. Events will be reported by subjects and the severity of events will be graded using the following scale:
Mild (grade 1): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily activities Moderate (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily activities Severe (grade 3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status Life-threatening (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event Fatal (grade 5): the event caused death.
Specific events evaluated will include Infection at procedure or urinary catheter site, prostate abscess, pain, hematospermia, hematuria, burning in the urethra, diarrhea, bleeding from the rectum, bladder injury, and radiation exposure by physical exam, lab value and urine flow testing at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post procedure.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of LUTS secondary to BPH refractory to/contraindicated for medical
             treatment. Patients with indwelling foley catheters will be treated with culture
             directed antibiotics one time for 5-7 days. The catheter will be removed so urodynamic
             testing and cystoscopy can be completed as part of the screening visit. It will be
             replaced when testing is completed.
