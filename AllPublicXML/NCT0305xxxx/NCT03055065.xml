    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study is to assess the characteristics and frequency of adenovirus
      conjunctivitis in a population of male and female patients from one year of age who present
      signs and symptoms of acute conjunctivitis.

      Epidemiological, prospective, open, multicentric trial in patients suffering from acute
      conjunctivitis who will undergo a rapid diagnostic test for adenoviral conjunctivitis at the
      time of their visit to the ophthalmologist office, at the emergency room or during
      hospitalization. This epidemiological study will include approximately 500 patients in Italy.
      The planned duration of the study is one year from the first patient visit to the last
      patient visit.
