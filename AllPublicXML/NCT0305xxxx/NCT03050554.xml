  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether avelumab has an effect on cancer and body in
      combination with SBRT, a standard treatment for early stage non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

      Avelumab is considered experimental because it is not approved by the United States (U.S.)
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cancer. It is a type of drug called a
      monoclonal antibody (a type of protein). Monoclonal antibodies are made to recognize, target
      and bind to specific proteins on the cells that make up your tissues. Avelumab is designed to
      block the interaction between PD-1, a known immune checkpoint, and PD-L1. By blocking this
      interaction, the immune system may be stimulated, allowing it to more effectively recognize
      and attack the cancer.

      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a type of radiation that uses precise targeting
      to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor over a short period of time. A positioning
      cushion such as Vac-lok will be used during radiation treatment that is custom made. This
      custom mold forms to the contours of the subjects body to allow for proper positioning
      comfort and stability.

      This is a single arm open label Phase I/II study that will consist of two parts. In Phase I,
      investigators will assess the safety and tolerability of SBRT combined with Avelumab. In
      Phase II, investigators will determine whether SBRT combined with Avelumab improves relapse
      free survival. Subjects with Stage I NSCLC who are not undergoing surgical resection will be
      candidates for enrollment. Subjects will receive definitive stereotactic body radiation
      (SBRT) in 4-5 fractions combined with concurrent and adjuvant Avelumab at 10mg/kg for a total
      of 6 cycles. Subjects will be evaluated for safety as measured by the occurrence of adverse
      events, serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities. Three blood draws will be
      obtained to analyze anti-tumor immune responses and immune correlates.
