          3. Participated in another clinical trial of an investigational drug (or medical device)
             within 30 days or 5-half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to Screening, or is
             currently participating in another trial of an investigational drug (or medical
             device)

          4. Clinically significant medical disease that is likely, in the Investigator's opinion,
             to significantly impact the study's efficacy and safety assessments (e.g., history
             significant cardio-pulmonary disease or arrhythmias) within 6 months of Screening.
