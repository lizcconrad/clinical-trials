      This randomized clinical trial studies how well Lactobacillus plantarum works in preventing
      acute graft versus host disease in children undergoing donor stem cell transplant.
      Lactobacillus plantarum may help prevent the development of gastrointestinal graft versus
      host disease in children, adolescents, and young adults undergoing donor stem cell
      transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine efficacy of orally-administered Lactobacillus plantarum (LBP) in preventing
      the development of gastrointestinal (GI) acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) in children
      and adolescents undergoing initial allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether orally-administered LBP decreases the incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD
      following alloHCT.

      II. To determine whether LBP administration maintains intestinal integrity as measured by
      mean plasma citrulline levels and reduction in mucosal barrier injury (MBI) bacteremia.

      III. To measure the effects of LBP on the intestinal flora phylogenetic composition during
      and after alloHCT using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene deep sequencing.

      IV. To measure effects of LBP on intestinal flora function during and after alloHCT using
      metagenomic and metabolite profiling.

      V. To measure proposed immunomodulatory effects of LBP in mean plasma levels of
      alloreactive-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, etc)
      in patients receiving LBP compared to placebo.

      VI. To determine whether LBP administration reduces hospital days within the first 100 days
      post hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      VII. To determine whether LBP administration reduces the incidence of Clostridium
      difficile-associated diarrhea in alternative donor HCT patients.

      VIII. To define the safety of orally administered LBP strains 299 and 299v in alternative
      donor HCT patients as measured by incidence of Lactobacillus plantarum bacteremia.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive Lactobacillus plantarum strains 299 and 299v orally (PO) or through
      nasogastric (NG) or gastronomy (G) tube once daily (QD) on day 1 of transplant conditioning
      regimen to 56 days post alloHCT. Patients undergo alloHCT at day 0.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO or through NG or G tube QD on day 1 of transplant
      conditioning regimen to 56 days post alloHCT. Patients undergo alloHCT at day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 120 days.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of stage I-IV GI aGvHD</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 days</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary analyses will be performed on cumulative incidence of stage I-IV GI aGvHD using unconditional multivariate logistic regression with covariate adjustment. Secondary analyses will also be performed (time to GI aGvHD onset) generating Kaplan-Meier curves and comparing treatment arms with the log rank test to accommodate censoring. Actuarial analyses will be extended for covariate adjustment using Cox proportional hazards regression.</description>

    <measure>Blood/stool measures of intestinal flora assessed using sequencing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 days</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of LBP introduction on the intestinal flora of pediatric alloHCT recipients will be examined. The association between LBP administration and bacterial genes and pathways, and bacterial metabolites will be evaluated with Pearson's correlation coefficient with possible transformation to approximate normality. In addition to confirming the significance, a 95% confidence interval will be estimated for each marker. In addition to correlation, bivariate scatterplots will be used to display the association between LBP administration and each marker.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 120 days</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive analysis examining the association between GvHD outcomes and bacterial genes, pathways, and metabolites using Cox regression will be performed. Additional regression models will adjust for other known GvHD risk factors.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of mucosal barrier blood stream infection (MBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 days</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of MBIs will be determined using actuarial methods looking at the time to first infection as the primary endpoint. Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to compare the incidence density of infection for the two groups adjusted for confounders.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of stage II-IV overall GvHD</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 days</time_frame>
    <description>Similar analysis approach will be used as described for the primary aim but using the dichotomous cumulative incidence of Grade II-IV aGvHD as the endpoint measure.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Laboratory correlative measures for allo-induced inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 days</time_frame>
    <description>The effects of LBP on pro-inflammatory cytokines in alloHCT recipients will be examined. The investigators hypothesize that LBP-associated maintenance or restoration in the microbiota will attenuate plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the early post-transplant period.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma levels of citrulline</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 120 days</time_frame>
    <description>The citrulline levels at each of the time points will be summarized and described by arm. The mean quantitative change in citrulline level from start of conditioning to each of the four later time points will be compared between the 2 arms to determine if LBP administration maintains citrulline level via two-sample t-test and repeated-measures general linear modeling which include adjustments for potential confounders. In such analyses, multiple comparison adjustments for the 4 parallel analyses (linear contrasts) will be performed with Bonferroni adjustment to maintain an overall fixed alpha</description>
