  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare three prosthesis designs to compare three prosthesis
      designs for total knee arthroplasty and determine the best option for patients in need of a
      knee replacement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a cost beneficial surgery shown to improve pain, function
      and quality of life in patients with osteoarthritis. In 2015, 6093 patients received primary
      TKA in Norway. Despite the procedure´s general success, 20% of patients report persistent
      postoperative pain and/or dissatisfaction with the surgical outcome. Efforts to further
      improve the procedure have raised considerable debate regarding the role and management of
      the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). Prostheses for TKA have evolved into designs that
      either preserve or sacrifice the PCL. In patients with a functional PCL, the decision of
      which design is selected depends largely on the favor and training of the surgeon. To further
      improve TKA patient outcomes, a better understanding of the role of these differing PCL
      treatments is needed. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine whether patients' perceived
      outcome, implant stability and clinical outcome differ between 3 TKA implant designs (2
      PCL-sacrificing and 1 PCL-retaining). We will conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled
      prospective trial with 5-year follow-up. This study will have impact on clinical practice by
      addressing the lack of evidence supporting use of these different types of implants.

    <measure>Knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 1, 2 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS is a knee-specific questionnaire developed to evaluate short- and long-term symptoms and functioning in subjects with knee injury and osteoarthritis. KOOS is validated for use in total knee arthroplasty and has been shown to be a valid, reliable and responsive measure. KOOS is a patient-administered questionnaire.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 1, 2 and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>OKS is a brief patient-completed questionnaire for patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. It reflects the patient's assessment of their knee-related health status and benefits of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operative, 6 weeks, 3, 12, 24 and 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will use three single items to measure worst pain intensity, average pain intensity, and pain interference with walking. Patients rate their pain intensity and pain interference with walking on an 11-point numeric rating scale from 0-10, where 0=no pain/no interference and 10=worst imaginable pain/complete interference.</description>
