  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III, randomized, prospective clinical study, aiming to compare the analgesic
      effects of celecoxib, parecoxib, and oxycodone in patients with inoperable hepatic carcinoma
      undergoing TACE procedure in postoperative pain control.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies reported that almost 75% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing
      transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) experienced severe pain (in a three-grade
      mild, moderate, and severe classification), and 93% of patients required opioid treatment
      during the first 12 hours after TACE.

      Opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are most commonly used analgesic
      medications in the control of postoperative surgical pain. Previous studies has indicated
      that both controlled-release oxycodone, which is an oral semisynthetic opioid µ and κ
      agonist, and parecoxib sodium, a parenteral COX-2 selective inhibitor, were effective and
      safe on peri- and post-procedural pain in HCC patients undergoing TACE.

      To the investigators's knowledge, no studies have been developed on comparing differences of
      efficacy and feasibility of analgesics with different action mechanism (opioids vs. NSAIDs)
      and administration route (oral path vs. injective path) on pain control for patients
      undergone TACE. In this phase III, randomized, prospective clinical study, the investigators
      aimed to compare the analgesic effects of celecoxib (oral NSAIDs), parecoxib (injective
      NSAIDs), and controlled-release oxycodone (oral opioids) in patients with inoperable hepatic
      carcinoma undergoing TACE procedure in postoperative pain control.
