  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective will be to check if MyoInositol (MYO) reduces the total resistance rate to
      Clomiphene Citrate (CC). For this, our study will be controlled, randomized and double
      blinded. It will include patients with PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome, defined by the
      Rotterdam criteria) who wish to become pregnant and are eligible to simple ovulation
      induction by CC. Half of them will receive MYO + folic acid (FA) in addition to the CC, while
      the other half will receive a placebo containing only FA in addition to the CC. The MYO
      supplementation will be initiated at least one month before taking CC and will be continued
      throughout this treatment until pregnancy or before switching to another type of treatment
      for ovulation induction if no pregnancy is obtained after 6 ovulatory cycles.
