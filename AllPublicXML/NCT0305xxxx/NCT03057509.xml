      This research study is designed to evaluate a type of scan called Ga-68-DOTA-TOC positron
      emission tomography (PET) scanning as a way of assessing carcinoid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study intervention.

      Many patients who are diagnosed with carcinoid tumor undergo treatment with long acting
      release (LAR) octreotide. It is presently standard for all patients to receive equal doses of
      octreotide. However, the response to the treatment with the same dose of medication may vary
      substantially from one person to another. This study uses a novel form of PET/MR imaging to
      try and better understand how to treat carcinoid tumors, and may in the future allow doctors
      to tailor treatment dosing based on PET/MR findings and select the right drug dose for an
      individual person. It is important to note that the participant method of treatment and the
      dose of the participant medication (Octreotide LAR) will not change in this study.

      The imaging technique used in this study is called Ga-68-DOTA-TOC PET/MR scanning.
      Ga-68-DOTA-TOC is a radioactive tracer that is given by vein to participants before PET
      scanning. The scanner then detects radioactivity from the tracer that is attached to cells
      within the body and uses this information to create images (pictures) on a computer screen
      that can then be analyzed.

      These types of scans are investigational. &quot;Investigational&quot;, meaning that the scans are still
      being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about them. It also means
      that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved these types of PET scans
      for this type of cancer.

    <description>Siemens PET/MR scanner at Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging will be use.
Standard Siemens software will be used to perform image analysis and measure parameters such as SUVmean, SUVmax and MTV.
Standard LAR Octreotide will be administered.
Ga-68-DOTA-TOC that will be administered prior to PET/MR imaging at 7 days after standard LAR octreotide administration and again at 28 day.
Ga-68-DOTA-TOC will be administered as a single intravenous dose at a pre-determine dosage.</description>

    <description>Ga-68-DOTA-TOC is a imaging radiotracer that is used for positron emission tomography imaging of a variety of the neuroendocrine tumors. This radiotracer in the body binds to several subtypes of the somatostatin receptor and accumulates in the tissue with high expression of these receptors. Therefore neuroendocrine tumors that express somatostatin receptors can be imaged using this radiotracer.</description>

    <description>LAR octreotide is a man-made protein that is similar to a hormone in the body called somatostatin. LAR Octreotide lowers many substances in the body such as insulin and glucagon, growth hormone, and chemicals that affect digestion. LAR octreotide is used to treat a variety of clinical conditions but most importantly to reduce flushing episodes and watery diarrhea caused by cancerous tumors such as neuroendocrine tumors.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Have histologically or cytologically confirmed small bowel carcinoid tumor

          -  Receiving a stable dose of octreotide LAR as a part of a treatment regimen for
             ≥3months

          -  Presently planned for ongoing octreotide according to current standard of care for at
             least 18 months (i.e. throughout the study follow-up period).

          -  Presently planned for restaging using contrast-enhanced CT scans at baseline and at
             least every 6 months, as a part of their standard of care assessments.

          -  The effects of Ga-68-DOTA-TOC on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason and because PET imaging agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of Ga-68-DOTA-TOC administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or
             those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than
             4 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions to IV contrasts or reactions attributed to compounds of
             similar chemical or biologic composition to Ga-68-DOTA-TOC used in study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Ga-68-DOTA-TOC have the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to administration of
             Ga-68-DOTA-TOC to mothers, breastfeeding mothers are also excluded from this study.

          -  Expected lifespan less than 18 months by investigator assessment

          -  Previous hypersensitivity reaction to LAR octreotide

          -  Non-removable non-MR compatible placements including hearing aid or dentures, metal
             IUD, surgical aneurysm clips, cardiac pacemaker, prosthetic heart valve,
             neurostimulator, implanted pumps, cochlear implants, metal rods, plates or screws,
             surgery leaving implanted materials, metal injury to eye, metallic tattoos anywhere on
             the body, tattoos near the eye and transdermal patches

          -  History of Meniere's disease
