  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High rates of recurrent cardiovascular events and readmission after percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) are important issues. Guidelines emphasize rehabilitation and secondary
      prevention. But many patients are lack of effective management after PCI.This study is aimed
      to examine the effect of mobile application (APP)-based multifaceted management on the
      improvement of long-term care after PCI.

  <detailed_description>

      This is a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of APP-based
      multifaceted management strategy on improvement of long-term care for medication
      adherence,risk factor control, and reduction of adverse events, readmission rate and
      mortality after PCI.It includes knowledge education, medication reminder,advice provision,
      support to change lifestyle behaviors. The program is interactive between care provider and
      patients. A total of 20 wards will be randomly assigned to intervention or usual
      care.Anticipated 1100 patients after PCI will be participated in the trial. All the
      participants will be followed up until 12 months.
