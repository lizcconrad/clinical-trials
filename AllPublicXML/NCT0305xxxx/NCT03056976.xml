  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of the mandibular overdenture
      retained by one and two implants and the mandibular fixed prosthesis retained by four
      implants, based on a randomized clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial alongside a cost-effectiveness analysis will include 48
      edentulous individuals who meet eligibility criteria. Participants will receive conventional
      complete denture treatment and will be randomized into three groups: single-implant
      mandibular overdenture group, mandibular overdenture retained by two implants, and fixed
      mandibular prosthodontics retained by four implants. CBCT and panoramic radiographs will be
      obtained to assess if bone sites in three-dimensional terms have a minimum volume for
      receiving implants of at least 3.75 x 9 mm. All patients will receive Titamax IT Cortical
      implants (Neodent, Curitiba, Brasil) and correspondent prosthodontic components - O'ring/ball
      abutments for overdentures. Satisfaction with the dentures and oral health-related quality of
      life impacts will be considered the measures of effectiveness for the three interventions.
      Cost assessment and cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from the healthcare
      provider perspective. Further analysis will be performed using the patient's perspective, in
      which the costs will be estimated according to the reference price of dental procedures and
      treatments of the Brazilian Dental Association (Hierarchical Brazilian Classification of
      Dental Procedures - CBHPO) and the gross costs will be obtained from a panel of experts.
      Quantification and costing of the resources will be carried out in three steps:
      identification of the relevant costs to the assessment; measurement of the resources used;
      and valuation of the resources. The costs will be calculated in Brazilian currency for each
      patient until one year after treatment. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be
      calculated to assess the incremental cost for each unit of effectiveness.
