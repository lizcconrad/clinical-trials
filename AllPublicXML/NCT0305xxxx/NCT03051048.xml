    <textblock>
      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) pose a pool clinical outcome to men and women whom
      treatment was delayed. However, reperfusion time was limited in previous studies. To evaluate
      the system delay and clinical outcomes among Chinese patients with AMI, consecutive inpatient
      case prospectively collected from 1999 to 2016. Basic data and innovative evidence will
      accelerate evidence-based clinical practice and policy making, and improve AMI patients
      outcomes finally.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMI is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in public health globally, as
      well as in China. Remarkable variations of repercussion time and clinical outcome have been
      noted, however little information is available about how shortened D2B time is incorporated
      appropriately into routine clinical practice in China. In addition, basic data and evidence
      about effectiveness of treatment for AMI during long-term recovery is limited. Practical and
      applied knowledge from large unselected population is needed to guide practice for
      improvement.

      This study will enroll patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AMI consecutively in China. At
      study entry, participants will be interviewed during their index hospitalization, to collect
      information about symptoms, functioning, quality of life, and medical care. Demographic
      characteristics, medical history, clinical features, diagnostic tests, medications,
      procedures, and in-hospital outcomes of patients will be abstracted from medical records by
      well trained professional abstractors. At 1 month, and 12 month after discharge, participants
      will return to the clinic for follow up visits. This study will examine system delay that may
      affect patients recovery after a heart attack. Effective clinic path system, and risk model
      for AMI patients will be established based on the findings, to improve patients outcomes in
      future finally.
