      Introduction: Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic phenomenon, poorly
      understood and difficult to predict, complicating intense ovarian stimulation cycle. The most
      severe symptoms, which associate vascular permeability disorders and hypercoagulability,
      occur in 0.2 to 1% of the cases and often require intensive care.

      Activation of endothelial, platelet, erythrocyte or leukocyte cells trigger the release of
      small specific vesicles, called microparticles, used as markers.

      Classically leading to endothelial dysfunction and hypercoagulability, the endothelial
      activation phenomenon could constitute the main cause of OHSS or help predict its severity,
      as established for various other diseases (cerebral stroke, infarct and lupus…). However, so
      far, this endothelial activation role has never been studied.

      Objectives:

      Evaluate the serum level of microparticles as a predictor of adverse outcomes; correlate it
      to hypercoagulability and changes of endothelial permeability associated with this syndrome.

      Methodology: Prospective Pilote Cohort study, evaluating before and throughout the ovarian
      stimulation cycle (6 samples/patient), the serum modulation of:

        -  Endothelial activation markers (endothelial-derived microparticles, E-selectin)

        -  Procoagulant markers (microparticles from platelet, erythrocyte or leukocyte origin, Von
           Willbrand factor, thrombin-antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragment 1+2)

        -  Endothelial disjunction marker (soluble CD 146) A group of 50 patients will be assessed
           Techniques: Flow cytometry for measurement of microparticles expressing non specific
           (Annexin V) and cell specific surface determinants (CD 31, CD 41, CD 45 or glycophorin
           A). Use of commercial kits for other serum markers.

        Infertile volunteers, aged 18 to 35 years, with neither cardiovascular disease nor Lupus
        erythematosus related disease, scheduled for In Vitro fertilisation, and assessed from
        their day 3 basal hormonal assessment, at least to the ovarian triggering of their IVF
        cycle were included.

          -  With Health Insurance

          -  Scheduled for their first ovarian stimulation in an IVF or ICSI program in our centre

          -  Whose blood samples will be collected in our hospital

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Suffering or having suffered from a disease likely to alter their vascular system and

               -  Tobacco addiction.

          -  Presenting a blood œstradiol rate &gt; 5000 pg/ml at ovulation triggering (criterion of
             stimulation cancellation) and more generally, every patient which ovulation has not
             been triggered.
