      To improve the function and welfare of late stage solid cancer subjects by:

        -  enabling subjects to benefit from a potentially promising drug under development

        -  assessing initial evidence of improvement in Pain VAS score

        -  assessing initial improvement in Performance Status (PS)

        -  assessing initial improvement in oxygen saturation whenever it is feasible

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females, Age &gt; 18 years

          2. Signed the informed consent

          3. Late Stage Histologically proven advanced solid tumors for which no standard curative
             therapy exist, who failed or refused anti-cancer treatment

          4. Performance Status : ECOG 0-1

          5. No brain metastasis by CT or MRI

          6. Life Expectancy : at least 2 months

          7. Hormonal therapy is allowed if needed

          8. Patient is on conservative treatment for relieving his symptoms

          9. Subjects within normal range of serum-corrected albumin calcium

         10. Acceptable haematology and biochemistry variables:

             WBC &gt; 3000/mm3 Absolute Neutrophil count &gt; 1500 /mm3 Platelet Count &gt; 100,000/mm3
             Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times ULN ALT and AST &lt; 2 times ULN PT/PTT &lt; 1.5
             ULN

         11. Subjects must be Vitamin D sufficient upon study entry, which is defined as 25(OH)D
             serum level &gt;20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) according to a document composed by the Food and
             Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, USA. If the subject is Vitamin D
             insufficient or deficient, then a loading dose of Vitamin D3 will be administered as
             follows:

               1. If the serum 25(OH)D level is 12-20 ng/mL (30-50 nmol/L) then a loading oral dose
                  of 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3 should be administered twice with 3-5 days in between
                  the doses.

               2. If the serum 25(OH)D level is â‰¤ 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L), then a loading oral dose of
                  50,000 IU of Vitamin D3 will be administered three times with 3-5 days in between
                  the doses. Serum 25(OH)D levels will be checked 1-2 weeks following the last
                  loading.

         12. Regardless of Vitamin D levels, all subjects will receive a daily maintenance dose of
             1000 IU Vitamin D3, which should be taken in the morning with breakfast.

         13. Subjects receiving Denosumab or bisphosphonates are eligible provided treatment was
             initiated at least 2 weeks prior to study enrollment.

         14. Negative Pregnancy Test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent treatment with acute anti-cancer therapy

          2. Hypercalcemia

          3. Any illness or condition deemed by the physician to contra-indicate treatment with ACC
             or may interfere with the assessment of the therapy

          4. Active History with Brain Metastases.

        3. Clinical Significant Cardiovascular Disease 4. Known alcohol or drug abuse 5. Any
        psychiatric condition that would prohibit understanding or rendering of Informed Consent 6.
        Active Participation in Clinical Trial in the last 2 weeks prior to inclusion 7. Subjects
        receiving Denosumab or bisphosphonates are not eligible provided treatment was initiated
        less than 2 weeks prior to study enrolment 8. Persistent Toxicity related to prior therapy
        greater than 2 NCI-CTCAE v 4.0 9. Pregnancy
