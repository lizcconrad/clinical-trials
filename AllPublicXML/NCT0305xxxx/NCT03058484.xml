  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators implemented and evaluated a pilot program in Shinyanga Region, Tanzania to
      bring prevention of HIV services to communities using community health workers (CHWs). The
      intervention aimed to integrate community-based maternal and child health services with HIV
      prevention, treatment, and care—bridging the gap between women and facility, and enhancing
      the potential benefits of Option B+. Option B+ is the current World Health Organization
      recommendation for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, but its success in sub-Saharan
      Africa may be threatened by overburdened clinics and staff. Consequently, paraprofessionals
      like CHWs can be key partners in the delivery and/or enhancement of health services in the
      community.

      The study focuses on whether this approach: increases retention in care; improves adherence
      to antiretrovirals (ARVs); or improves the number of women initiating antiretroviral therapy
      and the timing of initiation. Investigators hypothesize improvements along primary and
      secondary outcome indicators in the treatment group. This evaluation helps illuminate both
      the impact and feasibility of the intervention, and the role that CHWs may play in the
      elimination of mother-to-child transmission services.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention in HIV care</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>Binary variable taking the value of 1 if the women has had at least one clinic visit in the postpartum period (60-120 days after birth), and zero otherwise.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to ARVs</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth to 90 days postpartum</time_frame>
    <description>ART adherence will be measured through a binary variable taking the value of 1 when adherence is at least 95%, and the value of zero otherwise. We measure adherence using the medication possession ratio (MPR), computed as the number of days ARVs are prescribed or dispensed divided by the number of days in the interval. It has been shown to be associated with short-term virologic outcomes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timing of ART initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>ART initiation date, expressed as gestational week of pregnancy, up to 40 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Defined by gestational week at start of ART, which was computed using standard approaches (i.e., 40 weeks prior to the date of birth or, when available, the expected delivery date based on last menstrual period).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Initiation of ART</measure>
    <time_frame>Through pregnancy and up to 90 days after birth</time_frame>
    <description>Measured as the number of HIV-infected women in the sample who had any evidence of beginning ART after pregnancy, among women without evidence of treatment prior to pregnancy (women who had initiated ART before the current pregnancy were excluded).</description>
