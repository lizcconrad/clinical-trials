  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to combat the growing global health issue of sedentary behavior and
      the associated health consequences of prolonged sitting in the workplace. The population of
      desk-based workers makes up a relatively large population and are an important target for
      this health promoting initiative with a focus on improving posture, encouraging movement, and
      fostering a more active and healthy business community. It's important to recognize that
      occupational therapy practitioners can contribute to community health promotion/disease
      prevention programs by the skill-set of practitioners to understand habits and routines that
      influence the adoption and maintenance of healthy behaviors.
