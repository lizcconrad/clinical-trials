  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study of a small randomized controlled trial (RCT)design to
      evaluate participation in a Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills (CBCS) group intervention
      versus standard of care in patients with hepatitis C undergoing antiviral treatment. The
      primary objectives are to (1) examine effect size (ES) estimates of key outcomes to provide
      essential data to inform a larger efficacy trial, (2) determine whether clinically
      significant improvements occurred in any key outcomes, and (3) evaluate study feasibility and
      patient acceptability. Study findings will inform a larger efficacy study of the CBCS-HCV.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot feasibility study of a Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills (CBCS) Group
      Intervention with a representative sample of patients with Hepatitis C viral (HCV)undergoing
      standard antiviral treatment in a small RCT to examine (1) study feasibility, (2) effect size
      estimates, and (3) whether clinically significant improvements occurred in key outcomes. This
      pilot study will allow the investigators to test the hypotheses that the study procedures are
      feasible and that participation in the CBCS-HCV group is acceptable and useful to
      participants. Furthermore, effect size estimates of key outcome variables will determine
      which outcomes appear to improve as a result of the intervention and should potentially be
      evaluated in a future efficacy study. Several patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are evaluated:
      health-related quality of life (HrQOL), perceived stress, depression, anxiety, anger,
      fatigue, sleep, pain and medication adherence. The investigators will also determine if group
      participation affects viral cure rate. Change scores that have an effect size d&gt; .35 are
      considered potentially clinically significant and reasonable to evaluate in a larger efficacy
      study. Study feasibility elements evaluated included: feasibility of a RCT study design,
      intervention delivery, patient acceptability, therapist protocol fidelity, recruitment,
      enrollment, attendance, retention and data collection.

      The investigators planned to enroll and evaluate the intervention in two waves of study
      participants (Wave 2, Wave 3). When a block of 12 patients is consented for Wave 2,
      participants will be randomized to standard of care (SC; n=6) or the CBCS-HCV group
      intervention (n=6). The same procedure will be used to consent and randomize 12 patients in
      Wave 3 to SC vs CBCS-HCV. Patients randomized to CBCS will participate in 4 weekly CBCS
      sessions prior to starting HCV treatment, and 5 more sessions during HCV treatment, on the
      same day they attend follow-up treatment visits at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. Outcome data
      will be collected at baseline (T1), just prior to HCV treatment starting (T2); at week 8 of
      HCV treatment (T3), at end of CBCS intervention/ HCV treatment at week 12 (T4), and 1-month
      post-CBCS intervention/ HCV treatment (T5). The primary outcome is change in total HrQOL
      score. Secondary outcomes are change in other PROs noted above. Additional secondary outcomes
      are group differences in medication adherence and viral cure rate. Elements of study
      feasibility are also evaluated.

    <description>HRQOL is measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General Population (FACT-GP). The FACT-GP is an instrument derived from the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) measurement system to measure HRQOL during the management of chronic illness. The FACT-GP is a 21-item survey that assesses four HRQOL domains: Physical well-being; Social/Family well-being; Emotional well-being; and Functional well-being. Items are rated on a five-category response system ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores indicate higher (better) HRQOL. Change in the total HRQOL score from T1 to T2 was the primary outcome measure, with an effect size d&gt;.35 indicating a small to moderate clinical improvement</description>

    <description>Change in each of the 4 HRQOL subscale scores derived from the FACIT-GP will be evaluated. Items are rated on a five-point system ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores indicate higher (better) physical, emotional, social, and functional well-being. Change in these 4 subscale scores from T1 to T5 evaluates change from baseline to 1 month post-intervention/post-HCV treatment. An effect size change of d&gt;.35 would indicate a small to moderate clinical improvement</description>

    <measure>Change in perceived stress scale score from T1 to T2</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a widely used survey to measure stress perception. The scale includes 10 items, rated using a 5-point Likert scale, from 0 (never) to 4 (very often) where patients report the frequency of symptoms in the past month. The PSS has been shown to have good reliability and validity. Higher stress scores represent a worse outcome. T1 to T2 measures change after 4 CBCS sessions. An effect size change of d&gt;.35 indicates a small to moderate clinical improvement</description>

    <measure>Change in 8 PROMIS symptom scores from T1 to T2</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PROMIS symptom surveys measured 8 constructs: depression, anxiety, anger, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbance, sleep impairment, pain intensity, and pain interference. These surveys utilize 4-8 items each with higher scores indicating higher (worse) symptoms. The PROMIS surveys are derived from the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS). Responses are scored 1 to 5 for each item with higher scores representing worse outcomes. Raw total scores are translated into T-scores in which the raw score has been rescaled into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. T1 to T2 measures change from baseline to after 4 CBCS sessions. An effect size change of d&gt;.35 indicates a small to moderate clinical improvement</description>

    <measure>Pill count medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess medication adherence from week 2 to 12 of HCV treatment, patients brought HCV medication bottles to clinic and pills were counted at treatment weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 if a patient had a standard clinical visit. The number of pills remaining in the pill bottle were monitored to determine ideal vs actual proportion of pills taken between clinic visits. The proportion of pills taken at each visit was added then divided by the number of visits to obtain an overall proportion of medical adherence.</description>

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CBCS-HCV participants will complete a 14-item brief survey administered by a research coordinator at the end of each of the 9 sessions to rate the session on acceptability, usefulness, comprehension, and group process. Each item is rated on a five-point Likert scale from &quot;1=Not At All&quot; to &quot;4=A lot/Extremely&quot; with higher scores indicating greater patient acceptability. The survey was adapted from one developed by previous interventionists to examine intervention acceptability.</description>

Ratings are made on 14 items based on the following Likert scale: 1=Not At All; 2=A little; 3=moderately; and 4=A lot/Extremely with higher scores indicating greater competency to manage group dynamics and demonstrate awareness of the nonspecific therapeutic processes.</description>
