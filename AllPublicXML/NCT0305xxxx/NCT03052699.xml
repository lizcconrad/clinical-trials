  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This database has for objective to include the medical data of patients which underwent a
      vaginal Cesarean Section in our establishment. This collection will allow to determine the
      risk factors of the maternal morbi-mortality and to estimate the long-term results

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is about an operating technique little known which is used as an alternative of the
      abdominal Cesarean Section for very premature pregnancies and the main indication is the
      maternal rescue.

      It has several advantages: simplicity of the technique, the dissection of tissues is limited,
      low risk of bleeding and no abdominal scar.

      The purpose is to determine the risk factors of the maternal morbi-mortality and to estimate
      the long-term results
