  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of regular daily use of xylitol (or &quot;birch sugar&quot;), a
      natural sweetener that has antimicrobial properties, for the prevention of acute otitis media
      (AOM, primary outcome) as well as upper respiratory tract infections and dental caries (the
      two secondary outcomes) in preschool aged children. This trial will be conducted through the
      TARGet Kids! research network.

    <textblock>
      This is an RCT of regular daily use of xylitol (or &quot;birch sugar&quot;), a natural sweetener that
      has antimicrobial properties, for the prevention of acute otitis media (AOM, primary outcome)
      as well as upper respiratory tract infections and dental caries (the two secondary outcomes)
      in preschool aged children. Clinical equipoise over the efficacy of xylitol in preventing AOM
      - a common and costly condition in early childhood - persists even after the completion of
      three RCTs by a single research group in Finland and one in the United States. Several
      clinical trials of xylitol for the prevention of dental caries and other studies have
      demonstrated that the intervention in this trial (3-5 doses of xylitol per day) is safe, well
      tolerated and feasible for the study period. This trial will be conducted through the TARGet
      Kids! research network which is undertaking several CIHR funded RCTs and will leverage
      existing CIHR funded infrastructure and important collaborations. The nominated principal
      applicant's salary is supported by a CIHR RCT training grant to develop this RCT under the
      mentorship of a co-principal applicant who is an experienced trialist. This trial has the
      potential to transform the management of three common conditions during early childhood from
      treatment to prevention using a currently underutilized antimicrobial substance.
