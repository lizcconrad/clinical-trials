  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The nociceptif system of the newborn child is functional from 22 to 23 weeks of pregnancy.
      During the delivery the baby is exposed to multiple exterior factors and he is capable to
      memorize the pain .Recent epidemiologic studies showed that the coverage of pain was
      insuffcient and also an increase of analgesic means. Normally the pain coverage have to be
      managed and group every painful gesture. In fact all these recommandations are not followed
      by medical team.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of this type of pain as to set up an
      adequate coverage.
