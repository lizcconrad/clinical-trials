      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the powered
      vascular stapler for transection of the pulmonary artery (PA) and pulmonary vein (PV) during
      Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Lobectomy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of stage IA to stage IIB non-small
             cell lung cancer scheduled for lobectomy (Lung Cancer Staging per American Joint
             Committee on Cancer,7th Edition)7;

          2. Subjects scheduled for VATS lobectomy in accordance with their institution's SOC;

          3. Performance status 0-1 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group classification);

          4. ASA score &lt; 3;

          5. No prior history of VATS or open lung surgery (on the lung in which the procedure will
             be performed);

          6. Willing to give consent and comply with study-related evaluation and treatment
             schedule; and

          7. 18-75 years of age (inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active (subject currently receiving systemic treatment) bacterial infection or fungal
             infection;

          2. Systemic administration (intravenous or oral) of steroids, including herbal
             supplements that contain steroids (within 30 days prior to study procedure);

          3. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus;

          4. End stage renal or liver disease;

          5. History of severe cardiovascular disease;

          6. FEV1% &lt;50% or severe COPD;

          7. Prior chemotherapy or radiation for lung cancer;

          8. Scheduled concurrent surgical procedure other than diagnostic wedge resection followed
             by lobectomy (central venous access - e.g., port placement, mediastinoscopy with lymph
             node sampling, and VATS lymphadenectomy are allowed);

          9. Robotic-assisted procedure;

         10. Women who are pregnant or lactating at the time of screening;

         11. Physical or psychological condition which would impair study participation;

         12. The subject is judged unsuitable for study participation by the Investigator for any
             other reason;

         13. Participation in any other investigational drug (within 30 days or 5 half-lives of an
             investigational drug) or device study; or

         14. Unable or unwilling to attend follow-up visits and examinations.
