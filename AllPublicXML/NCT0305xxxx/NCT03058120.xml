  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective randomized, controlled trial designed to quantify the reduction in
      cost and length of stay of early discharge of emergency department patients evaluated for
      acute myocardial infarction, who are deemed to be low risk based on a modified HEART score (a
      score that incorporates troponin biomarker, ecg, patient characteristics, and physician
      clinical judgment).

      This was a prospective randomized, controlled trial conducted from February 2014 to May 2015
      designed to quantify the reduction in cost and length of stay of early discharge of emergency
      department patients evaluated for acute myocardial infarction, in those deemed to be low risk
      based on a modified HEART score. Our study enrolled only those deemed low risk, as these are
      the patients we believe best served by utilization of the HEART score decision aid.

      A total of 105 patients evaluated for AMI in the ED with a modified HEART score â‰¤ 3 (which
      includes cardiac troponin I &lt; 0.04 ng/ml at 0 and 3 hours) were randomized to immediate
      discharge (n = 53) vs management in an observation unit with stress testing (n = 52).

      The primary endpoints were 30-day total cost and length of stay. Secondary endpoints were
      all-cause death, nonfatal AMI, rehospitalization for evaluation of possible AMI, and coronary
      revascularization at 30 days.

      That such an early discharge strategy would decrease cost and length of stay is intuitively
      expected; our goal was to quantify such a reduction.
