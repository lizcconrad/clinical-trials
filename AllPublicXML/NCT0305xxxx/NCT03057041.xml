  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intranasal fentanyl has been found to be safe and effective in the reduction of pain among
      pediatric and adult populations. The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive 100
      mcg of intranasal fentanyl for pain control before first-trimester uterine aspiration will
      report lower pain scores than those who receive placebo. The investigators will test this
      hypothesis using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing pain reported
      during uterine aspiration between patients who receive either intranasal fentanyl or
      intranasal saline prior to the procedure.
