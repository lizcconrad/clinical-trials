    <textblock>
      Worldwide, glaucoma is the most common cause of irreversible blindness. The major risk factor
      is raised pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure, IOP). IOP is typically measured
      using Goldman applanation tonometry (GAT). This involves instilling anaesthetic eye drops and
      using a probe to contact the cornea and obtain a pressure measurement. A major disadvantage
      of GAT is that only limited numbers of pressure measurements can be obtained, whereas IOP is
      known to vary throughout the day and in ¾ of people is highest during the night. The result
      is that clinicians have poor understanding of patient's 24 hour IOPs and the effect that this
      might have on their glaucoma. This is a serious limitation as the treatment of glaucoma
      depends on lowering IOP.

      Recently a new device has become available, designed specifically for home IOP monitoring.
      The iCare HOME tonometer is a CE marked commercial device
      (http://www.icaretonometer.com/products/icare-home-tonometer/) that can be used to gain
      insight into 24-hour IOP fluctuations. We wish to determine the feasibility of home IOP
      monitoring using this device. The iCare HOME tonometer depends on the patient performing
      self-tonometry. Testing one's own IOP may be technically difficult and it is likely that
      large numbers of patients will struggle with this.
