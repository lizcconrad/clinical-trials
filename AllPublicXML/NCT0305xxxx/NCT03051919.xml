  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a technically simple popular bariatric operation with
      acceptable results. Leaks can occur in long staple lines; therefore, variable reinforcement
      methods are used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator compared non-reinforced stapling with three staple line reinforcement
      methods (suturing, absorbable buttressing material and fibrin glue) in laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy.

      The resected stomach specimens were treated in the same manner of reinforcement as used in
      the surgeries of the corresponding patients and then insufflated until a burst occurred. The
      burst pressures of the resected stomach specimens and postoperative events of the patients
      were recorded.
