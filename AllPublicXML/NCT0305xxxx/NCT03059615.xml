  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, Open-label, one arm study in which the eligible patients will be treated
      with IV Nerofe, three times a week in 28 days cycles (up to 12 cycles).

      Evaluation will include safety procedures, blood level of study drug in certain time points,
      immune system response and tests checking the mechanism of the drug action.

      Nerofe is a first-in-class hormone peptide with cancer suppressive properties. It works in
      three mechanisms of action. The purpose of this research is to study Nerofe's effect in
      patients diagnosed with AML and MDS.

    <description>Nerofe is a first-in-class hormone-peptide with cancer suppressive properties. Nerofe is a derivative of the human hormone-peptide Tumor-Cells Apoptosis Factor (TCApF). It contains 14 amino-acids. Binding Nerofe to the T1/ST2 receptor caused a rapid activation both of Caspase 8 and Bcl-2 mediated downstream in proliferating cancer cells.</description>

             carcinomas - can be included

         15. Use of any investigational agents within a minimum of 3 weeks or 5 half-lives of

             effective, dual contraceptive methods (i.e., a condom, with female partner using oral,
             injectable, or barrier method) while on study drug and for 3 months afterward

         19. Any severe, acute, or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration, may interfere with the informed consent process and/or with
             compliance with the requirements of the study, or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the investigator's opinion, would make the
             patient inappropriate for entry into this study
