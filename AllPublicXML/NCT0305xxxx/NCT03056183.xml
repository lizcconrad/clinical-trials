      Aim 1: To collect data on a Depression Care Transition (DCT) program's association with
      self-care behaviors as measured by medication adherence and clinic visit attendance, after
      discharge. Hypothesis 1: Compared with usual care, patients who receive the DCT intervention
      will have significantly greater medication adherence and clinic visit attendance, at 30, 90,
      and 365 days after discharge.

      Aim 2: To collect data on DCT's association with clinical/health outcomes as measured by
      depression severity, functional status, and overall physical and mental health, after
      discharge. Hypothesis 2: Compared with usual care, patients who receive the DCT intervention
      will have significantly larger improvements in depression severity, functional status, and
      overall physical &amp; mental health at 30, 90, and 365 days after discharge.

      Aim 3: To collect data on DCT's association with utilization outcomes as measured by
      readmissions, length of subsequent hospital stays, and cost of care, after discharge.
      Hypothesis 3: Compared with usual care, patients who receive the DCT intervention will have
      significantly lower hospital readmissions, shortened length of subsequent hospital stays and
      lower cost of care, at 30, 90, and 365 days of discharge.

      Leading the research team are a psychiatrist (Dr. IsHak - PI) and a hospitalist (Dr. Nuckols
      - Co-I) with an advanced and well-established track record of health services
      research/scholarship in the fields of depression, outcome measurement, and economic
      implications of improving the quality and safety of health care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will contribute to advancing the science of continuity of care delivery for
      depressed medical inpatients by collecting data on the impact of a modified evidence-based
      care transition model on clinical/health and utilization outcomes of depression in medically
      ill inpatients. The study could generate evidence to support the inpatient application of the
      USPSTF guidelines for screening adults for depression through staff-assisted depression care
      systems including follow-up and continuity of care. This study will add to the existing
      outpatient evidence for identification and treatment of depression in improving outcomes
      (Simon et al., 2001;O'Connor et al., 2013), the crucial aspect of inpatient evidence for
      depression identification, treatment, and continuity of care/care transitions in improving
      clinical/health and utilization outcomes.

    <description>Patients in the DCT intervention will have a Transitional Care Social Worker (TCSW) who will maintain daily phone contact, home visits, and will attend with the patient medical and psychiatric appointments for an average of three months following discharge. Patients in the usual care group will proceed as usual (scheduled follow-up visits). These subjects will also be asked to complete questionnaires relating to quality of life and physical and mental health status.</description>

    <time_frame>365 days</time_frame>
    <description>All patients who are admitted to CSMC are screened for depression using the PHQ instrument (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001). Patients are asked two questions about frequent occurrence of cardinal depressive symptoms - sadness and anhedonia - and provide yes/no answers to the intake nurse (PHQ-2). If patients answer, &quot;yes&quot; to either question, they are administered the complete PHQ-9 instrument. Per the CSMC depression screening protocol, if patients score &gt;12 on the PHQ-9, a social worker evaluation, and notification of the admitting physician and psychiatry, will take place. The subjects will be identified through the psychiatrist who will discuss the risks and benefits of study participation, and assess the patient's interest in the study.</description>
