  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peri-anal fistula is common seen in Crohn's disease. Treatments including surgery,
      antibiotics, immunosuppressive drug and infliximab improve the quality of life of the
      patients suffering Crohn's perianal fistula, but the recurrent rate is still high. MSC showed
      promising effect in the therapy of CD, but the standard treatment strategy is unclear. Here
      investigators will carry out this phase II clinical trial to explore a effective therapeutic
      regimen of MSC in the Crohn's perianal fistula.

    <description>CDAI means Crohn's Disease Activity Index.The purpose of this crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) calculator is to gauge the progress or lack of progress for people with crohn's disease. The reference article says &quot;generally speaking, CDAI scores below 150 indicate a better prognosis than higher scores.&quot; Clinical Response of patients 6 weeks after receiving treatment (CDAI score less than 150)</description>
