    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many kinds of cancer. It is considered &quot;immunotherapy&quot;
      and not &quot;chemotherapy&quot;. Laboratory tests show that it works by allowing the immune system to
      detect cancer and reactivate the immune response. This may help to slow down the growth of
      cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has been shown to shrink tumours in
      animals and has been studied in more than 5000 people and seems promising.

      Tremelimumab is a new type of drug for various types of cancers. It works in a similar way to
      durvalumab and may improve the effect of durvalumab. Tremelimumab may also help slow the
      growth of the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. It has been shown to shrink
      tumours in animals and has been studied in over 1200 people and seems promising.

      Combinations of durvalumab and tremelimumab have also been studied. While the combination has
      been studied in over 200 people, it is not clear if it can offer better results when it is
      combined with chemotherapy.

      Recently, immunotherapies that target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have shown promise in treating
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

             skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours
             curatively treated with no evidence of disease for ≥ 3 years. Patients with a history
             of other malignancies detected at an early stage and whom the investigator believes
             have been curatively treated and are at low risk of recurrence MAY be eligible.
             Contact CCTG to discuss eligibility prior to enrolling.

          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including
             inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. colitis or Crohn's disease), diverticulitis with the
             exception of diverticulosis, celiac disease or other serious gastrointestinal chronic
             conditions associated with diarrhea), systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis
             syndrome, or Wegener syndrome (granulomatosis with polyangiitis), rheumatoid
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc., within the past 3 years prior to the start of
             treatment. The following are exceptions to this criterion:

               -  Patients with alopecia.

               -  Patients with Grave's disease, vitiligo or psoriasis not requiring systemic
                  treatment (within the last 2 years).

               -  Patients with hypothyroidism (e.g. following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on
                  hormone replacement.

          -  History of primary immunodeficiency, history of allogenic organ transplant that
             requires therapeutic immunosuppression and the use of immunosuppressive agents within
             28 days of randomization* or a prior history of severe (grade 3 or 4) immune mediated
             toxicity from other immune therapy or grade ≥ 3 infusion reaction.

          -  Live attenuated vaccination administered within 30 days prior to randomization

          -  History of hypersensitivity to durvalumab or tremelimumab or any excipient. Patients
             who have received other treatment or other antibodies must not have had intolerable
             toxicity or required steroids to manage toxicity.

          -  Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) ≥ 470 msec
             in screening ECG measured using standard institutional method or history of familial
             long QT syndrome.

          -  Patients who have untreated and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions and/or have
             symptomatic cardiac dysfunction (unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction within the previous year or cardiac ventricular arrhythmias requiring
             medication, history of 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular conduction defects).
             Patients with a significant cardiac history, even if now controlled, should have a
             LVEF ≥ 45%. (Note: patients with uncomplicated controlled hypertension do not require
             LVEF measurement in the absence of other significant cardiac history)

          -  Concurrent treatment with other investigational drugs or anti-cancer therapy

          -  Patients with untreated brain or meningeal metastases are not eligible. Patients with
             treated CNS disease who have radiologic AND clinical evidence of stable brain
             metastases, with no evidence of cavitation or hemorrhage in the brain lesion, are
             eligible providing that they are asymptomatic and do not require corticosteroids (must
             have discontinued steroids at least 1 week prior to randomization).

          -  Pregnant or Lactating Women: Women of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy
             test (urine or serum) proven negative within 14 days prior to randomization. If urine
             test is positive, pregnancy testing may then include an ultrasound to rule-out
             pregnancy if a false-positive is suspected. For example, when beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin is high and partner is vasectomized, it may be associated with tumour
             production of hCG, as seen with some cancers. Patient will be considered eligible if
             an ultrasound is negative for pregnancy. Men and women of child-bearing potential must
             agree to use adequate contraception.

          -  Patients with serious illnesses or medical conditions which would not permit the
             patient to be managed according to the protocol (including corticosteroid
             administration), or would put the patient at risk. This includes but is not limited
             to:

               -  Contraindications to the use of pemetrexed, gemcitabine, cisplatin and/or
                  carboplatin (consult product monograph);

               -  History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder which would impair the
                  ability to obtain consent or limit compliance with study requirements;

               -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy; (including any patient known to have
                  active hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
                  tuberculosis);

               -  Active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis;

               -  Known pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis with clinically significant impairment of
                  pulmonary function.
