  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies how well helical computed tomography (CT), positron emission
      tomography (PET)/CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cone beam computed tomography
      (CBCT) work alone or in combination in predicting whether tumor cells have spread to the jaw
      bone (jaw invasion) in patients with oral cancer. Imaging, such as helical CT, PET/CT, MRI,
      and CBCT, may help find out how far cancer has spread. Accurate prediction of the presence or
      absence of jaw invasion may help create a better surgical treatment plan for patients with
      oral cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine which imaging modality or combination of imaging methods, in conjunction with
      clinical and histological examination, will most accurately predict the presence or absence
      of invasion of the mandible or maxilla by intraoral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the histopathologic findings to the radiologic findings.

    <description>Sensitivity and specificity of the clinical exam, CBCT, helical CT, PET/CT, MRI and any other imaging modality used in detection of bone invasion will be calculated, as compared to the histological examination of the specimens. The positive and negative predictive value will be calculated for each modality using the true positive and negatives as well as false positive and negative values</description>
