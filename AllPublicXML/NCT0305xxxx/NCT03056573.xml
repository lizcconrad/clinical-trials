          3. Subject has a porcelain aorta, defined as an extensive circumferential calcification
             of the ascending aorta that would complicate TAo access.

        Subclavian/Axillary Subject Cohort Specific Exclusion Criteria

          1. Subject's access vessel (subclavian/axillary) diameter will not allow for introduction
             of the 18/19 Fr delivery system.
