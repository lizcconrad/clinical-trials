        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects â‰¥18 years of age at the time of consent.

          2. Subjects do not have any medical conditions, other than rosacea, that in the opinion
             of the investigator, put the subject at unacceptable risk or could interfere with
             study assessments or integrity of the data.

          3. A clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe (Grade 3 or 4) facial rosacea
             (papulopustular (Subtype 2) or mixed erythematotelangiectatic (Subtype 1) and
             papulopustular (Subtype 2)) as determined by the Investigator's Global Assessment
             (IGA) at Visit 1/Screening.

          4. Female subjects of childbearing potential (including pre-puberty) are willing to use
             effective contraceptive method for at least 28 days before baseline (Day 0) and at
             least 28 days after the last study product administration or have a sterilized or
             same-sex partner for the duration of the study. Hormonal contraceptives must be on a
             stable dose for at least 12 weeks before baseline (Day 0). Subjects using low dose
             oral contraceptives must use a second form of birth control (e.g., barrier method such
             as condoms with spermicide).

             Note: Female subjects of non-childbearing potential are defined as follows:

               1. Female subjects who have had surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral
                  oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation);

               2. Female subjects who have had a cessation of menses for at least 12 months and a
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test confirming non-childbearing potential
                  (refer to the central laboratory reference range for menopausal women) or
                  cessation of menses for at least 24 months without FSH levels confirmed;

          5. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
             screening and baseline (Day 0).

          6. Treatment with hormonal therapy must be on a stable dose and frequency for at least 12
             weeks before baseline (Day 0) and must remain stable throughout the study.

          7. Subjects who use make-up, facial moisturizers, creams, lotions, cleansers and/or
             sunscreens must have used the same product brands/types for a minimum period of 14
             days prior to baseline (Day 0), must agree not to change brand/type or frequency of
             use throughout the study and must agree not to use make-up, facial moisturizers,
             creams, lotions, cleansers and/or sunscreens on the clinic visit days before the
             visit.

          8. Subjects must be capable of giving informed consent and the written informed consent
             must be obtained prior to any study-related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a history of skin disease, presence of skin condition or excessive facial hair
             the PI believes would interfere with the study

          2. Have moderate or severe rhinophyma, severe telangiectasia or plaque-like facial edema

          3. Have rosacea conglobata or fulminans, corticosteroid induced rosacea or facial
             erythrosis other than rosacea

          4. Have ocular rosacea of a severity that requires systemic treatment

          5. Have a history of any adverse reaction to minocycline or other tetracycline class
             antibiotic

          6. Have a clinically significant chemistry or hematology value at baseline or have an ALT
             or AST at screening that is greater than or equal to 2x normal

          7. Have conditions or factors that the PI believes may affect the response of the skin or
             the interpretation of the results

          8. Participated in any clinical study with exposure to any investigational treatment or
             product within the previous 30 days, or plan on concurrent participation in other
             studies

          9. Have used on the face an OTC topical medication for the treatment of rosacea within 4

         10. Have used prescription topical (on the face) or oral antibiotics or corticosteroids
             within 4 weeks prior to baseline.

         11. Have had a facial procedure such as chemical peel, laser, microdermabrasion within 8
             weeks prior to baseline

         12. Have received photodynamic therapy or phototherapy with blue or red light within 12
             weeks prior to baseline
