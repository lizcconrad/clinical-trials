  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Independently, both lenalidomide and vorinostat have shown promising activity in pediatric
      central nervous system tumors. These are both agents that are not typically part of
      first-line studies, although both agents are of serious interest and are currently in
      clinical trials for further investigation. This study is to evaluate the combination of
      lenalidomide and vorinostat in high grade or progressive central nervous system tumors in
      children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumors are the second most common cause of cancer in pediatrics and the leading cause
      of cancer death in children. For children with relapsed, refractory, or recurrent brain
      tumors, new agents in new combinations are needed. This study is a phase I study designed to
      provide an objective observation of toxicity and establish a maximum tolerated dose of this
      combination. In addition, this study will observe the response of children with relapsed or
      refractory central nervous system tumors. Lenalidomide will be dosed orally once daily days
      1-21 consecutive days of a 28 day cycle. Vorinostat will be dosed orally once daily days 1-7
      and 15-21 of a 28-day cycle.Doses will be escalated according to standard phase 1 dose
      escalation criteria. In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment
      may continue for 24 cycles.

             standard curative measures do not exist or are not loner effective

          -  Must have measurable disease

          -  may not have received vorinostat and lenalidomide in combination

          -  At least 3 weeks since prior chemotherapy

          -  At least 6 weeks from last nitrosurea

          -  At least 6 weeks from autologous transplant

          -  At least 3 months from bone marrow donor transplant

          -  At least 3 weeks from focal radiation

          -  At least 6 weeks from craniospinal radiation

          -  Must have not received growth factors within 1 week of study entry

          -  Must be on a stable or decreasing dose of steroids for 1 week prior

          -  Must not be receiving any chemo, biologic, or radiation therapy

          -  Must not be receiving enzyme inducing anticonvulsants or valproic acid

          -  Must not be receiving pro-thrombotic agents

          -  Karnofsky or Lansky performance status ≥50%

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 8 weeks

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function, including

          -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL

          -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL

          -  Pulse oximetry &gt;93%

          -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

          -  Creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above
             institutional normal

          -  The effects of vorinostat and lenalidomide on the developing human fetus are
             unknown.For this reason and because agents used in this trial are known to be
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must commit to complete abstinence or
             use TWO methods of birth control (one highly effective (i.e. IUD, birth control pills,
             injections, implants, tubal ligation, partner's vasectomy), and one additional method
             (i.e. male condom, diaphragm, cervical cap) for the duration of study participation
             and at least 28 days after completion. Females of childbearing potential must agree to
             ongoing pregnancy testing and counseling every 28 days about pregnancy precautions. If
             a female has not had a menstrual period in the preceding 24 consecutive months or has
             had a hysterectomy, the two methods of birth control requirement does not apply.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men
             treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use condoms for the duration of
             study participation, and 28 days after completion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has not recovered from acute toxic effects of all prior therapies

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to vorinostat or lenalidomide

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, dyspnea at rest, symptomatic congestive heart failure, history of
             thromboembolism unrelated to central line, patients with known predisposition syndrome
             for thromboembolism, patients receiving anticoagulation therapy, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, patients receiving enzyme inducing anticonvulsants,
             patients receiving valproic acid, patients receiving antiplatelet agents (aspirin,
             anti-inflammatory drugs), or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic
             effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding should
             be discontinued if the mother is being treated and not resumed until 28 days after
             completing therapy.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with these agents. In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.
