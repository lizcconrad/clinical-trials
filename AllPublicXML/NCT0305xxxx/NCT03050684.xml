  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will use dinoprostone(Propess TM) for cervix ripening and labor induction in
      term pregnant women.Vaginal pH base is achieved with the effect of hormones in pregnancy and
      associated with this, vaginal infections rates increase. With the vaginal application of
      Propess, the preparate remains in the vagina for a long time, with controlled
      release,creating a film layer against bacteria and especially fungal infections and it was
      thought that this could be a reason for unsuccessful birth induction by preventing release of
      this ovule.

      The aim of this study is to observe whether or not the rate of caesareans with the indication
      of unsuccessful induction was reduced in patients by reducing the density of vaginal bacteria
      and fungi with vaginal lavage and thereby increasing the effect of the drug and decreasing
      the rate of unsuccessful inductions.

      The study will include patients meeting the study criteria monitored in the delivery .

      Verbal and written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before starting the
      study. The patients will be randomised to 2 groups. In one group, vaginal lavage (the vagina
      will first be washed with saline in a 20cc injector) will be applied then Propess will be
      used and in the other group Propess will be used without any lavage.

      It is planned to include 70 patients in each group.
