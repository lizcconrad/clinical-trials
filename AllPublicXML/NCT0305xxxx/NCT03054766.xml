  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy of laser photocoagulation combined with ranibizumab intravitreal
      injection in macular edema (ME) secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) in long
      term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy of ranibizumab intravitreal injections-driven by achieving vision
      acuity stabilization compared to combination with laser photocoagulation in Chinese patients
      with visual impairment in ME due to BRVO.

      The result of the trial will be used to support new therapy in the BRVO in China.
