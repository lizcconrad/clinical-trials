  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise programs that combine resistance exercise with aerobic training yield optimal health
      benefits for people with HIV. The global aim of this study is to contribute evidence for the
      impact potential of a comprehensive exercise program on brain health in people with HIV.

      This study is part of a larger project based upon a cohort multiple randomized controlled
      design. Within a fully characterized cohort which is followed over time, people meeting the
      specific criteria for an exercise intervention will be identified. The sample will be
      randomly selected to receive the intervention; the remaining eligible persons will serve as
      controls. The intervention group will receive a 45 minute structured exercise program 3 times
      a week consisting of aerobic exercise and resistance training for a total of 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is an inexpensive intervention with widespread benefits to vascular and
      musculoskeletal health and few harms. Showing an additional benefit to brain health and
      cognition in particular is likely to encourage adoption and help elucidate mechanisms
      underpinning brain health in HIV.

      The primary objective of the study is to estimate, in comparison to individuals not offered
      the exercise intervention, the extent to which a comprehensive exercise program impacts on
      indicators of brain health, where these indicators are the primary outcome of cognitive
      ability (B-CAM) and the related brain health outcomes of depression, anxiety, fatigue,
      motivation, and speed of motor performance.

      A secondary objective is to estimate the extent to which changes in brain health are mediated
      through exercise induced changes in brain network function as measured by EEG and/or by
      exercise induced changes in muscle power, aerobic capacity, physical function, and body
      composition.

    <description>The primary outcome is cognitive ability as measured by B-CAM. This is part of the measurement platform for all and the value taken at the regular assessment prior to the exercise intervention will serve as the baseline value and the subsequent evaluation 9 months following will serve as the follow-up value. The strategy ensures that the intervention cohort does not have additional measurements of cognitive ability than the control cohort. The items on the B-CAM fit the Rasch Model and as such have linearized units on a logit scale.</description>

    <description>The measures of brain network function are derived from event related potential (ERPs) which are electric potentials produced by the brain in response to auditory or visual stimulation, respectively. These brain responses are easily recorded noninvasively with scalp electrodes (EEG). ERPs allow insights into the neural mechanisms underlying specific cognitive processes. The potentials of interest here include the N1, N2, P2 and P3 ERPs.</description>

    <description>Interval training will be performed for 21 minutes including a 3 minute warm-up and cool-down period. The interval program will be 15 minutes at 65-75% of maximal heart rate with 30 sec. bursts of exercise to 80-85%; intervals. Resistance training will be done as a circuit and will make use of weight machines and functional exercises. Resistance will be done in 2 sets of 15 repetitions and will last 24 minutes. The work load of the program is calibrated and is conducted at a specified rhythm. All exercise sessions will be supervised.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        The exercise intervention will target individuals recruited from two Montreal clinics who
        identified at cohort entry they were interested in being approached for different trials if
        they eligible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  men and women aged ≥ 35 years, HIV+ for at least 1 year, able to communicate
             adequately in either French or English, and able to give written informed consent.

        Also, participants must identify that they are mostly sedentary by reporting that they
        perform moderate level physical activity of 30 minutes duration less than twice a week or
        have limitations in performing vigorous activities, walking a kilometer, or climbing
        stairs. Individuals answering yes to any of the Physical Activities Readiness Questionnaire
        (PAR-Q) (Thomas et al., 1992) items except taking medication (Item 6) will require
        clearance from their physician to be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  people with dementia (MOCA &lt; 18) or treating physician's concern about capacity to
             consent, life expectancy of &lt; 3 years or other personal factors limiting the ability
             to participate in follow-up, non-HIV-related neurological disorder likely to affect
             cognition, known active CNS opportunistic infection or hepatitis C requiring
             interferon (IFN) treatment during the follow-up period, psychiatric disorder on the
             psychotic axis, current substance use disorder or severe substance use disorder within
             the past 12 months.

        Also excluded will be people with a contraindication for exercise from cardiovascular or
        musculoskeletal co-morbidity as gathered from the medical history and from the PAR-Q
        (Thomas et al., 1992).
