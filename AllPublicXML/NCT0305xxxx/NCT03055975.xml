    <textblock>
      Sampling of accessed root canals with endodontic paper points during treatment and
      immediately pre-obturation of endodontic root canals was carried out.

      Following ethical approval (REC ref: 05/Q0705/051), informed consent was obtained from
      patients undergoing root canal treatment.The teeth included in the study had been referred to
      a specialist centre for the treatment of endodontic infection. They all responded negatively
      to vitality tests and presented pre-operative apical radiolucencies. The source population
      were referred by their general dental practitioner into specialist endodontic clinics of
      Guy's Hospital, King's College London Dental Institute.Treatments on the teeth were carried
      out by a total of 19 postgraduate endodontic students.
