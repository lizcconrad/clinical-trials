      Background:

      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) damages the connections between brain cells. This can lead to
      problems like memory loss. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can help
      improve connections between brain areas in healthy people. Researchers want to see if it can
      be useful in patients with memory problems after TBI.

      Objective:

      To see how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can be used to improve the
      connections between parts of the brain and whether this will lead to changes in memory.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18-50 years old with TBI who can speak and write in English.

      Healthy volunteers the same age and English ability.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with a neurological exam and may have a urine pregnancy test.

      Participants with TBI will have 7-15 visits. Healthy volunteers will have 2-8.

      At the visits, participants will have all or some of the following:

        -  MRI for about 1 hour. They will lie in a machine that takes pictures in a magnetic
           field. They will do some memory tasks.

        -  Memory and attention tasks with pictures and with a computer

        -  Questions about their mental state and well-being

        -  TMS: A wire coil is held on the scalp and a short electrical current passes through it.
           Participants will hear a click and feel a pulling or twitch. They may be asked to make
           simple movements. rTMS is repeated magnetic pulses in short bursts. They will have this
           for about 20 minutes.

      A week after the last visit, some participants will return for a memory test.

      Objective: To use resting state functional connectivity (FC) as a biomarker of synaptic
      modulation by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in paradigms intended to
      improve memory and learning and to pilot one such paradigm for improving memory in traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) patients. Ancillary outcomes include the effects of rTMS on the explicit
      and implicit memory systems and the potential effects of manipulating one system on the
      other.

      Study population: Healthy adult volunteers and patients with TBI

      Design: The study contains 3 experiments. Experiment 1 is designed to establish the number of
      rTMS sessions required to produce a meaningful change in resting parietohippocampal FC in
      healthy subjects. Experiment 2 will apply this information to an experiment aimed at
      enhancing fronto-striatal FC and, as a secondary outcome, enhancing implicit memory. This
      intervention will be contrasted with parietal stimulation and a negative control condition
      (vertex stimulation) in a between-groups design. In Experiment 3, we will adapt a paradigm
      used by others in healthy subjects to amnestic TBI patients in an effort to enhance
      parieto-hippocampal FC and, as a secondary outcome, explicit memory. This will be compared to
      negative control (vertex) stimulation in a within-subjects design

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the change in FC produced by serially
      applied rTMS. Secondary measures will be changes in explicit and implicit memory performance.
      We will explore whether white matter integrity predicts changes in FC in healthy subjects and
      patients.
