  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the bioavailability of a single dose of a
      new 1000 mg fast release ASA (acetylsalicylic acid) tablet with that of two tablets of a
      commercially available 500 mg fast release tablet and to test for bioequivalence of the new
      versus the commercial product in healthy adult subjects.

             prescription) seven days prior to dosing or during the Treatment Periods, other than
             study product

          -  Loss of blood in excess of 500 mL within 56 days of the first dose of trial treatment
             (e.g., donation, plasmapheresis, or injury)
