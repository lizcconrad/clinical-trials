  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 2-period crossover study aimed at assessing the effect of taking a food
      supplement containing a blend of microbial accessible carbohydrates on the diversity of the
      gut microbiome. Impacts to the skin, scalp and oral microbiomes; blood inflammatory
      biomarkers; quality and quantity of sleep; gastrointestinal quality of life; bowel habits,
      and facial skin features will also be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      The human body is home to trillions of microbes, which have been shown to play important
      roles in many aspects of human biology, such as immune function and metabolism. Research in
      this area has primarily focused on the role that dietary factors have in modulating the
      gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota with associated changes in host health parameters.
      Specifically, dietary microbiota accessible carbohydrates (MACs), which include compounds
      such as resistant starches and other dietary fibers that are typically resistant to
      digestion, have been shown to serve as a primary source of energy for the distal gut
      microbiota. Metabolism of MACs by the GI microbiota is important in shaping this microbial
      ecosystem. A Western diet, typically low in MAC content (e.g., dietary fiber), is associated
      with a marked reduction in microbial diversity and depletion of specific types of potentially
      beneficial microbes.

      Until only recently, the bulk of microbiota studies have been conducted in animals, and human
      studies on the GI microbiota have focused primarily on delineating the gut bacterial
      composition and corresponding changes in taxonomy in response to a particular dietary
      intervention (e.g., with prebiotics). Additionally, investigations on dietary factors
      influencing the skin (or scalp) and oral cavity microbiomes have only recently garnered
      attention. Human intervention studies that increase consumption of dietary MACs are needed to
      better understand how changes in the composition and function of these bacteria influence
      host parameters.

          -  Subject has abnormal laboratory test results of clinical significance at Visit 1b
             (week -1), at the discretion of the Investigator. One re-test will be allowed on a

             ability to provide informed consent, comply with the study protocol, which might
             confound the interpretation of the study results, or put the subject at undue risk.
