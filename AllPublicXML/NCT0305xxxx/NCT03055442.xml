  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the importance assumed by follicular microenvironment for a proper oocyte
      development, this study is a prospective observational clinical trial which aims to evaluate
      whether the embryo blastocyst quality may be affected by different Myo-inositol (MI) and
      D-chiro-inositol (DCI) levels in the follicular fluid (FF) of the aspired oocytes. The study
      includes egg donors and egg receiving couples participating in the oocyte donation program.
      MI/DCI is calculated in FF and related with blastocyst grade.

    <description>After transvaginal aspiration of oocyte and follicular fluid and subsequent ICSI, at the day 5 the cultured embryos were graded according to Gardner's grading system for blastocysts. Then follicular fluids specimens were divided following the different scores given to the respective blastocysts, and their content in myo-inositol was quantified.
In each sample of follicular fluid myo-inositol levels were assessed. The quantitative analysis was performed by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the values were expressed as µmol/l. This value was related to the respective blastocyst grade.</description>

        The study included 8 egg donors participating in the donation program of IAKENTRO not for
        the first time, and 11 recipient couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (ICSI).

        Follicular fluid (FF) specimens were analysed.
