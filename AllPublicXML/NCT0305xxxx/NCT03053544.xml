      This study is a phase II, single arm, controlled, open label internal pilot.

  <detailed_description>

      This internal pilot will be the first prospective study to assess the feasibility and
      efficacy of adding metformin in non‐diabetic rectal patients who undergo standard of care
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT). The translational aim of the study will inform on
      predictive factors (such as p53) and mechanism of action (hypoxia, proliferation). Metformin
      has been used for decades in patients with type 2 diabetes and has an extremely safe toxicity
      profile. With current interest in the use of metformin as a cancer therapeutic in
      non‐diabetics, this study is expected to provide proof‐of principle data for a larger study.

    <description>The primary outcome is to evaluate the use of metformin to improve pathological complete response (pCR) rates in non‐diabetic participants undergoing standard of care neoadjuvant CRT for rectal cancer.
The primary outcome will be measured by the pathological complete response rate after completion of the study treatment.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Plan for care inclusive of:

             i. standard of care neoadjuvant chemoradiation ii. planned total mesorectal excision
             (TME)

          2. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum

          3. At least one of the following:

             i. T3 or T4 lesions ii. T2 lesions ≤ 1 mm to the mesorectal fascia iii. Node positive
             rectal tumor

          4. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

          5. Provide written informed consent

          6. Female participants of childbearing potential agree to use adequate methods of
             contraception from the start of metformin administration until the start of CRT.
             Contraception will not be required to be continued during or after CRT as this
             treatment renders participants infertile. Clinically acceptable methods of birth
             control for this study include intrauterine devices (IUD), birth control pills,
             hormonal implants, injectable contraceptives, and using barrier methods such as
             condoms, vaginal diaphragm with spermicide, or sponge.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of diabetes

          2. Current use of metformin

          3. Prior pelvic radiation

          4. Life expectancy &lt; 6 months.

          5. Active infection

          6. Creatinine &gt; 1.5X ULN, within 1 month prior to baseline

          7. AST, ALT &gt; 2.5X ULN, within 1 month prior to baseline

          8. Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 ULN, within 1 month prior to baseline

          9. Pregnant or breastfeeding women
