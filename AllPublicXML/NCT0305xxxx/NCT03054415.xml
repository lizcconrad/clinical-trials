    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the phenotype of the enteric nervous system (enteric neurons) in
      healthy subjects.

      The enteric nervous system (ENS) is composed by enteric neurons and enteric glial cells.
      There is a cross-talk between ENS and the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB). ENS and IEB
      together constitute the neuronal-glial-epithelial unit. This unit has a key role in gut
      functions. The characteristics and the phenotype of the ENS also change according to age and
      environmental factors. Similar study is ongoing for patients with Spina Bifida. Anorectal
      data and phenotype of the neuronal-glial-epithelial unit in healthy subjects is required to
      assess abnormality of these items in patients with neurological disease including Spina
      Bifida.

    <measure>intestinal permeability</measure>
    <time_frame>data collected at the day of endoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Biopsy samples collected at the time of colonoscopy will be use within a Ussing Chamber able to assess intestinal permeability. The Ussing chamber is used to measure the short-circuit current as an indicator of net ion transport taking place across an epithelium, such as gut mucosa. The measure will be performed on 2 biopsies from each patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>macroscopic and microscopic colonic inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>data collected at the day of endoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Colonic inflammation will be assessed during the scope procedure. The physician will assess the normality of the mucosa or not in case of mucosal erythema, ulceration or a decrease of the vascular pattern. Microscopic inflammation will be assessed by the pathologist according to neutrophils infiltration in the gut, crypt abscess, crypt distortion.</description>
