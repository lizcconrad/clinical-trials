      This is designated to validate patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures in itch-specific
      pediatric skin conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, and examine the ability of a modified
      stigma instrument to assess the severity and type of stigma experienced in atopic dermatitis
      and other potentially stigmatizing conditions.

      This study involves a series of research and development projects targeted at two of the most
      common chronic diseases affecting children: asthma and atopic dermatitis (AD, or eczema). The
      Investigators propose to directly validate patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measures in a
      large cohort of itch-specific pediatric skin conditions, with a primary focus on AD. The
      Investigators propose to examine the ability of PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
      Information Systems) instruments to detect meaningful and clinically significant change in
      disease status, as well as to create a pediatric itch item pool and PRO model for signs and
      symptoms of skin disease. The Investigators will also examine the ability of a modified
      Neuro-QOL stigma instrument to assess the severity and type of stigma experienced in AD and
      across various dermatologic or other potentially stigmatizing conditions. Lurie Children's
      Hospital will only be involved in the AD and stigma portions of this project

    <description>This study results in the validation of the ability of PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems) instruments to detect significant change in disease status, to create a pediatric itch item pool and patient-reported outcomes (PRO) model for signs and symptoms of skin disease, specifically AD, in children of ages 6 months to 17 years.
Through the research study to validate PROMIS, the physicians will derive an effective system which optimally and efficiently measures pain, depressive symptoms, anxiety, physical function-mobility, fatigue, peer relationships, psychological stress experiences, stigma, and new itch-specific measures in children ages 5-17 who suffer with moderate to severe AD.
By validating PROMIS, physicians and patients can decipher specific environmental stressors and illness flares that are clinically significant in the disease status.</description>

    <description>To assess stigma, up to 20 children ages 8-17 and 20 parents of children ages 5-12, will participate in semi-structured interviews to evaluate the modified Neuro-QoL stigma questionnaire. This questionnaire includes new skin-specific stigma items and existing items modified for use with children having a skin or other condition that may negatively affect their appearance</description>

Furthermore, this portion of the study will validate generic PROMIS measures of AD subjects' environmental stressors, illness flares, socio-demographic differences based on race/ethnicity and family income status.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Affected children must have moderate to severe AD or another skin condition that
             causes itch, experience itch, understand English, and be able to complete an
             English-based survey

          -  Any child with a potentially disfiguring skin condition or change in appearance
             related to disease/intervention will be considered eligible. Parents of children with
             such conditions will also be asked to participate. Children and parents must also
             understand English and be able to complete an English-based survey
