      Abstract

      Objectives: To explore the clinical effects of self-acupressure for treating insomnia
      delivered by a training course.

      Hypothesis: Subjects who have participated in the self-acupressure training course will have
      greater improvement in insomnia symptoms and daytime impairment than the sleep hygiene
      education control group at 4 and 8 weeks.

      Design and subjects: A pilot randomized controlled trial. Subjects with insomnia will be
      recruited from the community. 30 subjects will be randomized to self-acupressure and sleep
      hygiene education control groups in a 1: 1 ratio. Study instrument: Insomnia Severity Index
      (ISI) will be used to assess insomnia symptoms and daytime impairment.

      Interventions: Subjects in the self-acupressure group will attend two training sessions to
      learn self-acupressure and will practice self-acupressure every night for 4 weeks; subjects
      in the sleep hygiene education control group will receive two training sessions to learn
      sleep hygiene practice.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the ISI score. Other measures include
      sleep parameters using subjective sleep diary, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and
      SF-6D at 4 and 8 weeks. Acceptability and sustainability of self-acupressure will also be
      evaluated.

      Data Analysis: Differences in the questionnaire scores, subjective sleep parameters will be
      examined using a mixed-effects model.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI is a seven-item self-rating scale. The subjects rate the severity of insomnia, the distress, and the functional impairment associated with insomnia on a 5-point Likert scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The 7-day daily sleep diary</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The standardized sleep diary records the bedtime and rising time, from which the total time in bed (TIB) can be calculated. Subjects will be asked to estimate sleep-onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and total sleep time (TST). Sleep efficiency will be calculated as (TST/TIB * 100%).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a 14-item self-administrated questionnaire, which assess the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-6D (SF-6D)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-6D is composed of six multi-level dimensions: physical functioning, role participation, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, and vitality.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group will attend two weekly 120-minute self-acupressure training sessions in a classroom at the School of Nursing, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The subjects will be instructed on how to perform the self-acupressure treatment by a trained instructor. To enhance interaction and ensure the quality of teaching, each course will be conducted in a small group of 6 participants. Subjects will perform self-acupressure daily for 4 consecutive weeks.</description>

    <description>A training hand-out will be provided to each subject. The hand-outs included manualized sleep hygiene instructions. A registered nurse who has been trained by a clinical psychologist will be the instructor on sleep hygiene and activity scheduling. To enhance interaction and ensure the quality of teaching, each course will be conducted in a group of 5 participants.</description>
