  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mepolizumab is a humanized Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that acts on
      Interleukin-5 (IL-5), which is responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment,
      activation, and survival of eosinophils; thereby reducing the production and survival of
      eosinophils which may be therapeutic in subjects with atopic dermatitis (AD). This study will
      investigate the efficacy and safety of mepolizumab (100 milligram [mg] subcutaneous [SC]
      administered every 4 weeks) compared with placebo in adult subjects with moderate to severe
      atopic dermatitis (AD). Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either placebo SC or mepolizumab
      SC. The study will comprise of a pre-screening period of up to approximately 4 weeks, a
      screening period of up to 2 weeks, followed by a 16-Week study treatment period (16 weeks
      with the last dose of study treatment at Week 12) and follow-up period of up to 4-week. The
      total duration of subject participation will be approximately 26 weeks. (Note: For subjects,
      who may need to stop treatment with a biologic, the total Pre-Screening and Screening period
      may last up to 20 weeks and total duration of participation in the study may be up to 40
      weeks).

             such as skin thinning or increased risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA]
             suppression; as well as, inadequate response to optimization of non-pharmacological
             measures such as moisturizers. Inadequate response to a stable regimen of prescription
             topical medication (such as medium to high potency topical corticosteroids or topical
             calcineurin inhibitors) is defined as failure to achieve and maintain remission or low
             disease activity state (equivalent to an IGA score =0 [clear] to 2 [mild]) despite
             treatment for the recommended duration as per label or for the maximum duration
             recommended for the subject treatment, whichever is shorter.

          -  Male or female: A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as
             confirmed by a negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not

             Pre-menopausal females with documented tubal ligation, documented hysteroscopic tubal
             occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of bilateral tubal occlusion,

             simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] and estradiol levels consistent with
             menopause). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status
             is in doubt will be required to use one of the highly effective contraception methods
             if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue
             HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment.
             Reproductive potential and agrees to follow one of the options listed in the Modified
             List of Highly Effective Methods for Avoiding Pregnancy in Females of Reproductive

             weeks after the last dose of study medication.
