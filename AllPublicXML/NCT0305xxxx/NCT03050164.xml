      An Open-Label，Randomized, Single-Dose, 2-way Crossover Bioequivalence Study. During each
      session, the subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 250-mg dose
      of either the test formulation(Hunam Kelun) or the reference formulation(Iressa®
      Astrazeneca), and vice versa, with a 21-day washout period between administration periods.
