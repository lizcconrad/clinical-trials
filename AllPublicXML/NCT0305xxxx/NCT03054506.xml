    <textblock>
      Constipation is a common gastrointestinal motility disorder that is often chronic, negatively
      affects patients' daily lives. Constipation occurs when bowel movements become difficult or
      less frequent.This study is being done to study the effectiveness of the hydrogel capsule,
      CSP01, compared to the active control (carboxymethylcellulose) and placebo (non-medicine
      sugar pill), to relieve constipation among subjects with chronic idiopathic constipation
      (CIC) or with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).

    <description>Subjects in the experimental group will receive CSP01, a non-systemic, orally administered hydrogel capsule, twice a day. CSP01 capsules are taken prior to a meal with water, after which the small particles within the capsules hydrate and expand in the stomach and small intestine. By acting as a bulking agent and possibly reducing colonic transit time through increase of colonic water content, CSP01 may contribute to constipation relief.</description>
