  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the limiting data about an efficacy and safety of fractional radiofrequency for
      the treatment of hyperhidrosis, this study aim to compare clinical efficacy by Hyperhidrosis
      Disease Severity Score (HDSS) between Fractional Microneedle Radiofrequency device and
      intradermal Botulinum toxin type A injection for the treatment of primary axillary
      hyperhidrosis. The secondary objectives to determine the improvement change of iodine starch
      test, total amount of sweat production by trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), patient's
      satisfaction and their quality of life by Dermatology Life Quality Index and side effect
      between the groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of Hyperhidrosis disease severity score (HDSS) at week-12 with the baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hyperhidrosis disease severity score will be assessed by study subjects that is categorized to 4 levels; (1) my axillary sweating is never noticeable and never interferes with my daily activities (2) my axillary sweating is tolerable but sometimes interferes with my daily activities (3) my axillary sweating is barely tolerable and frequently interferes with my daily activities (4) my axillary sweating is intolerable and always interferes with my daily activities</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Iodine starch test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, week 4 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Qualitative test used to evaluate sudo-motor function (sweating) which method is to apply iodine solution to the skin. Once dry, the area is dusted with cornstarch or potato flour then sweating is encouraged. When sweat reaches the surface of the skin the starch and iodine combine causing a dramatic color change from yellow to dark blue allowing sweat production to be actively visualized.
Photograph from iodine starch test will be assessed by two independent clinical assessors who are blinded to study protocol and grading with score. The investigators will prepare the photo with pre- and post-treatment set. Each set will contain 6 photos, 3 photos from the left and 3 photos from the right. Prepare by using Microsoft PowerPoint program, on each slide will contain 2 photos, pre-treatment photos on the left and post treatment photos on the right. The paired photos will be assessed and graded the score at different time points (4 and 12 weeks) on each side of axilla</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participants' satisfaction assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>week 4 and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment will be determined at the endpoint visit (4th-12thweek) after the treatment by study subjects by Quartile rating scale on each side of axilla. Quartile rating scale by comparing with the baseline that is categorized to 4 levels; (3) greatly satisfy with treatment result (2) moderately satisfy with treatment result (1) slightly satisfy with treatment result (0) No different with treatment result.</description>

    <description>each patient will be treated with FMR DeAgeÂ®, applicator device at 4-week intervals for 2 sessions of treatment. This applicator consists of rows of 36 (6x6 needles) insulated microneedles that form an array of positively and negatively charged electrodes. The microneedles will deliver bipolar radiofrequency energy in a fractional manner that extends from 3.0 mm below the surface of the skin. All subjects will be prepared by local anesthesia to induce numbness at the axilla prior to treatment. The targeted axillary side will be treated with a total of 4 passes.</description>
