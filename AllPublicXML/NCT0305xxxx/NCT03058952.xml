  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial measuring outcomes up to 6-months
      post-intervention. The objective of this study is to evaluate outcomes of two different group
      interventions for Veterans with Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI). The interventions to be
      compared are Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and an adapted version of the Chronic Disease
      Self-Management Program (aCDSMP) for Veterans experiencing symptoms of Chronic Multi-Symptom
      Illness (CMI) - musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and cognitive failures - especially those who
      were deployed to Gulf War I. Hypothesis One (re: Outcomes): Participants randomized to the
      adapted Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (aCDSMP) will derive benefit for the primary
      outcomes, but with smaller effects than the participants randomized to Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR). The investigators hypothesize that Veterans randomized to MBSR will
      report greater reductions in each of the three primary outcome measures (pain, fatigue, and
      cognitive failures) at 6-month follow-up as compared to aCDSMP. Hypothesis Two (re:
      Acceptability): MBSR will be an acceptable and satisfactory program for Veterans with CMI, as
      measured by attendance rates, a self-report measure of satisfaction, and qualitative
      interviews. The investigators hypothesize that Veterans with CMI randomized to MBSR will
      report greater satisfaction with care than their peers randomized to aCDSMP.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll 308 participants. Half of these will be Gulf War Veterans who
      meet criteria for CMI, and the other half will be Veterans from other periods of service who
      also meet criteria for CMI. Each participant will be randomized to either participate in MBSR
      or aCDSMP (stratified by Gulf War deployment status so there are ~7-8 Gulf War Veterans in
      each group for every cohort). Measures to collect primary outcome data (pain, fatigue,
      cognitive failures, patient satisfaction), secondary outcomes, and potential mediators will
      be administered at four assessments: (1) Baseline; (2) Post-Intervention; (3) at 3-months
      after the group ended; and (4) at 6-months after the group ended. Sample demographic data
      (age, gender, race, income, education, etc.) will be collected at baseline only. All study
      procedures will take place at VA Puget Sound Health Care System in Seattle, WA.

CDSMP teaches self-management strategies and attempts to modify illness beliefs, enhance self-management capabilities and reinforce successful management strategies. CDSMP is based on self-efficacy theory, which posits that key determinants of behavior are: 1). self-efficacy (confidence in the ability to carry out an action) and 2). outcome expectancy (expectation that a particular goal will be achieved).</description>
