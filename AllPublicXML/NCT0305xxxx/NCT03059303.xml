  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability of single-dose Simeprevir
      (SMV), Odalasvir (ODV), and AL-335 when administered as a fixed-dose combination (FDC)
      compared with the single agents when administered together, and to assess the effect of
      multiple-dose lansoprazole and omeprazole on the single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of SMV,
      ODV, and AL-335 when administered as an FDC.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI: weight in kg divided by the square of
             height in meters) of 18.0 to 32.0 kilogram per meter (kg/m^2), extremes included, and
             a body weight not less than 50.0 kg

          -  Participant must have a blood pressure (supine after at least 5 minutes rest) between
             90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher than 90
             mmHg diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated assessments are
             permitted. Participants with a normal value at retest may be included

          -  Participant must have a normal 12-lead Electrocardiogram [ECG] (based on the mean
             value of triplicate ECG parameters) consistent with normal cardiac conduction and
             function at screening, including:a) normal sinus rhythm (heart rate (HR) between 60
             and 90 beats per minute [bpm], extremes included); b) QT interval corrected for heart
             rate according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) less than or equal to &lt;=450 milliseconds
             (ms) for male participants and &lt;=470 ms for female participants; c) QRS interval &lt;=110
             ms; d) PR interval &lt;=200 ms; e) Electrocardiogram (ECG) morphology consistent with
             healthy cardiac conduction and function. Any evidence of heart block is exclusionary.
             Any evidence of left or right bundle branch block is exclusionary

          -  Female participant must have a negative highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test
             at Day -1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant with a past history of: a) Heart arrhythmias (example, extrasystolic
             rhythms or tachycardia at rest). Isolated extrasystolic beats are not exclusionary; b)
             Risk factors associated with Torsade de Pointes such as hypokalemia; c) Family history
             of short/long QT syndrome; d) Sudden unexplained death (including sudden infant death
             syndrome) in a first degree relative (that is, sibling, offspring, or biological
             parent)

          -  Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to odalasvir (ODV),
             AL-335, simeprevir (SMV), lansoprazole, or omeprazole, or their excipients

          -  Participant has a history of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C
             antibody (anti-HCV) positive, or other clinically active liver disease, or tests
             positive for HBsAg or anti-HCV at screening

          -  Participant has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) or -2 infection
             positive, or tests positive for HIV-1 or -2 at screening

          -  Participant has previously been dosed with SMV, ODV, or AL-335 in more than 3
             single-dose studies or in a multiple dose study with SMV, ODV, or AL-335
