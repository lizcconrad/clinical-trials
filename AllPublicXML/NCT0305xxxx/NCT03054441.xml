  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In hemiplegia quantitatively measurement of the asymmetry in the use of upper limbs could
      overcome the limitation of many outcome measures in which scores are dependent on the
      experience and training of the therapist. The main aim of this study was to determine the
      validity of Actigraph GXT3+ to measure asymmetry in the use of the two upper limbs during the
      Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) in children, adolescents and young with hemiplegia aged 5-19
      years, compared to age-matched typically developing subjects (TD).

      This study aims to validate the use of Actigraphs as an evaluation tool of the upper limb
      asymmetry in children / adolescents and young adults with typical development or hemiplegia.

      The validation involves two stages:

      The first stage, carried out in the clinical setting, provides the use of Actigraphs
      (Actigraph GXT3+ and in a subgroup also FitBit) during the administration of clinical tests
      which are usually performed for the evaluation of the manual dominance in individuals with
      hemiplegia but also suitable for those with typical development.

      This first phase will allow to compare the quantitative measures acquired by the actigraphs
      (e.g. the mean activity of each hand and the asymmetry index i.e. difference between the mean
      activities of the two arms) with those from clinical standardized measures.

      The second phase, carried out in a non-clinical setting, provides the use of Actigraphs
      (Actigraph GXT3+ and in a subgroup also FitBit) in a subgroup of subject involved in the
      first phase for a week in order to measure the asymmetry index during the activities of daily
      living.

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The asymmetry index (AI) is the difference between the mean activities of the dominant with those of the non dominant hand and it will be correlated with the scores of AHA. The AHA measures Upper Limb function during bimanual activities. The test evaluates spontaneous use of assisting hand during a semi-structured 10-15 minutes session with specific toys (Kids-AHA) or tasks (Ad-AHA) requiring bimanual handling.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The mean activity of each hand will be correlated with the BBT that measures unilateral gross manual dexterity. It is a quick (2-5 minutes), simple and inexpensive test. It can be used with a wide range of populations from childhood to adulthood.</description>

    <measure>Correlation among Mean activity and asymmetry index during standardized clinical activities.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The mean activity of each hand and the asymmetry index will be analyzed during some other activities such as Writing, Upper Limb Physician's Rating Scale, Six Minutes Walking Test, Rest Supine Position</description>
