  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part study to evaluate the efficacy of early combined PDL (pulsed dye laser)
      and fractional photothermolysis in the cosmetic improvement of post surgical scars.All
      subjects will be offered at the time of the dermatologic procedure, an option to treat the
      post surgical scars with early combined PDL and fractional photothermolysis.

      Part A is a non-randomized study design and subjects will have the choice of whether or not
      they will receive treatment. In part B, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 treatment vs.
      control design.

      The experimental group will have a total of 6 visits: 1 standard of care suture removal
      visit, 3 treatment visits and 2 follow up visits. The control group will have 3 visits: 1
      standard of care suture removal visit and 2 follow up visits.

      Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be considered for enrollment.

      This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this procedure.
