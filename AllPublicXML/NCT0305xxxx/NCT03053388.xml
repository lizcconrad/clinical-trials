    <textblock>
      Double blind, randomized multi-center, evaluation of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      Nitric Oxide (NO) given intermittently via inhalation to subjects with acute bronchiolitis.

      Bronchiolitis is defined as an infection of the small airways. It is also the most common
      manifestation of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in early infancy, and is the
      leading cause of global child mortality.

      Nitric Oxide (NO) has been shown to play a critical role in various biological functions,
      including in the vasodilatation of smooth muscle, neurotransmission, regulation of wound
      healing and during immune responses to infection with a microbicidal action directed toward
      various organisms. In the airways, NO is considered to play a key role in the innate immune
      system in which the first-line of host defense against microbes is built.

      The beneficial effect of NO has been shown in different diseases with several options of
      doses and regimens; newborn with primary pulmonary hypertension showed improvement in
      oxygenation after 30 minutes of NO treatment at 10-20 ppm, while subjects with adult
      respiratory distress syndrome demonstrated clinical improvement during NO treatment at 18 and
      36 ppm.

      In vitro studies suggested that NO, in part per million (ppm) concentrations, possesses
      antimicrobial and anti-viral activity against a wide variety of phyla including bacteria,
      viruses, helminthes and parasites.

      Safety and tolerability of 160 ppm NO given intermittently via inhalation were shown in a
      phase II study performed on 2-12 month infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. According to
      data no difference in the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events were
      detected between subjects treated with NO and subjects treated with standard supportive
      treatment.

      In this study the investigators wish to assess the efficacy of 160 ppm NO given
      intermittently via inhalation to 0-12 months-old infants hospitalized due to acute
      bronchiolitis.

      Primary objective: Asses the difference in hospital Length of Stay (LOS) between subjects
      treated with 160 ppm NO combined with standard supportive treatment and subjects treated with
      standard supportive treatment.

      Secondary objectives: Asses the difference in the time required to achieve clinical
      improvement, a clinical score ≤5 (Modified Tal score) between subjects treated with 160 ppm
      NO combined with standard supportive treatment and subjects treated with standard supportive
      treatment. Assess the difference in the time required to achieve sustained 92% oxygen
      saturation in room air between subjects treated with 160 ppm NO combined with standard
      supportive treatment and subjects treated with standard supportive treatment. Characterize
      the safety and tolerability of 160 ppm NO intermittent inhalation treatment as measure by the
      rate of adverse events.

      In this prospective double-blind, randomized multi-Center study the investigators will enroll
      up to 120 (no less than 80) subjects aged 0-12 months-old, diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis
      and requiring in-patient hospitalization.

      Enrolled subjects will be randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 -Treatment group - Will receive
      160 ppm NO given intermittent via inhalation in addition to standard treatment for up to 5
      days. Group 2 - will receive ongoing inhalation of the standard treatment for up to 5 days.
      Between study and after completing all study inhalations the subject will continue to receive
      the standard treatment. Oxygen (O2), NO, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fraction of inspired
      oxygen (FiO2) delivered to the patient will be continuously monitored.

      Treatment administration: Treatment blindness will be kept by separating between un-blinded
      team members (giving the actual treatment) and blinded team members, and by hiding the NO
      container and all study related equipment behind a curtain.

      All subjects will return for follow-up visits on day 14(+5), 21(+5) days and will be
      contacted on day 30 (+5) from day of admission to the department.
