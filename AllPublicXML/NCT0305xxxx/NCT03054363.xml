    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter run-in phase Ib / roll-over phase II study of triple targeted drug
      combination (HER2-targeted small molecule inhibitor tucatinib, CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib
      and aromatase inhibitor letrozole) as a first or second line of therapy in patients with
      metastatic hormone receptor positive and HER2-positive breast cancer.

      This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label, run-in phase Ib / roll-over phase II study of
      novel HER2-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor tucatinib in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitor
      palbociclib and aromatase inhibitor letrozole in subjects with HR+/HER2+ locally advanced
      unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. The study will enroll post-menopausal women and
      premenopausal women if on treatment with or willing to be treated with standard ovarian
      suppression. The phase Ib part of the study will determine safety and tolerability of the
      combination of tucatinib, palbociclib and letrozole to confirm that current RP2D of tucatinib
      and FDA approved dosing of palbociclib remains the same in the triplet combination. The dose
      of letrozole will be constant through the study period. Once the safety of the combination is
      established, we will move to the phase II part of the study in the expansion cohort of
      subjects at RP2D for the purpose of assessing efficacy while further refining assessment of
      safety of the combination treatment.

For subjects with brain metastatic disease enrolled in the study, assessment of bi-compartmental PFS in the non-CNS and CNS compartments, defined as the time from allocation to the first documented disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 and/or RANO-BM criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first</description>

    <description>During phase 1b part of this trial (N=20 patients), treatment will be administered in cycles of 28 days and consist of tucatinib 300 mg PO BID, palbociclib 125 mg PO daily for 21 days followed by 7 days off, and letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily. Dose modifications of tucatinib, palbociclib and letrozole will be allowed per protocol. There will be an interim safety analysis performed after enrollment of 10 patients. Safety analysis will take into account proportion of patients requiring dose modifications or interruption for therapy because of toxicity. If excessive toxicity or significant changes in PKs are found, further patients will be enrolled at a lower starting dose level. There will be a second interim safety analysis after enrollment of 20 patients in the study. Once the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) has been determined, testing of this drug combination will be expanded in the phase II part of this trial (N=20 patients) to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) rate.</description>
