  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving genetically changed immune
      cells, called CAR-NK cells, after chemotherapy will improve the disease in stem cell
      transplant patients with relapsed (has returned) and/or refractory (has not responded to
      treatment) B-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Also, researchers want to find the highest tolerable
      dose of CAR-NK cells to give to patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma or
      leukemia. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. The making of and infusion of genetically changed NK cells
      and the drug AP1903 (if you receive it, explained below) are not FDA approved or commercially
      available for use in this type of disease. They are currently being used for research
      purposes only. The chemotherapy drugs in this study (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and
      mesna) are commercially available and FDA approved.

      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Gene Transfer:

      The process of changing the DNA (the genetic material in cells) of NK cells is called &quot;gene
      transfer.&quot; NK cells will be separated out from frozen cord blood using a machine. Researchers
      then perform a gene transfer to change the NK cells' DNA, and then inject the genetically
      changed NK cells into the body of the patient receiving the transplant.

      NK Cell Dose Levels:

      If participant chooses to participate in this study, participant will be assigned to a dose
      level of CAR-NK cells based on when participant joined this study. Up to 3 dose levels of
      CAR-NK cells will be tested. Up to 12 participants will be enrolled at each dose level until
      the highest tolerable dose level is found. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the
      group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the
      highest tolerable dose of CAR-NK cells is found. When the highest tolerable dose is found,
      more participants may be enrolled at that dose level.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Participant may be taking part in this study for up to 1 year.

      Tests Before Study Drug Administration:

      Before participant receives study drugs:

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for research tests. This blood will be used as
           a baseline to study the immune system before starting treatment.

        -  If participant's doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow
           aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease and for research tests. To
           collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy, an area of the hip is numbed with anesthetic,
           and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large needle.

      Within 7 days before participant receives study drugs:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If participant can become
           pregnant, part of the blood will be used for a pregnancy test.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Participant will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide to help prepare participant's body
      for CAR-NK infusion. These drugs may kill some cancer cells, but that is not the main goal
      for their use. The day participant receives the CAR-NK cells is called Day 0. The days before
      participant receives participant's CAR-NK cells are called minus days. The days after
      participant receives the CAR-NK cells are called plus days.

      On Day -6, participant will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate
      participant.

      On Days -5, -4, and -3, participant will receive fludarabine by vein over 1 hour and
      cyclophosphamide by vein over 3 hours. Participant will also receive mesna by vein over
      before and after the cyclophosphamide dose to lower the risk of side effects to the bladder
      caused by cyclophosphamide.

      On Days -2 and -1, participant will rest.

      On Day 0, participant will receive the CAR-NK cells as a cell infusion by vein.

      If participant has graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or cytokine release syndrome after the
      CAR-NK cell infusion, participant will receive AP1903 by vein and possibly steroids by mouth
      or by vein.

      GvHD occurs when donor cells attack the cells of the person receiving them. Cytokine release
      syndrome (CRS) occurs when a large amount of proteins are released into the blood. The risks
      of GvHD and CRS, some of which are serious, are described in greater detail below.

      Study Tests After the NK Infusion:

      On Day 0, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for research tests.

      On Day +7, participant will have a physical exam.

      On Day +2 and then at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, and 16:

      °Blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, for chimerism tests (to see how
      well the transplant has taken), and for research tests.

      During Weeks 1, 4, and 16:

      °If participant's doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have a bone marrow aspiration
      and biopsy to check the status of the disease and for research tests.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      For safety reasons, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that patients who
      receive infusions of cellular products that have been treated with a gene transfer procedure
      must have long-term follow-up for at least 15 years after receiving the gene transfer.
