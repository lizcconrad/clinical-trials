  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of MDMA on encoding and retrieval of
      emotional and social memories in healthy young adults. The study will explore the effects on
      memory retrieval when the drug is administered 1) before encoding, and 2) before retrieval.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Here, we aim to investigate the effects of MDMA (1 mg/kg) on the encoding and retrieval of
      positive, negative, social, and neutral memories. The study will use a between subjects
      design with three groups (N = 20 per group). Two of the groups will be randomly assigned to
      receive MDMA before one of the two stages of memory: Encoding (ENC) or Retrieval (RET). The
      third group will receive placebo only (PLC). All three groups will receive capsules before
      viewing the study materials, and at retrieval two days later, but they will receive MDMA only
      in the capsule appropriate to their condition, and other capsules will contain placebo.

      Participants will participate in two sessions: a viewing session during which they will view
      emotional and neutral stimuli, followed 48 hours later by a retrieval session, during which
      there will be a surprise memory test with two components (verbally cued recollection and
      picture recognition). On all sessions subjects will also complete mood questionnaires.

    <description>The study tasks will include the International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al, 1999). The IAPS consists of standardized positive, neutral, and negative pictures, and each image is associated with a brief label. During the viewing phase, participants will view 120 unique IAPS pictures with labels (40 negative/unpleasant, 40 neutral, and 40 positive/pleasant, based on normative ratings with emotional items matched for arousal). Intermixed with these items, they also will view 120 labels without pictures (40 negative, 40 neutral, 40 positive; the same stimuli will be coded for their social context in separate analyses).
Participants will rate the perceived arousal and valence of each picture on two 7-point scales: 1) Affective valence -3 to +3 and 2) physiological reaction (0-6).Two days later, they will be given two surprise memory tests.</description>
