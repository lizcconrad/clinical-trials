  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Real-world adherence to inhaled and oral therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients remains
      discouragingly low, ranging between 31-53% for inhaled antibiotics and 41-72% for hypertonic
      saline. Programs to enhance adherence, including comprehensive behavioral interventions with
      adolescents, have met with mixed success. Advances in therapy, treatment delivery systems,
      and data capture technology offer the potential for enhancing adherence by providing
      immediate and more frequent feedback to the patient regarding his or her fidelity to the
      prescribed treatment regimen. The investigators propose to evaluate a systematic yet
      technically simple approach to linking treatment and feedback components to enhance adherence
      in a real-work CF clinic setting that treats a significant minority patient population.

      This is the first trial assessing the impact of a collaborative active intervention program
      of a multi disciplinary team in improving adherence to specific chronic medications and
      improving clinical outcomes in CF patients. The PI has implemented the texting service
      (Caremessage.org) with COPD and diabetes patients. The content will be modified to provide
      both English and Spanish language content relevant to these participants and their standard
      treatment protocols.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive mobile health information
      service in supporting clinic staff (i.e., nurse practitioners, case managers and care
      coordinators) at a Cystic Fibrosis Center clinic to connect with patients and create
      conversations around behavior-centered goals. The interactive mobile health information
      service has been designed to supplement the standard of care by supporting
      patient-empowerment strategies through:

        -  educating participants,

        -  encouraging behavior change, and

        -  promoting adherence with their treatment protocols.

      The project will adapt the iCAN program content as an educational tool to be incorporated in
      the educational material. iCAN is an electronic platform aimed to provide an engaging
      environment for diabetic outpatients to self-manage, gain control over their health, and
      ultimately adhere to their medical appointments and regimen. Similar to diabetes, CF is an
      all-encompassing chronic disease that requires coordinated efforts among patients,
      caregivers, and health-care providers across treatment adherence, nutrition, lifestyle
      choices, and social support systems. Central to the mobile health information service is the
      interactive and personalized text-based message system that delivers actionable and tailored
      health content to participants: office visit appointment reminders; medication adherence
      reminders; and general health education messages. While a number of technically sophisticated
      applications exist, our approach will involve a less sophisticated and complex approach. Our
      primary objective is to get the information to the patients, some of whom are members of
      lower income minority communities. If &quot;simple&quot; interventions prove effective, then the
      groundwork will have been laid for considering more tailored albeit complex systems.

Processes involving program management and impact on barriers to treatment delivery by clinic staff, treating physicians and parents will also be evaluated.</description>
