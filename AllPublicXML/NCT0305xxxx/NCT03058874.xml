  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most common co-morbidity accompanying Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is hypertension, which
      appears in approximately 80% of all patients with renal dysfunction, whereas its prevalence
      in general population is remarkably lower appearing in approximately 30% of adults.Defining
      hypertension in ESRD patients under maintenance dialysis is a challenging procedure.
      Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the
      diagnosis of hypertension in hemodialysis patients over the last years. The major
      pathophysiologic mechanism underlying hypertension development in patients with ESRD under
      hemodialysis is water and sodium overload.

      Identifying an accurate and objective method of dry weight evaluation has been a matter of
      intensive nephrology research for more than two decades. Assessment of the water balance in
      hemodialysis patients on the basis of common clinical criteria (e.g. leg or face swelling or
      signs of lung congestion) is a subjective method with limited reliability, despite its
      widespread use. Recently, a novel technique has been developed to quantify water excess by
      conducting an ultrasound lung scan. Pilot studies have shown significant changes in lung
      water in hemodialysis patients according to body weight changes during interdialytic days and
      dialysis sessions. Moreover, results from previous studies indicate significant benefits from
      dry weight probing with regards to blood pressure (BP).

      The clinical application of a lung-ultrasound-based volume control strategy in hemodialysis
      patients is currently being tested by the randomized study entitled &quot;Lung water by ultrasound
      guided treatment to prevent death and cardiovascular complications in high risk end stage
      renal disease patients with cardiomyopathy (The LUST Study)&quot;. This clinical trial aims at
      evaluating whether the use of the number of US-B lines could be used as a biomarker to guide
      a per-protocol intensification of ultrafiltration (UF) in order to reduce volume overload,
      improve cardiac function and prolong survival.

      Cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD is attributed to a spectrum of structural and
      functional alterations of the large and the small branches of the arterial tree. The most
      important process in patients with advanced CKD is that of arteriosclerosis, which is
      developed in parallel to atherosclerosis and is typically associated with impaired cushioning
      function of the aorta and the large conduit arteries. Accelerated arterial stiffening is
      involved in the development of isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy
      (LVH) and congestive heart failure (CHF), which predispose to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac
      death. In the context of the phenomenon of &quot;aortic-to-brachial BP amplification&quot;, systolic BP
      (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) conventionally measured at the level of brachial artery are
      higher than the relevant pressures in the ascending aorta. Due to extreme elevation of
      arterial stiffness, BP amplification is disturbed in patients with ESRD. Prospective cohort
      studies have demonstrated that elevated central PP, wave reflections and arterial stiffness,
      as well as, reduced PP amplification represent strong and independent predictors of all-cause
      and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. On this basis, estimation of central
      BP indices appears as an important tool towards optimisation of cardiovascular risk
      stratification in ESRD as well as in other diseased populations.

      Until recently, available devices for ABPM evaluated BP levels only at the level of brachial
      artery. The newly developed Mobil-O-Graph NG (IEM, Stolberg, Germany) provides the ability to
      monitor central aortic pressure and indices of vascular resistance, such as wave reflections
      (augmentation index, AIx) and arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, PWV).This device has
      recently been validated in hemodialysis patients and showed comparable performance with the
      widely used tonometric SphygmoCor device (ArtCor, Sydney, Australia). Accumulated evidence
      over central BP and PWV in hemodialysis patients derives mostly from studies that included
      only static pre-dialysis and post-dialysis measurements. However, variations of BP levels
      during intra- and interdialytic intervals combined with the superiority of aortic BP
      measurements, as analysed above, indicate that ambulatory monitoring of central BP is the
      best available method.

      This study aims for the first time to evaluate the outcome of a treatment strategy for dry
      weight probing, based on volume overload quantification with lung ultrasound, on 24-hour
      aortic systolic BP and arterial stiffness in hemodialysis hypertensive patients.

      This is a Lust Sub-Study. Additional information can be found at: NCT02310061.

      Patient selection and study preparations

      Potentially eligible hemodialysis patients, not fitting the exclusion criteria, will provide
      written informed consent and will be evaluated for the diagnosis of hypertension. If patients
      are treated with antihypertensive therapy, a brief-wash out from medications period will take
      place and home BP will be monitored up to a maximum of 4 weeks. During this period BP
      â‰¥160/110 mmHg will be a threshold for further medication withdrawal.

      Hypertension diagnosis will be based on mean BP values &gt;140/90 mmHg with home BP monitoring
      the days after the mid and last dialysis of the week for 2 consecutive weeks using a
      validated self-inflating automatic oscillometric device (cuff with bladder size encircling at
      least 80% of arm circumference and covering two thirds of arm length). Every patient will be
      asked to conduct both morning and evening BP measurements at the level of brachial artery
      after 5 min of rest and with two measurements per occasion taken 2 min apart according to the
      European Society of Hypertension 2013 guidelines. The mean of the last measurements would be
      used.

      Study period

      A total number of 50 eligible patients undergoing hemodialysis in the Hemodialysis Unit of
      the Department of Nephrology, Hippokration Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,
      Greece and in affiliated Hemodialysis Units in Northern Greece will participate in the study.
      In all potentially eligible patients full medical history, as well as demographic
      characteristics and drug treatment will be recorded, followed by a detailed physical
      examination. Patients that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be randomized with
      a ratio of 1:1 into two equal groups consisting of 25 patients. In the intervention group a
      specific treatment strategy for dry-weight reduction will be applied guided by lung
      ultrasound, whereas in the control group standard-of-care treatment will be applied guided by
      conventional clinical criteria. Blood samples for hematological and biochemical laboratory
      tests will be collected at baseline prior to a mid-week dialysis session; these tests will
      correspond to the routine monthly laboratory tests of the patients.

      In the intervention group UF regimen and dry-weight will be guided by the number of
      pre-dialysis US-B lines measured by lung ultrasound prior to a mid-week dialysis session
      (Figure 1). In patients who will be included in both the main study (LUST) and the present
      sub-study (i.e. additional inclusion criteria of LUST study: history of myocardial infarction
      with or without ST elevation or unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome documented by ECG
      recordings and cardiac troponins or stable angina pectoris with documented coronary artery
      disease by prior coronary angiography or ECG or dyspnea class III-IV NYHA), a total number of
      â‰¥15 US-B lines indicates moderate to severe lung congestion; UF will be intensified in these
      patients. They will undergo dry-weight reduction less than 0.2 kg/session (0.6 kg/week) with
      a maximum UF rate â‰¤10 ml/kg/h, so that episodes of hemodynamic instability and hypotension
      are minimized. If needed longer and/or additional dialysis sessions will be applied to a
      maximum of 5 hours/session or 4 sessions/week. US-B lines measurements will be repeated at
      least once a week (before and after a mid-week dialysis session) until the treatment goal is
      achieved (&lt;15 US-B lines) over a period of 8 weeks. Thereafter, lung ultrasound will be
      conducted once a month. In patients without pulmonary congestion at pre-dialysis baseline
      (&lt;15 US-B lines), no UF intensification will be applied and US-B lines will be measured on a
      weekly basis. Patients in the intervention group with &lt;15 US-B lines at baseline who will
      develop clinical signs of pulmonary congestion and/or â‰¥15 US-B lines at any time will be
      treated according to those with lung congestion at baseline. In patients who will be included
      only in the present sub-study, and are expected to have hypertension with better cardiac
      function and, possibly, less degree of lung congestion compared to the typical subjects of
      the main LUST study, UF will be intensified on the basis of a total number of â‰¥5 US-B lines
      which indicates mild to moderate lung congestion. These patients will also undergo careful
      dry-weight reduction less than 0.2 kg/session (0.6 kg/week) with a maximum UF rate â‰¤10
      ml/kg/h, so that episodes of hemodynamic instability and hypotension are minimized. If needed
      longer and/or additional dialysis sessions will be applied to a maximum of 5 hours/session or
      4 sessions/week. US-B lines measurements will be repeated at least once a week (before and
      after a mid-week dialysis session) until the treatment goal is achieved (&lt;5 US-B lines) over
      a period of 8 weeks. Thereafter, lung ultrasound will be conducted once a month. In patients
      without pulmonary congestion at pre-dialysis baseline (&lt;5 US-B lines), no UF intensification
      will be applied and US-B lines will be measured on a weekly basis. Patients in the
      intervention group with &lt;5 US-B lines at baseline who will develop clinical signs of
      pulmonary congestion and/or â‰¥5 US-B lines at any time will be treated according to those with
      lung congestion at baseline.

      Reduction of post-dialysis weight with UF intensification to achieve treatment goal will be
      pursued for 8 weeks. During this period BP should be maintained in levels &lt;160/110 mmHg. If
      BP exceeds these levels, per protocol drug therapy will be initiated (Table 1). As a first
      step, carvedilol per os will be administered on a starting dose of 3.125 mg b.i.d. up to a
      maximum tolerated dose (â‰¤25 mg b.i.d.) until BP levels are &lt;160/110 mmHg or until patient
      experiences signs of bradycardia (HR &lt;60 bpm) or other adverse effects. As a second step of
      drug therapy, irbesartan will be initiated on a starting dose of 75 mg daily up to maximum
      tolerated dose (â‰¤300 mg daily) until BP levels are &lt;160/110 mmHg or any adverse effects are
      presented. Finally, amlodipine on a starting dose of 5 mg daily up to maximum tolerated dose
      (â‰¤10 mg daily) will be administered on failure of the two previous steps to achieve BP levels
      &lt;160/110 mmHg. If BP is still not controlled at goal, any antihypertensive class can be added
      according to treating physician's choice.

      In the control group follow-up, dry-weight and UF regimen will be guided only by conventional
      clinical and laboratory criteria. Blood pressure and blood pressure changes over time, pedal
      edema, presence or absence of dyspnea, body weight gain between dialysis and hemodynamic
      instability during dialysis session will be some of the clinical criteria that will determine
      possible post-dialysis weight adjustments in these patients. The use of lung ultrasound to
      estimate lung congestion will not be allowed in these patients. A threshold of BP 160/110
      mmHg will be set for the first 8 weeks of the study. If BP exceeds these levels, per protocol
      drug therapy will be initiated as mentioned in the intervention group.

      After 8 weeks of treatment, this per protocol drug therapy will be performed in patients from
      both study groups, aiming at maintaining Home BP levels &lt;140/90 mmHg.

      The primary and secondary measurements of the study will be carried in prespecified
      time-points that are listed below:

      Study-Point 1:

      Participants in the study will be asked to come to their dialysis unit on the second
      interdialytic day of the week (Thursday or Friday) exactly 24 hours after the scheduled
      starting time of the second mid-week dialysis session. All study participants will undergo an
      echocardiography study by a single operator, as well as US-B lines measurement with lung
      ultrasound. During this day, BP will be recorded for 24 hours using the Mobil-O-Graph monitor
      with a cuff of appropriate size. The device will be programmed to collect data every 20
      minutes, except for 23:00 to 07:00 (data collection every 30 minutes). The Mobil-O-Graph
      device will be removed before the patients' third dialysis session of the week (Friday or
      Saturday). The results from this echocardiographic study and 24-hour ABPM will be used as the
      baseline reference. An ABPM would be considered successful if &gt;80% of recordings are valid
      with no more than two non-consecutive day hours (07.00-23.00 hours) with fewer than two valid
      measurements, and no more than one night hour (23.00-07.00 hours without valid recording,
      according to standard recommendations for ABPM. Patients with unsuccessful 24-hour ABPM will
      repeat the measurement a week later.

      After the baseline evaluation, patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio in the intervention
      and control arms with permuted blocks of random length, stratified by sex.

      Participants in the study will be asked to come to their dialysis unit one hour earlier than
      their third dialysis session of the week is scheduled (Wednesday or Thursday), following at
      least a 8-hour fast and without having received their morning medication. Body weight will be
      measured with the use of validated electronic weighting scales. Height will be also evaluated
      for the BMI calculation. Body composition would be estimated with the use of Bioelectrical
      Impedance Analysis. Office blood pressure measurements will be acquired after 5 min of rest
      (sitting posture) with the use of a validated oscillometric device or standard mercury
      sphygmomanometer at the level of brachial artery in the contralateral arm of the side where
      vascular access is located. PWV and AIx recordings with the Sphygmocor device would be taken.
      Venous blood specimens will be collected for routine hematological and biochemical laboratory
      testing, as mentioned before.

      A lung ultrasound will be conducted in all study participants in the intervention group using
      the GE VScan lung ultrasound device, 15 minutes before hemodialysis session initiation. With
      patient in a lying posture pre-dialysis US-B lines will be measured in both lungs, while the
      transducer is placed vertically from the second up to the fifth intercostal space
      consecutively, along the parasternal, the mid-clavear, the anterior axillary and the mid
      axillary lines. All measurements will be performed in a quiet room with controlled air
      temperature (approximately 22 Â° C) The sum of the US-B lines produces a score (US-B lines
      score) and UF regimen will be guided accordingly. In patients who will be include in both the
      main LUST study and the present sub-study with â‰¥15 US-B lines and in patients who will be
      included only in this sub-study with â‰¥5 US-B lines, UF will be intensified and dry-weight
      will be reduced according to the value of US-B lines score over a period of 8 weeks (Figure
      2). Thresholds in dry-weight reduction and UF rates will be applied and if needed longer
      and/or additional dialysis sessions will be conducted as mentioned before. In the control arm
      standard-of-care treatment will be applied guided by conventional clinical criteria.

      Afterwards all study participants from both arms will undergo their scheduled dialysis
      session with BP measured every 20 minutes. After session's completion, body weight and office
      blood pressure will be measured in both arms. A second lung ultrasound will be conducted in
      the intervention group to evaluate post-dialysis US-B lines.

      Over the period of the first 8 weeks of the study US-B lines measurements with lung
      ultrasound will be repeated at least once a week (before and after a mid-week dialysis
      session) in all patients in the active arm. During this period per protocol drug therapy will
      be initiated if BP exceeds a threshold of home BP 160/110 mmHg (Table 1).

      Study Point 2:

      Two months (8 weeks) after baseline all patients will visit again their dialysis unit on the
      second interdialytic day of the week (Thursday or Friday) exactly 24 hours after the
      scheduled starting time of the second mid-week dialysis session. They will be subjected to a
      second echocardiography study and US-B lines measurement with lung ultrasound by the same
      cardiologist. During this day, 24-hour ABPM will be monitored as mentioned in Point 0.
      Patients with an unsuccessful 24-hour ABPM, will repeat the measurement a week later.

      On the day that the third dialysis session of the week is scheduled (Wednesday or Thursday)
      body weight, bioelectrical impedance analysis, office blood pressure and PWV and AIx with
      Sphygmocor will be measured as in Point 0 of the study and a detailed physical examination
      will be also performed in both groups. Pre-dialysis lung ultrasound will be conducted in the
      intervention arm to evaluate the treatment goal of post-dialysis US-B lines score &lt;15 in
      patients included in both the main LUST study and this sub-study and US-B lines score &lt;5 in
      patients included only in the present sub-study. Study participants from both arms will then
      undergo their scheduled dialysis session with blood pressure monitoring every 20 minutes and
      body weight measurement after its completion.

      If treatment goal is achieved during this post-dialysis US-B lines measurement, lung
      ultrasounds will be conducted once a month from this point on. Patients in the intervention
      group who have achieved the treatment goal of post-dialysis US-B lines score at previous
      evaluations and who will develop clinical signs of pulmonary congestion and/or â‰¥15 or â‰¥5 US-B
      lines according to the patients' stratification at any time will be treated according to
      those with lung congestion at baseline. A threshold of Home BP &lt;140/90 mmHg will be set after
      this point and when needed the same per protocol drug therapy will be performed in patients
      from both study groups.

      Study Point 3:

      One year after their first evaluation all patients will undergo all examinations described in
      baseline, with a similar order.
