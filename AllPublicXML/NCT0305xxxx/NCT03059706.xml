      This study evaluates the efficacy of intra-articular administration of RegenoGel-OSP™ to
      treat pain and the safety and efficacy on subject's activity and quality of life following
      arthroscopic surgery due to degenerative or traumatic meniscal tear. adult subjects will be
      randomized and sequentially assigned to RegenoGel-OSP™ or placebo treatment on a 1:1 basis.
