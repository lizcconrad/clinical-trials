  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medically healthy Veterans ages 21-75 that have been diagnosed with Depression will get up to
      6 treatments of Ketamine infusions, weekly. After treatment is completed, follow up will
      occur at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after completion of infusions to evaluate the longer
      term effects of ketamine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 25 depressed subjects between the ages of 21-75 who have current major depressive
      disorder without psychotic features by DSM-5 will be recruited. Subjects will be accepted
      into the protocol after an opportunity to review and provide voluntary written informed
      consent and completion of a comprehensive medical and psychiatric history, physical
      examination, mental status examination, and routine laboratory assessments. Patients will be
      recruited in outpatient settings to the Refractory Depression Clinic. Providers or Refractory
      Depression consult team will be informed if the patient may be eligible for participation in
      the ketamine protocol. If the Veteran is interested, a screening visit for further evaluation
      for the ketamine protocol will be scheduled. Veterans will receive up to 6 infusions for
      ketamine weekly, per PI discretion. The primary goal of this proposal is to test the
      effectiveness of repeated ketamine treatment (0.5 mg/kg; once or twice a week for up to 6
      weeks; up to a total of 6 ketamine infusions). An open-label trial will be conducted that
      will include up to 25 Veterans with MDD with a follow-up of 6 months. This open-label trial
      will allow us to examine the safety and tolerability of the ketamine treatment in this
      population and the long-term effects. All patients will receive usual standard care during
      this trial.

When the cognitive battery is being conducted on test days it will be done at the end of the test day, to eliminate the confounding effects of acute treatment of ketamine..</description>
