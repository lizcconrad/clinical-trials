  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine plus cisplatin have been the most studied and used anticancer agents in patients
      with local advanced and/or metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of urothelial tract even if
      clinical benefits and survival remains limited.

      The purpose of this study is to test in a randomized trial enrolling patients for comparing
      the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 with Gemcitabine plus cisplatin, in order
      to determine the most promising agents as the first line treatment of advanced and/or
      metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of urothelial tract.
