  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (S. Korea/US), Phase Ib, open-label, dose-finding study to assess
      safety, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of CWP232291 administered in combination with ara-C
      in subjects with relapsed or refractory AML.

      The primary objectives in phase 2a is to assess the efficacy of CWP232291 administered in
      combination with cytarabine (response rate complete remission [RR-CR]/complete remission with
      incomplete blood count recovery [CRi]/partial remission [PR]).
