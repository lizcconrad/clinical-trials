    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of once-daily oral administration of
      Gabapentin enacarbil versus placebo, based on the change in International Restless Legs
      Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLS) score in subjects with moderate-to-severe primary Restless Legs
      Syndrome. This study will also assess the safety of Gabapentin enacarbil.
