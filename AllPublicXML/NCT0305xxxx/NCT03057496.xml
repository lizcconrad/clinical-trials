  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a novel collision warning device to help people with severe vision
      impairment or blindness avoid collisions with obstacles. The main hypothesis to be tested is
      that the device reduces the number of collisions with obstacles in everyday activities.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants with blindness or severe visual field loss (hemianopia or tunnel vision) will be
      trained to use a collision warning device that alerts them to impending collisions.
      Participants will use the device at home during everyday mobility for 2 months. The device is
      designed to supplement existing mobility devices, such as a long cane or dog guide. The
      device will provide warnings about potential collisions with mid- or high-level obstacles
      (which are typically not detected by a long cane).

    <intervention_model_description>The device will operate in two modes: active mode (intervention condition), when it gives warnings and, silent mode (control condition), when it does not give warnings. The device will be programmed to generate a different randomized active/silent schedule for each subject. Participants will not know whether it is in the active or silent mode.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Although this is a single-arm study, participants will be masked in the sense that they will not know whether the device is operating in the active mode (intervention condition), when it gives warnings, or the silent mode (control condition), when it does not give warnings. The device will be programmed to generate a different randomized active/silent schedule for each subject. The investigator conducting the statistical analyses will also be masked as to whether the device was in the active or silent mode</masking_description>

    <description>The collision warning device is a pocket-sized, electronic system that includes a micro-computer, a clip-on miniature camera, a gyro-sensor, an accelerometer, and a rechargeable battery. It is about the size of a smart phone. When a potential collision is detected by the device it emits a warning to the user, either in the form of an audible beep or a tactile warning through bracelets worn on the wrist. The time to collision will be coded in both the auditory and tactile domains. As the time to collision decreases, the rhythm of auditory beeps and the tactile vibrations will increase. The device is designed to only give warnings about high risk collisions, so the users will not be continually bombarded by warnings for every potential collision object in the environment.</description>
