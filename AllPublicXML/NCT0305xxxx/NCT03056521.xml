      -  All patients admitted for elective upper and lower limb surgery, will be expected to
           have a preoperative visit by the anesthetic provider on the day before surgery.

        -  Those who will have consented to participate in the study will be randomized to either
           the intervention or control group.

        -  The intervention group will receive specific preoperative information about pain in
           private by the principal investigator in addition to the preoperative assessment.

        -  The following variables will be recorded preoperatively: socio-demographics (age,
           gender, tribe, education level) and vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure and oxygen
           saturation).

        -  A Numerical pain score will be explained to patient before it is recorded
           preoperatively.

        -  The patient will also be informed that the pain scores will be repeated after surgery at
           (someone will take the pain scores again after surgery at) 0, 6, 12, 24, 48hours or till
           discharge if less than 48hours. In addition the pulse rate, number of analgesic
           intravenous/ intramuscular injections or tablets needed/or given will be recorded.
