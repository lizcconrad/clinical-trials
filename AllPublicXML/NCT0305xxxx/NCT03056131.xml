  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tension Type Headache (TTH) is a frecuent type of headache disorder (about 1 person in 5
      worldwide). Individuals with TTH typically present pericraneal tenderness and an increased
      cervical muscle tone.

      The most common treatment in primary care consists mainly on analgesic medication. However,
      different techniques of manual therapy have been shown to be effective in the treatment of
      these patients. Diacutaneous fibrolysis shows clinical benefits in relieving symptoms of
      tension type headache, but there is no scientific evidence that analyzes this effects.

      The hypothesis of this study was that adding treatment with diacutaneous fibrolysis to the
      usual conservative treatment has beneficial effects on different variables of the headache.

      The aim of the study was to assess the effect of diacutaneous fibrolisis on intensity,
      frequency, duration of headache and cervical function in patients with tension type headache.

      A randomized controlled clinical trial has been designed to evaluate the effectiveness of
      diacutaneous fibrolysis technique compared to usual general practicioner care in patientes
      with tension type headache.

      The study protocol has been approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee from the
      Aragon Community and all patients provided written consent.

      Eighty-two people with clinical diagnosis of TTH were randomized into a intervention group or
      a control group. Intervention group received three sessions of Diacutaneous Fibrolysis, while
      control group was advised to maintain their usual pharmacologic treatment. Pain intensity
      (VAS), frecuency, location, cervical range of motion, head forward position and pressure pain
      thresholds (PPTs) were measured at baseline, postintervention, and 1 month follow-up after
      treatment. The Spanish version of the HIT-6 Questionnaire was used to measure
      disability/function at baseline and follow-up.
