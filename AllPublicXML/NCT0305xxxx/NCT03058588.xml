  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to look for predisposing mutations in patients and relatives
      affected by AML and MDS with familial history of myeloid or, less frequently, lymphoid
      malignancies. Taking advantage of a next generation sequencing (NGS) platform, screening for
      known and unknown mutations potentially associated with the disease will be done. The
      screening will be performed on affected and unaffected family members, in order to outline
      new pedigrees that either validate previous findings or constitute novel discoveries.

    <textblock>
      Patients with a diagnosis of AML or MDS with at least one relative affected by AL/MDS or,
      secondly, lymphoproliferative disorders, will be enrolled into the study, and will be
      referred to as the index case. The analysis will be performed both retrospectively and
      prospectively. A gene panel deep sequencing (GPDS) of the tumor DNA from peripheral blood of
      the index case at diagnosis will be performed in order to identify mutations in a number of
      genes known to be associated to myeloid malignancies, mainly: ASXL1, BCOR, NRAS, TP53, RUNX1,
      CEBPA, FLT3, EZH2, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, DNMT3A, TET2, CBL, KRAS, ETV6, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1,
      ZRSR2, GATA2, TERT, TERC, SRP72, and ANKRD26.

      In case none of the known mutations is found by the GPDS, whole exome sequencing (WES) will
      be performed as second step on the tumor cells of the index case.

      When one or multiple somatic mutations are found, a Sanger Sequencing (SS) on germline DNA
      from epithelial buccal cells of the index cases and affected relatives will be performed for
      the screening of the same somatic leukemic mutations on germline DNA. If the index case and
      affected relatives share the same mutations on the germline, the same germline mutations will
      be checked by SS in the unaffected family members.

      Tumor DNA of index case will be extracted from 10 ml of PB collected at diagnosis in EDTA
      tubes. Mononuclear cells from PB (PBMC)will be separated and isolated by Ficoll gradient.
      Tumor DNA will be extracted possibly soon after the isolation. Tumor DNA of affected
      relative/-s will be extracted from PBMC isolated at diagnosis, or during the patients
      monitoring, and stored at -80°C. Tumor DNA previously extracted and stored at -20°C may be
      used in event of no PB or bone marrow sample available.

      Germline DNA of index case and relatives will be extracted by buccal epithelial cells
      isolated by Isohelix SK-2 DNA Buccal Swab Collection Kit by Therapak Corporation, Isohelix
      SK-2 DNA Buccal Swab Collection Kit.

        Detailed personal and family history from every patient affected by myeloid malignancy will
        be obtained, in order to identify patients with at least one relative affected by myeloid
        malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorders or with the features that increase the
        likelihood of one of the aforementioned familial myeloid malignancy predisposition
        syndromes
