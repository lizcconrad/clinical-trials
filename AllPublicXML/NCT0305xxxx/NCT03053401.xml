  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both Ultrasound guided Adductor Canal Block ( ACB) and Femoral Nerve Block (FNB) has been
      used to provide postoperative analgesia for knee surgeries. To the investigators' knowledge,
      no comparison has been made between these blocks in relation to postoperative quadriceps
      muscle strength, or duration and quality of postoperative analgesia for arthroscopic ACL
      repair in pediatrics. If ACB provides postoperative analgesia after arthroscopic knee surgery
      comparable to FNB, it has the potential to improve the postoperative outcome as it will lead
      to less quadriceps muscle weakness and early mobilization, both of which are very important
      in the early postoperative period.

    <textblock>
      Motor preservation with adequate analgesia has become the optimal postoperative goal in
      orthopedic surgeries, in particular knee surgeries. This enables earlier physical therapy,
      faster recovery and shorter hospital stays. Both Ultrasound guided ACB and FNB has been used
      to provide postoperative analgesia for knee surgeries, including anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction . To the investigators' knowledge, no comparison has been made between both
      blocks in relation to postoperative quadriceps muscle strength as well as duration and
      quality of postoperative analgesia for arthroscopic ACL repair. ACB predominantly block the
      sensory component of the femoral nerve without much effect on the motor component. Hence, it
      can lead to less quadriceps muscle weakness, early postoperative mobilization and decreases
      the incidence of postoperative fall . With the advent of ultrasonography, the adductor canal
      can be easily visualized at the mid-thigh level, allowing performance of ACB with a high
      success rate . In recent years, ACB has been successfully used for postoperative pain control
      after knee surgery . Anatomical study of adductor canal demonstrated that the adductor canal
      may serve as a conduit for more than just the saphenous nerve, possibly including the vastus
      medialis nerve, medial femoral cutaneous nerve, articular branches from the obturator nerve,
      as well as the medial retinacular nerve . Thus, the sensory change is not limited to the
      distribution of the saphenous nerve but includes the medial and anterior aspects of the knee
      from the superior pole of the patella to the proximal tibia.To the investigators Knowledge
      there has not been a randomized controlled study comparing ACB with FNB after Arthroscopic
      Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) repair. This prospective, double-blinded, randomized,
      controlled study will test the hypothesis that ACB would be associated with less quadriceps
      motor weakness than FNB at 4 hours after block performance . The investigators also
      hypothesize that ACB will provide analgesia that is not inferior to FNB and not different in
      opioids usage at 4 and 24 hours after Peripheral Nerve Block (PNB) performance .

        -  Hypothesis ACB would be associated with less quadriceps motor weakness than FNB and
           provide analgesia that is not inferior to FNB in quality or duration as determined by
           Numeric Scale (NS) pain scores and opioid use a 4 and 24 hours after PNB.

        -  Objectives

      To compare FNB and ACB regarding:

        1. Quadriceps muscle strength in immediate pre-operative period and at 4 hours after PNB
           performance.

        2. Pain scores at rest at 4 hours and 24 hours after PNB as assessed by Numeric Scale (NS)
           pain scoring system.

        3. Total opioid consumption at 4 and 24 hours after PNB.

             -  Study Design:

      Randomized, double blinded, single center clinical trial. A total of 50 pediatric patients
      (ASA 1or 2), aged between 8 to 18 years, for elective ACL repair at Akron Children's Hospital
      ( ACH ) will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups, A or B. Group A (25 patients) will have ultrasound guided ACB performed at mid-thigh
      level and group B (25 patients) will have ultrasound guided FNB, with nerve stimulator
      confirmation with the type of motor response (e.g., quadriceps, patellar) and the minimum
      current needed to be recorded. Both blocks will be performed under general anesthesia. Both
      group will have ropivacaine 0.2 % ( 0.5 ml/kg, maximum of 30 ml and methylprednisolone
      acetate 1 mg/kg , maximum of 40 mg ).Both blocks will be performed using a 22-gauge 2-inch
      Stimuplex A needle; ; B. Braun Medical Inc., Melsungen, Germany).Both blocks will be
      performed using linear ultrasound transducer, General Electric ( GE). Ultrasound pictures
      will be obtained to Verify proper local anesthetic placement.ACL repair, which is the
      surgical procedure used in this study may not always be possible to perform by the surgeon.
      The alternative is ACL reconstruction, using a hamstring graft. Post-operative pain related
      to the hamstring graft arises from the distribution of sciatic nerve and is not covered by
      either ACB or FNB and requires management with IV /oral opioids. The potential increase in
      opioids consumption and pain scores due to sciatic nerve involvement may confound the
      statistical analysis of the data and is therefore not within the scope or aims of this study.
      The investigators decided therefore to continue the study procedures and data collection on
      both ACL repair and ACL reconstruction. However, to improve the accuracy of the study
      results, the statistical analysis will include only patients that undergo ACL repair. For the
      other patients that undergo ACL reconstruction, the investigators will collect the data but
      will not include it in the statistical analysis. The data from these patients may be used as
      a pilot for future research.

      Quadriceps strength of both legs will be assessed by placing the dynamometer on the anterior
      of the ankle, between the malleoli. Patients will be instructed to extend their legs three
      times each, with a 30 seconds pause between each attempt as described by Maffiuletti . The
      assessment will be performed in the pre-operative period and will be repeated postoperatively
      at 4 hours after PNB. All patients will be observed in the post-operative period by an
      observer unaware of the technique of analgesia used. Pain will be assessed using the NS.
      Postoperatively, PCA morphine pumps will be attached to patients. A loading dose of 0.05
      mg/kg to a maximum of 5 mg will be administered in the Post Anesthesia Care unit (PACU) as
      needed, followed by demand interval dosing of 0.015 mg/kg every 10 minutes.as demanded by the
      patient .Four-hours limits for morphine will be set at 0.35 mg/kg. No continuous infusion and
      no adjuvant NSAIDs or acetaminophen will be administered. Rescue morphine dosing will be
      ordered via PCA pump at 0.05 mg/kg ( repeated once as needed) and will be available every two
      hours as needed by pain assessment ( for a NS â‰¥ 4 ) or patient request. Diazepam 0.03 mg/kg
      IV will be available every 4 to6 hours as needed for muscle spasm or anxiety. Patients will
      be considered ready for discharge from hospital when all the following criteria are met:
      Child is alert, oriented, stable vital signs, and would tolerate clear liquid, with no nausea
      or vomiting and good pain control. The evaluation for meeting the discharge criteria will be
      done after one hour from arrival in PACU and every 30 minutes thereafter till the patient
      meet all the discharge criteria. After discharge, After discharge, parents will be instructed
      to give the child oxycodone tablets/elixir 0.1 mg /kg PO q 3 hours as needed for pain. In
      addition, acetaminophen 10mg/kg q 4 hours PRN and/or ibuprofen 10 mg/kg q 6 hours PRN up to
      maximum of 2400 mg/24 hours, may be administered for any residual pain. The total dose of
      oxycodone, ibuprofen and tylenol will be recorded per parents for a total of 24 hours after
      PNB. Pain scores will be also recorded by parent at rest,24 hours post -block. The data for
      total opioids use in the first 24 hours after PNB and Pain score at 24 hours will be
      collected from parent by phone call.

        -  Study Endpoints

           1-Quadriceps muscle strength pre-operatively and at 4 after PNB 2- Total
           morphine/morphine equivalent at 4 and 24 hours after PNB. 3-Pain scores via NS at 4 and
           24 hours after PNB.

        -  Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Regimen Random allocation for one of the two
           treatments will be achieved using sealed envelope assigned by external third party not
           involved in the study to ensure allocation concealment.

        -  Study Monitoring Plan This study will be monitored through a data monitoring committee.
           The study will be performed over a period of 18-24 months. This study offers minimal
           risk to the patient. The data monitoring committee will include the PI, at least one of
           the co-investigators, the principal statistician, and the principal research nurse.

      The data monitoring committee will meet when approximately 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the
      primary outcomes are observed. The priority of the data monitoring committee will be to
      ensure the safety of the participants in the trial and to ensure the integrity of the trial.
      Also, these meetings will monitor the quality of the collected data to assess for weaknesses
      and errors. If any weakness and/or errors are identified, feedback will be provided during
      these meetings .The investigator(s) will allocate adequate time for such monitoring
      activities. The investigator(s) will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or
      quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study-related documents.

      -Summary Statistics: Will be provided for all variables. Examination of continuous data will
      include normality testing as well as assessment of potential outliers. Statistical testing
      will be based upon distributional shape, but for purpose of analytical planning and sample
      size analysis normality of distributions will be assumed.

      To examine for potential differences in quadriceps motor strength (QMS) between the two
      groups (ACB, FNB), two change scores will be created and analyzed via T-Test for Equal and
      Unequal Variances with appropriate Bonferroni adjusted alpha testing paired difference at two
      distinctive time points. Assuming no statistically significant baseline differences between
      the two groups the QMS Change scores will be a) Baseline to 4 hours. Sample size analysis
      will be based upon testing of the QMS Change scores. Non-inferiority of ACB to FNB in
      analgesia provided will be assessed by examination of pain scores. Non-inferiority of ACB
      compared with FNB is defined as the mean ACB - NRS pain score not higher than the mean FNB -
      NRS pain score by an amount of 1.6. (Kim, 2014) Pain scores will be individually examined at
      the 4 hour and 24 hour post - operative time points with appropriate Bonferroni adjusted
      alpha. In addition, a change in pain score from 4 to 24 hours will be created and evaluated
      for potential difference between groups.

      Total opioid consumption as measured in morphine equivalents will be assessed at the 24 hour
      post-operative time point to determine whether a difference exists. Opioid consumption will
      also be examined by creating a change score from 4 to 24 hour consumption and comparing
      between the groups.

      All testing will be completed utilizing SAS 9.4 Â© software and evaluated at the Type I Error
      Rate of alpha = 0.05 level for statistical significance unless otherwise noted.
