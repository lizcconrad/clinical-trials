    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of a nutraceutical

      months of continuous daily use.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in adult female subjects with
      mild to moderate hair loss. Following an up to 35-day screening period to determine
      eligibility, subjects will be randomly assigned into one of the following treatment arms:
      Nutrafol速 vs. Placebo. Nutrafol速 or Placebo will randomly assigned be administered daily to
      the subjects for 6 months starting on Day 2. The subjects will return to the study site at
      Day 90 and Day 180 for assessments. Additionally, the subjects will return to the study site
      approximately 48 hours after Day 0 (Baseline Visit) and D180 in order to assess hair growth
      rate. Nutrafol速 or Placebo will be dispensed by the non-blinded study staff with nonlabeled
      containers containing the corresponding tablets. Efficacy ratings will be performed by a
      trained investigator who will not be aware of the subject's treatment randomization in order
      to preserve double-blinding of the study.
