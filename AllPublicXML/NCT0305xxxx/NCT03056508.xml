  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the impact of an exercise and nutrition (EX+NUTR) , relative to
      exercise alone (EX) intervention, on brain structure and function as well as blood biomarkers
      in older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and vascular risk factors. The
      overall hypotheses are that a combined EX+NUTR, relative to EX, intervention will evoke more
      positive changes in brain structure (e.g. hippocampal volume), neural activity (e.g. task
      associated functional activations monitored through fMRI), and cognitive performance. These
      changes will be associated with an improved metabolic profile, reductions in inflammatory
      cytokines and oxidative burden, and greater intervention compliance.

      This is a randomized control trial in which all participants will engage in supervised
      exercise sessions which are part of the standard Toronto Rehabilitation Institute's (TRI)
      Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation program, including aerobic training, resistance
      training and education/counseling. The active group will receive strategy training to
      simultaneously improve their diet in conjunction with our newly developed Brain Health Food
      Guide (EX+BHFG); the placebo control group (EX+BHEd) will receive brain health education to
      control for time and social participation. [NOTE All participants must also be enrolled in
      the SCD cohort of the CCNA and undergo the CCNA's COMPASS-ND assessment at the beginning of
      the trial.] The study is 6 months in duration and requires participants to attend 2.5 hr
      weekly sessions (1 hr supervised exercise, 0.5 hr exercise/stress education and 1 hr
      nutrition or brain health education) and to exercise on their own an additional 3-4 times per
      week. Participants are assessed on measures of cognition, brain health (MRI), functional
      status at baseline, post intervention and 6 month follow-up.

    <description>On the same day as the exercise class, participants will also receive nutrition support. Participants will alter their overall diet to be consistent with recommendations outlined in our brain health food guide (BHFG) and receive diet counseling and strategy training to promote retention and enable this dietary change. For the first two months, diet group sessions will be held on a weekly basis. For the remaining four months, sessions will be divided between group sessions and individual meetings with study dietitians, on a predefined schedule. Participants will submit weekly logs outlining diet goals, plans, successes and obstacles to help direct identification of sequential goals.</description>

    <description>Supervised group exercise will be performed once per week (60 minutes) and self-directed exercise (4 additional aerobic and 2-3 resistance training sessions per week) will be monitored by an exercise diary. The initial walking prescription will be set at ~1.6 km and an intensity equivalent to the anaerobic threshold and/or 60% VO2-peak. Progressions will be made every 2 weeks, increasing distance to a maximum of 6.4 km and then increasing to a max intensity of 80% of VO2-peak and/or max duration of 60 minutes. Heart rate and perceived exertion will be monitored. The program will last 6 months.</description>
