      A Muti-center randomized controlled study with large samples to observe improvement of motor
      function,severity of spasm,ADL(activity of daily lives),by standardized protocols of TCM
      techniques(massage and herbal bathing) combined with conventional rehabilitation on spasm
      after stroke in 1 month.Modified Ashworth scale,Fugl-Meyer Index and Modified barthel Index
      were used for spasm,motor function and ADL.And also the follow up research within 3 months
      and 6 months focus on the efficacy duration of TCM on spasm.Try to find suitable timing for
      intervention on spasm by CTM(Massage and herbal medicine bathing)and the connection between
      spasm severity and treatment efficacy.
