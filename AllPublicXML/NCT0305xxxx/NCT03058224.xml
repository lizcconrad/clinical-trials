      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory trial to investigate
      efficacy and safety of food supplement IGN-ES001 in patients with chronic widespread pain
      (CWP) with or without fibromyalgia (FM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will perform five scheduled on-site visits and five phone calls:

        -  Screening visit, V1 (Day -10 to -7), informed consent

        -  Baseline visit, V2 (Day 1), randomization, treatment start

        -  Phone call, V3 (Day 4 ± 1)

        -  Phone call, V4 (Day 8 ± 3)

        -  Phone call, V5 (Day 15 ± 3)

        -  On-site visit, V6 (Day 22 ± 3)

        -  Phone call, V7 (Day 29 ± 3)

        -  Phone call, V8 (Day 36 ± 3)

        -  On-site visit, V9 (Day 43 + 3), treatment end

        -  Follow-up on-site visit, V10 (Day 50 + 7, or 7 + 7 days after EDV).

      In addition, patients may be asked to return to the trial site between scheduled visits for
      assessment of safety data (unscheduled visits).

      The maximum duration of treatment for the individual patient will be 46 days (including
      allowed visit window deviation). The maximum duration of trial participation for the
      individual patient will be 67 days.

    <time_frame>Six Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The overall pain improvement will be assessed by means of the percent changes from baseline (Visit 2) to end of treatment visit (Visit 9). Percent changes are preferred to raw changes due to their implicit adjustment for baseline differences in the case of proportional decrease. The baseline pain value will be calculated as mean overall pain of the last seven-day time period of the screening phase from Day -7 to Day -1. Minimum the last 6 out of 7 days prior to baseline visit V2 must be documented. The final pain value will be calculated as mean overall pain of the last seven-day time period prior to the end of the adjunctive treatment period from Day 36 to Day 42.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain, final percent changes from baseline (based on diary), multivariate analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to the univariate analysis of the overall pain score, a correlation-sensitive multidimensional approach will be performed with respect to the two major pain activity levels:
Pain at rest (sum score of three locations), percent change from baseline
Pain perceived during physical strain (sum score of three locations), percent change from baseline</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain, final responder (based on diary)</measure>
    <time_frame>Six Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Responders will be defined as patients with a percent decrease from baseline of the overall pain score by at least 30%. This is a recommended benchmark for a &quot;clinically meaningful improvement&quot; (Farrar et al.), and provides robustness in case of proportional pain decrease (independency from baseline pain level). Tubach et al. (2012) defined a percent decrease of 20% as minimal clinically important change. Thus, the recommendation of Farrar et al. is regarded as optimum choice for a clinically meaningful responder definition.</description>

             aspects of the trial, including use of investigational product, subjective completion
             of diaries and questionnaires, attending scheduled visits, completing telephone
             interviews, and compliant with protocol requirements as evidenced by providing signed
             writteninformed consent.

          3. History of chronic widespread pain (for at least three months prior to visit V1
             (screening)).

          4. a.) For FM patients: Widespread Pain Index (WPI) ≥ 7 and Symptom Severity (SS) ≥ 5 or
             WPI 3-6 and SS ≥ 9 (original preliminary fibromyalgia criteria of the American College
             of Rheumatology (ACR) 2010).

             b.) For non-FM CWP patients: WPI ≥ 3-6 and SS ≥ 5-8 (modified from the preliminary
             fibromyalgia criteria of the ACR 2010).

          5. Use of prior and concomitant medications/ therapies (if not excluded, see exclusion
             criteria no 6 and no 7), non-pharmacological therapies and lifestyle habits (e.g. diet
             changes, Ramadan participation, etc.) that could influence the efficacy assessments
             must have been stable for at least 30 days prior to visit V1 (screening) and are
             anticipated to be at a stable regimen throughout the trial until visit V9.

          6. Patient has negative urine test at screening visit V1 for the following drugs of
             abuse:

               1. Amphetamine

               2. Cocaine

               3. Metamphetamine

               4. Morphine

               5. Tetrahydrocannabinol

          7. Female patient is surgically sterile (i.e. bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral
             oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), or at least two years postmenopausal or, if of
             childbearing potential, she is sexually abstinent or agrees to practice adequate
             contraceptive measures (hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device, double-barrier
             method).

          8. Patient must have completed at least 6 screening phase diary pages satisfactorily
             within the past 7 days before visit V2.

          9. Median pain NRS must be ≥ 4 in at least 1 out of the 6 pain qualities and ≥ 4 in
             overall pain assessment. The median will be calculated from the last 7 days before
             visit V2 (baseline) and will serve as baseline value.

        If all inclusion criteria are fulfilled (and none of the exclusion criteria below), the
        patient will be randomized at visit V2 and continues in the trial. Otherwise the patient
        will be excluded from trial participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients without a basic and stable CWP therapy which started at least 30 days before
             V1 (screening) i.e. treatment-naive patients, first diagnosis.
