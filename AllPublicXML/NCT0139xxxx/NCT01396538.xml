      Atni-HBs to HBsAg and Anit-HBc was interpreted based on three hepatitis markers for clinical
      detection of HBV-infections. HBAg and Anti-HBs were negative and the Anit-HBc-positive
      referred to as Anti-HBc alone. When the Anti-HBc alone occurs, patients may be due to
      mutations in HBV HBsAg can not be detected due to (1), but if by the molecular diagnostics by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology can detect HBV DNA present. When Anti-HBc alone in
      patients with serum HBV DNA can be measured, then there may be occult HBV infection. In
      different countries, Occult HBV infection in the Anti-HBc Alone group had significant
      differences in the prevalence (2.9 ~ 22.8%) (2), but prevalence survey in Taiwan there are
      very few studies on this , It is hoped to be able to investigation the prevalence of occult
      HBV infection Among Anti-HBc Alone.

      The main use of this program, Taipei Medical University - Wan Fang Hospital in clinical
      specimens using the Roche system (Corbas e601) operating HBsAg, Anti-HBs, Anti-HBc to screen
      for the Anti-HBc alone group. Recycling Roche molecular system (Taq48) Real-time PCR to
      detect all anti-HBc alone population to understand their serum HBV-DNA viral load, in order
      to understand Occult HBV infection in the Anti-HBc alone group, the prevalence and viral load
      changes in these studies through the clinical units to provide occult HBV infection as a
      reference basis.
