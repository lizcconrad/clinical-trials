  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in the treatment of patients with resected NSCLC, disease recurrence
      and mortality related to lung cancer are common among patients with early stage non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Therefore novel approaches are necessary to improve the outcome for
      early stage NSCLC. The preclinical studies conducted with vaccine based approaches provide
      the rationale to evaluate this as an adjunct to surgery for patients with early stage NSCLC.
      Administration of the vaccine before surgery will also allow for the evaluation of the tumor
      specimen for immunological responses to the vaccine.

      In the currently proposed study, patients will receive the first dose of the vaccine
      approximately 2 weeks prior to surgery. The second dose will be administered about 3-4 weeks
      following surgery. A booster dose of the vaccine will be given 6 months after the 2nd
      vaccine. The tumor tissue and serum will be studied for immunological responses following
      therapy with the vaccine. Patients are allowed to receive adjuvant chemotherapy if indicated.
      The choice of the chemotherapy regimen will be at the discretion of the treating physician,
      preferably 3-4 cycles of platinum combination regimen. The vaccine should be administered at
      least 2 weeks before chemotherapy is initiated.

             cancer

          -  All patients must have one of the following stages: Stage IA(T1NO), and IB T2NO), II &amp;
             IIIA (N2 negative)

          -  No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for non-small cell lung cancer

          -  Patient must be deemed surgically and medically resectable

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to use effective contraception
             while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients should not have received chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 months prior
             to entry to study.

          -  Patients with tumors involving the superior sulcus are not eligible.

          -  Patients must not have post-obstructive pneumonia or other serious infection at the

             the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment.

          -  Prior resection of lung cancer is allowed, if at least five years have elapsed between
             previous resection and registration.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
