  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Altered choline phospholipid metabolism is a recently recognized hallmark of cancer and
      potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in a number of cancers, including hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). The feasibility of detecting HCC on the basis of measuring the
      phosphorylation rate of choline in-vivo has been shown using positron emission
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and the investigational tracer compound [18F]
      fluorocholine (FCH). This Phase 2 study will evaluate the diagnostic performance of FCH
      PET/CT in patients undergoing surgical resection as treatment for HCC. Since the molecular
      signaling alterations leading to enhanced choline metabolism in tumors are not fully
      elucidated at this time, this study will also collect frozen tissue specimens for
      whole-genome gene expression profiling to elucidate genes and signal transduction pathways
      related to altered choline metabolism in HCC.

    <textblock>
      Eighty (80) human subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who meet selection criteria
      will undergo PET/CT imaging with 18F-fluoromethylcholine (FCH or 18F-choline) prior to
      surgical hepatic resection. The PET/CT will measure the dynamic tissue delivery and uptake of
      18F-choline in the liver, as well as its static distribution in this organ after a fixed
      period of time. Kinetic modeling will be performed using the PET/CT data to quantify
      parameters related to 18F-choline delivery, uptake, and phosphorylation. The imaging findings
      will be compared with histopathologic diagnosis following surgery to estimate the detection
      rate and other diagnostic parameters of PET/CT for HCC. Tumor and liver tissue samples will
      also be obtained following surgery for gene expression analysis. These results will be
      correlated with the imaging findings. The surgical procedures are clinically warranted and
      not considered a part of the investigation.
