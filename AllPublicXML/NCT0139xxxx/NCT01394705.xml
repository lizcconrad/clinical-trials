  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study seeks to compare the change in energy expenditure and fitness levels of
      patients seen in the Children's Hospital Preventive Cardiology program receiving standard of
      care provider exercise counseling to similar patients receiving Frequency, Intensity, Time,
      Type (FITT) exercise prescription and counseling combined with BodyMedia supported by an
      online interactive tool.

      The investigators primary hypothesis is that this interactive technology coupled with support
      from a exercise specialist will increase the energy expenditure of the investigators patients
      over standard of care provider counseling.

      The investigators Secondary hypotheses include greater improvement in measured physical
      fitness Peak oxygen consumption (VO2max), oxygen consumption (VO2) at anaerobic threshold
      (AT) and ventilation/carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) slope, lipid profiles, blood pressure, arterial
      stiffness, body mass index (BMI), BMI percentile, and self-efficacy in the intervention group
      compared to control.
