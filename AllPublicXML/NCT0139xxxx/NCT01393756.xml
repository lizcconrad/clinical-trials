      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of the association of Lenalidomide
      (Revlimid) and R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, vincristine and Prednisone)
      in a population of patients with follicular lymphoma as measured by the response rate at the
      end of treatment.

          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 90 days (3 months).

          -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL not more than 3 days from the
             start of study drug and must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual
             intercourse (and confirmed on a monthly basis) or begin one effective method of birth
             control, at least four weeks before she starts taking lenalidomide, and maintain that
             method throughout the entire duration of study drug therapy (including dose
             interruptions), and for four weeks after the end of study treatment with lenalidomide,
             even if she has amenorrhea. FCBP must also agree to pregnancy testing at least every
             three weeks and must be counseled at a minimum of every three weeks about pregnancy
             precautions and risks of fetal exposure.

          -  Men must agree not to father a child and agree to use a condom throughout study drug
             therapy, during any dose interruption, and for one week after cessation of study drug
             therapy, if their partner is pregnant or of child bearing potential. Men must also
             agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of
             study drug therapy. Men must be counseled at a minimum of every 4 weeks about
             pregnancy precautions and risks of fetal exposure.

          -  All subjects must abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for
             one week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

          -  Agree not to share study drug with another person and to return all unused study drug
             to the investigator.

               -  A female patient is considered to have childbearing potential unless she meets at
                  least one of the following criteria 1) Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic
                  for ≥ 1 year (amenorrhoea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing
                  potential); or 2) Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist
                  gynaecologist or 3) Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), or
                  hysterectomy, or 4) XY genotype, turner syndrome, uterine agenesis.
