      The purpose of this study is to find out whether perioperative fluid restriction influence on
      postoperative immunological function. And discuss the probable mechanism that fluid
      restriction regime effect on clinical data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative fluid administration is a common therapy in clinical practice, and recent
      regime has a history about 50 years. Recently, clinicians found that traditional regime had
      some disadvantages, for example, pulmonary edema, increased cardiac load, increased body
      weight. And thus, perioperative fluid restriction regimen has been suggested and proved could
      reduce cardiopulmonary complications and mortality rates after major elective
      gastrointestinal surgery.

      Patients were divided into two groups randomly and underwent restricted fluid regimen or
      traditional fluid regimen. We determined the complications and immunological function in two
      groups, and analyzed the relationship between complications and immunological changes. Based
      on this we decide the probable mechanism that perioperative fluid restriction effects on
      complications.
