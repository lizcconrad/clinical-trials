    <textblock>
      The proposed controlled, randomized study aims to compare pre-dilution hemodiafiltration
      (HDF) and low flux hemodialysis (HD) regarding acute changes in the brain.

      The study consist of two examination days placed one week apart. 12 HD patients will be
      recruited to the study. The patients will be randomly placed in two groups: Pre-dilution
      hemodiafiltration during the first examination and low flux hemodialysis during the second
      day or vice versa.

      Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be obtained before and after both treatments. The
      MRI-data will later be processed to estimate brain volume changes during the two types of
      treatment.
