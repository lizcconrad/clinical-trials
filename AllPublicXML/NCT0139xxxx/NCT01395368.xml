  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus, commonly referred to as &quot;ringing in the ears&quot;, affects 50 million people in the
      United States and is recognized as a major public health concern. Tinnitus is the most
      frequent cause of service-connected disability claims among war veterans. Tinnitus remains a
      subjectively diagnosed entity. There is no standardized objective method of diagnosing
      tinnitus or describing the functional impact of the condition. Currently, physicians have to
      rely on patient-based self reports. Without an objective method of diagnosing tinnitus and
      describing the functional implications, adequate treatment delivery is also hampered since
      there is no way to objectively stratify patients into severity groups and assess response to
      treatment. Because tinnitus is known to negatively affect cognition through the ventral
      attention networks and the prefrontal cortex, measuring cognitive processing speed is a
      possible way to objectively measure tinnitus. This study builds on previous work the
      investigators have done that utilized a quick, easily accessible measure of auditory
      processing speed. That earlier study showed a correlation between that measure and self
      reported measures of tinnitus severity, and this study attempts determine a more precise
      estimate of that correlation. It also better validates those results by including a
      traditional neurocognitive measuring cognitive speed and by controlling for the presence of
      depression and somatoform disorders.

          -  Participants with active diagnoses of any acute or chronic brain-related neurological
             conditions that alter normal brain anatomy or function including Parkinson's disease,
             Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease, cerebral infarcts, traumatic brain injury,
             history of brain tumor(s), epilepsy, or dementia.

          -  Participants with tinnitus related to retrocochlear lesions, cochlear implants, or
