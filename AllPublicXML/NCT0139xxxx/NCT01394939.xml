    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of JX-594
      (Pexa-Vec) administered intravenously either alone or in combination with Irinotecan in
      colorectal carcinoma patients who are refractory to or intolerant to standard therapy.
