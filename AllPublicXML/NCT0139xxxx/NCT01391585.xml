  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing whether patients with diabetes can communicate with our health
      care system through text messaging. The investigators will look at how often they respond to
      prompts for blood pressures, blood sugars, and step counts. The investigators will also see
      if they come in for lab tests when prompted by text message. Also, for patients overdue for
      medication refills, the investigators will ask them why they have not yet called for the
      refill.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will be sent text messages through a software interface, the Patient Relationship
      Manager (PRM). A registered nurse will also use PRM to receive incoming responses. Tasks will
      be created for her to outreach to patients who have out of range text responses or poor
      response rates. This intervention if a feasibility study to see if patients can communicate
      with the investigator's health care system and potentially utilize PRM to better manage their
      diabetes.
