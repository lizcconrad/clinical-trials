  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-based surveys will be conducted to evaluate the drivers of medication adherence in
      patients treated with either 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) therapy, alpha-blocker (AB)
      therapy, or combination therapy for enlarged prostate (EP). Adherence with EP therapy will be
      evaluated. The researchers believe that the majority of participants will report that they
      are compliant with therapy. The data source is a cross-sectional patient survey administered
      at one time point.

    <time_frame>Cross sectional survey administered once to each participant during a 17-month study period (May 2009 to September 2010)</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance was calculated based on the participant's response to the following question: &quot;In general, how many times did you miss taking your prostate medication?&quot; Responses were measured on a 5-point scale. Participants who answered &quot;I never miss a dose of my medication&quot; were considered compliant. All other responses were considered non-compliant.</description>
