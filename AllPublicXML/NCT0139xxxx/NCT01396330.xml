      Introduction Stress is part of the investigators daily life, and means to cope with it allow
      adaptation and survival. To this end, physiological pathways are activated, including
      neuroendocrine, cardiovascular and metabolic responses. In short term, the majority of
      consequences are beneficial, in the long run, however, chronic psychosocial stress may
      constitute an increased risk for coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and disability.

      Acute mental stress induces an exaggerated release of stress hormones e.g. catecholamine and
      cortisol which are thought not only to increase heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) but
      also to increase blood glucose levels. In clinical practice, patients and health care
      providers are often confronted with questions concerning psychological stress as a possible
      reason for glucose fluctuations. Whether stress itself or poor treatment adherence is
      responsible for the altered glucose control remains often controversial. Differences in the
      inter- and intraindividual response to stress have been suggested, but only a few small
      studies have addressed the effect of acute psychological stress on glucose control in
      patients with diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes may overestimate the effect of acute
      psychological stress on glucose control but further studies are clearly needed to definitely
      exclude or confirm a relevant effect of stress on the glucose control in diabetic patients.
      For example, effects of longer lasting or repetitive events of psychological stress on
      glucose concentrations still remain elusive. The aim of the present study was therefore to
      investigate the effect of prolonged psychological stress by means of repetitive safe driving
      training courses on glucose control in patients with diabetes.

      Patients and Methods Forty patients with type 1 or insulin-treated type 2 diabetes attending
      the outpatient-clinic of the Kantonsspital Frauenfeld or University Hospital of Zurich for
      regular visits are invited to participate. Included are patients on any oral glucose-lowering
      treatment and at least one daily injection of insulin, a valid driver license and written
      informed consent given. Exclusion criteria are diabetes duration &lt;2 years, pregnancy,
      unstable coronary artery disease, limited visual acuity or unstable proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy, uncontrolled hypertension (BP &gt;160/95mmHg) and pituitary or adrenal disease. The
      Ethics committee of the Kanton Thurgau approved the protocol and the study conform to the
      principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.

      Study protocol Each patient completes a control and a stress testing day which takes place
      consecutively in a randomized order. Randomization is performed by an uninvolved third
      person. The study is carried out at the driving training area of the Touring Club Switzerland
      at Hinwil. Patients are advised to have lunch before 12:00 a.m. and to abstain from food
      thenceforth. Drinking mineral water remains allowed during the entire study days, and the
      patients have to take their basal insulin and other medication as usual. Patients are advised
      to arrive at the driving training area between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. At arrival, a capillary
      glucose measurement is carried out, and glucose concentrations ≥10mmol/l are corrected with
      short-acting insulin analogues (glucose target 6 - 8mmol/l). Subsequently, no additional
      adjustment with insulin is allowed during the study. Glucose concentrations ≤4mmol/l are
      always corrected with administration of 10g carbohydrate (DextroEnergy® or orange juice). On
      both study days, patients ingest a standard meal at 4:45 p.m. (i.e. 15min before the driving
      training). Immediately after the meal, short-acting insulin is injected in knowledge of the
      carbohydrate content (same dose on both days) or oral antidiabetics are ingested as usual.
      Measurements of capillary and plasma glucose concentration, blood pressure, heart rate,
      stress perception and salivary cortisol concentration are carried out in regular intervals
      between 4 and 9 p.m. on both study days.

      On the control day, patients are placed in a quiet room and are permitted to read. They also
      have the possibility to leave the room and stay on a balcony.

      On the stress testing day, patients complete a driving training with their car between 5 and
      7 p.m. The driving training consists of 3 consecutive exercises: first, a slalom track on dry
      and wet asphalt, secondly, a full braking exercise with water obstacles. Thirdly, the car is
      hurled around by a mechanical plate and the patients has to regain control over it.
