      Growth hormone and gonadotropin deficiency after brain injury (traumatic brain injury,
      ischemic stroke, subarachnoidal hemorrhage): the effects of hormone replacement on cognition,
      quality of life and body composition Randomized, controlled, 3 arm (group 2: double-blind;
      groups 1 and 3: open), multi-center, pilot study (Phase II)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of growth-hormone replacement on
      cognition, quality of life, body mass index, body composition and reorganization of brain
      activity of hypopituitary patients in a stable, chronic phase after brain injury compared to
      control patients and the influence of testosterone replacement in gonadotropin deficient
      patients compared to placebo treated control patients.

    <description>Quality of Life (QoL) was measured with the following questionnaires prior to treatment and after treatment:
SF-12 short-form health questionnaire (12 items, score: min. 12/max. 47)
QoL-AGHDA Assessment of GHD in Adults (25 items: yes/no answers)
EQ-5 D Euroquol (5 items, scale per items from 1 (no problems) to 3 (severe problems); 1 Likert scale (0 worst-100 best) to measure health status)
BDI Beck Depression Inventory (21 items, score: min. 0/max. 63)
PSQI Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: (4 items regarding sleep duration, 11 items regarding sleep quality, 1 item regarding sleeping medication, 2 item regarding daytime dysfunction, 1 item regarding sleeping habit; 5 items for third-party assessment)
QOLIBRI Quality of Life after Brain Injury (37 items, scale per item from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much) QoL was measured with difference between mean scores of the respective questionnaires, determined before and after treatment.</description>
