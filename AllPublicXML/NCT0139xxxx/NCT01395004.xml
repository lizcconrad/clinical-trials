      LCH115397 was a phase 2a, open label, multicenter study testing 125 mg (starting dose) daily
      oral GSK2110183 in adult and adolescent patients with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis. The
      primary objectives of the study were efficacy (at 3 and 6 months) and safety. For the purpose
      of efficacy analysis, patients were stratified into two groups: treatment-naïve (Stratum 1)
      and refractory or reactivation disease (Stratum 2). Adolescent participation was limited to
      patients with refractory or reactivation disease (Stratum 2).

               -  Treatment-naïve stratum (defined as either no prior treatment or intolerant of
                  first-line treatment with cessation prior to first response evaluation): Age &gt;=
                  18 years old

          3. Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis
             requiring systemic treatment:

               -  SS-LCH with 'CNS-risk' or 'special site' lesions or 'risk organs' (Includes LCH
                  brain lesions or pituitary infiltration provided that disease is evaluable for
                  treatment response. Patients with isolated pulmonary disease should have recent
                  onset (within 3 years) or demonstrate evidence of active disease on PET or other
                  functional imaging. If isolated pulmonary disease without radiographic lesion,
                  then pulmonary function testing must demonstrate vital capacity &lt;80% predicted,
                  FEV1 &lt;80% predicted or DLCO, &lt;70% predicted, and condition is evaluable for
                  treatment response and could not be explained through a diagnosis of asthma.)

               -  SS-LCH with multifocal bone or skin disease

               -  MS-LCH with or without involvement of 'risk organs'

          4. Archival tumor available for central confirmation of LCH and biomarker analysis or
             willingness to undergo biopsy.

          5. If 18 years or older, performance status score of 0, 1, and 2 according to the Eastern
             Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. If age &gt;=12 and &lt;18, performance status score
             of &gt;50 according to the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scale.

          6. Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          7. Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential must have had a prior
             vasectomy or agree to use adequate contraception from the time of the first dose of
             study drug until three months after the last dose of study drug.

          8. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant)
                  defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or
                  hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
                  [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating
                  hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL (&lt;140 pmol/L) is
                  confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
                  status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods
                  defined in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least two to four
                  weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
                  interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
                  post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use
                  of a contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test during the screening
                  period, and agrees to use adequate contraception from screening until four weeks
                  after the last dose of study drug.

             Note: Oral contraceptives are not reliable due to potential drug-drug interaction.

          9. Adequate organ-systems function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within 28 days (or 42 days for prior
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to the first dose of study drug. Corticosteroids
             may be administered up to seven days prior to the first dose of study drug.
             Chemotherapy regimens given continuously or on a weekly basis with limited potential
             for delayed toxicity (in the medical opinion of the investigator) are permitted, if
             administered at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          2. Use of an investigational anti-cancer drug within 28 days or five half-lives,
             whichever is longer, preceding the first dose of GSK2110183.

          3. Current use of a prohibited medication or requires any of these medications during
             treatment with GSK2110183.

          4. Presence of active gastrointestinal disease or other condition that could affect
             gastrointestinal absorption (e.g. malabsorption syndrome) or predispose subject to
             gastrointestinal ulceration.

          5. Any major surgery within the last four weeks (excluding diagnostic biopsy).

          6. Unresolved toxicity (except alopecia) &gt;= Grade 2 from previous therapy, except where
             the Investigator considers that the ongoing toxicity will not introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          7. Fasting serum glucose &gt;126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L), or for known diabetic patients with
             stable disease, fasting serum glucose &gt;250 mg/dL (14 mmol/L) and Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 9%.

          8. Current use of oral corticosteroids, with the exception of stress dose hydrocortisone
             (20 mg BID). Inhaled steroids permitted if patient is currently on a stable
             dose/regimen. Topical steroids are permitted; however, they should not be used as
             concurrent treatment for LCH skin disease.

          9. Any serious or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric, or other condition
             (including lab abnormalities) that could interfere with subject safety or with
             obtaining informed consent.

         10. Evidence of LCH-related neurodegenerative disease if patient has CNS SS-LCH, however,
             subjects with CNS SS-LCH who were previously treated for CNS involvement, and are
             currently asymptomatic without anti-epileptic medications or steroids for at least two
             months are eligible.

         11. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases (e.g., unstable or uncompensated
             respiratory, hepatic, renal, or cardiac disease).

         12. Known infection with HIV, HBV or HCV.

         13. QTc interval &gt;= 470 msecs.

         14. History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable
             angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting or bypass grafting within the past six
             months.

         15. Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             functional classification system.

         16. Pregnant or lactating female.

         17. History of previous treatment with a small molecule AKT inhibitor (this does not
             include perifosine), PI3K inhibitors, or mTOR inhibitors.

         18. Other associated conditions which in the opinion of the investigator could
             significantly impair the ability to evaluate the impact of treatment on the clinical
             course of the disease.
