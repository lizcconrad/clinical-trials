      The primary study objective is to evaluate recurrence/metastasis free survival at 12 months
      with postoperative adjuvant treatment incorporating gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy
      followed by chemoradiation with gemcitabine followed by maintenance chemotherapy with
      gemcitabine.

    <description>The study consists of three phases; Induction chemotherapy phase:Starting 4~8 weeks after R0 resection of pancreatic cancer. Gemcitabine: 1200mg/㎡ (Day 1, 8), cisplatin 60mg/㎡ (Day 1) every 3 weeks for 2 cycles. Chemoradiotherapy phase: Starting 1-2 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy (within 5 weeks after D1 of 2nd cycle of induction chemotherapy), no later than 16 weeks after operation. Gemcitabine 300mg/㎡ weekly for 5 weeks throughout RT period. Radiotherapy: 50.4Gy at 1.8Gy/Fx, for 28 Fx (Field reduction at 45Gy) for 5.5 pweeks. Maintenance chemotherapy phase: Within 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotheray, no later than 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy Gemcitabine: 1200mg/㎡ (Day 1, 8) every 3 weeks, for 4 cycles</description>

          6. WBC at least 3,000/mm3 OR Absolute neutrophil count at least 1,500/mm3. Platelet count
             at least 100,000/mm3.

          7. Bilirubin less than 2.0 mg/dL, AST less than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN).

        Serum creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating woman.

          2. Woman of childbearing potential with either a positive or no pregnancy test at
             baseline.

          3. Woman of childbearing potential not using a reliable and appropriate contraceptive
             method (postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be

          5. Prior chemotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma.

          6. Radiotherapy incorporating radiation fields of more than 25% of active bone marrow.

          7. History of another malignancy within the last five years except cured basal cell
             carcinoma of skin and cured carcinoma in-situ of uterine cervix.
