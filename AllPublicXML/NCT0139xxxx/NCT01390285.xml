      Background

      Central sensitization has recently been documented in patients with knee osteoarthritis. So
      far, the presence of central sensitization has not been considered as a confounding factor in
      studies assessing the pain inhibitory effect of TENS on osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Purpose

      First, to explore the pain inhibitory effect of burst TENS in OAk patients. Second, to
      explore the prognostic value of central sensitization on the pain inhibitory effect of TENS
      in Oak patients.

      Methods

      Patients with knee pain due to OAk will be recruited through advertisements in local media.
      Temporal summation, before and after a heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation, will be
      measured. In addition, pain on a numeric rating score and WOMAC subscores for pain and
      function will be assessed. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups
      (TENS, sham TENS). Follow-up measurements will be scheduled after a period of 6 and 12 weeks.

      Discussion/ conclusion

      TENS influences pain through the electrical stimulation of low-threshold A-beta cutaneous
      fibers. The responsiveness of central pain-signaling neurons of OAk patients who are
      centrally sensitized may be augmented to the input of these electrical stimuli. This would
      encompass an adverse therapy effect of TENS. Therefore it might be interesting to identify a
      subgroup of symptomatic OAk patients, ie. non-sensitized patients, who are likely to benefit
      from burst TENS.
