  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will evaluate whether treatment with CRMD001 (unique formulations of the iron
      chelator, Deferiprone) will reduce morbidity and mortality in subjects with Chronic Kidney
      Disease (CKD) and additional risk factors. Adult subjects with moderate to severe CKD who are
      undergoing diagnostic or interventional coronary angiography will be randomized to either
      placebo or CRMD001 and followed for 90 days. Subjects will receive 8 days of randomized
      therapy starting 1-3 hours prior to angiography. The primary endpoint of the trial will be
      the difference in a composite of specified renal and cardiovascular clinical events occurring
      through Day 90.
