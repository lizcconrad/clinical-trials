      The purpose of this study is changing (improving), after initiating various doses of
      Paliperidone ER on schizophrenia patients.

      In this study, investigators are going to examine the effectiveness of Paliperidone ER on
      depressive symptoms toward schizophrenia patients who are previously unresponsive to other
      oral antipsychotics. In addition, the relationship between the change of depressive symptoms
      and adherence will be studied. Even though this study has a limitation of being designed as
      an open-labelled clinical study, it would be useful for clinicians because this study
      examines the influences toward adherence related to various factors and the changes of
      depressive symptoms related to switching to Paliperidone ER, which is well-proven medication.
