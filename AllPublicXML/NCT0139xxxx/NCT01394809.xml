  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The therapy results after distal radius fracture especially of elderly patients are often
      suboptimal. The central problem results from the inevitable, 3-6-weeks immobilization, which
      leads to reduction in ROM of the wrist, deterioration of muscle strength as well as
      malfunction of fine motor skills and coordination. Currently, there are no adequate proactive
      strategies to counteract these immobilisation problems. Hence the overall aim of our research
      project is to investigate the therapeutic potential of a motor-cognitive therapy on hand
      function after distal radius fracture. On the one hand the pilot study should provide
      information about the level of recruitment rate necessitated for an adequate sample size
      which allows reliable evidence for the therapy effects. On the other hand we want to evaluate
      the sensitivity and adequacy of the assessment instruments.

      The pilot is conceived as a controlled, randomised, longitudinal intervention study over 6
      weeks with 3 groups. One experimental group imagine movements and actions without executing
      them. A second experimental group performs mirror training, in which visual feedback through
      a mirror activates additionally the contralateral hemisphere. The control group receives
      therapy as usual. There are three key domains to be analysed: function (PRWE), impairment
      (ROM, strength) and participation in social life/life quality (DASH, EQ5D).

    <description>During motor imagery practice a person imagines performing a movement with all its sensory consequences without actually moving. In this study the therapists follow a motor imagery guideline designed for rehabilitation of movement performance. The guideline offers therapists structure and a strategy to deliver subject-specific imagery, and is based on principles of motor learning.</description>

    <description>Mirror therapy is thought to work by using vision of the intact or good arm to replace or drive proprioception in the affected arm, and so normalise the afferent segment of the movement process.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive therapy as usual. Currently, this means that patients are immobilized during first 3-4 weeks. The control group will receive additional relaxation training during this period to achieve the same total amount of time the therapist spends with the patients of the experimental groups.</description>
