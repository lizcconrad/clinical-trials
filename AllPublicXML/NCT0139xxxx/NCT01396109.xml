  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic Organ prolapse (a feeling of bulge in the vagina) may cause some distressing symptoms
      such as loss of control of the bowel or bladder, and may also cause problems with patient's
      sex life. The primary treatment is surgery, sometimes a mesh is placed in the pelvis to
      support the weakened tissues, but mesh implants can cause complications.

      This study is designed to determine the effectiveness and safety of GYNECARE PROSIMA* pelvic
      floor repair system compared with the modified total pelvic floor reconstructive surgery with
      mesh for the treatment of uterine prolapse.

      Patients enrolled into the study will be followed up for up to 3 years after surgery.
      Evaluation will take place during surgery and postoperative visit. Stage of prolapse before
      and after surgery, patient satisfaction through quality of life and sexual function
      questionnaires before and after surgery, and peri-operative complication rates will be
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem. The high rate of failure has led to an increasing
      use of synthetic grafts to augment vaginal repair procedures to obtain more durable results.
      In 2005, the investigators began to perform modified pelvic floor reconstruction surgery with
      mesh. The nation-wide multicenter prospective clinical trial data showed that it was safe,
      efficient and cost-effective. No severe intraoperative complications were recorded and the
      recurrence rate after 1 year follow-up was 8.1%. Quality of life improved significantly from
      the baseline, while the sexual function did not change.

      The GYNECARE PROSIMA* system is a new technique. It provides a simplified unanchored mesh
      repair, avoiding the need for dissection outside the pelvic cavity and avoids passage of
      suture and instruments through the obturator foramen and sacrospinous ligament, thus making
      surgery much simpler to perform and reduces the risk of the specific complications that can
      occur with suture placement or tunneling. 1-year anatomic and functional outcomes of
      international multicenter prospective study for POP-Q Stage I I-III pelvic organ prolapse
      showed the objective success rate was 76.9%, pelvic symptoms, quality of life, and sexual
      function improved significantly from baseline.

      In clinical practice, many women have symptomatic POP-Q Stage III uterine prolapse, which
      requires surgical correction. They are relatively young, and therefore care more about the
      long-term outcomes and quality of life after procedure. The purpose of this multicenter,
      prospective, and comparative study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these two
      procedures concomitantly performed with vaginal hysterectomy (TVH) in the treatment of
      symptomatic POP-Q Stage III uterine prolapse in China.
