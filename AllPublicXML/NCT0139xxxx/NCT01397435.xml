  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bone status in Gaucher disease is very difficult to monitor precisely in children. This
      is a major problem because lack of optimal treatment, especially enzyme replacement, may
      cause irreversible severe bone damage that will impact an affected person's life. Currently,
      there are qualitative (subjective) methods, such as Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI), to
      gauge the response to treatment. A quantitative (objective) measurement of Gaucher cell
      presence and activity in bone marrow could help with more precise and accurate monitoring of
      bone marrow disease in patients both treated and not (yet) being treated with enzyme
      replacement. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
      (MRS) as a quantitative assessment of bone marrow involvement in Children with Gaucher, and
      examine how this result correlates with semiquantitative MRI scales and overall disease
      severity.

  <detailed_description>

      To quantify the amount of fat in the bone marrow of affected subjects and healthy controls
      the investigators will use Single voxel short, echo time(TE) proton spectroscopy. This MR
      Spectroscopy (MRS) will be conducted in the vertebral body of L5 and in the neck of the
      femur.

      To assess the qualitative scores and compare it to the quantitative MR Spectroscopy (MRS)
      results the investigators will use a series of Fluid sensitive and Fat sensitive conventional
      MR sequences that will allows us to determine indirectly the degree of glucocerebrosidase
      infiltration.
