      Family resilience is an important strength to help family to manage life challenge
      successfully, and to reorganize family function. However, few studies have showed the
      trajectory of family resilience in adolescents with cancer over time. The purposes of this
      study are to know the trend of family resilience in adolescents with cancer from previous 3
      months to the first year of newly diagnosed, and to examine the relationships among family
      members' stress, family satisfaction, and family resilience in adolescents with cancer.

      The inclusion criteria of adolescents with cancer are: 1) 12-20 years of age, 2) newly
      diagnosed with cancer about 3 months, 3) willing and able to complete own report
      questionnaires. The study is designed as repeated measurement. Considering attrition rate may
      be more than 60%. Therefore, of necessity, the proposed sample size was set at 60 families.

      Data will be collected by a structured questionnaire (a demographic questionnaire and 4
      scales). The study consists of four times of data collection time point as follows:
      approximately 3 month (t1), 6 months (t2), 9 months (t3), and 12 months (t4) after the
      diagnosis of cancer in adolescents. Each participant may take 20-30 minutes to finish the
      structured questionnaire.
