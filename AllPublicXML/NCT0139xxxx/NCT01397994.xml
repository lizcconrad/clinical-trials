      nicorandil in patients of chronic stable angina.

    <textblock>
      Stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used for the diagnosis and risk
      assessment of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Also, MPI lends
      itself to monitoring the effects of therapeutic interventions such as anti-ischemic
      medications, gene therapy, and various percutaneous and surgical revascularization
      modalities.

      The effects of nitrates, potassium channel activators, calcium-channel blockers, and
      beta-blockers on myocardial perfusion imaging are likely attributable to changes in
      myocardial blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply-demand ratio. The major anti-ischemic
      effect of BBs is a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption both at rest and during stress.
      Beta-blockers decrease myocardial oxygen demand through a reduction in heart rate, blood
      pressure, and myocardial contractility. They also prolong diastole, therefore increasing
      coronary perfusion time. The effect of chronic atenolol use on dipyridamole SPECT MPI was
      assessed in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study that showed no difference in the
      perfusion defect size and severity between placebo and atenolol for the group as a whole,
      although one-third of patients had larger defects on atenolol than placebo. Bridges et al.,
      1992 (56)

      Nicorandil, a potassium channel activator, when given for 3 weeks exhibited significant
      improvement in myocardial perfusion in both MI and angina patients, on exercise thallium
      scan. Yamazaki et al., 1993 (69).

      Atenolol as shown in the cross over study does not affect myocardial perfusion significantly
      and hence combination therapy with nicorandil will help us to determine a significant benefit
      of nicorandil on MP. Results will be analyzed from base line in the same arm and the
      difference will be further compared with control arm.

      Guidelines suggest beta blockers as first line of therapy. To assess the anti ischemic
      effects of nicorandil, combination therapy with atenolol will be compared with atenolol
      alone. Since atenolol effect on MP is insignificant an added advantage of nicorandil can be
      evaluated in comparative study.

      Primary objective is to assess the anti ischemic effect of nicorandil.

      The primary endpoint is to compare the anti ischemic effect over 4 weeks period.

      Changes in perfusion will be evaluated in each arm at week 4 and comparison between the two
      study arms will be made to document the anti ischemic effects of nicorandil.

      Primary efficacy variables of the study are the difference of the following endpoints from
      the baseline at week 4 and comparison between control and study arm using Ex- SPECT MPI.

      Secondary efficacy variables of the study are the difference of the following endpoints from
      the baseline and comparison between control and study arm using ETT Bruce Protocol at week 4.

      Secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the anti anginal effect and safety of
      Nicorandil.

      This is an open label, randomized controlled pilot study. Sponsor of this study is Ferozsons
      Labs. Ltd. All participating patients must sign a written informed consent form.

      Eligible patients with proven CAD having at least one reversible or partially reversible
      myocardial perfusion defects on MPI SPECT - Tc-99m and functional class I &amp; II of CSA, and
      laboratory values within predefined safety limits will be recruited.

      Chief exclusion criteria include presence of only fixed perfusion defects, CSA functional
      class III and IV and prior revascularization.

      A total of 40 patients will be enrolled in the study, 20 patients in each arm). Patients will
      be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive beta blocker in combination with nicorandil
      (experiment arm) or beta blocker (control arm) for four weeks until unacceptable toxicity,
      withdrawal of consent, whichever comes first.

      Nicorandil dose will be titrated from 10mg bd for 7days to 20mg bd for next 3 weeks.
      Concurrent therapy for angina attacks will be allowed to be used with study medication.

      All patients will have treadmill exercise using Bruce protocol. At peak exercise, 10-15 mCi
      of technetium - 99m tetrofosmin is injected and patient will exercise an additional 1 to 2
      minutes.. Stress SPECT images will be acquired beginning 15 to 45 minutes after the
      completion of treadmill stress. At rest 30 mCi of technetium-99m tetrofosmin will be injected
      and SPECT images will be acquired using same protocol.

      Study monitoring at the centre will be provided by the sponsor
