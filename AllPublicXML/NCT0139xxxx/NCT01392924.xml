      Primary Objective:

      - To confirm safety and tolerability of global recommended phase three dose (RPTD) of
      SAR245408 tablets when administered on continuous once daily dosing (CDD) in patients with
      solid tumors.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of daily oral administration of SAR245408
           in CDD treatment schedule in patients with solid tumors.

        -  To gather preliminary efficacy data after repeated administration of SAR245408 in
           patients with solid tumors.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed solid tumor that is metastatic or
             unresectable, and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or
             are no longer effective, and there are no known therapies to prolong survival.

          -  Before any study-specific procedure, the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB)
             approved written informed consent must be obtained. Second informed consent must be
             obtained before the patient starts the Treatment Extension Period (Cycle 2 and after).

          -  Not recovered from all previous therapies (i.e. radiation, surgery, or medication)

          -  Currently receiving anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of warfarin (low-dose
             warfarin ≤ 1mg/day is permitted).

          -  Primary brain tumor or brain metastasis are considered eligible if the patient has not
             received radiation therapy for brain metastasis within 2 weeks of enrollment and has
             been on a stable dose of steroids for 2 or more weeks.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection (including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, toxoplasmosis, and hepatitis
             B and C), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, or cardiac
             arrhythmia.

          -  Known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situation(s) that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the SAR245408 formulation.

          -  Withdraws consent during the screening (starting from signed informed consent form
             (ICF))

          -  Patient who is judged by the investigator as not suitable for participating in the
