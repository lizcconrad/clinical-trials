      This pilot study will recruit patients admitted to the inpatient psychiatric unit at MGH for
      suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt. Inclusion criteria will be broad to increase
      enrollment rates and obtain information for patients with a wide range of diagnoses and
      illness severity. Enrolled subjects will complete randomly-selected positive psychology
      exercises daily (on weekdays) until discharge and will rate the exercises in multiple
      domains. Subjects' participation will be complete at the end of their admission or when all
      exercises have been completed, whichever comes first.

      Overall, our goal is to assess the acceptability and utility of eight possible positive
      psychology interventions related to gratitude, optimism, kindness, mindfulness, recollection,
      and forgiveness in suicidal inpatients.

      This is a single-arm study, completed with patients who have been admitted to the hospital
      for suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt. It is aimed at developing a positive psychology
      treatment aimed at suicidal patients. The study consists of serial completion of different
      positive psychology exercises, once daily, during admission, to get subjects' input on their
      feasibility and impact. This will allow us to work collaboratively to identify the specific
      exercises that best fit this population. Subjects' participation ends when they are
      discharged from the hospital. The investigators plan to enroll 30 subjects at MGH (and total)
      in this study.

    <description>At each session, the interventionalist will prepare the subject to complete a randomly-selected positive psychology exercise, lasting approximately 20 minutes, within the next 24 hours. He or she will describe the rationale for the exercise and the details of the exercise, and will answer any questions. A sheet with written instructions (matching the verbal instructions) for the exercise will be provided, with space for recording the exercise and an area to provide ratings on the exercise. On the following day, the interventionalist will review the prior day's exercise (and record whether it was completed). The exercises will be completed daily on weekdays for a maximum of 8 days.</description>
