  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a manualized and culturally sensitive intervention for adolescent
      girls targeting binge and loss of control (LOC) eating. The investigators will evaluate the
      feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a controlled pilot trial. The
      investigators hypothesize that this intervention will serve to reduce binge and LOC eating,
      as well as improve psychosocial functioning as evidenced by decreased depression, anxiety,
      eating disorder cognitions, and impulsivity, and improved quality of life.
