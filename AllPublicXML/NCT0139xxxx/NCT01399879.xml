  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Scanning Kelvin Probe measures surface electrical potential without actually touching the
      skin. This is a pilot study to evaluate methods of minimizing noise during Scanning Kelvin
      Probe measurements. This project will focus specifically on noise arising from physical
      movement and environmental electrical field.

    <description>This study focuses on the ability of the Kelvin Probe to measure skin electrical potential. Because it does so without touching the skin, it is prone to noise - specifically physical movement and surrounding electrical noise. The variability in surface electrical potential is a way to determine how stable the measurements are. It can be determined immediately after testing - and will be used in data analyses (comparing across study volunteers) approximately 24 weeks after testing is complete.</description>

    <description>The Faraday cage is a copper-mesh cage that surrounds the device and test site. It helps eliminate surrounding electrical noise. Movement stabilization will be achieved by placing a velcro strap over the arm to minimize random movements.</description>
