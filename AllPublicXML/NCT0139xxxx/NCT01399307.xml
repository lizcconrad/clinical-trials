  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human Adipose Tissue is considered as a new source for Stromal Stem Cells and offers a large
      therapeutic potential for many rare and common diseases that impacts millions of patients
      worldwide. The Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) of Adipose Tissue is relatively easy to
      extract with minimally invasive procedures such as elective liposuction in large quantities
      and therefore may be a cost effective source for cellular therapies in a wide range of
      medical specialties. In this study we aim to demonstrate the efficacy of Antria Cell
      Preparation Process© in obtaining human adipose derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) by
      performing histology, various cell counts, multiple surface marker tests and measurement of
      the residual amount of digestive enzymes as a safety measure for human clinical trials.
