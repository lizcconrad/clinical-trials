  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this integrated project targeting the Childhood Obesity Prevention Challenge Area
      is to reduce the prevalence of obesity among children attending Head Start in Michigan. The
      proposed intervention program is based on Social Cognitive theory and the premise that
      enhancing children's capacity for emotional and behavioral self-regulation is a key component
      of effective obesity prevention. A randomized controlled trial design is proposed to
      evaluate, among 600 Head Start children and their parents, the effectiveness of 2 approaches
      to obesity prevention: (1) the Parents of Preschoolers Prevention Series (POPS), a curriculum
      delivered to preschoolers and their parents focused on obesity-related health behaviors; and
      (2) POPS in combination with the Incredible Years Series (IYS), an evidence-based program
      designed to improve preschoolers' emotional and behavioral self-regulation. The research
      objective is to test the hypotheses that: (1) POPS, compared to Usual Head Start exposure,
      will lead to greater improvements in obesity-related health behaviors and adiposity indices;
      and (2) POPS + IYS will lead to the greatest improvements in obesity-related health behaviors
      and adiposity indices, and this effect will be mediated by improved self-regulation. The
      extension objective is to evaluate the feasibility, fidelity, and educational effectiveness
      of the POPS and POPS + IYS interventions, as delivered by paraprofessionals and educators
      within Extension and Head Start. The education objective is to provide Extension and Head
      Start staff non-formal training and educational curricula which can be widely disseminated.
      The long-term goal of this project is disseminate a novel and effective approach to obesity
      prevention in preschoolers.

    <measure>Change in Teacher-reported Self-regulation as Measured by the General Adaptation T-score From the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess self-regulation, teachers completed a modified 60-item version of the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation (SCBE) scale.The SCBE assesses emotional and behavioral regulation difficulties typically seen in the preschool setting. It includes both positive (competence) and negative (emotional or behavioral problems) items, including internalizing (ie, anxious, sad) and externalizing (ie, oppositional) behaviors, both of which are indicators of poor behavioral self-regulation. The General Adaptation T-score assesses child overall emotional and behavioral self-regulation in the classroom setting. It is calculated by taking the mean of all 60 items for the SCBE questionnaire (with reverse scoring for questions capturing problem behavior) and then determining the corresponding t-score based on published tables. Higher scores indicate better self-regulation. The range for General Adaptation T-score is 30-70.</description>

    <description>The POPS-Parent intervention consists of eight 60-90 minute lessons about preventing childhood obesity followed by four 10-minute reinforcing telephone contacts. Each lesson includes opportunities for parents to develop and practice skills, and a discussion of strategies to overcome challenges and problem-solving techniques, with an emphasis on building knowledge and self-efficacy.
The POPS-Child Intervention uses children's stories with embedded healthy nutrition themes. Five lessons (6 books) are delivered over 12 weeks. Activities include classroom cooking experiences, games/activities associated with the story's nutrition themes, and goal setting. &quot;Family Links&quot; and &quot;Parent Pages&quot; are sent home to reinforce content from school to home.</description>

    <description>The Parent component (BASIC) is a group-based program (12-14 weeks, 2 hours/week) focused on enhancing parenting skills such as using effective praise, incentives, and limit-setting, and handling misbehavior. Parents complete homework activities that will be reviewed in group sessions and receive follow-up reinforcement phone calls.
For the Child component (&quot;Dinosaur School&quot;), 60, 15-20 minute lessons are delivered during &quot;Circle Time&quot; in Head Start classrooms followed by small group activities. The curriculum focuses on teaching self-regulation skills, problem-solving strategies, and prosocial behaviors.
Teachers are trained in classroom management strategies.</description>

        <title>Change in Teacher-reported Self-regulation as Measured by the General Adaptation T-score From the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation Scale</title>
        <description>To assess self-regulation, teachers completed a modified 60-item version of the Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation (SCBE) scale.The SCBE assesses emotional and behavioral regulation difficulties typically seen in the preschool setting. It includes both positive (competence) and negative (emotional or behavioral problems) items, including internalizing (ie, anxious, sad) and externalizing (ie, oppositional) behaviors, both of which are indicators of poor behavioral self-regulation. The General Adaptation T-score assesses child overall emotional and behavioral self-regulation in the classroom setting. It is calculated by taking the mean of all 60 items for the SCBE questionnaire (with reverse scoring for questions capturing problem behavior) and then determining the corresponding t-score based on published tables. Higher scores indicate better self-regulation. The range for General Adaptation T-score is 30-70.</description>
