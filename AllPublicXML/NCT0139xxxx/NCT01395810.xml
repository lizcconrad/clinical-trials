    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe, Japan, North America and South Africa. The aim is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of nonacog beta pegol (NNC-0156-0000-0009) after long-term
      exposure in patients with haemophilia B.

      This trial is an extension to trials NN7999-3747 (NCT01333111/paradigm™ 2) and NN7999-3773
      (NCT01386528/paradigm™ 3).

    <measure>Incidence of Inhibitory Antibodies Against FIX Defined as Titre Above or Equal to 0.6 BU (Bethesda Units)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint was incidence of inhibitors against coagulation factor nine (FIX) defined as titre
≥0.6 Bethesda unit (BU). Number of subjects who developed inhibitors against FIX are reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Haemostatic Effect of Nonacog Beta Pegol When Used for Treatment of Bleeding Episodes, Assessed as Success/Failure Based on a Four-point Scale for Haemostatic Response (Excellent, Good, Moderate, Poor)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The haemostatic effect was evaluated by a four-point scale where an &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot; outcome translated into a successful treatment, and a &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; outcome was considered a treatment failure. The values mentioned below do not include bleeds with missing response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Bleeding Episodes During Routine Prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Annualized bleeding rate is the total number of bleeding episodes/total exposure time. It is analysed by a Poisson regression model with dose as a factor allowing for over-dispersion and using treatment duration as an offset. Median annualized bleeding rate is the median of individual annualized bleeding rates. Numbers are based on the treatment arm at the time of each bleed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FIX Trough Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>During the trial, the pre-dose FIX levels was measured with the one-stage clotting assay. Measurements taken at least 5 days and no more than 10 days after last dose as well as at least 14 days after last bleeding episode were included in this analysis. The mean FIX trough levels were estimated based on the mixed effects model on the log-transformed plasma concentration with subject as a random effect. The mean FIX trough level was presented back-transformed to the natural scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were summarized by frequency of events and frequency of patients with any event. Incidence of AEs was expressed as number of AEs per subject years of exposure (total number of events /total time in trial).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were summarized by frequency of events and frequency of patients with any event. Incidence of serious AEs was expressed as number of serious AEs per subject years of exposure (total number of events /total time in trial).</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 41 sites in 15 countries as follows: France: 1 site; Germany: 3 sites; Italy: 2 sites; Japan: 4 sites; Macedonia: 2 sites; Malaysia: 1 site; Netherlands: 1 site; Romania: 1 site, Russia: 1 site; South Africa: 1 site; Taiwan: 1 site, Thailand: 2 sites; Turkey: 3 sites; United Kingdom: 5 sites; United States: 13 sites</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 71 unique subjects were dosed during this trial. During the trial, subjects were free to switch between treatment arms if agreed between the investigator and the subject. Subjects who switched arms were represented in multiple arms.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Prophylaxis 10 IU/kg</title>
          <description>Subjects were given 10 IU/kg weekly nonacog beta pegol. Subjects were free to switch between treatment arms if agreed between the investigator and the subject. Administration of the appropriate volume of nonacog beta pegol was given as an intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection. The maximum injection rate was 4 mL/min. Subjects on prophylaxis who experienced a bleeding episode were to treat the bleeding episode with a single dose of 40 IU/kg, unless the bleeding episode was severe in which case it was to be treated with 80 IU/kg.</description>

          <description>Subjects were dosed with 80 IU/kg every second week. Subjects were free to switch between treatment arms if agreed between the investigator and the subject. Administration of the appropriate volume of nonacog beta pegol was given as an i.v. bolus injection. The maximum injection rate was 4 mL/min. Subjects on prophylaxis who experienced a bleeding episode were to treat the bleeding episode with a single dose of 40 IU/kg, unless the bleeding episode was severe in which case it was to be treated with 80 IU/kg.</description>

          <title>On-demand</title>
          <description>Subjects in the on-demand group were administered with the single dose of 40 IU/kg of nonacog beta pegol. The recommended dose for treatment of a mild or moderate bleeding episode, for example a joint bleed, was a single dose of 40 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol. If there was no observed effect of 40 IU/kg, the investigator was to be contacted prior to administration of the second dose of 40 IU/kg. The recommended dose for severe bleeds was 80 IU/kg nonacog beta pegol. Subjects were free to switch between treatment arms if agreed between the investigator and the subject.</description>

Measurements taken at least 5 days and no more than 10 days after last dose as well as at least 14 days after last bleeding episode were included in this analysis. The mean FIX trough levels were estimated based on the mixed effects model on the log-transformed plasma concentration with subject as a random effect.

            <description>Subjects were given 40 IU/kg weekly nonacog beta pegol. Subjects were free to switch between treatment arms if agreed between the investigator and the subject. Administration of the appropriate volume of nonacog beta pegol was given as an i.v. bolus injection. The maximum injection rate was 4 mL/min. Subjects on prophylaxis who experienced a bleeding episode were to treat the bleeding episode with a single dose of 40 IU/kg, unless the bleeding episode was severe in which case it was to be treated with 80 IU/kg.</description>

          <title>FIX Trough Levels</title>
          <description>During the trial, the pre-dose FIX levels was measured with the one-stage clotting assay. Measurements taken at least 5 days and no more than 10 days after last dose as well as at least 14 days after last bleeding episode were included in this analysis. The mean FIX trough levels were estimated based on the mixed effects model on the log-transformed plasma concentration with subject as a random effect. The mean FIX trough level was presented back-transformed to the natural scale.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set consisted of all subjects exposed to nonacog beta pegol. This endpoint was analysed only for the prophylaxis arms (i.e.,10 IU/kg, 40 IU/kg). No pre-dose measurements were collected for patients on 80 IU/kg every second week prophylaxis.</population>
