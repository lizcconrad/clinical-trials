      Assessment of the performance of the Salt Lake mask system acting as a patient interface in
      the provision of PAP therapy. This study will assess the suitability of this mask system in
      its current form for use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a significant direct cause of morbidity and mortality, as
      well as being a significant indirect cause of morbidity and mortality impacting greatly upon
      health and quality of life when left untreated. Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) therapy is an
      effective and proven form of medical treatment for many types of SDB.

      In order for PAP therapy to be effective, patient interfaces(masks) need to be both effective
      in their delivery of this treatment and accepted by prospective and current patients for use.
      This study will investigate the ability of the Salt Lake mask system to act effectively as a
      patient interface in PAP therapy, and its ability to be accepted by patients.
