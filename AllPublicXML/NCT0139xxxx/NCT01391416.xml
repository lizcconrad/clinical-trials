    <textblock>
      It is well recognized that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk
      for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hyperhomocysteinemia appears to be a predictor of future
      CVD events. Hyperhomocysteinemia has been reported to bo of high prevalence in patients with
      CKD. The investigators aim to study the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in Thai CKD
      patients by using Thai Screening and Early Evaluation of Kidney Disease (SEEK) study database
      and their relationship to CVD.

      Ninety eight subjects were sampling from Thai SEEK study database Traditional Traditional
      risk factors of CVD such as total cholesterol, triglyceride, age, sex, history of smoking and
      blood pressure levels were examined and recorded. Stored sera of these subjects were analyzed
      for the total homocysteine (tHcy) level. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the
      different of mean tHcy among groups

        Ninety eight subjects from CKD stages 3-4 were randomly sampling from Thai- SEEK study
        database. Thai-SEEK study is a community-based cross-sectional survey that was conducted
        between August 2007-june 2008 in four regions of Thailand (i.e Northern, Northeastern,
        Central and Southern) and Bangkok (Metropolitan).
