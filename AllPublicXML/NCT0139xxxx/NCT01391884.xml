  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing rapidly worldwide. T2D is characterized
      by a severely impaired incretin effect. The incretin effect refers to the insulinotropic
      action of the nutrient-released incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and
      glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). The incretin effect is defined as the
      difference in insulin secretory responses between oral and isoglycaemic intravenous glucose
      challenges (OGTT and IIGI, respectively) and in healthy individuals it accounts for as much
      as 70% of the insulin response following oral glucose, whereas patients with T2D exhibit an
      incretin effect in the range of 0 to 30%. Patients with T2D and non-diabetic patients with
      severe kidney failure share several pathophysiological characteristics, including decreased
      insulin sensitivity, fasting hyperinsulinaemia and impaired beta-cell function. The reason
      for these findings remains to be fully elucidated. An ongoing study in our research group is
      investigating the incretin effect and the incretin hormone secretory responses following
      OGTT, IIGI and meal ingestion, respectively. In continuation of this study, essential
      knowledge of metabolism of incretin hormones in an uremic milieu will be obtained in the
      present study prior to evaluation of the use of incretin-based agents in patients with
      impaired kidney function. In this second study we evaluate the elimination and biodegradation
      of GLP-1 and GIP. The biological active incretin hormones are rapidly degraded by the
      ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), generating inactive metabolites. The active
      hormones are however also eliminated by renal clearance, although the importance of this
      remains questionable. It is likely that the degradation and elimination of the active
      hormones will be significantly affected in patients with severe kidney impairment.

      We hypothesize that elimination and biodegradation of the two incretin hormones, both in itÂ´s
      active and inactive forms, will be affected in non-diabetic patients with severe kidney
      failure.
