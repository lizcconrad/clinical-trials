      The purpose of this study is to investigate the risk factor, molecular character and
      susceptibility change for recurrent ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. To characterize the genotypes of the pathogens isolated from recurrent ESBL-EK
           bacteremia versus non-recurrent ESBL-EK bacteremia to differentiate relapse from
           reinfection

             -  recurrent versus non-recurrent

             -  relapse versus reinfection

        2. To correlate the patient characteristics, clinical manifestations, severity of illness
           (the modified Pitt bacteremia score), diagnosis of deep-site infection, co-morbid
           conditions (including diabetes mellitus, hepatic and renal dysfunction), length of stay
           in ICU/hospitalization, the presence of invasive procedures, source of pathogen
           (community acquired or nosocomial infection), antimicrobial regimen (i.e carbapenems
           versus non-carbapenems(flomoxef or quinolones), microbiological characteristics (E coli
           and Kleb. pneumoniae) and outcome endpoints (clinical outcome and mortality) with ESBL
           recurrence and genotypes
