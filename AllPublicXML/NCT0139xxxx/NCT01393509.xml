      NOTE: This study is now recruiting only patients with Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN).
      Dose escalation has been completed.

      The purpose of this study is to test a new drug, called PU-H71 for the first time in humans,
      to find out what effects, good or bad, this new drug has on the patient and the cancer at
      different dose levels. PU-H71 blocks a protein called Heat Shock Protein-90 (Hsp90). Hsp90 is
      found in both normal and cancer cells, but may be more important in cancer cells. Attacking
      Hsp90 can stop the function of certain proteins that are needed for cancer cells to survive.
      The diseases that are part of this study may be especially sensitive to attacking Hsp90, and
      the investigators have seen signs of disease control in patients with MPN. This study is
      currently enrolling a cohort expansion for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).

    <description>PU-H71 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour two times a week on a 2 week on and 1 week off (Q21 day) schedule with a starting dose of 10 mg/m2. A Cycle on study will be defined as 21 days. The same schedule of administration will be used for all patients in this Phase I trial, and a MCRM (modified continual reassessment method)design will be employed. The MPN expansion may explore different dosing schedules.</description>
