    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be between age 45 and 80 years of age

          3. ECOG is ≤2

          4. Screening serum total testosterone ≥150 ng/dL

          5. Have prostate cancer, confirmed by pathology report

          6. Have not been treated with ADT (chemical or surgical). If a subject has been treated
             with LHRHa for ≤6 months duration and that treatment was ≥1 years prior to the
             screening, the subject may be considered for the study.

          7. Have a clinical indication for the initiation ADT.

          8. Give written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

          9. Subjects must agree to use acceptable methods of contraception:

               -  If their female partners are pregnant or lactating acceptable methods of
                  contraception from the time of the first administration of study medication until
                  3 months following administration of the last dose of study medication must be
                  used. Acceptable methods are: Condom used with spermicidal
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. If the subject has undergone surgical
                  sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azospermia) a condom with
                  spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository should be used.

               -  If the male subject's partner could become pregnant, use acceptable methods of
                  contraception from the time of the first administration of study medication until
                  3 months following administration of the last dose of study medication.
                  Acceptable methods of contraception are as follows: Condom with spermicidal
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository [i.e. double barrier method of contraception],
                  surgical sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azospermia) and a double
                  barrier method (condom used with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository),
                  the female partner uses oral contraceptives (combination estrogen/progesterone
                  pills), injectable progesterone or subdermal implants and a double barrier method
                  (condom used with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).

               -  If the female partner has undergone documented tubal ligation (female
                  sterilization), a double barrier method (condom used with spermicidal
                  foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) should also be used.

               -  If the female partner has undergone documented placement of an intrauterine
                  device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), a double barrier method (condom with
                  spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) should also be used.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity or allergy to estrogen or estrogen like drugs

          2. Have, in the judgment of the Investigator, a clinically significant concurrent illness
             or psychological, familial, sociological, geographical or other concomitant condition
             that would not permit adequate follow-up and compliance with the study protocol

          3. History of abnormal blood clotting, Factor V Leiden clotting disorder, thrombotic
             disease (venous or arterial thrombotic events such as history of myocardial infarct
             (MI), stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and/or pulmonary embolus (PE)) NOTE: if
             there is evidence of an MI on the ECG that is not documented in the medical history or
             there is a history of MI greater than three years ago that has completely resolved,
             the eligibility of this subject per this exclusion criterion is an investigator
             decision and may require a consultation with a cardiologist.

          4. Have ALT or AST above 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          5. Have alkaline phosphatase greater than 3 times ULN and/or total bilirubin levels above
             2 mg/dL at baseline

          6. Patients cannot have brain or spinal cord metastases

          7. Patients cannot have or be at high risk for spinal cord compression from bone
             metastases.

          8. Received an investigational drug within a period of 90 days prior to enrollment in the
             study

          9. Received the study medication previously

         10. Currently taking testosterone, testosterone-like agents or antiandrogens, including
             5-alpha reductase inhibitors (the subject may be considered for randomization after a
             4 week washout period prior to randomization)

         11. Currently taking Saw Palmetto or PC-SPES (the subject may be considered for
             randomization after a 4 week washout period prior to randomization)

         12. Have taken diethylstilbestrol or other estrogen products within the previous 12 months
             prior to randomization into this study

         13. Have taken body building or fertility supplements within 4 weeks of admission into the
             study (steroids and steroid like supplements)

         14. Have a history of cancer other than prostate cancer, superficial bladder cancer (with
             no recurrence in the last 5 years) and/or non-melanoma carcinoma of the skin.

         15. QTcB &gt;480 msec, If the first QTcB reading exceeds 480 msec two additional ECGs are to
             be performed separated at least 5 min apart, then take the average of the three QTcB
             readings to determine if the subject satisfies the above criteria. If the average QTcB
             reading is &gt; 480 msec then the subject is excluded.
