  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study. In patients with node-negative invasive breast cancer or carcinoma
      in situ treated by breast conserving surgery, postoperative whole breast irradiation with
      inversely intensity modulated radiotherapy and a simultaneous integrated boost is technically
      feasible. The aim of this study is to evaluate the radiation toxicity, cosmetic outcome and
      local control rate in a single center

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score﹤2

          -  All patients aged &gt;18 years and &lt; 70 years after breast conserving surgery.

          -  On histological examination, the tumor must be DCIS or invasive adenocarcinoma of the
             breast.

          -  Negative nodal status determined by sentinel node biopsy, or axillary dissection.
             Axillary staging is not required for patients with DCIS

          -  No evidence of distant metastasis

          -  Gross disease may be unifocal or multifocal with pathologic (invasive and/or DCIS)
             tumor size excised with negative margins（＞2mm）

          -  Surgical treatment of the breast must have been lumpectomy. Re-excision of surgical
             margins is permitted.

          -  The patient must consent to be in the study and must have signed an approved consent
             form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score≧2

          -  Presence of extensive intraductal component (ductal carcinoma in situ occupying &gt; 25%
             of the primary invasive tumour and present adjacent to the primary tumour).Suspicious
             microcalcifications, densities, or palpable abnormalities (in the ipsilateral or
             contralateral breast) unless biopsied and found to be benign.

          -  Proven multicentric carcinoma (invasive cancer or DCIS) in more than one quadrant of
             separated.

          -  Metastatic disease (M1)

          -  Pregnancy or lactating

          -  Surgical margins that cannot be microscopically assessed or are positive at pathologic
             evaluation.

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders that preclude obtaining informed consent or
             adherence to protocol.

          -  Collagen vascular disease, specifically dermatomyositis with a CPK level above normal
             or with an active skin rash, systemic lupus erythematosis, or scleroderma.

          -  Prior breast or thoracic RT for any condition.

          -  Previous or concomitant malignancies except non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix, and invasive carcinoma of the colon, thyroid, cervix, or
             endometrium treated five years prior to study entry.

          -  Synchronous chemotherapy or target therapy is not permitted.

          -  Refusal of the patients to be included in the study
