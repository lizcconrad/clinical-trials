  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive free radical formation and depletion of the brain's primary antioxidant,
      glutathione, are established components of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathophysiology. While
      there is rationale for the therapeutic use of reduced glutathione (GSH) in PD, and even some
      preliminary evidence to suggest the use of GSH can lead to symptomatic improvement, obstacles
      surrounding currently employed delivery methods have hindered the clinical utility of this
      therapy. Intranasal GSH, (in)GSH, is a novel method of delivery for this popular CAM therapy
      in patients with PD, and bypasses the obstacles associated with other delivery methods. It
      has been used in clinical practice since 2005. The aim of this study is to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, and preliminary absorption data of (in)GSH in volunteers with PD in a Phase I
      single ascending dose escalation study.

      Individuals will be randomized to one of three treatment (100 mg GSH/ ml, 200 mg GSH/ ml, or
      placebo) arms in a double-blind fashion. All study medication will be administered 1 ml three
      times daily for three months, with a one-month wash out.

    <description>1a. Laboratory monitoring for adverse events will include CBC, ALT, AST, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, and urinalysis. Data will be collected throughout the 12-week intervention and at 1-mo following cessation of the study medication.
1b. Clinical adverse events will be measured using a daily patient diary and record score cards specifically screening for sinus irritation. Monitoring of Side Effects System (MOSES) will be used to screen for systemic and generalized adverse events.
1c. Effect on PD symptoms will be measured by the UPDRS to screen for accelerated disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Determination of Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to keep a daily log and unused study medication will be measured at each clinical visit. Tolerability will be measured by frequency and severity of reported adverse events and withdrawal from study. The goal will be to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which will be defined as the highest dose achieving adherence, as defined as 80% of the group taking the prescribed dose 80% of the time.</description>
