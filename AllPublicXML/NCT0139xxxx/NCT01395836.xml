  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One common occurrence following open heart surgery is an irregular rhythm from the top
      chambers of the heart known as atrial fibrillation (afib or AF). It is known that about 30%
      of patients who have had bypass surgery without having a heart valve replaced at the same
      time will develop AF. It is felt that this occurrence leads to factors that will affect a
      subjects health for the rest of their life. In studying this the investigators will see if
      post operative afib is an indicator of a person having afib and is not a condition that may
      only last during the post op recovery period as many physicians feel.The problem in question
      is, is post operative afib only transient or is it an indicator for more long term episodes
      of afib that may lead to other health concerns like stroke. Fifty subjects will be asked to
      participate. There will be to groups of 25 subjects. All subjects will have a device
      implanted under the skin that will be able to detect all types of heart rhythms. One group
      will get standard treatment and the physicians will be blinded to the recordings. The other
      group will be treated by the recording and the information about the amount of time in afib.
      The purpose of the study is to determine what the true occurrence of afib is for the first
      year after open heart surgery and to see if knowing this will alter the clinical management
      of this group of subjects.Currently most subjects are treated without knowing this
      information and based on that the arrhythmia will no longer happen after the heart is healed
      or recovered from the surgery. Most medications for controlling the heart rate and rhythm are
      stopped around 3 months. There is also a tendency to not to use blood thinning medications
      for the prevention of stroke after this time period. Stroke is one of the major complications
      from afib. Not all subjects are aware of the irregular heart beats so you can not depend on
      them to accurately know. They might feel episodes of very fast beating episodes or may become
      weak and fatigued. Weakness and fatigue are also normal during the first parts of recover
      from bypass surgery. By documenting the true episodes of afib the investigators can better
      understand if postoperative afib might need to be treated as a life long issue rather than a
      transient post operative issue. This treatment might change clinical management and decrease
      mortality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is able and willing to sign and date the Patient Consent Form.

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subject is expected to remain available for at least 12 months of follow- up visits.

          -  Subject is willing to comply with the protocol, including follow-up visits, medication
             compliance, carelink transmissions, and randomization assignment.

             discharge from a CABG procedure.

          -  Subject has no previous history of AF and has developed new-onset postoperative atrial
             fibrillation according to the established STS definition, which defines it as the
             occurrence of POAF or atrial flutter requiring treatment (i.e. beta-blockers,
             calcium-channel blockers, amiodarone, anticoagulation, or cardioversion).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a medically documented history of paroxysmal or persistent atrial
             fibrillation or atrial flutter.

          -  Subject is pregnant.

          -  Subject is enrolled or planning to participate in a concurrent drug and/or device
             study during the course of this study that would confound study results as determined
             by the study physician.

          -  Subject has previously or is scheduled to undergo valve repair or valve replacement
             during the course of the study.
