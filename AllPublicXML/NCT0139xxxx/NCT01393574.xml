      The study hypothesis is that some children with Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder
      (ADHD) who also have sleep onset difficulties will improve with Melatonin treatment to an
      extent similar to that of stimulants treatment.

      In order to check this hypothesis children with a new ADHD diagnosis who also have sleep
      difficulties will be treated with either Melatonin or with stimulants (Methylphenidate) for
      one month. The main outcome will be improvement of the ADHD symptoms.
