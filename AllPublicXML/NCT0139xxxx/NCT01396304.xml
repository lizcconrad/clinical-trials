  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcium alginate dressings with silver have been found to be safe and effective for use for
      leg ulcers. The primary objective is to compare Restore Calcium Alginate Dressing, Silver to
      AqualCel Ag Dressing on the following parameters: No further progression toward infection
      (bioburden), ease of application and removal, and percent progression to closure. The
      secondary objective is to obtain photographic documentation of the leg ulcers during the
      course of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is 18 years or older; male or female.

          2. Previous diagnosis of venous insufficiency proven by a positive venous duplex with
             reflux.

          3. Has a venous ulcer with a wound area between 5 cm2 - 40 cm2.

          4. Has an ankle brachial index (ABI) &gt;0.8.

          5. Has a venous ulcer with duration less than 24 months.

          6. Has a venous ulcer which is critically colonized (not infected) based on the Lazareth
             Study Model. Ulcers are considered to be critically colonized if at least three of the
             five following signs are present:

             Severe spontaneous pain between two dressing changes,Perilesional erythema,Local
             edema,Malodour,Heavy Exudation

          7. Is currently using Profore as their standard of care.

          8. Has not received antibiotics for 6 weeks prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Has an allergy to one of the components of the dressings (calcium alginate,
             hydrocolloid [carboxymethylceullose], silver).

          2. Is currently on antibiotics.

          3. Has a negative venous duplex.

          4. Is unable to tolerate 4 layer compression.

          5. Is unable to continue contact with the investigator for a period of at least two
             weeks.

          6. Is unwilling or unable to comply with the study protocol.
