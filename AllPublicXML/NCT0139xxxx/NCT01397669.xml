      To compare the immunophenotyping and immunochemistry in the gut mucosa of HIV negative and
      non-acute HIV-infected adults

        1. To compare the immunophenotyping of the gut mucosa to that of the peripheral blood in
           HIV negative and in non-acute HIV-infected subjects

        2. To compare the immunophenotyping of the peripheral blood in HIV negative and non-acute
           HIV-infected adults to the findings from acutely HIV-infected subjects in the
           WRAIR#1494/RV254/ SEARCH 010 study

        3. To compare immunologic markers in the genital compartment compared to the peripheral
           blood in HIV negative and non-acute HIV-infected adults to the findings from acutely
           HIV-infected subjects in the WRAIR#1494/RV254/ SEARCH 010 study

        4. Archive samples for immunologic and virologic testing

      This study will provide control samples for immunologic and virologic investigations from HIV
      negative and non-acute HIV-infected subjects to compare to subjects with acute HIV infection
      in WRAIR#1494/RV254/SEARCH 010 study. These control samples will allow for correct scientific
      interpretation of the immunologic changes seen in acute HIV infection in the peripheral
      blood, gut and genital compartments.

      Subjects will be recruited at the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic (TRCAC) and Chulalongkorn
      University Hospital. Eligible subjects will undergo a one-time flexible sigmoidoscopy and
      biopsy at Chulalongkorn University Hospital. They will have a total of approximately 60 ml of
      blood draw for immunophenotyping and storage. Genital secretion will be collected in subjects
      who agree to this optional procedure.

      It will take approximately 12 months to complete the study. Each subject will have two
      visits: the screening visit and the enrollment visit (within 15 days of screening visit).
      Subjects may also be co-enrolled in other study protocols provided blood volumes are within
      acceptable limits.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 to 50 years old

          2. HIV negative subjects must have negative results by 4th generation EIA and NAT
             (Aptima)

          3. HIV positive subjects must have a positive 4th generation EIA and a positive less
             sensitive EIA.

          4. Understand the study and sign informed consent form. Persons who cannot read will have
             the consent form read to them by a study staff and they can give informed consent by
             using thumb print.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have gastrointestinal disorders or gastrointestinal symptoms that require endoscopy
             for diagnostic purposes or have systemic disorders, which include but may not be
             limited to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
             erythematosus or psoriasis, that in the judgment of investigators could cause colon
             mucosa to be abnormal on biopsy

          2. Active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection (OI) within 30 days prior to entry for
             HIV-positive subjects. Subjects must be off all acute treatments for OI for at least
             14 days prior to entry. Subjects on maintenance or prophylactic therapy for
             AIDS-related OIs will be eligible.

          3. Have platelet count &lt; 150,000 count/ml or PT, PT/PTT &gt; the upper limit of normal (ULN)
             or INR &gt; 1.1

          4. Have self-reported bleeding disorder

          5. Positive urine pregnancy test

          6. Persons who have a history of a medical or psychiatric disorder by investigator's
             interview and physical examination according to standard practices, that in the
             judgment of the investigator(s), would interfere with or serve as a contraindication
             to adherence to the study protocol or ability to give informed consent.
