      The purpose of this study is to assess the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of
      alogliptin after a single or multiple administrations, once daily (QD), of oral alogliptin in
      healthy Korean subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alogliptin is a selective, orally available inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 being
      developed by Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center, Inc. as a treatment for type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) prolongs the action of 2
      important incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent
      insulinotropic peptide (GIP). These hormones are responsible for increasing insulin
      synthesis, regulating β-cell proliferation, inhibiting gastric emptying and inhibiting
      glucagon secretion.

      Evaluations of alogliptin and its clinical efficacy have been conducted in multiple countries
      including the United States and Japan. As development of alogliptin expands to other
      countries, additional studies are needed to bridge between the data previously acquired.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      alogliptin in healthy Korean participants.

         16. The participant has poor peripheral venous access.

             plasmapheresis), or had a transfusion of any blood product within 30 days prior to Day
             1.

         18. Participant has a Screening or Check-in (Day -1) abnormal (clinically significant)
             electrocardiogram (ECG). Entry of any participant with an abnormal (not clinically
             significant) ECG must be approved, and documented by signature by the principal
             investigator.

         19. Participant has abnormal Screening or Day -1 laboratory values that suggest a
             clinically significant underlying disease or participant with the following lab
             abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             &gt;2x the upper limits of normal.

         20. Participant has a hemoglobin value &lt;12 g/dL at Screening only.

         21. Participant has a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or has a diastolic blood pressure
             ≥90 mm Hg at Screening or Check-in (Day -1).
