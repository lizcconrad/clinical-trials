  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to show the safety and efficacy of the SeQuent® Please (Drug Eluting
      Balloon or DEB) vs. commonly used Drug Eluting Stents in the treatment of small vessel
      disease and side branches by pressure wire guided percutaneous coronary intervention.

      This study is a randomized, prospective, multi-center, efficacy study with a DES control
      group assessing the 6-month loss in FFR in patients treated with the &quot;matrix coated
      paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon catheter&quot; SeQuent® Please and commonly used DES for small
      vessel de novo and side branch lesions. 100 patients will be studied in total with two
      equivalent treatment groups DEB &amp; DES of 50 patients each.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients of at least 18 years of age.

          -  Patients with stable angina pectoris (CCS class 1-3) or with unstable angina pectoris
             (Braunwald class 1-2, A-C) or documented ischemia or with documented silent ischemia

          -  Patients must agree to undergo the angiographic 6-month and clinical follow-ups at 12
             and 36 months.

          -  De novo coronary lesions including side branches in native coronary arteries
             (reference vessel between ≥ 2.0 and ≤ 3.0 mm, lesion length ≤ 25 mm as
             angiographically documented)

          -  Diameter stenosis pre procedure must be either ≥ 70 % or ≥ 50 % if ischemia
             corresponding to the target lesion is documented either by exercise stress ECG, stress
             echocardiography, scintigraphy, MRT, or suspected based on angina pectoris.
