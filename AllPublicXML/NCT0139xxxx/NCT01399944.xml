      This single-site, within-subject, experimental study is designed to test the hypothesis that
      individuals express taste receptors differently and have different sensitivities to bitter
      taste samples, which results from uneven expression. Subjects will include 100 racially and
      ethnically diverse, healthy adults. All subjects will provide saliva samples for genetic
      analysis and undergo taste testing with common psychophysical stimuli. From the pool of 100
      subjects, 36 subjects from the common heterozygous group (PAV/AVI) and two from each
      homozygous group (AVI/AVI, nontaster and PAV/PAV, taster) will be invited to return for two
      additional sessions. During both sessions the investigators will 1) measure bitterness
      thresholds for PROP, a common psychophysical stimulus; 2) measure bitterness perception of
      several vegetables; 3) obtain a saliva sample and 4) collect taste papillae. The
      investigators will then isolate DNA and RNA from the taste papillae and isolate DNA from
      saliva to evaluate molecular differences over time and between individuals and how it relates
      to taste psychophysics. All psychophysical and cellular measurements will be done during both
      sessions so that the investigators can determine how much variation is observed over a
      one-week time period in both cellular phenotype and psychophysical phenotype.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Adults of all races and both genders (N=100) will be involved in the proposed research.
        Typically, our population of subjects is approximately 45% African American, 45% Caucasian,
        6% Hispanic, and 4% Asian. This increased representation of under-represented minorities in
        our subject populations is reflective of the greater Philadelphia region and has been
        achieved, in part, through our outreach efforts advertising in local newspapers throughout
        the city.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Key inclusion criteria include age 18-40 years; English speaking, and good health at
             the time of study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Key exclusion criteria include cigarette smoking, which alters taste perception, oral
             disease and subjects undergoing Coumadin therapy. Subjects showing signs of oral
             disease, including tongue lesions or xerostomia will be excluded from tongue biopsy
             and therefore excluded from the study. Subjects undergoing Coumadin therapy will be
             excluded from tongue biopsy due to the risk of bleeding, and therefore excluded from
             the study. Subjects will not be excluded because of economic status, gender, race or
             ethnicity.
