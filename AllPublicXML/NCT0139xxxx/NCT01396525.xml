      The MOBILITY study was a prospective, non-randomized, two-arm, multi-center study. The 2 arms
      (Omnilink Elite arm and Absolute Pro arm) were designed to independently assess the safety
      and effectiveness of the 2 devices used in this study.

    <description>Measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), a disease-specific instrument utilized to characterize walking ability through a questionnaire as an alternative to treadmill testing. It is a measure of subject-perceived walking performance for subjects with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and/or intermittent claudication. The WIQ quantifies patient-reported walking speed, walking distance, and stair-climbing ability, respectively, on a scale of 0 (= worst) to 100 (= best). The highest possible score for each domain is 100%, which indicates no difficulty. Lowest possible score for each domain is 0%, which indicates inability to perform the activity.</description>

        <description>Measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), a disease-specific instrument utilized to characterize walking ability through a questionnaire as an alternative to treadmill testing. It is a measure of subject-perceived walking performance for subjects with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and/or intermittent claudication. The WIQ quantifies patient-reported walking speed, walking distance, and stair-climbing ability, respectively, on a scale of 0 (= worst) to 100 (= best). The highest possible score for each domain is 100%, which indicates no difficulty. Lowest possible score for each domain is 0%, which indicates inability to perform the activity.</description>

        <title>Walking Impairment Questionaire Scores</title>
        <description>Measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), a disease-specific instrument utilized to characterize walking ability through a questionnaire as an alternative to treadmill testing. It is a measure of subject-perceived walking performance for subjects with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) and/or intermittent claudication. The WIQ quantifies patient-reported walking speed, walking distance, and stair-climbing ability, respectively, on a scale of 0 (= worst) to 100 (= best). The highest possible score for each domain is 100%, which indicates no difficulty. Lowest possible score for each domain is 0%, which indicates inability to perform the activity.</description>
