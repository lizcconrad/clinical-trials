      The aim of the study is to measure Pentraxin-3 levels in patients on hemodialysis, peritoneal
      dialysis and those in the pre-dialysis period; and to compare these groups with the control
      group; so as to investigate the eligibility of it as a reliable marker of inflammation;
      relationship with other inflammatory markers and carotis intima media thickness.

      The investigators planned to involve four group of patients: Hemodialysis, peritoneal
      dialysis, pre-dialysis and the control group; with about 25 patients planned to be involved
      in each group. The laboratory parameters to be measured are Pentraxin-3, C-reactive protein
      (CRP), high sensitive CRP, fibrinogen and interleukin-6. Concomitantly, carotis intima media
      thickness will be measured in the radiology clinic. Statistical analysis will be carried on
      by Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows 13.0. The variables acting on
      the inflammatory parameters and the correlation between them and carotis intima media
      thickness will be studied.
