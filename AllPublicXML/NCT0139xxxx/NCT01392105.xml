  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early reperfusion strategies in tandem with remarkable advances in drugs and devices for
      treating myocardial infarction (MI) have contributed to a reduction in early mortality, but
      cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Current management
      strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart
      failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the
      damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive
      therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect:
      ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic
      versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but
      only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the
      safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in
      patients with AMI.
