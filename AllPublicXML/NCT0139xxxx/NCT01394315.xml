      The aim of the study is to determine if DOT can detect response early in breast cancer
      patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study will enrol up to ten patients over one year. Patients receiving neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy for breast cancer will undergo baseline clinical examination, mammography,
      ultrasound, MRI and DOT before commencement of treatment. DOT will be repeated at 1,3,6 weeks
      after chemotherapy, and at the end of each chemotherapy regimen. Ultrasound will be repeated
      every 6 weeks and at the end of treatment. Mammography and MRI will be repeated once at the
      end of treatment before surgery. A breast pathologist will evaluate the subtype of breast
      cancer and the pathologic response of the operative specimen at the end of treatment. Patient
      satisfaction questionnaires will be administered to evaluate their preferences for DOT,
      ultrasound, mammography and MRI scanning at the beginning and the end of the study.

    <description>The primary parameters derived from the optical images acquired with the DOT system include: The volume of tumor microvasculature V, the total haemoglobin concentration (THC), and the blood volume index BVI (=VC).
Other available optical parameters are: blood oxygenation in the tumor microvasculature (SO2), its spatial distribution and dynamic fluctuation; dynamic blood perfusion.
These parameters will be compared with histopathological response.</description>

    <measure>Change in DOT parameters such as BVI, SO2, blood perfusion dynamic fluctuation</measure>
    <time_frame>These parameters will be obtained from patients during neoadjuvant chemotherapy process, which is up to an average of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The change in DOT parameters such as BVI, SO2, blood perfusion dynamic fluctuation will be correlated with response based on clinical examination, ultrasound, MMG and MRI.
Standard definitions for clinical response will be used to classify patients into four categories: complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD) and stable disease (SD).</description>

        Approximately 60 patients are prescribed neaodjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer at
        National Cancer Centre Singapore annually. Accrual is expected to be 10 patients per year.
        Up to 10 patients will be recruited for this study.
