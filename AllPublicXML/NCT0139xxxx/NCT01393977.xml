  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The morbidity of spinal cord injury (SCI) is increasing significantly in China. The methods
      to treat SCI patients in sequela stage update are poor. Though traditional rehabilitation
      therapy is the routine method to treat SCI in sequela stage, its effect to improve the
      neurological disorders of these patients, such as the dysfunction of sense, motor, autologous
      adjustment of blood pressure control of urination and defecation, perspiration , etc. is
      unsatisfying. Rehabilitation Therapy can prevent the process of muscle atrophy and joint
      stiffness. However, it can not repair the damaged nerve function. Studies show that
      mesenchymal stem cell transplantation can remarkably improve the neurological function of SCI
      in animals without any severe side effect.

      In this study, the investigators use mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord to
      treat 40 SCI patients (20 cases in early stage and 20 cases in sequela stage). The
      investigators also follow-up ten patients who only receive rehabilitation and another ten
      outpatients who accept neither stem cell therapy nor rehabilitation. On this basis, the
      investigators can compare the efficacy of these two treatments.
