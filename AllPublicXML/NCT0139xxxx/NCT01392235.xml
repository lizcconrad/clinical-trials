    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3,
      Flt1 and Flt3. Phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well famitinib works in treating patients with
      recurrent and/or metastatic NPC.
