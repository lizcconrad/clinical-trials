  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are in excess of 1 million operations performed annually to repair inguinal hernias,
      mostly in the male population. Unfortunately, some patients continue to suffer both groin or
      testicular pain for varying lengths of time postoperatively. This can lead to a severe
      degradation of the patient's lifestyle, work habits and sexual function. The origin of the
      pain is felt to be secondary to the inflammatory reaction caused by the mesh. This also
      involves the spermatic cord and its structures, leading to orchidinia and possibly
      azospermia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective randomized trial, male patients with a primary symptomatic unilateral
      inguinal hernia will be admitted to the trial. All patients must be over 21 years of age. In
      order to avoid inguinal nerve entrapment or damage by mesh fixation sutures Covidien
      Parietene ProGrip mesh will be employed. This mesh does not require fixation. Standard open
      inguinal hernia repair will take place with nerve preservation, as day surgery cases. In the
      randomized portion of the study, the mesh will be placed as usual along the posterior wall of
      the inguinal canal, however the inguinal ligament will be interposed between the mesh and the
      spermatic cord, thus isolating the cord from intimate contact with the mesh, and a reduction
      in postoperative inflammatory changes.
