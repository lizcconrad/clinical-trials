  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PFCs (perfluorocarbons, PFC), an ideal liquid respiratory media, has special chemical and
      biological properties, including high solubility of gas, swiftness of carrying and release,
      low surface tension, high proportion, almost non-absorbing and non-metabolic characteristics
      in the body. On the basis of the strong animal data suggesting the efficacy of PFC vapor
      inhalation in models of lung injury, we performed a randomized clinical trial comparing PFC
      vapor inhalation with conventional mechanical ventilation（CMV）in patients with Acute Lung
      Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome（ALI/ARDS）. The investigators will apply the
      Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV) to the vaporized perfluorocarbon inhalation,
      objectively evaluate its curative effect on the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and
      meanwhile assess the safety of PFC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) treatment of ALI/ARDS, the therapeutic
      action of vaporized PFC inhalation will be evaluated on the treatment of ALI/ARDS patients,
      and the safety of vaporized PFC inhalation on the treatment of ALI/ARDS. The Test group will
      make a timing and fix quantify inhalation of PFC, while the control group will be treated
      with the inhalation of water for injection. The general condition of patients will be
      assessed by monitoring their vital signs, hematology testing and APACHE II score, etc. Main
      outcome measures include the oxygenation index, respiratory mechanics; secondary outcomes
      include ventilator-free days, 28-day mortality and so on.
