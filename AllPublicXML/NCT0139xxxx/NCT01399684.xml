    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed
      to estimate the efficacy of MEGF0444A treatment to disease progression, combined with
      oxaliplatin + folinic acid + 5-Fluorouracil (mFOLFOX-6) + bevacizumab therapy in participants
      with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).
