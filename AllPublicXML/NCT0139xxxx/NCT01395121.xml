  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to see if a drug called nilotinib (Tasigna®) is effective in the
      treatment of patients with a rare group of acral and mucosal melanomas that have a change
      (mutation) in a protein called cKIT. Nilotinib interferes with signalling inside cells with
      this mutation and it is believed that this may lead to shrinkage of tumours. Acral melanomas
      are found on the palms and soles and mucosal melanomas start inside body cavities rather than
      on the skin.

      NICAM has a two step consent process. Patients diagnosed with advanced acral or mucosal
      melanoma first consent for study registration and undergo screening tests including testing
      samples of melanoma tissue for the c-KIT mutation.

      Following confirmation of the c-KIT mutation, patients are asked to consent to study entry
      with continuation of screening. Eligible patients then enter the study and commence taking
      nilotinib tablets twice a day for as long as clinical benefit is maintained.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with c-KIT mutated histologically proven advanced mucosal or acral melanoma
             in which the mutation is not known to be associated with nilotinib resistance.

          2. Advanced mucosal and acral melanoma defined as unresectable locally advanced or
             metastatic disease

          3. The presence of one or more clinically or radiologically measurable lesions at least
             10mm in size

          4. Age 18 or greater

          5. ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2

          6. Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks

          7. At least 14 days since any major surgery
