  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard therapy for gynecologic cancers involves the use of brachytherapy, also called
      internal radiation therapy or implant radiation. The treatment being studied consists of
      standard brachytherapy with the additional use of MRI to guide the insertion of radioactive
      applicators. The purpose of the study is to find out whether MRI-guided brachytherapy is
      practical and beneficial when compared to the standard CT-guided brachytherapy placement. The
      investigators are hoping that this MRI procedure will decrease the risk of giving too high a
      radiation dose to the bladder or bowel.

      The insertion of the brachytherapy applicator will be administered in the Advanced
      Multimodality Image-Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Subjects
      will undergo an MRI scan in the AMIGO suite ensuring proper placement of the applicator.
      Subjects may have an optional FMISO-PET scan.

      Subjects will have a follow-up visit including physical exam, pap smear, and MRI of the
      pelvis and/or PET scan 90 days after treatment.

      Subjects will have a follow-up visit including physical exam, pap smear, and MRI of the
      pelvis and/or PET scan 180 days after treatment.
