      The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of physical training on exercise
      capacity, quality of life, functional class, oxygen consumption and right ventricular
      function in patients with severe associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH) as part of
      a congenital heart defect with / without Eisenmenger's Syndrome

    <description>Randomized, prospective, controlled, blinded study of three-week inpatient rehabilitation and subsequent continuing of the training at home for 12 weeks. The control group received conventional rehabilitation without a specific training program. After 15 weeks training is also offered to patients in the control group.</description>

    <description>patients of the control group continue their sedentary lifestyle without given advice for exercise training.
The time before start of rehabilitation (three months) serves as control group. Afterwards patients take part in the training program as well.</description>
