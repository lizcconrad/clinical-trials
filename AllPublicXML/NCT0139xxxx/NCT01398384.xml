      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of Nitric Oxide for Inhalation on
      Myocardial Infarction Size.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to assess whether or not inhaled nitric oxide can
      decrease myocardial infarction (MI) size as a fraction of left ventricular size at 48-72
      hours in patients presenting with an ST segment elevation MI who undergo successful
      percutaneous coronary intervention.

             transfusion within 6 weeks prior to presentation or hemorrhagic stroke within the 6
             weeks prior to presentation.

          7. Known or suspected aortic dissection.

          8. Prior history of pulmonary disease requiring chronic oxygen therapy.
