      A study multicenter, phase III, randomized, open label study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of a fixed-dose combination of formoterol/fluticasone and salmeterol/fluticasone in
      patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that will
      enroll 336 subjects aged ≥ 40 years, smokers or former smokers, diagnosed with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, classified as moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
      or severe according to GOLD spirometric classification. The subjects will be allocated in 2
      parallel groups and will receive the medicines of study, according of the randomization
      during a 24-week.
