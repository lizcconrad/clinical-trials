  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of two
      dose levels (1x10^10 and 5x10^10 virus particles (vp)) of the adenovirus serotype (Ad)
      Ad35.CS.01/Ad26.CS.01 prime-boost malaria candidate vaccine, followed by an evaluation of the
      protective efficacy of the higher dose level in an experimental malaria challenge.

      The study will be in 3 phases:

        1. a dose escalation / vaccination phase in which both dose levels will be tested

        2. a malaria challenge phase in which only subjects receiving the Ad35.CS.01/Ad26.CS.01
           5x10^10 vp dose level, together with six infectivity control subjects, will be exposed
           to experimental challenge with Plasmodium falciparum

        3. a long term follow up phase in which all subjects who received active vaccine from both
           dose levels and/or malaria challenge will be included
