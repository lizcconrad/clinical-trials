      This is a prospective, double-blind placebo-controlled randomized pilot trial of the
      preliminary safety and efficacy of bupropion SR in combination with behavioral counseling for
      smoking cessation during pregnancy. A total of 150 pregnant smokers will receive medication
      (75) or placebo (75) for 12 weeks. Compassionate care/continuance of therapy will be
      available to pregnant subjects. Women who relapse to smoking postpartum will be offered an
      additional course of medication treatment. All subjects regardless of adherence with 12 week
      study drug administration period and smoking habits during pregnancy will be followed through
      the duration of their pregnancy, delivery, and 6-month postpartum period. Subject
      participation will begin between 13-30 wks of gestation and end 6 months postpartum.
      Participation will be ten (10) to thirteen(13) months in length.

    <measure>Change in Cigarette Craving and Total Nicotine Withdrawal Symptoms Between Groups During Medication Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>During treatment: Visits 2-6 (time period between 2nd and 12th week of therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>Cigarette craving and withdrawal symptoms were assessed by the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS). MNWS consists of 7 objectives (e.g., irritability, anxious, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite, insomnia, restless). Subjects were given a score on each item on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). Summed (total) score excluding craving represent subject's symptoms of tobacco withdrawal, ranging from 0 to 28. We calculated a craving for tobacco score and a total score of withdrawal symptoms excluding craving. The higher score represent more sever craving and withdrawal.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With 7-day Point Prevalence Smoking Abstinence at the End of Medication Treatment (Visit 6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 6 (end of 12 weeks of medication therapy)</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of self-reported smoking abstinence during study visits was confirmed by an exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels and by urinary cotinine levels. 7-day point prevalence abstinence was defined as no cigarettes (not even a puff) in the last 7 days, levels of (CO) in exhaled air &lt; 4 ppm, and concentrations of cotinine in urine &lt; 50 ng/mL. At every visit, a research nurse monitored the smoking status of all subjects (amount of cigarettes per day, exhaled CO). Exhaled CO was measured using a Vitalograph carbon monoxide monitor (Lenexa, KS) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A urine sample was collected at each visit and cotinine in urine was quantified using the validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method. We calculated the total number of abstinent subjects. The higher the number the better outcome.</description>

    <description>Bupropion SR and smoking cessation counseling Subjects received Bupropion SR 150 mg tablet orally twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks. Subjects were instructed to begin using study medication (bupropion SR 150 mg orally for 3 days, then BID for 4 days) on study visit day 1, which was approximately 1 week prior to their quit date. Thereafter, they were continued to dose Bupropion SR 150 mg tablet orally BID for a total medication treatment of 12 full weeks.
Smoking cessation counseling included 35-minute counseling sessions at each of the first 2 visits and 10 minutes of smoking cessation counseling at subsequent visits, provided by the trained study nurse.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Pregnant smokers were recruited through the UTMB Ob/Gyn Department clinics and Regional Maternal Child Health Program (RMCHP) clinics. The study was also advertised through printed flyers, posters, and electronic media in clinic waiting areas. UTMB OB providers were notified of the study as well to refer potential participants.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Psychological screening using the PRIME MD survey was administered after enrollment at the first Study Visit. Using the score, subjects with evidence of major depression or any other severe, acute psychiatric symptom (eg, psychosis) were considered screen failures and referred back to their prenatal provider for treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change in Cigarette Craving and Total Nicotine Withdrawal Symptoms Between Groups During Medication Treatment</title>
        <description>Cigarette craving and withdrawal symptoms were assessed by the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS). MNWS consists of 7 objectives (e.g., irritability, anxious, depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite, insomnia, restless). Subjects were given a score on each item on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe). Summed (total) score excluding craving represent subject’s symptoms of tobacco withdrawal, ranging from 0 to 28. We calculated a craving for tobacco score and a total score of withdrawal symptoms excluding craving. The higher score represent more sever craving and withdrawal.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With 7-day Point Prevalence Smoking Abstinence at the End of Medication Treatment (Visit 6)</title>
        <description>The accuracy of self-reported smoking abstinence during study visits was confirmed by an exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels and by urinary cotinine levels. 7-day point prevalence abstinence was defined as no cigarettes (not even a puff) in the last 7 days, levels of (CO) in exhaled air &lt; 4 ppm, and concentrations of cotinine in urine &lt; 50 ng/mL. At every visit, a research nurse monitored the smoking status of all subjects (amount of cigarettes per day, exhaled CO). Exhaled CO was measured using a Vitalograph carbon monoxide monitor (Lenexa, KS) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. A urine sample was collected at each visit and cotinine in urine was quantified using the validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method. We calculated the total number of abstinent subjects. The higher the number the better outcome.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With 7-day Point Prevalence Smoking Abstinence at the End of Medication Treatment (Visit 6)</title>
          <description>The accuracy of self-reported smoking abstinence during study visits was confirmed by an exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) levels and by urinary cotinine levels. 7-day point prevalence abstinence was defined as no cigarettes (not even a puff) in the last 7 days, levels of (CO) in exhaled air &lt; 4 ppm, and concentrations of cotinine in urine &lt; 50 ng/mL. At every visit, a research nurse monitored the smoking status of all subjects (amount of cigarettes per day, exhaled CO). Exhaled CO was measured using a Vitalograph carbon monoxide monitor (Lenexa, KS) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. A urine sample was collected at each visit and cotinine in urine was quantified using the validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method. We calculated the total number of abstinent subjects. The higher the number the better outcome.</description>

      <desc>We monitored for maternal AEs that could be related to bupropion, such as seizures, consistent BP &gt;140/90 mm Hg, headache, insomnia, rhinitis, dry mouth, and anxiety.
