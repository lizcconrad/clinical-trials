  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy alone is generally the only treatment in old patients with SCCHN. No evidence
      indicates combination with EGFR Target therapy can bring benefit for the patients. Senile
      Society is coming in China, the mean age in Beijing reaches 80 years old. A valuable
      treatment with efficacy and safety is needed for senile patient with SCCHN. The purpose of
      the study &quot;Prospective, Randomized, Controlled, Phase II Multiple Centered Clinical Trial of
      Nimotuzumab Combined with Radiotherapy for Senile Locally Advanced SCCHN&quot; was sponsored to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety for Nimotuzumab Combined with Radiotherapy in Senile SCCHN
      patients.
