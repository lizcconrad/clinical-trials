  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nimotuzumab (hR3) is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody that recognized an epitope located
      in the extra cellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Clinical
      efficacy has been shown in adults with head and neck cancer. This study assesses the efficacy
      and safety of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concomitantly with chemotherapy in
      patients with NSCLC. This is a randomized, muti-center sites trial of this treatment.
