  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Alabama Veterans Rural Health Initiative is to better understand access
      and barriers to health care and to enhance veteran enrollment or engagement in health care
      services of veterans residing in rural areas. It describes an intervention that is adaptable
      for use by other VA facilities that serve veterans in rural settings, and importantly, this
      study will improve our understanding of barriers to care and evaluate a method for enhancing
      access to care. The anticipated impact is that more veterans in rural areas who were
      previously under-utilizing VA services will receive and attend a health care appointment.
      This gain may improve preventative and primary care health care and reduce long term health
      care morbidity, expense and burden. This study may also identify previously unknown barriers
      to care that can be surmounted by innovative access and health care delivery approaches.

      The primary objective is to evaluate an innovative approach for enhanced enrollment and
      engagement outreach intervention (EEE intervention) for rural veterans in VA health care
      services. This study entails a two-cell design, addressing this objective with a prospective,
      randomized controlled multi-site clinical trial that evaluates an active intervention
      compared to administrative outreach (AO, control condition) on whether or not a
      rurally-residing veteran obtains and attends a VA appointment.

    <textblock>
      Access, enrollment, and engagement with primary and specialty health care services present
      significant challenges for rural populations worldwide. The Alabama Veterans Rural Health
      Initiative evaluated an innovative outreach intervention combining motivational interviewing,
      patient navigation, and health services education to promote utilization of the United States
      Veterans Administration Healthcare System (VA) by veterans who live in rural locations.

    <description>Enhanced Engagement and Enrollment (EEE) consists of the outreach worker (interventionalist) engaging the participant in education (about VA resources and medical care), navigating the patient through the VA eligibility, enrollment, and scheduling processes, and using motivational interview to focus on ambivalence about attending a VA appointment.</description>
