    <textblock>
      The aims of this study were to identify risk factors associated with delirium in hospitalized
      persons with dementia, and to describe immediate and post-hospital (1&amp;3 months) trajectory of
      cognitive decline and associated outcomes in persons with dementia who develop delirium. It
      was hypothesized that factors such as CNS-active medications, urinary tract infection, stage
      of dementia, pain, activity level, and dehydration would be associated with an increased risk
      of delirium and delirium severity in patients with dementia compared to dementia patients
      without delirium. It was also hypothesized that persons with DSD will have worse outcomes
      (longer hospital length of stays, decreased functional status, a steeper negative slope of
      cognitive decline) than dementia patients without delirium. Lastly, it was hypothesized that
      higher delirium severity would be associated with poorer outcomes in persons with dementia.
      The long-term objectives were to use the results from this study to design and test an
      intervention strategy to improve early recognition, management, prevention, and outcomes in
      persons with DSD.

      It is well known that persons with dementia are at increased risk of developing delirium or
      acute confusional state. Further, current evidence suggests that delirium may worsen the
      prognosis of dementia, may alter the clinical course and trajectory of cognitive decline, and
      may be associated with substantially worse long-term outcomes. This study was a prospective
      cohort study design involving 165 hospitalized subjects with dementia who were 65 and older
      and included a three month follow up period. Aims for the study included: 1) to identify risk
      factors for DSD, and 2) to describe post-hospital outcomes and the trajectory of cognitive
      decline for DSD, which will justify the development of appropriate preventative and
      management strategies for delirium in patients with dementia. Delirium was assessed daily
      from admission to discharge and then at one and three month follow-ups. The potential risk
      factors being examined were 1) polypharmacy (central nervous system-active medications,
      number of medications, new medications added), 2) physical stressors (urinary tract
      infection, pain, dehydration), and 3) environmental stressors (bedrest, restraints, room
      changes). Outcomes were assessed by research study staff blinded to the study aims.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons with dementia were included if they: a) were on one of the selected
             medical-surgical units and age 65 years or older; b) spoke English; c) were
             hospitalized less than 24 hours; and d) met the criteria for dementia. This study
             included minorities and women.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons with dementia were excluded if they: a) had any significant neurological or
             neurosurgical disease associated with cognitive impairment other than dementia (due to
             confounding with dementia or DSD), such as parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease,
             normal pressure hydrocephalus, seizure disorder, subdural hematoma, head trauma or any
             other known structural brain abnormalities; b) were nonverbal and unable to
             communicate due to sever dementia (MMSE=0), aphasia, intubation, or terminal illness
             (since interviews were required for the study); or c) had no family or caregivers to
             interview (since proxy interviews were required for the study). This study did not
             exclude persons with pre-existing delirium. In addition, subjects were not excluded on
             the basis of race or gender.
