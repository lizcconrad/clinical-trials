  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who had urinary stress incontinence and underwent one of two procedures: the classic
      TVTO or the Folke-Flam method of surgical operation, will be evaluated and compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will enroll women that underwent one of the two surgeries: TVTO or the modification where
      the needle passes somewhat to the side to prevent the post operative pain, for urinary stress
      incontinence. Data will be collected from the charts. Telephone interviews will be carried
      out. Physical examination will also be incorporated.
