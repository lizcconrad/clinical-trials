    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigated and evaluated the effectiveness of a new
      surgical technique for the treatment of severe chronic pain stages (Complex Regional Pain
      Syndrome Type II).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For 140 years the treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndromes Type II (CRPS II) has been an
      unsolved problem. Recent findings in animal models assume that CRPS Type II is maintained by
      a coupling of newly sprouted sympathetic and sensible fibres. Therapeutic approaches have
      included conventional pain medication, physical therapy, sympathetic blocks, transcutaneous
      or spinal cord stimulation, injections or infusion therapies and sympathectomy. Alone or in
      combination these therapies often yielded unfavorable results. The majority of physicians
      dealing with CRPS patients are convinced that a surgical treatment of the affected extremity
      only exacerbates the symptoms, especially its hallmark excruciating pain.

      Patients with a CRPS Type II at the upper or the lower limb will be included in the study
      after ineffective pain therapy for more than 6 months. The most proximal region of pain
      associated with CRPS can be localized and 2% Lidocain will be injected into that area. If the
      sympathetic, deep, burning pain can be blocked repeatedly with these injections, the
      subcutaneous veins in the previously determined area will be surgically removed. This
      operation should lead to the permanent resolution of symptoms.

      A visual analogue scale (VAS), the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), thermography and physical
      examinations will be used to evaluate the outcome of the operation.

    <description>After incision of the skin a subcutaneous area of approximately 16 cm² (2.5 square inches) will be en block removed between dermis and muscle fascia. All prior detected and marked veins in the operating field will be ligated or coagulated precisely.The tissue defect generated by this operation will be closed by a full thickness or a meshed skin graft which arises during the preparation.</description>
