      The purpose of this study is to compare the incidence of opportunistic infections between
      HIV-infected patients who continue and discontinue primary or secondary prophylaxis for
      opportunistic infections in whom receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and achieve
      undetectable HIV-1 RNA, but CD4 cell counts are less than 200 cells/mm3.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has become the standard of care in the
      treatment of HIV infection in many parts of the world including Thailand. The benefits of
      cART represented by an increment of CD4 cell count and a suppression of HIV viral load have
      been reported worldwide. The National Institute of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC), and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases
      Society of America (HIVMA/IDSA) recommended discontinuing primary and secondary prophylaxis
      for prevention of opportunistic infections (OIs) in HIV-infected adults and adolescents
      receiving cART, when the CD4 cell count increase to a certain level for a certain period of
      time. For instances, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis can be discontinued
      when patients receiving HAART and CD4 ≥ 200 cells/mm3 for at least 3 months (for primary
      prophylaxis) or at least 6 months (for secondary prophylaxis), prophylaxis for Cryptococcal
      meningitis, disseminated penicilliosis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, and disseminated
      mycobacterium avium complex can be discontinued when patients receiving HAART and CD4 ≥ 100
      cells/mm3 for at least 6 months. Our practices follow this guideline. However, recently there
      are new data showing that there were no cases developed PCP after primary or secondary
      prophylaxis discontinuation even if CD4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3. Discontinuation of
      secondary prophylaxis resulted in reduction in pill burdens that may improve HAART adherence,
      decrease drug-drug interactions, and also prevent drug adverse events that may happen.
