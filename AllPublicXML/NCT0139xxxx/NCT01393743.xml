    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      perampanel on Primary Generalized Tonic Clonic (PGTC) seizure frequency in adolescents and
      adults maintained on one to two stable antiepileptic drugs (AED).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      adjunctive-therapy study with an open-label Extension Phase. The Core Study consists of 2
      phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase consisted of 2
      periods: Screening (up to 4 weeks) and Baseline (4 or 8 weeks, depending on the accuracy of
      diary-documented seizures during Screening), during which participants will be assessed for
      eligibility to participate in the study. The Randomization Phase consisted of 3 periods:
      Titration (4 weeks), Maintenance (13 weeks), and Follow-up (4 weeks; only for those
      participants not entering into the Extension Phase). At the start of the Randomization Phase,
      eligible participants will be randomized to the perampanel or placebo treatment groups in a
      1:1 ratio. The extension phase consists of 142 weeks.

    <measure>Median Percent Change in Primary Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizure Frequency (PGTC) Per 28 Days During the Titration and Maintenance Periods (Combined) Relative to Baseline (Prerandomization) - (for Core Study)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (4 or 8 weeks), Titration (4 weeks), and Maintenance (13 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Seizure frequency per 28 days was derived from the information recorded in the participant diaries. PGTC seizure frequency per 28 days (as determined from participant diaries) was calculated as the number of PGTC seizures divided by the number of days in the interval and multiplied by 28. The percent change from baseline in PGTC seizure was analyzed over the Titration and Maintenance Periods combined, while baseline was defined as seizure frequency per 28 days based on all valid diary data during the Prerandomization Phase.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 1 of perampanel treatment to date of last dose of perampanel in the Extension Phase</time_frame>
    <description>Responder rate was defined as the percentage of participants who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in PGTC and total seizure frequency during treatment per 28 days relative to baseline (responder). Week 1 began on the date of first dose of the perampanel treatment regardless of whether it occurred in the Core Study or Extension Phase and continued to and included the date of the last dose of perampanel in the Extension Phase. For any given analysis window and seizure type(s), a 50% response from Core Study Prerandomization is a participant whose seizure frequency per 28 days for that seizure type(s) during that analysis window is 50% to 100% lower than his or her Core Study Prerandomization baseline seizure frequency per 28 days for that same seizure type(s). In Part B of the Extension Phase (after Visit 15), the seizure diary is only completed for days on which a seizure occurred and missing days were imputed as non-seizure days.</description>

    <description>Efficacy assessments included seizure counts from participant diaries. The percent change in seizure frequency was assessed during the perampanel treatment duration, with the pre-perampanel baseline being used for evaluating the change. The pre-perampanel baseline was defined as follows: 1) for all participants who had been assigned to placebo treatment in the Core Study, the pre-perampanel baseline was computed from all valid seizure diary data during the Core Study, and 2) for participants who had been assigned to perampanel in the Core Study, the pre-perampanel baseline was computed from all valid seizure diary data during the Prerandomization Phase plus the 4 weeks prior to the Prerandomization Phase of the Core Study. The perampanel treatment duration consisted of: 1) the Randomization Phase of the Core Study plus the Extension Phase for participants assigned to perampanel in the Core Study, and 2) the Extension Phase for participants assigned to placebo in the Core Study.</description>

    <time_frame>For each participant, from the first treatment dose till 30 days after the last dose or up to 21 weeks for core study and 142 weeks for extension phase.</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this did not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study drug). In this study, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (defined as an AE that started/increased in severity on/after the first dose of study medication up to 30 days after the final dose of study medication) were assessed.</description>

        <description>Seizure frequency per 28 days was derived from the information recorded in the participant diaries. PGTC seizure frequency per 28 days (as determined from participant diaries) was calculated as the number of PGTC seizures divided by the number of days in the interval and multiplied by 28. The percent change from baseline in PGTC seizure was analyzed over the Titration and Maintenance Periods combined, while baseline was defined as seizure frequency per 28 days based on all valid diary data during the Prerandomization Phase.</description>

        <title>50% Responder Rate in Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days Relative to the Core Study Prerandomization Phase – (for Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>Responder rate was defined as the percentage of participants who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in PGTC and total seizure frequency during treatment per 28 days relative to baseline (responder). Week 1 began on the date of first dose of the perampanel treatment regardless of whether it occurred in the Core Study or Extension Phase and continued to and included the date of the last dose of perampanel in the Extension Phase. For any given analysis window and seizure type(s), a 50% response from Core Study Prerandomization is a participant whose seizure frequency per 28 days for that seizure type(s) during that analysis window is 50% to 100% lower than his or her Core Study Prerandomization baseline seizure frequency per 28 days for that same seizure type(s). In Part B of the Extension Phase (after Visit 15), the seizure diary is only completed for days on which a seizure occurred and missing days were imputed as non-seizure days.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 1 of perampanel treatment to date of last dose of perampanel in the Extension Phase</time_frame>
        <population>The Extension Phase FAS included participants who were eligible to participate in the Extension Phase, received at least 1 dose of study drug in this phase, and had baseline seizure frequency data and at least 1 observation of valid seizure diary data during study drug treatment duration.</population>

          <group group_id="O1">
            <title>Perampanel Extension Phase</title>
            <description>The Extension Phase consisted of two parts: Part A (6-week blinded Conversion Period plus a 32-week Maintenance Period) and Part B (maximum of 104-week Maintenance Period), which was followed by an additional 4-week Follow-up Period. Part A: Participants who received placebo in the Core Study were started on blinded oral perampanel (2 mg/day) and were up-titrated weekly in 2-mg increments to the optimal dose per investigator's discretion, up to 12 mg/day perampanel maximum. Part B: Participants were unblinded to study treatment and remained on the optimal perampanel dose established during the blinded Conversion Period (Part A). Dose adjustment in 2-mg increments (upwards or downwards) was allowed at the investigator's discretion. Participants who could not tolerate a dose of 2 mg/day perampanel during the Extension Period were discontinued from the study. The maximum dose of perampanel allowed during the Extension Phase was 12 mg/day.</description>

          <title>50% Responder Rate in Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days Relative to the Core Study Prerandomization Phase – (for Extension Phase)</title>
          <description>Responder rate was defined as the percentage of participants who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in PGTC and total seizure frequency during treatment per 28 days relative to baseline (responder). Week 1 began on the date of first dose of the perampanel treatment regardless of whether it occurred in the Core Study or Extension Phase and continued to and included the date of the last dose of perampanel in the Extension Phase. For any given analysis window and seizure type(s), a 50% response from Core Study Prerandomization is a participant whose seizure frequency per 28 days for that seizure type(s) during that analysis window is 50% to 100% lower than his or her Core Study Prerandomization baseline seizure frequency per 28 days for that same seizure type(s). In Part B of the Extension Phase (after Visit 15), the seizure diary is only completed for days on which a seizure occurred and missing days were imputed as non-seizure days.</description>
          <population>The Extension Phase FAS included participants who were eligible to participate in the Extension Phase, received at least 1 dose of study drug in this phase, and had baseline seizure frequency data and at least 1 observation of valid seizure diary data during study drug treatment duration.</population>

        <description>Seizure frequency per 28 days was derived from the information recorded in the participant diaries. PGTC seizure frequency per 28 days was calculated as the number of PGTC seizures divided by the number of days in the interval and multiplied by 28. The percent change in seizure frequency relative to baseline (prerandomization) for all seizures (PGTC, myoclonic, absence and all other seizures that occur during the study) per 28 days during the Titration and Maintenance Periods combined was analyzed.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Core Study Prerandomization Phase in Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic (PGTC) Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days - (for Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>Week 1 began on the date of first dose of the perampanel treatment regardless of whether it occurred in the Core Study or Extension Phase and continued to and included the date of the last dose of perampanel in the Extension Phase. For any given analysis window and seizure type(s), a 50% responder from Core Study Randomization is a participant whose seizure frequency per 28 days for that seizure type(s) during that analysis window is 50% to 100% lower than his or her Core Study Prerandomization baseline seizure frequency per 28 days for that same seizure type(s). In Part B of the Extension Phase (after Visit 15), the seizure diary is only completed for days on which a seizure occurred and missing days were imputed as non-seizure days.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set included all participants who were eligible to participate in the Extension Phase, received at least 1 dose of perampanel in this phase, and had baseline seizure frequency data and at least 1 observation of valid seizure diary data during the perampanel treatment duration.</population>

            <description>The Extension Phase consisted of two parts: Part A (6-week blinded Conversion Period plus a 32-week Maintenance Period) and Part B (maximum of 104-week Maintenance Period), which was followed by an additional 4-week Follow-up Period. Part A: Participants who were assigned to the perampanel arm in the Core Study continued to receive blinded perampanel once daily at the dose received during the Maintenance Period of the Core Study. During the Conversion Period, dose adjustments could be made at the investigator’s discretion. Part B: Participants were unblinded to study treatment and remained on the optimal perampanel dose established during the blinded Conversion Period (Part A). Dose adjustment in 2-mg increments (upwards or downwards) was allowed at the investigator's discretion. Participants who could not tolerate a dose of 2 mg/day perampanel during the Extension Period were discontinued from the study. The maximum dose of perampanel allowed during the Extension Phase was 12 mg/day.</description>

        <title>Summary of Percent Change From Pre-Perampanel Baseline in Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days - (for Extension Phase)</title>
        <description>Efficacy assessments included seizure counts from participant diaries. The percent change in seizure frequency was assessed during the perampanel treatment duration, with the pre-perampanel baseline being used for evaluating the change. The pre-perampanel baseline was defined as follows: 1) for all participants who had been assigned to placebo treatment in the Core Study, the pre-perampanel baseline was computed from all valid seizure diary data during the Core Study, and 2) for participants who had been assigned to perampanel in the Core Study, the pre-perampanel baseline was computed from all valid seizure diary data during the Prerandomization Phase plus the 4 weeks prior to the Prerandomization Phase of the Core Study. The perampanel treatment duration consisted of: 1) the Randomization Phase of the Core Study plus the Extension Phase for participants assigned to perampanel in the Core Study, and 2) the Extension Phase for participants assigned to placebo in the Core Study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Perampanel in Subjects With Inadequately Controlled PGTC Seizures - (for Core Study)</title>
        <description>An Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. A serious adverse event (SAE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening (i.e., the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this did not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study drug). In this study, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (defined as an AE that started/increased in severity on/after the first dose of study medication up to 30 days after the final dose of study medication) were assessed.</description>
        <time_frame>For each participant, from the first treatment dose till 30 days after the last dose or up to 21 weeks for core study and 142 weeks for extension phase.</time_frame>

          <description>The Extension Phase consisted of two parts: Part A (6-week blinded Conversion Period plus a 32-week Maintenance Period) and Part B (maximum of 104-week Maintenance Period), which was followed by an additional 4-week Follow-up Period. Part A: Participants who were assigned to the perampanel arm in the Core Study continued to receive blinded perampanel once daily at the dose received during the Maintenance Period of the Core Study. During the Conversion Period, dose adjustments could be made at the investigator’s discretion. Part B: Participants were unblinded to study treatment and remained on the optimal perampanel dose established during the blinded Conversion Period (Part A). Dose adjustment in 2-mg increments (upwards or downwards) was allowed at the investigator's discretion. Participants who could not tolerate a dose of 2 mg/day perampanel during the Extension Period were discontinued from the study. The maximum dose of perampanel allowed during the Extension Phase was 12 mg/day.</description>
