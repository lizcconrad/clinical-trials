  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood and marrow transplantation (BMT) is commonly used in the treatment of oncologic and
      hematologic disorders. Patients undergoing Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are
      screened for functional status among other criteria to ensure that they are able to endure
      the rigorous treatment involved during Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The
      patient entering the transplant process is possibly already functionally compromised from
      their disease, prior cancer treatment, and possible other co-morbidities. Additional factors
      of the transplantation that compromise the independent functional status of the patient
      include the high dose preparative regimen, pancytopenia, steroid-related side effects,
      hospitalization, transplantation complications such as infections, pulmonary alterations,
      acute and chronic Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD), pain, decreased nutritional input, and
      other sequelae of transplantation.

      Physical Therapy has been utilized in this population primarily as a supportive therapy to
      prevent and limit the patient's functional decline. Studies have addressed general and
      aerobic exercise in this population but there is a paucity of research investigating the
      benefits of a strength-training program, particularly performed in weight-bearing, in
      attenuating the detrimental effects of the transplantation on functional status.

      This is a feasibility study questioning if an exercise program including weight-bearing
      strengthening exercises and cardiovascular exercise is practical for the patients to carry
      out as inpatients. The study will also preliminarily determine if this exercise program
      influences functional outcomes and level of fatigue. Such outcome measures will include 1)
      FiveTimes Sit-To-Stand Test, 2) Six-Minute Walk Test, 3) stair performance, 4) Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation (FACT-BMT) and Functional Assessment
      of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) Scales.

      The study population will include patients with lymphomas and acute leukemias undergoing
      matched-related donor allogeneic myeloablative Blood and marrow transplantation (BMT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All diagnoses admitted for a first allogeneic myeloablative Blood and marrow
             transplantation (BMT)

          -  Adult subjects greater or equal to 18 year of age. There are no gender or ethnic
             restrictions

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;= 70%.

          -  Admitted to E1 Day-7 (+/- 3 days).

          -  Patients must be informed of this study and must sign and give written informed
             consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with musculoskeletal, neurological, cardiovascular, and pulmonary impairments
             will be excluded. Cardiovascular and pulmonary status will be confirmed prior to
             transplantation by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and pulmonary function tests.
