    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severely debilitating mental illness that affects approximately 1% of the
      world population. Hallucinations and delusions are the most striking characteristic positive
      symptoms of schizophrenia; however, more subtle negative symptoms (eg, social withdrawal and
      lack of emotion, energy, and motivation) may also be present. The first antipsychotics
      developed for the treatment of schizophrenia were effective against positive symptoms, but
      showed little efficacy for negative symptoms and were also associated with a high incidence
      of side effects. Second generation antipsychotics, represent a significant advancement in the
      treatment of psychotic disorders because they are effective and at the same time exhibit
      fewer side effects than first generation antipsychotics. Although generally safer than first
      generation antipsychotics, the second-generation antipsychotics are not devoid of undesirable
      side effects such as Hyperprolactinemia and weight gain. In addition, the safety of these
      drugs vary considerably.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 6 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consists of 3 subscales (positive subscale, negative subscale and general psychology subscale) containing a total of 30 symptom constructs and was administered using the Structured Clinical Interview (SCI)-PANSS. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremely severe symptoms. The PANSS total score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness Scale (CGI-S) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of illness was rated using the CGI-S which is the key secondary endpoint. To perform this assessment, the rater or study physician answered the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the participant at this time?&quot; Response choices included: 0=not assessed; 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=among the most extremely ill participant.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP is a clinician-rated scale that measures personal and social functioning in 4 domains: socially useful activities (eg, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Impairment in each of these domains was rated as absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe, or very severe. These ratings were then converted to a total score based on a 100-point scale using algorithms to identify the appropriate 10-point interval, and the rater's judgment to determine the total score within the 10-point interval. Participants with a PSP total score of 71 to 100 were considered to have mild functional difficulty. Scores of 31 to 70 represented manifest disabilities of various degrees and ratings of 1 to 30 indicated minimal functioning that required intense support and/or supervision.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 6 in PANSS Positive Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>For each symptom construct of the PANSS Positive Subscale, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremely severe symptoms. The symptom constructs were as follows: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. The PANSS Positive Subscale Score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 7 subscale items, and ranged from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 6 in PANSS Negative Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>For each symptom construct of the PANSS Negative Subscale, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremely severe symptoms. The symptom constructs were as follows: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking. The PANSS Negative Subscale Score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 7 subscale items, and ranged from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression- Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Score at Week 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's overall improvement was rated using the CGI-I. The rater or study physician rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. All responses were compared with the participant's condition at screening/baseline. Response choices were: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 6 in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP)</title>
        <description>The PSP is a clinician-rated scale that measures personal and social functioning in 4 domains: socially useful activities (eg, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Impairment in each of these domains was rated as absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe, or very severe. These ratings were then converted to a total score based on a 100-point scale using algorithms to identify the appropriate 10-point interval, and the rater’s judgment to determine the total score within the 10-point interval. Participants with a PSP total score of 71 to 100 were considered to have mild functional difficulty. Scores of 31 to 70 represented manifest disabilities of various degrees and ratings of 1 to 30 indicated minimal functioning that required intense support and/or supervision.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 6 in PANSS Positive Subscale Score</title>
        <description>For each symptom construct of the PANSS Positive Subscale, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremely severe symptoms. The symptom constructs were as follows: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. The PANSS Positive Subscale Score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 7 subscale items, and ranged from 7 to 49 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>

          <title>Clinical Global Impression- Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Score at Week 6</title>
          <description>The participant’s overall improvement was rated using the CGI-I. The rater or study physician rated the participant’s total improvement whether or not it was due entirely to drug treatment. All responses were compared with the participant’s condition at screening/baseline. Response choices were: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 6 in PANSS Marder Anxiety Depression Score</title>
          <description>The PANSS Marder Factor score - Anxiety/Depression Score consists of 4 PANSS items (anxiety [G2], guilt feelings [G3], tension [G4], depression [G6]). The PANSS Marder Factor score - Anxiety/Depression Score for participants was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 4 items, and ranged from 4 to 28 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms.</description>
          <population>Efficacy: consists of all participants who received at least one dose of study medication and have baseline and at least one post-baseline efficacy evaluation. At Week 6, 121, 123, 56 and 108 participants in the Brex 4mg, Brex 2mg, Brex 0.25 mg and placebo group, respectively had data.</population>
