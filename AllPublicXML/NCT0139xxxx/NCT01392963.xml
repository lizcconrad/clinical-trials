    <description>Binary measure of response to treatment (positive outcome is defined as a reduction in Ham-D score by &gt;50% as compared to baseline). To be measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24 weeks. For both placebo and active group, change from baseline (0 weeks) in Ham-D scores as compared to Ham-D scores at 3,6, and 12 weeks.
For both placebo and active group, change from baseline (at week 12, when cross-over occurs) in Ham-D scores as compared to Ham-D scores at 15,18,and 24 weeks.</description>

    <description>Proportion of patients who achieve a Ham-D score &lt; 8. To be measured at 0, 3, 6,12,15,18, 24 weeks. Response rate by self report on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to be measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24 weeks For just the group given Botox at week 0, change from baseline (0 weeks) in Ham-D scores as compared to Ham-D scores at 3,6,12,15,18, and 24 weeks. This is to determine if there is improvement in depression even when the Botox has &quot;worn off&quot; according to cosmetic guidelines (i.e. approximately 16 weeks since injection).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male/Female between the ages of 18 and 65

          2. Major Depression Disorder as defined by DSM IV criteria and diagnosed by a
             psychiatrist. DSM IV criteria for depression are: a depressed mood or anhedonia for at
             least a two week period. This mood must represent a change from the person's normal
             mood; social, occupational, educational or other important functioning must also be
             negatively impaired by the change in mood. Major depressive disorder cannot be
             diagnosed if a person has a history of bipolar disorder or if the depressed mood is
             better accounted for by substance abuse or a psychotic disorder. In addition, the
             patient must have 5 of the following symptoms:

               -  Significant weight loss or weight gain.

               -  Insomnia or hypersomnia

               -  Psychomotor agitation or retardation

               -  Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt

               -  Poor Concentration

               -  Fatigue or loss of energy

               -  Suicidal thoughts

          3. History of depression for at least 6 months

          4. Initial score 14 or higher on initial Hamilton Depression rating scale.

          5. Melancholic facial expressions amenable to treatment with Botox. Photos will be taken
             of potential participants and ranked independently by two investigators, on a scale of
             1-10 based on how negative they look, 10 being the highest. Patients with an average
             score of 6 or above will be included in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active substance abuse

          2. Bipolar Depression

          3. Subjects who are pregnant, nursing or trying to become pregnant during study
             participation

          4. Subjects who are currently on more than 3 psychiatric medications at the time of
             enrollment

          5. Current medications used to treat depression must be stable for at least 60 days prior
             to enrollment

          6. Previous Botox treatment

          7. The Principle Investigator has determined that this study is not in the best interest
             of the subject and therefore the subject will not be enrolled.
