      This is a multicentric International Phase III,Long term open label study(12 months)assessing
      the long-term safety and efficacy of BF2.649 (Pitolisant)in the treatment of Excessive
      Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) in narcoleptic patients with or without cataplexy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In narcoleptic patients, results obtained in the previous studies showed that BF2.649 reduced
      significantly the diurnal somnolence compared to placebo confirming its wakening effect
      against EDS and demonstrating its anti-cataplectic effect when administrated on an individual
      titration scheme established on basis of individual benefit/tolerance ratio.This long-term
      safety pragmatic study will provide information about long-term treatment of BF2.649, and
      also allow patients who satisfy of BF2.649 treatment in previous or on-going studies of
      Bioprojet continuing to benefit this product.This is an open-label, naturalistic pragmatic,
      prospective longitudinal uncontrolled, multi-centre international trial assessing the safety
      and effect of long-term therapy of BF2.649 in treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in
      narcolepsy, on 12-month follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females, aged 18 years old and over.

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of narcolepsy according to the International Classification
             of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) criteria.

          -  Patients should have complained of EDS with an ESS score at least 12 (historical
             assessment).

          -  Patients having previously participated in and completed a Bioprojet narcolepsy study
             assessing BF2.649 efficacy (P05-03, P06-06, P07-03 HARMONY I or P07-07 HARMONY II,
             P09-15 HARMONY I bis) or narcoleptic patients complaining with EDS which in the
             opinion of the investigator would not be able to participate in a double blind study
             against placebo but who could benefit from testing a new therapy such as the BF2.649
             in an open label study.

        or patient receiving BF2.649(Pitolisant) under condition of&quot;ATU nominative&quot; according to
        the French law (called named temporary authorization of use approved by the Afssaps) for
        Excessive Daytime Sleepiness associated with narcolepsy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have discontinued study treatment during the previous studies due to
             adverse events related to BF2.649.

          -  Patients with an untreated sleep apnoea syndrome or who have any other cause of
             daytime sleepiness

          -  Patients working in an occupation requiring variable shift work or routine night
             shifts.

          -  Psychiatric and neurological disorders, other than narcolepsy/cataplexy, or other
             problem that in the investigator's opinion would preclude the patient's participation
             and completion of this trial or comprise reliable representation of subjective
             symptoms.

          -  Current or recent (within one year) history of a substance abuse or dependence
             disorder including alcohol abuse as defined in DSM-IV.

             neoplasic pathology which could interfere with the study conduct or counter-indicate
             the study treatments or place the patient at risk during the trial or compromise the
             study participation.

          -  Known history of long QTc syndrome, syncope or arrhythmia or any significant serious
             abnormality of the ECG (e.g. recent myocardial infarction), or QTc interval strictly
             higher than 450 ms (electrocardiogram Bazett's corrected QT interval

          -  Severe Hepatic Impairment or with Severe Renal Impairment, or with any other
             significant abnormality in the physical examination or clinical laboratory results.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the tested treatment including active substance and
             excipients.

          -  Participation in an other study - in the 30 days prior to the entry in this study
