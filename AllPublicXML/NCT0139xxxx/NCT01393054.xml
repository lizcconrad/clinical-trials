  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite of the development of new anti hypertensive agents, hypertension in elderly is still
      a big health problem. Nigella sativa seed extract, derived from a small plant originating in
      Middle east which can be found abundantly in Asia, has shown small antihypertensive effect in
      adult. Diuretic effect of Nigella sativa is thought to be the main mechanism for the effect
      but as it also shows anti-inflammatory and vasodilatory activity which are important
      contributors in arterial stiffness, the main pathogenesis of hypertension in elderly, thus it
      has a superior potential benefit for this population. We will conduct a randomized, double
      blind, placebo-controlled trial to prove the effect of Nigella sativa seed extract in elderly
      patients with hypertension. Our hypothesis is 300 mg Nigella sativa seed extract twice daily
      will have anti-hypertensive effect in the blood pressure of elderly with hypertension.

      Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia.

      Eligibility criteria are men and women over 60 years old and available to participate in the
      study for 4 weeks with blood pressure higher than 140/90.

      Exclusion criteria are renal disease, hepatic failure, dementia and orthostatic hypotension
      and malignant hypertension.

      Outcome measures are systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 4 weeks administration of
