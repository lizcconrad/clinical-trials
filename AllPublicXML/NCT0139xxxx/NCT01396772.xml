      The purpose of this study is to determine if a 6-month community-based prediabetes lifestyle
      and behaviour change intervention (called, PREPARE) for middle and older adults with
      prediabetes will result in positive lifestyle behaviour change.

    <textblock>
      This community-based, healthy lifestyle project targets middle (30-59) and older (60+) adults
      with prediabetes - a population known to be at high risk for Type 2 diabetes development.

      This project aims to create, deliver and evaluate a six month interdisciplinary education and
      lifestyle improvement intervention that emphasizes goal-setting and self-management
      approaches to inform, engage, monitor and support adults with prediabetes in making positive
      lifestyle changes within the London (Ontario, Canada) community.

      Participants are encouraged to reflect on their current lifestyle, resources and barriers,
      increase skills, motivation, and awareness of community resources, and make positive
      lifestyle changes. Based on a solid partnership between both community - health service
      providers and Brescia University College, the Prediabetes Initiative aims at empowering
      individuals with prediabetes through self-management approaches to reduce behaviours known to
      contribute to Type 2 diabetes development.
