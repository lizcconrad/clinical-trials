  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an optimal dose of [6R]
      5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (Modufolin) in combination with pemetrexed are effective in
      pre-operative treatment of patients with resectable rectal cancer.

    <measure>Feasibility of Pemetrexed Prior to Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>3 cycles (21-day cycles)</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility is defined as the ability to receive the total planned dose of pemetrexed (i.e., 1500 mg/m) administered over a period of no more than 9 weeks. Feasibility is measured as absence of the following toxicities:
CTC grade 4 lasting &gt;= 7 days, or febrile neutropenia
CTC grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 3 with bleeding.
CTC grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity (excluding nausea and vomiting, isolated CTC grade 3 ALT or AST that returns to the patient's pretreatment CTC grade within 3 weeks, or grade 3 fatigue lasting &lt;7 days).</description>

    <time_frame>Samples taken prior before study treatment, during 3 cycles of chemotherapy and after completion of study treatment. Expected average 20 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples are taken before start of study treatment, in conjunction with start of every study drug cycle, and after completed study treatment. HCy measurements performed using HPLC. 5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate is measured in tissue biopsies (tumor and adjacent mucosa) sampled in conjunction with surgery. The tissue is collected before start of study treatment, during and after completed study treatment. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate levels are measured using LC/MS/MS.</description>

    <time_frame>Tissue to be collected from tumor and adjacent mucosa before start of study treatment, during and after completed study treatment. Expected average 20 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>RT-PCR will be used to measure and determine the gene expression levels of the genes FPGS (Folylpolyglutamate synthase) and GGH (Gamma-glutamyl hydrolase). This translational research will be compared with the clinical outcome and toxicity profiles of patients.</description>
