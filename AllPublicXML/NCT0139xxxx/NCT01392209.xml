  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best dose of radiation to be given with bevacizumab is currently unknown. This study will
      use higher doses of radiation with bevacizumab than have been used before. This study will
      test the safety of radiation given at different doses with bevacizumab to find out what
      effects, good and/or bad, it has on the patient and the malignant glioma or related brain
      cancers.

    <description>Treatment: (until treatment failure): bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV once every two weeks on days 1 (+/- 3 days) and 15 (+/- 3 days) of every cycle (Cycle defined as 28 days). On day 28 (or up to 2 days before) of cycles 1 and 2 (and for every other cycle thereafter) patients will undergo a physical and radiological re-evaluation (MRI). Patients will begin stereotactic radiotherapy beginning anywhere from day 7 to day 10 of cycle 2 with escalating fraction sizes (interpatient - there is no intrapatient escalation). Assessment of response will be performed following cycles 1 and 2 then following every two cycles.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have EITHER

          -  Histologically confirmed intracranial malignant glioma of the following types:
             Glioblastoma, Anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO),
             Anaplastic oligo-astrocytoma (AOA) also called anaplastic mixed gliomas, Malignant
             glioma NOS (not otherwise specified). Patients will be eligible if the original
             histology was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of a high grade
             (malignant) glioma is made.

        OR

          -  Histologically confirmed low grade (WHO grade II) gliomas (such as low grade
             astrocytoma, low grade oligodendroglioma, low grade oligo-astrocytoma (mixed gliomas),
             or low grade glioma NOS) IF there is radiographic evidence by MRI of malignant
             transformation but histologic confirmation of high grade (malignant) transformation
             would not be otherwise undertaken for routine clinical care. Inclusion of patients in
             this group will allow increased accrual rapidity by enrolling patients who are
             otherwise ineligible for almost all malignant glioma trials yet whom are treated
             presumptively for malignant glioma. The primary aim of the phase I study is not
             determination of efficacy. Therefore, inclusion of such patients will not affect
             efficacy analyses.

        Participating site confirmation is adequate.

          -  Able to undergo brain MRI scans.

          -  MRI scan with gadolinium contrast showing geographically-circumscribed tumor ≤40 cc
             incorporating both enhancing and non-enhancing volume. This is calculated by the
             product of maximum measurements in 3 dimensions divided by 2. Tumors exceeding this
             limit may be eligible and any question should be directed to a Radiation Oncology
             Investigator and the MSK PI. (The MRI must be performed on a steroid dosage that has
             been stable or decreasing for at least 5 days. Patients on no steroids are eligible.
             If the steroid dose is increased between date of imaging and registration, a new
             baseline MRI is required).
