  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to survey the guideline compliance of the cardiologists in the
      treatment of systolic heart failure in Korea
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major improvement in the medical management of CHF has been achieved in the past decades.

      But there is no doubt that prognosis of heart failure patients remains poor. The compliance
      to the standard treatment can be one of reasons. But very little data concerning this in
      Korea is available.
