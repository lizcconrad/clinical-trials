  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a mounting evidence of the modulation properties of the major catechin in green tea,
      epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), on dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated
      kinase 1A (DYRK1A) gene overexpression in the brains of DS mouse models.The aims are to
      investigate the clinical benefits and safety of EGCG administration in young adults with DS,
      to establish short-term EGCG effects (three months) on neurocognitive performance, and to
      determine the persistency or reversibility of EGCG related effects after three months of
      discontinued use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             the consent to participate (official custody).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with neurological disease other than DS, relevant medical disease, co-morbid
             mental disorder or currently taking any treatment that could interfere with cognitive
             function or alter any key biomarkers and biochemical parameters analyzed.

          -  Having suffered from any major illness or undergoing major surgery in the last three
             months before the study;

          -  Regular ingestion of medication in the month preceding the study. Exceptions were made
             for single doses of symptomatic medication administered up to the week preceding the
             trial.

          -  History of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal problems or any other cause that may
             alter processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the drug, or
             that might suggest gastrointestinal irritation to drug.
