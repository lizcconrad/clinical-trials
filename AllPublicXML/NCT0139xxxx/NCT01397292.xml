      The purpose of this research study is to examine the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness
      of currently available pulmonary procedures when used to diagnose or treat different
      diseases.

      This study will collect information that may influence the outcome of the procedure and
      identify factors that may affect the procedures yield or safety. The information will be
      entered into a registry or data storage.

      This is a retrospective and prospective data registry of all pulmonary diagnostic and
      therapeutic interventional pulmonary procedures at a single academic center. All pulmonary
      procedures upon completion will be entered into a database by the participating investigator
      performing the procedure. For both diagnostic and therapeutic cases, the data will require
      additional input 1-4 weeks after the procedure in order to place the diagnosis and follow-up
      data. Retrospective data will only be collected for patients that had their procedures prior
      to approval of this registry.

      Study data will be collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture)
      electronic data (CTSA Awared - Award Number UL1RR031990) capture tools hosted at Virginia
      Commonwealth University. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data
      capture for research studies.

      The prison population will also be included in the registry in order to examine the effects
      of pulmonary procedures on a special population.
