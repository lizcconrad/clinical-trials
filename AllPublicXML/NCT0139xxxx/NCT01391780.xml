      Aims: To assess pelvic floor muscle (PFM) strength in women with stress urinary incontinence
      (SUI) and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI).

      Methods: 51 women were prospectively divided into two groups, according to the symptoms as
      SUI (G1 = 22) or UUI (G2 = 29). Demographic data, such as number of Pads/ 24 hours, number of
      micturitions/ 24 hours and nocturia, delay time of urgent void (i.e., the time period for
      which an urgent void could be voluntarily postponed), number of parity and vaginal deliveries
      were obtained using a clinical questionnaire. Objective urine loss was evaluated by 60-min
      Pad Test. Subjective [urine stream interruption test (UST), visual survey of perineal
      contraction and transvaginal digital palpation] and objective (vaginal manometry) evaluations
      of PFM were performed in all patients.

        The sample size was established considering a significance level of 5%, the test power of
        80%, and the estimated error of 10%. According to these results and considering the range
        between percentages of answers as the casual error, each group was established with
        approximately 20 participants.
