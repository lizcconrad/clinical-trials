    <time_frame>Continually from enrollment through Day 9 and at study discharge on Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation participant who has received an investigational (medicinal) product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. An SAE is an untoward medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is life-threatening or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization; is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention.</description>

    <time_frame>Day -1, Screening, and Days 1, 5, 9 and 10 (at study discharge)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure and heart rate were measured after the participant had been seated quietly for at least 5 minutes. ECG findings were recorded after the participant had been supine for at least 5 minutes. Clinically significant as reported by principal investigator.</description>

Participants were required to fast for a minimum of 4 hours prior to the collection of specimens for clinical laboratory tests at screening and for at least 8 hours prior to collection on Day -1. Marked abnormalities were reported for the treatment regiment that participants received just prior to clinical laboratory testing.</description>

        <description>An AE is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation participant who has received an investigational (medicinal) product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. An SAE is an untoward medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is life-threatening or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization; is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention.</description>
