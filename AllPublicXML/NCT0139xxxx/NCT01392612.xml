      We hypothesized that the effect of erythropoietin may be reflected by changes in thromboxane
      B2 (TXB2) and endothelial cell function.

      Six male and six female subjects received recombinant human epoetin alpha (Erypo®)
      intravenously (300 Units per kg). Biomarker levels were assessed at baseline and 4, 24, 48
      and 72 hours after administration.

      Introduction: Erythropoietin (EPO) enhances formation of red blood cells and also affects
      thrombopoiesis and platelet function. We hypothesized that the effect of erythropoietin may
      be reflected by changes in thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and endothelial cell function.

      Methods: Six male and six female subjects received recombinant human epoetin alpha (Erypo®)
      intravenously (300 Units per kg). Biomarker levels were assessed at baseline and 4, 24, 48
      and 72 hours after administration.

      Results: Epoetin alpha increased TXB2 levels, which reached significance at 48h (2.5- fold
      increase: 6.6±5ng/mL vs. 15±9ng/mL; p=0.044) and remained at that level at 72h. In line,
      epoetin alpha increased E-selectin levels by 25% already at 24h (39±21ng/ml vs. 49±26ng/ml;
      p&lt;0.001) and stayed at this level until 72h (p&lt;0.001). The raise in platelet activation
      markers corresponded with a 2-fold increase in reticulocyte count (81±17G/L vs. 43±10G/L;
      p&lt;0.001) and a 9% increase in platelet count at 72h (224±45G/L vs. 244±52G/L; p=0.005).
      Thrombomodulin and von Willebrand factor concentrations were not significantly altered by
      epoetin alpha. Interestingly, gender differences in the baseline levels of E-selectin and
      thrombomodulin were observed. E-selectin and thrombomodulin levels were doubled in men
      compared to women (51±24ng/mL and 28±10ng/mL; p=0.025 and 30±5ng/mL vs. 16±5ng/mL; p=0.002,
      respectively).

      Conclusion: Epoetin alpha increases levels of platelet activation markers. Further studies
      are needed to investigate whether measurement of TXB2 or E-selectin levels might be useful
      for estimation of thromboembolic risk during EPO-therapy.
