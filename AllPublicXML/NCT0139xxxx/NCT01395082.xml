      The purpose of this registry is to study the natural history of vaccination-related
      myocarditis and pericarditis and to assess possible risk factors for these conditions.

      Primary Objective:

      - To document the natural history of confirmed, probable, suspected, and subclinical
      myocarditis and pericarditis (myopericarditis) following ACAM2000® vaccination.

      Other Pre-defined Objective:

      - To look for potential predictive factors for the prognosis of myopericarditis following
      ACAM2000® vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will have received previous vaccination with ACAM2000 but will not receive
      any vaccination as part of the registry. All participants enrolled in the registry will be
      followed for 2 up to 5 years (depending on whether there are persisting signs and symptoms of
      myopericarditis).
