    <textblock>
      This study will compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of grazoprevir (MK-5172) when administered
      to participants with mild, moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency (assessed by the criteria
      of the Child-Pugh's scale) with the PK of grazoprevir when administered to healthy
      participants.
