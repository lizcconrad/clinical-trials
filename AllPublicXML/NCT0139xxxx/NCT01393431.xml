  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measurement of pH in Exhaled breath condensate has been mentioned as a robust variable from
      lung inflammation. It is non-invasive and reproducible. The investigators measured pH in the
      water condensed in the trap of expiratory arm of ventilator.In ICU the investigators measured
      pH in condensed water without interfering with patients treatment. A group of critically ill
      patients mechanically ventilated due to non pulmonary cause were followed until successful
      weaning, death or pneumonia. The investigators found that pH did not change along the study
      and it did not predict worsening condition.

      Collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) became a promising method for obtaining samples
      from the lungs. In this prospective clinical trial we aimed to answer if spontaneous EBC in
      the trap of the expiratory arm of the ventilator could replace EBC collected by coolant
      chamber with gas standardization with Argon as an inert gas. Second, if EBC pH could predict
      ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and mortality. We included a group of critically ill
      patients, that required mechanical ventilation due to non-pulmonary cause. The patients were
      followed up until development of VAP, successful weaning or death.EBC pH spontaneously
      collected in the trap of expiratory arm of the ventilator. We measured pH with a blood gas
      analyzer, named Radiometer ABL5 Copenhagen. For the coolant chamber EBC pH measurement, the
      expiratory arm was passed through the chamber at -3ºC and in 10 min at least 2 ml was
      collected. The rest of the EBC was collected in Ependorff tube and pH was measured after
      de-aeration of the condensate with argon (350 ml/min) for 10 min as a gas standardization
      procedure as previously described by Hunt and colleagues. [Hunt JF, Fang K, Malik R, Snyder

      asthma pathophysiology. Am J Resp Crit Care Med 2000; 161: 694-699. ]

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    IRB recommended to stop the trial becasue none of the 4 procedures showed a predictive value
    for VAP, duration of MV or mortality.
