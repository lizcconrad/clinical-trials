    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as a blinded, randomized and parallel group study to investigate the
      clinically recommended dosage for ASP7374 based on the comparison of the immunogenicity and
      safety among two doses of subcutaneous ASP7374 and one dose of intramuscular ASP7374 in
      healthy adults.
