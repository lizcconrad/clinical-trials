  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incretin-based therapy for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is
      new and fundamentally different from the classical treatments with oral antidiabetic agents
      and insulin. The novel and original aspect of this investigator-initiated study is the focus
      on treatment with an incretin-based agent (the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide) in T2D patients
      with severely reduced kidney function. At present there is virtually no knowledge of the
      physiology and clinical implications of the role of incretin hormones and incretin-based
      therapy in this group of diabetic patients.The aim of the study is to establish an
      evidence-based rationale for introducing a GLP-1 analogue to the limited armamentarium of
      antidiabetic drugs for patients with type T2D and severe renal insufficiency. The overall
      hypothesis is that patients with T2D and severe renal insufficiency will tolerate and benefit
      from treatment with the GLP-1 analogue liraglutide, hereby improving glycaemic control and
      reducing risk factors of cardiovascular disease
