  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the addition of dutasteride to a
      regimen with abiraterone acetate and prednisone will improve on therapy in patients with
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer and metastatic disease. This study will also help
      determine the side effects of the study treatment and how often they occur.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive abiraterone acetate and prednisone orally, once daily for 2 months (2
      cycles) on an outpatient basis. At the start of cycle 3, dutasteride will be taken once
      daily. Patients will return to the clinic on Day 14 of the first 3 cycles for routine blood
      tests.

      Patients will come to the clinic every 12 weeks for a CT scan and/or x-ray of the chest, CT
      scan or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis, bone scan, and blood test for testosterone and other
      specialized blood test.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Androgen Receptor (AR) Related Mutations</measure>
    <time_frame>Pairs of patients samples were evaluated at baseline and time of progression. In this study cohort, participants were followed up to 48 months for this endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>AR related mutation was defined as presence of T878A mutation. Expression of T878A was measured by established methods.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Serum Levels of Testosterone</measure>
    <time_frame>Samples for testosterone analyses were obtained at baseline and at time of progression. In this study cohort, participants were followed up to 48 months for this endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>Serum testosterone levels were estimated based on established methods. The change from baseline to progression was calculated for each participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Response</measure>
    <time_frame>PSA was measured at baseline and day 1 of every cycle on treatment. In this study cohort, participants were followed up to 48 months for this endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>PSA response was defined as decline of 50% from baseline confirmed by a PSA at least 4 weeks later based on Prostate-specific Antigen Working Group-2 (PSAWG-2) (2008) criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to PSA Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>PSA was measured at baseline and day 1 of every cycle on treatment. In this study cohort, participants were followed up to 48 months for this endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to PSA progression based on the Kaplan-Meier method was defined as the time between registration and documented PSA progression. PSA progression based on Prostate-Specific Antigen Working Group-2 (PSAWG-2) (2008) criteria was an increase of &gt;/=25% and &gt;/= 2 ng/ml after 12 weeks for patients without a PSA decline from baseline and an increase of &gt;/=25% and &gt;/= 2 ng/ml above the nadir, confirmed by a 2nd value 3 weeks or later for patients with a PSA decline from baseline. PSA progression was reported not duration of response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Best Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 12 weeks cycles on treatment. In this study cohort, participants were followed up to 48 months for this endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response (OR) rate was defined as achieving partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) based on RECIST 1.0 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria are first met. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease evaluation occurred every 12 weeks while patients were receiving treatment. In this study cohort, participants were followed up to 48 months for this endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>TTP based on the Kaplan-Meier method is defined as the duration of time from study entry to documented first observation of progressive disease (PD). Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or appearance of new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence of AR Amplification</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients' samples were evaluated at baseline and every 12 weeks on treatment. In this study cohort, participants were followed up to 48 months for this endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of AR amplification was measured by established methods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Serum Androgen Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Pairs of patients' samples for androgen analyses were obtained at baseline and at time of progression. In this study cohort, participants were followed up to 48 months for this endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>Serum androgen levels measured based on established methods. The change from baseline to progression was calculated for each participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Pairs of patients' samples were evaluated at baseline and time of progression. In this study cohort, participants were followed up to 48 months for this endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>CTCs were measured based on established methods.</description>

        <title>Best Overall Response</title>
        <description>Overall response (OR) rate was defined as achieving partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) based on RECIST 1.0 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.0 for target lesions, CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria are first met. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>

      <desc>Maximum grade toxicity by type for a patient over time including only treatment-related events (possible, probable or definite attribution) was first calculated. Patients appear once for a given toxicity type. Serious and Other Adverse Events (AEs) were defined as events of grades 3-5 and grades 1-2, respectively, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAEv4). 'Other’ events have no further specification.</desc>
