      This study histologically evaluates sites grafted with NuOss XC using ridge preservation
      techniques prior to placement of dental implants. Sites grafted with NuOss XC (bovine bone
      mineral with self-expanding collagen) will be compared to sites grafted with NuOss
      particulate (bovine bone mineral).

      Patients presenting to the University of Oklahoma College of Dentistry Graduate Periodontics
      Clinic who are treatment planned for tooth extraction and placement of dental implant(s) will
      be interviewed for possible participation in the study. Forty extraction sites will be
      included in this study to provide statistical significance.

      The ridge preservation sites, using either NuOss XC or NuOss particulate, will be selected
      randomly. The first site will be selected using the flip of a coin. Thereafter, every other
      site will be grafted using NuOs XC. The ridge preservation procedure will involve tooth
      extraction with as little trauma as possible to preserve all four bony socket walls,
      curettage of the socket to remove all periodontal ligament fibers and granulation tissue,
      placement of the graft material into the socket and coverings the graft material with
      long-lasting collagen membrane. Facial and lingual mucoperiosteal flaps will be elevated to
      facilitate securing of the membrane with long-lasting absorbable sutures. Patient will be
      given prescriptions for analgesics and antibiotics as necessary.

    <description>Histological processing: Specimens to be trimmed and embedded in methyl methacrylate (MMA). One hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained section, and one Goldner's trichrome-stained section to be taken from each block in a longitudinal plane through the approximate center of each defect.
Goldner's trichrome-stained slides to be scored for the presence of bone and bone marrow as a percent of the total defect area.
H&amp;E-stained slides to be used to evaluate residual collagen and residual bone mineral as a percent of the total defect area.</description>

             placement of NuOss XC or NuOss particulate

          -  must have at least one single-rooted tooth to be extracted

          -  must consent to tooth extractions, socket augmentation and implant placement
