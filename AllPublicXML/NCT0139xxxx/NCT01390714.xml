  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics of
      E3710 following oral administration to Healthy Male Japanese Subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in healthy, male, Japanese subjects using an open-label,
      randomized, crossover design with comparison under multiple oral doses of E3710. Rabeprazole
      or Esomeprazole will be used in this study as marketed comparators. In each arm,
      pharmacodynamics will be measured in regard to intragastric pH. The measurements will be
      recorded using a pH probe with esophageal measurement capability for 24 hours post-dose.
      Pharmacokinetics measurements will also be conducted in all dosing stages for collecting
      serial blood samples.
