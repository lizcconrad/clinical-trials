  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether essential polyunsaturated acids (omega 3)
      are capable of reducing chocolate craving symptoms in healthy patients.

      Our hypothesis is that the omega 3 fatty acids have properties which stabilize and normalize
      neuronal functioning in many conditions, including chocolate craving.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyunsaturated fatty acids (of the omega 3 subtype) are fundamental in human diet, as they
      are components of cellular membranes, guaranteeing their fluidity and their functions of
      separating intracellular and extracellular means and transporting several substances to and
      from cellular microenvironment.

      Modern theories profess that lack of omega 3 fatty acids in western diets may be the cause of
      several deletery changes in neuronal physiology, which may cause or make worse several
      pathological conditions, such as depression, mood instability, and drug craving. The role of
      serotonin as the main lacking component in the conditions is well documented, and it is
      thought that omega 3 is important in the synthesis, transportation, and ultimately the
      activity of this neurotransmitter.

      Out theory states that supplementation with these acids can restore normal neuron balance,
      improving the condition of chocolate craving patients.

    <description>The MBES is an objective scale used to quantify compulsion and classify chocolate cravers in three categories: low, moderate and severe cravers. The scale was applied to all volunteers at baseline and 2 months after enrollment in the study, and comparisons were made to establish if there was efficacy of treatment with omega 3 when compared with placebo (with decreased grades in the MBES scale).</description>
