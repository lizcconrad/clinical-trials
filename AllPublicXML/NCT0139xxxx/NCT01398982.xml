    <textblock>
      Breast reconstruction using a patient's own abdominal tissue is one of the most common
      methods for restoring mastectomy defects for breast cancer patients. Despite its increasing
      popularity and safety, the abdomen remains a major source of postoperative pain. Adequate
      pain control is important as it has been shown to reduce medical complications, in-hospital
      death, shortens hospital stay, lessen chronic pain and disability, and in turn lower
      health-care costs. The current postoperative pain relief protocol consists primarily of a
      patient-controlled anesthesia device delivering intravenous opioids. Opioids can cause
      numerous side-effects such as sedation, headache, nausea, vomiting, breathing difficulties,
      bladder and bowel dysfunction. A promising approach to provide postoperative pain control of
      the abdominal incision is the newly developed transversus abdominis plane (TAP) peripheral
      nerve block. Although the TAP block has been found to be an effective pain-relief following
      major abdominal surgeries, its use has never been studied for breast reconstruction using
      abdominal tissue. Therefore, the investigators propose to rigorously study the efficacy of a
      TAP block in reducing postoperative abdominal pain following abdominal tissue breast
      reconstruction. This study has significant implications in improving both clinical care and
      health outcomes in patients undergoing this common method of breast reconstruction technique.

      1. Statement of Objectives/Specific Aims

      The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a newly developed block involving T6-L1 nerves
      that supply the anterior abdominal wall. Its effectiveness has been reported following major
      abdominal surgeries, but not following abdominally-based autologous tissue breast
      reconstruction. Thus, we propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to
      evaluate the efficacy of TAP block in improving pain symptomatology following
      abdominally-based, autologous tissue breast reconstruction.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the mean total opioid consumption in the
      first postoperative 48 hours between the control and study groups in intravenous morphine
      equivalent units. By directly blocking the neural afferents, the mean opioid consumption will
      be significantly lower in the group receiving intermittent local anaesthetic boluses compared
      to the placebo group through a TAP catheter.

      The secondary outcomes of interest are to compare the following parameters:

      A. Continuous outcomes i. Total in-hospital cumulative opioid consumption ii. Total
      in-hospital cumulative anti-nausea consumption iii. Quality of Recovery (QOR) score (0-18)
      iv. Duration of hospital stay

      B. Repeated measures outcomes

      In Hospital postoperative measures:

      i. Daily pain intensity scores at rest and with movement using a visual pain analogue scale
      (0-10) ii. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (score of 0-3) iii. Sedation score

      Long-term chronic pain, anxiety, function, and quality of life (QOL) measures:

      iv. Pain disability index v. Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire vi. Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale vii. Short-form 36

      C. Time to event outcomes i. Time to first bowel movement ii. Time to ambulation

      Hypothesis: Compared to the control group, the TAP block group will have a statistically
      significant reduction in total in-hospital consumption of opioids, pain scores and
      side-effects from opioid use such as sedation, nausea, and vomiting. This should also result
      in a greater QOR score in the TAP block group. Surgical milestones such as time to
      ambulation, first bowel movement, and duration of hospital stay will also be reduced in the
      TAP block group. In addition, we hypothesize less acute postoperative pain achieved using the
      TAP block will result in a reduction in chronic pain and disability, anxiety and depression,
      and improved QOL in the long-term.

        <title>Mean Total Opioid Consumption</title>
        <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the mean total opioid consumption in the first postoperative 48 hours between the control and study groups in intravenous morphine equivalent units. By directly blocking the neural afferents, the mean opioid consumption will be significantly lower in the group receiving intermittent local anaesthetic boluses compared to the placebo group through a TAP catheter.</description>

            <description>At the conclusion of the surgery, a 0.2 mL/kg bolus of 0.25% Bupivacaine or Saline will be injected through each catheter in the OR. At midnight following the OR, 0.2mL/Kg of 0.25% Bupivacaine or Saline will be injected through each catheter every 8 hours for the next 2 postoperative days by a MD member of the pain team. At 8am on postoperative day 3, the TAP catheters were removed by the pain team. Our rationale for decreasing the frequency of intermittent boluses from every 12 hours to 8 hours in this study design was based on our finding in the pilot study that patients frequently used more PCA between 8-12 hours following Bupivacaine bolus as the effect of the anaesthetic agent weaned off.</description>
