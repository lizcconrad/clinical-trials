  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The test agent in this study is a product of biphenylmethyl dicarboxylate (BDD) with garlic
      oil. The two components were confirmed to have complementary effects because of different
      operational mechanism in animal experiments, and were examined on humans in this study. Both
      BDD and garlic oil are expected to show better protection and treatment on hepatotoxicity
      caused by toxic substances, and the purpose of this study is to confirm efficacy of and
      safety on human body of the agent and to determine its optimal dose.
