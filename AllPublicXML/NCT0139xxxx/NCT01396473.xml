  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to design and conduct research to tailor out of school time
      evaluation materials so they are applicable to various settings in Boston, are efficient in
      that minimal resources and time are used, and are useful to participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly half of Boston's school age children (49%) participate in out of school time programs,
      a critical time to intervene on physical activity and nutrition. Previous research has mostly
      focused on during-school-day efforts, or on child care policies and practices for very young
      children, leaving a gap in the knowledge of what might work with programs serving school-age
      children during out of school time. OSNAP aims to implement low cost and sustainable policy
      and environmental interventions to improve physical activity and healthy eating/beverage
      environments. Data will be collected via observations, plate waste and accelerometers on
      program policies, environments, practices and behavioral outcomes related to physical
      activity, beverage, snack and screen time outcomes.

    <description>Afterschool programs participate in an assessment of physical activity and nutrition practices and policies. Study staff work with teams of afterschool programs in a participatory manner to identify areas in which programs would like to take practice, policy and communication efforts to meet physical activity and nutrition goals. Teams share progress and barriers during ongoing collaborative meetings.</description>
