  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to investigate new techniques to guide the appropriate
      diagnosis and treatment of Ductal Carcinoma In-situ (DCIS). The microvascularity and
      stiffness of the lesion may be prognostic factors that can guide the need for more or less
      extensive therapy or perhaps only imaging follow-up may be needed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who have imaging findings suggestive of DCIS, who are having breast ultrasound and who
      are candidates for surgery will be eligible. They will receive a contrast-enhanced breast
      ultrasound after the intravenous injection of a microbubble contrast agent which will show
      the microvascularity. A subset of women will also have ultrasound elastography performed of
      the abnormality to evaluate its stiffness.
