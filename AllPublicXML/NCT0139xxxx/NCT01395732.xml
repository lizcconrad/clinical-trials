  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of bosentan on digital ulcers (DU) was studied in two randomized
      placebo-controlled trials (RAPIDS-1 and RAPIDS-2). A limitation of these studies was the
      heterogeneous study population. More importantly, there were no endpoints that assessed
      changes in vasculopathy and / or perfusion. Laser Doppler imaging has been shown to
      effectively demonstrate blood flow restrictions in the hands of patients with Systemic
      Sclerosis (SSc). The relation between blood flow restriction in the hands measured by laser
      Doppler imaging and the extent of DU disease has not been studied. The current study will
      attempt to demonstrate this relation. In addition, the impact of bosentan on the blood flow
      in the hands, in a defined cohort of SSc-DU patients with a history of DU within the past 2
      years and a clinically relevant reduction of blood flow in the hands, will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects &gt; 18 years diagnosed with SSc;

          -  Reduction of blood flow measured by laser Doppler imaging, of at least 50%, distally
             to the proximal interphalangeal joint, compared to the healthy volunteers;
