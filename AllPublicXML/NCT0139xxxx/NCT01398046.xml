  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of a natural supplement (betaine
      hydrochloride) to affect the absorption of dasatinib in healthy volunteers. The investigators
      predict that betaine hydrochloride will increase the absorption of dasatinib, in volunteers
      pre-treated with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).

    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be dasatinib area-under-the-concentration curve (AUC) values from zero-to-twenty two (0-22) hours. Values from Experiemntal Arms of the study (Dasatinib plus Rabeprazole; Dasatinib plus Rabeprazole AND Betaine Hydrochloride) will be compared against the active comparator (dasatinib alone) and tested for statistical significance.</description>

    <description>The primary outcome measure will be dasatinib area-under-the-concentration curve (AUC) values from zero-to-infinite time (0-inf). Values from Experiemntal Arms of the study (Dasatinib plus Rabeprazole; Dasatinib plus Rabeprazole AND Betaine Hydrochloride) will be compared against the active comparator (dasatinib alone) and tested for statistical significance.</description>

    <description>The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) will also be measured. Values from Experiemntal Arms of the study (Dasatinib plus Rabeprazole; Dasatinib plus Rabeprazole AND Betaine Hydrochloride) will be compared against the active comparator (Dasatinib alone) and tested for statistical significance.</description>
