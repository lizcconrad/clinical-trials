      Clinical study investigating the feasibility and safety of using an anchored Calypso
      transponder in the airways of the lung for real-time monitoring of tumor location during
      radiotherapy
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Calypso anchored lung transponders are a modified version of the previously FDA-cleared
      Calypso soft tissue transponders. This modification includes an anchoring mechanism to hold
      the transponder positionally stable within small airways of the lung. Transponders are placed
      locally to the tumor within the lung and during subsequent radiotherapy the Calypso system
      may be used to monitor the location of the transponders and, by extension, the tumor, in
      real-time. This allows for improved tumor-targeting as well as gating of the radiation beam
      when the tumor moves outside the target field during respiratory motion.

      The goals of this investigation are to show that patients with implanted anchored
      transponders can be localized with the Calypso System, that anchored transponder implantation
      and use are feasible and safe, and that anchored transponders are positionally stable in the
      small airways of patients with cancer of the lung.

    <time_frame>1-2 weeks following implantation</time_frame>
    <description>Whether a patient can be localized by the Calypso System using the anchored transponders will be determined during the first week (i.e., the first five fractions) of radiation therapy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the implantation procedure of the anchored transponder in the lung</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks following implantation</time_frame>
    <description>The implantation procedure of the anchored transponder in the lung will be assessed with respect to a number of criteria: ability to implant transponders where intended, implanting physician's satisfaction with the process, and geometric configuration of the implanted transponders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the positional stability of the anchored transponders short term through the completion of radiotherapy and long term through one year of follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>1-14 months, depending on the duration of radiotherapy and time between follow-up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The positional stability of the anchored transponder configuration will be assessed using changes in intertransponder distance. Inter-transponder distance will be calculated from CT scans acquired at treatment planning (baseline), 2-4 subsequent follow-up CT scans acquired during radiation therapy, and 4 follow-up CT scans taking place between 10-13 months post-radiotherapy</description>

    <time_frame>Time of implantation through the completion of the follow-up period of the study (0-14 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events associated with the anchored transponder and implantation procedure from the time of implantation through the completion of the follow-up period will be recorded and assessed.</description>

    <time_frame>Depending on the type of radiation treatment, this will take place over the course of 1-2 weeks or 1-7 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>To calculate the potential reduction in volume and dose of normal lung irradiated when a reduced margin is used for the planning target volume</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 weeks following implantation</time_frame>
    <description>To calculate the potential reduction in volume and dose of normal lung irradiated when routine institutional planning target volume margins are reduced to a margin of 0.5 cm circumferentially made possible by realtime localization and tracking of the tumor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years at time of consent (19 years if required by local or state laws)

          -  Patients planning to undergo radiation therapy for primary or recurrent carcinomas of
             the lung or cancer that is metastatic to the lung.

          -  Patients who are to receive 30 Gy or more of external beam radiation therapy.

          -  Patients who are able to tolerate flexible bronchoscopy.

          -  Patients with life expectancy of at least 12 months and who are expected to be able to
             complete the full follow-up assessment in the protocol.

          -  Patients for whom the physician is able to identify suitable implantation sites for
             the anchored transponders on a recent (within the past 8 weeks) CT scan. This will
             require acquisition of a CT scan if a suitable one is not already available.

          -  Patients who are able to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with implants in the chest region that contain metal or conductive materials
             (e.g., metal implants, rods, or plates) which the Sponsor considers will interfere
             with the Calypso System's electromagnetic localization (note that the Sponsor will
             review a patient's implanted metal on a case by case basis).

          -  Patients with active implanted devices, such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and drug
             infusion pumps since the effect of the Calypso System operation on these devices is
             unknown.

          -  Patients with active infections.

          -  Patients with bronchiectasis in the lobe of the intended implantation sites.

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to nickel.

          -  Patients whose lung tumors are being monitored with MR imaging (MR imaging of the
             anchored transponders is safe but yields an image artifact around the anchored
             transponders).

          -  Patients with any other medical condition or laboratory value that would, at the
             discretion of the investigator, preclude the patient from participation in this
             clinical study.

          -  Patients enrolled in any other clinical studies the investigator believes to be in
             conflict with this investigation.
