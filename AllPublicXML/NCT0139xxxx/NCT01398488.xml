      Experimental intervention:

      Patient education after lung transplantation via Tablet computers. An electronic patient
      questionnaire via tablet computer will be collected in addition.

      Control intervention:

      Conventional Patient education by health care professionals. A paper-based patient
      questionnaire will be provided.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Noncompliance with immunosuppressive medications after organ transplantation is thought to be
      a leading cause of allograft rejection, graft loss, and death. Immunosuppressant medy to
      prevent graft rejection after lung transplantation.

      Reported non-compliance rates with calcineurin inhibitors are ranging between 13 and 22 %
      after lung transplantation. Incidence of non-compliance increases over time after
      transplantation. Increased health care costs, decreased quality of life, and organ failure
      (incl. the need for re-do transplantation) are possible consequences of immunosuppressant
      noncompliance. Therefore, medication compliance defined as the extent to which a patient's
      medication taking behaviour coincides with the prescribed regimen, is a critical issue in
      transplantation. Repeated patient education is one option to overcome non-adherence and
      immunosuppressive medication non-compliance.

      Immunosuppressive therapy is monitored by measurement of drug levels. Fluctuating drug levels
      increase the risk for rejection and drug toxicities. In addition, frequent dose adjustments,
      case management and frequent monitoring of drug levels are cost-intensive.
