  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of two doses of LP08
      compared to placebo. Hypothesis: Safety of the LP-08 therapy will not be significantly
      different from the placebo group. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: A matched-pair data analysis
      design will be employed, i.e. the measured outcomes will be subjects' improvements in
      quantitative and qualitative measures of the disease condition being assessed prior to and
      after LP-08 instillations at four and eight weeks follow-up visits

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study
      including male and female subjects with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS)
      as determined by a physician using the current diagnostic criteria for IC/BPS. A total of 36
      subjects will be enrolled at up to five (5) study sites in the U.S. Enrollment is expected to
      be completed within one year of initiating the study. The study is comprised of two parts.
      The first part of the study is a dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of LP-08 at 20 mg and 80 mg doses as
      compared with placebo. The second part of the study is an Open Label Extension study of the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of LP-08 80 mg. Subjects randomized to the placebo control
      group must have completed the randomized portion study, including the eight week follow-up
      period, to be eligible for the Open Label Extension.
