    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cosmetic performance of AIR OPTIX® COLORS
      contact lenses compared to FRESHLOOK® COLORBLENDS contact lenses in habitual FRESHLOOK®
      COLORBLENDS contact lens wearers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this non-dispensing trial, each participant wore 4 pairs of color contact lenses (gray,
      blue, green, hazel) sequentially for less than 10 minutes each in a contralateral fashion
      (test lens in one eye, control lens in the other eye). Randomization took place for each of
      the 4 pairs of lenses as to which eye (left or right) wore the test and which wore the
      control. Participants were selected based on eye color (dark vs light/medium). The primary
      analysis population (AP1) was pre-specified as participants of any eye color who habitually
      wore FRESHLOOK® COLORBLENDS lenses in one of the four colors tested in this trial. Pair 1
      lenses were dispensed per the participant's habitual lens color.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 2-10 minutes after lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>The participant compared Pair 1 study lenses on eye and indicated overall preference using a 4-point Likert scale (prefer lens in the left eye, prefer lens in the right eye, no preference, or both eyes are equal). Overall preference is reported as the percentage of participants who preferred the study lens. Each lens was assessed separately. This outcome measure was pre-specified for Analysis Population 1 (AP1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Initial Comfort Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 2 minutes after lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>The participant compared the initial comfort (way it feels) of Pair 1 study lenses and indicated preference using a 4-point Likert scale (prefer lens in the left eye, prefer lens in the right eye, no preference, or both eyes are equal). Initial comfort preference is reported as the percentage of participants who preferred the study lens. Each lens was assessed separately. This outcome measure was pre-specified for Analysis Population 1 (AP1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Appearance Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 2-10 minutes after lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>The participant compared the appearance (way it looks) of Pair 1 study lenses on eye and indicated preference using a 4-point Likert scale (prefer lens in the left eye, prefer lens in the right eye, no preference, or both eyes are equal). Appearance preference is reported as the percentage of participants who preferred the study lens. Each lens was assessed separately. This outcome measure was pre-specified for Analysis Population 1 (AP1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Rating of Initial Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 2 minutes after lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>The participant compared the initial comfort (way it feels) of Pair 1 study lenses and rated initial comfort using a 10-point scale (1=poor, 10=excellent). Each lens was assessed separately. This outcome measure was pre-specified for Analysis Population 1 (AP1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Positive Responses: Cosmetic Appearance (Strongly Agree, Agree)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 2-10 minutes after lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>The participant compared the cosmetic appearance of Pair 1 study lenses on eye and answered 9 appearance-related questions using a 4-point Likert scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). The combined percentage of the top two responses (strongly agree, agree) is reported for each question. Each lens was assessed separately. This outcome measure was pre-specified for Analysis Population 1 (AP1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Positive Purchase Intent (Definitely Would Buy, Probably Would Buy)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, 2-10 minutes after lens insertion</time_frame>
    <description>The participant compared Pair 1 study lenses and indicated purchase intent by answering the following question, &quot;Assuming these lenses were at a price you would expect to pay, how likely would you be to purchase these lenses?&quot; using a 5-point Likert scale (definitely would buy, probably would buy, might or might not buy, probably would not buy, definitely would not buy). The combined percentage of the top two responses (definitely would buy, probably would buy) is reported. Each lens was assessed separately. This outcome measure was pre-specified for Analysis Population 1 (AP1).</description>
