  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that pre-application of Qutenza® patches to the skin may reduce
      pain at the site of Remodulin® SC infusion (sited 1 to 2 weeks later at the site of Qutenza
      pre-application), in which case it would greatly improve the quality of life of the patients,
      and enable many more to continue with this treatment. It may also provide new information to
      support the use of Qutenza® patches for preventing and reducing pain produced by
      inflammation.

      The present study will explore the efficacy of single applications of Qutenza® (capsaicin 8%
      patch) in reducing site pain caused by continuous SC infusion of Remodulin®, in pulmonary
      arterial hypertension patients, as assessed by changes in subjective pain rating score and/or
      pain and sensory testing.

    <measure>Safety Measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 9 months (vital signs, AE's and concomitant medications will be recorded throughout the study)</time_frame>
    <description>Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, intensity and type of AEs and clinically significant changes in vital signs (pulse rate, blood pressure, respiration rate, pulse oximetry and temperature), and changes in concomitant medications throughout the study.
Evaluation of safety will also be based on subject's physical examination, signs and symptoms of PAH, routine clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, coagulation panel, and urinalysis), ECG, and NYHA (WHO) classification at the screening and end of study follow up visits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy measure - change in mean NPRS score</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 9 months. Average daily NPRS scores from Weeks 1 and 2 of each treatment period will be expressed as percentage changes from the average daily NPRS score at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy measure will be the change in mean NPRS pain score (reduced by greater than 1.1) at the site of Remodulin® SC infusion, following Qutenza® or transparent adhesive control dressing (Tegaderm film 10cmx12cm) in combination with 0.075% capsaicin cream (Axsain®), during two treatment periods. Efficacy of Qutenza® relative to the control will also be assessed on PGIC, as well as sensory tests and flare area.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older with symptomatic PAH

          -  Willing to provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  With documented diagnosis of PAH, either idiopathic, familial or associated with
             connective tissue disease, congenital heart disease or the use of anorexogenic drugs.

          -  Documented haemodynamic diagnosis of PAH by right heart catheterization - performed at
             any time prior to screening, showing: mean pulmonary arterial pressure &gt;25 mm Hg,
             pulmonary capillary wedge pressure =/&lt; 15 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance &gt;240
             dynes/sec/cm

          -  Receiving stable doses of Remodulin® SC, continuously infused at a dose of at least
             2.5 ng/kg/min for at least 8 weeks prior to enrolment. Additional medications that are
             approved for treatment of PAH (either bosentan or sildenafil) and other supplementary
             treatments such as oral anticoagulants, diuretics, digitalis, calcium channel blockers
             or oxygen supplementation are permitted.

          -  History of pain at the site of Remodulin® SC infusion for at least 8 weeks prior to
             enrolment and as assessed on the 11 point pain intensity numerical pain rating scale
             (NPRS) from 0 to 10, where 0 represents &quot;No pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;Maximum pain
             imaginable&quot;. Patients with a history of pain intensity equal or greater than 3 NPRS
             points (as determined by the NPRS trial diary completed during the screening period)
