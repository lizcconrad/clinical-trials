    <textblock>
      Asthma, a chronic disease which produces significant morbidity and mortality in children, is
      a significant health problem to a large segment of society. Despite considerable advances in
      the diagnosis and treatment of asthma over the past several years, a sizeable portion of
      patients do not respond to the &quot;core&quot; treatments. The investigators are now learning that the
      underlying pathophysiology of disease is different among patients with asthma therefore;
      treatments which are beneficial in some patient groups may be not achieve affect in other
      groups.

      Antihistamines have been studied in the past for the treatment of asthma. These studies have
      shown that there may be a beneficial effect of antihistamines in patients with allergic
      asthma where histamine likely plays a large role in disease and treatment response. However,
      there is not enough evidence to include these drugs in the standard treatment of asthma.

      The investigators hypothesize that histamine plays a definable, significant role in disease
      pathogenesis and treatment response in children with allergic asthma. The investigators plan
      to test this overall hypothesis through two specific aims. The first aim will characterize
      the relative contribution of histamine in allergic vs. non-allergic asthma. This aim will be
      accomplished by comparison of the microvasculature response to histamine in children with
      allergic asthma and children with non-allergic asthma, measured by histamine iontophoresis
      with laser Doppler (HILD) monitoring, to determine potential phenotype-associated differences
      in the pharmacodynamic response to histamine. The investigators will also investigate the
      role of genetic variation in the observed differences in HILD between the two groups. The
      second aim will characterize the pharmacodynamic response to antihistamines via HILD in
      children with an exaggerated histamine response compared to children with a low histamine
      response. This aim will be accomplished through conduct of a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled cross-over trial of levocetirizine (LCT) in the two groups (high histamine
      and low histamine) and observing the difference in antihistamine pharmacodynamics in the two
      groups. The investigators will also investigate the effect of pharmacokinetic variation and
      genetic variation in the histamine pathway on the observed pharmacodynamic drug response.
