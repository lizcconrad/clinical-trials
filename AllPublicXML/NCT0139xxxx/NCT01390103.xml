    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of hip injections on hip biomechanics
      in patients with hip pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the immediate biomechanical effect in patients that receive a hip injection.</measure>
    <time_frame>The short-term biomechanical effects of the hip will be evaluated within 1 hour of the patient receiving the injection.</time_frame>
    <description>The biomechanical assessment of gait will consist of walking on a gait mat. The mat is a specialized pressure sensor system. Prior to data collection, each participant will walk across the mat three times for acclimation. The first assessment will include a walk at a self-selected, comfortable pace across the mat, repeated three times. The second assessment will include walking as quickly as possible, also repeated three times.</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Hip Pain Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Within 1 hour of hip injection, 2 weeks post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Oswestry Hip Pain Disability Questionnaire. This a standard, well validated questionnaire to assess disability caused by hip pain. The questionnaire is a 10-item scale, ranging from 0 to 100%, to obtain a score for functional disability caused by hip pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Within 1 hour of injection, 2 weeks post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a global health assessment questionnaire ranging from 0 to 100%, to score self-experienced health related to quality of life. Items are grouped into two domains from which an overall summary score, a physical component score and a mental component score can be derived. A high score on each of the scales reflects a high level of self-experienced health</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>10 centimeter Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Within 1 hour of injection, 2 weeks post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>Hip pain is a symptom that affects the overall Quality Of Life. Hip pain intensity will be self-assessed by a 10 cm visual analogue scale with terminal descriptors (anchors of 0 cm = no pain; 10 cm = worst possible pain). The VAS is an accepted outcome measure for chronic pain conditions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Provocative Maneuvers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Within 1 hour of injection, 2 weeks pos-injection</time_frame>
    <description>All patients currently undergoing hip injections receive a basic physical exam including patient specific provocative maneuvers both before and after the injection. The loss of pain after injection of a local anesthetic is part of the routine treatment algorithm and the results will be correlated with other outcome measures</description>
