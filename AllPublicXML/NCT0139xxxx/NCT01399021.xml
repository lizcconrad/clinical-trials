    <textblock>
      There is no standard of care of management following parotidectomies. Most practitioners
      however place a drain (usually a flat Davol closed suction drain/ Hemovac in the
      investigators institutions) in the wound bed at the end of the procedure, which is usually
      removed the day following the surgery, or when the drain output reaches a subjective number
      (depending on surgeon preference). The investigators hypothesis is that there is no
      difference in hematoma/bleeding or infection rate when post parotidectomy drains are removed
      in the recovery area on the day of the surgery prior to discharge, compared to drains that
      are kept in place for at least 1 day or until drainage is less than 50 cc/24 hrs. The
      investigators would therefore like to undergo a randomized control clinical trial to assess
      the rate of significant hematoma formation and infection, the need for readmission and length
      of admission secondary to these complications when comparing 2 groups: one where drains are
      removed prior to discharge from the recovery area and the other where the patients are
      discharged with the drain and seen the next post operative day in the office. The drain
      output will then be measured and the drain taken out.

      Background:

      Parotidectomies involve the removal of all or a portion of the parotid gland off the facial
      nerve in the case of superficial parotidectomies, and total removal of the gland in the case
      of total parotidectomies. The most common indications for this procedure are for benign
      neoplasms such as pleomorphic adenomas, oncocytomas and Warthin tumors, or for malignant
      involvement of the gland such as metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Hematoma
      formation or bleeding following parotidectomy is a less emphasized early complication of this
      procedure, usually secondary to unrecognized incomplete hemostasis prior to incision closure.
      Hematoma formation rate post parotidectomy has been reported to vary between 3.8% (Upton et
      al.) and 6.1% (Laccourreye et al.). In case of bleeding or rapidly expanding hematomas, the
      patient is usually brought back to the operating room for surgical drainage of the hematoma
      and surgical control of any identified bleeding vessels (Myers et al). Small hematomas can
      usually be managed expectantly. Wound infection following parotidectomy usually also ranges
      around 3.8% (Upton et al.) to 5.4% (Henney et al).

      Hypothesis: There is no difference in hematoma/bleeding or infection rate when post
      parotidectomy drains are removed in the recovery area on the day of the surgery prior to
      discharge, compared to drains that are kept in place for at least 1 day or until drainage is
      less than 50 cc/24 hrs.

      Justification for study:

      Review of the literature has shown paucity of publication about this particular complication
      and post operative preventative management. The current postoperative management following
      parotidectomies is not evidence based, and is institution or surgeon dependent, ranging from
      primary closure without a drain, to placement of a drain that is removed either on
      post-operative day 1-14 (in hospital or in the community), and from no overnight stay to
      patient hospitalization until the drain is removed. Patel et al. 2006 have published a review
      of postoperative drainage following their parotidectomies, including primary closure without
      drain, with drain, with absorbable hemostatic agents and with fibrin sealants. As mentioned
      by these authors, suction drains do not prevent hematomas, but do help to remove drainage and
      close dead space. In his paper, the average drain output on post operative day 1 was 27.1 ml,
      but these authors do not address the optimal time for drain removal. The timing of removal of
      neck drains following head and neck surgery was addressed by Harris T. et al, who found that
      drains could be safely removed when the volume falls to 50 ml or less over a 24 hour period,
      with only 9% of their patients developing seromas. Moreover, a retrospective review of the
      timing of neck hematoma formation post carotid endarterectomy showed that 95% of their
      patients experiencing neck hematomas or neurological deficits occurred within 8 hours
      following surgery, indicating that same evening discharge was possible following this type of
      surgery (Sheehan M.K et al).

      In their prospective four armed randomized controlled trial investigating the use of
      subcutaneous catheter drain and antibiotic irrigation of abdominal incision closures, Farnell
      et al. have found no statistical difference in infection rate in wounds with lesser degree of
      contamination (Type II and III) between groups without drains and with drains for 4 days.
      Clean procedures (Type I wound) such as in parotidectomies should thus have similar infection
      rates with very temporary drains compared to no drains. The optimal time for catheter removal
      was however not addressed in this study.

      The primary investigator has noted during his 30 years of practice as a Head and Neck surgeon
      that significant hematoma formation or bleeding that would require surgical management
      following parotidectomy is usually a very early complication that is often recognized within
      the few hours following surgery due to the superficiality of the wound, when the patient is
      in the postoperative area. It is our belief that removal of the drain in the post operative
      area, just prior to the patient's discharge allows for the decreased risk for unrecognized
      bleeding while and decreasing risks of nosocomial infections and patient colonization with
      resistant bacterial strains, unnecessary prolonged discomfort to the patient in the form of
      the drain, as well as unnecessary use of hospital resources such as the need for overnight
      stay in the hospital. The average cost for one postsurgical hospital day for an out of
      province resident at Vancouver General Hospital costs about C$3000 per day. We also believe
      that wound infection rate would be equivalent if not less.

      Clinical equipoise exists as there is still controversy about the timing of the drain
      removal. Since no previous study has addressed the need or optimal timing of surgical drain
      removal following parotidectomies, we would also like to undertake a randomized controlled
      trial to address the hematoma and infection rate in post parotidectomy patients, depending on
      whether a drain is removed in the recovery area, or the next post operative day. This would
      follow a retrospective review study (H11-01433).

      Objectives:

      In our prospective randomized controlled trial, we would like to assess the rate of hematoma
      formation and infection, the need for readmission and length of admission secondary to these
      complications when comparing 2 groups: one where drains are removed prior to discharge from
      the recovery area and the other where the patients are discharged with the drain and seen the
      next post operative day in the office. The drain output will then be measured and the drain
      taken out.

      Research Methods:

        -  A prospective randomized controlled trial:

             -  Inclusion criteria: patients age ≥ 18 years old, competent, undertaking unilateral
                or bilateral parotidectomies at Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver; St. Paul's
                Hospital, Vancouver; or Surrey Memorial Hospital, Surrey, Eagle Ridge Hospital,
                Port Moody.

             -  Exclusion criteria: patients on anticoagulation therapy, ASA ≥ 3 where a patient
                would require post operative overnight admission secondary to his comorbidities,
                immunosuppression such as concurrent radiation or chemotherapy or receiving high
                dose corticosteroids, and concommitant infections requiring antibiotics, patients
                who are having additional head and neck procedures at the time of the
                parotidectomy, other than skin excision (eg. Modified neck dissection,
                mandibulectomy, external auditory canal resection)

        -  Patients will be recruited and consent obtained (see below for details of consent).

        -  The consented patients will be randomly assigned a unique subject number, not derived
           from personal identifiers, then randomly assigned to either of the 2 arm groups, through
           the use of opaque envelopes that will be opened after skin closure:

             1. Drain placement and patient discharge with the drain. The patient will then be seen
                the next postoperative day by the surgeon to have the drain output measured and the
                drain taken out. In the very unlikely case that a drain output exceeds 50 cc/24
                hrs, the patient will be asked to come back on the 3rd post operative day for drain
                removal, when the output will likely be even less than 50cc/24 hrs (Harris, T et
                al.).

             2. Drain placement with removal prior to discharge on the same postoperative day from
                the recovery area, irrespective of volume drained (volume will be measured).

        -  Permutated blocks of 4, unbeknownst to the surgeon will be used to allow for equal
           balance in sample size of the 2 groups.

        -  The patients will be stratified on the basis of which hospital they had the surgery at.

        -  The patients and surgeon will be blinded until the end of surgery. The outcome assessor
           cannot be blinded to the different arms under this setting.

        -  If clinical judgment requires that a patient be admitted, or have the drain kept longer
           than the assigned time, the patient will be analyzed on an intention to treat basis.

        -  Outcomes measured include:

        -  Significant Hematoma /Bleeding rate (primary outcome)

        -  Infection rate

        -  Length of hospitalization

        -  Need for surgical reexploration

        -  Definitions:

        -  Significant Hematoma: Blood collection/Bleeding at the wound site that was diagnosed by
           a doctor and that requires surgical management.

        -  Infection: Record of positive pus culture if patient in hospital, record of abscess
           diagnosed by a physician through clinical exam, imaging or during surgical drainage, or
           spontaneous drainage of purulent material from wound incision with associated localized
           pain. Wound erythema that spontaneously resolved will not be included in this outcome.

        -  Length of hospitalization: Number of nights patient stayed in hospital.

        -  Surgical reexploration: Patient is brought back to the OR for hemostasis or where wound
           incision is opened and drained following hematoma or abscess formation.

        -  The outcomes will be measured by the outcome assessor at 30 days post operatively, where
           outcomes will be determined by contacting the patients (by questionnaire, telephone
           interview), regarding presence or absence of significant hematoma, infection, number of
           nights spent in hospital and whether or not they had a surgical exploration, with the
           definitions of these outcomes given to them. These outcomes will be confirmed via the
           patient's chart review or with the surgeon.

        -  Details of consent:

        -  Source of the contact information:

        -  From the primary health care provider's file (the primary investigator).

        -  Who will collect the contact information:

        -  The investigator not acting as health care provider will obtain the list of patient's
           name from the VGH ENT outpatient clinic after they are consented for parotidectomies.

        -  Who will make the initial contact with the prospective subject and how and when will the
           initial contact be made:

        -  Non-coercive initial contact with the prospective participants will be undertaken
           through numerous approaches: notices to invite prospective participants will be posted
           in the clinic rooms, waiting rooms as well as the the secretary's office in the
           outpatient VGH ENT Clinic. Interested prospective participants can either call the
           investigator, who will mail the information package to their address or the secretary
           (acting as study co-ordinator) who can hand them an information package.

        -  The secretary (acting as the study co-ordinator) will also hand a package to prospective
           potential participants. The package will contain an introductory letter signed by the
           Primary Investigator describing the background behind the study, justifications and aim
           of the study as well as the methodology of the study and details on how to contact the
           investigator. In the letter, they will also be notified that the investigator (not
           involved in their primary care, along with her stated relationship to the VGH ENT clinic
           and the Primary Investigator) will be contacting them within the next 1-2 weeks to give
           more information about the study, answer any questions that they might have and see
           whether they would be interested in participating in the study. They would also be
           invited to call the Primary investigator/ health care provider if they have any
           questions to which the person making initial contact cannot respond. Additionally, it
           will be confirmed in writing that the patient's decision in participation will have no
           impact on the patient's level of care. Also included in the package will be a consent
           form for the study.

        -  On handing the package, the secretary/co-ordinator will tell the prospective participant
           that their health care provider and his colleague are undertaking a study involving the
           surgery they will be undergoing and that they are invited to learn more about the study
           through the package. The co-ordinator will also let them know verbally that Primary
           Investigator's colleague, who also works in the clinic, will be contacting them within
           the next 1-2 weeks to discuss the project in more detail and see whether they would be
           interested in the study (this will also be mentioned in writing in the introductory
           letter).

        -  If the investigator (not involved in the care of the patient) is in the clinic at the
           time that the prospective participant is in the clinic, she will introduce herself to
           the prospective participant and detail her relationship to the VGH ENT clinic and the
           Primary Investigator, and hand the package to the patient, inviting them to go through
           the details of the study and informing the patient that she will call them within the
           following 2 weeks to discuss the study in more detail and to see whether they would be
           interested in participating.

        -  The relationship of study team members to prospective participants:

        -  The prospective participants will be under the Primary Investigator's care; therefore,
           the PI will not make the initial contact as detailed above.

        -  The other investigator involved in the study (PGY2 ENT resident) will not be involved in
           the care of the patient, nor is the secretary/acting as co-ordinator and therefore will
           not create a coercive contact with the prospective participants.

        -  The consent form will be explained by the investigator not involved in the care of the
           patient (but also working at the VGH ENT clinic), via the phone, within 1-2 weeks
           following the prospective participants' receipt of the information package (that
           includes the consent form), obtained at the time of their clinic visit or mailed to
           them.

        -  The consent will be obtained after the phone discussion about the study, when the
           patient will be asked to sign the consent form included in their information package
           during their clinic visit and mail the consent in a prepaid envelope. If the patients
           decide to think about whether they want to participate, they will be invited to do so
           and bring the consent form on the day of the surgery. The procedure will be undertaken
           over the phone since no participant recruitment can take place at the time of the
           patient visit to the clinic, and so as to minimize patient inconvenience in the form of
           mobilization (unless prospective participants prefer to do so) for a face to face
           discussion.

        -  During the phone call, the patients will be given information concerning the background
           behind this study, and justifications as well as the objectives for undertaking this
           study. The patients will be advised that, were they to consent to participate in this
           study, they would not know which arm they would be assigned to until after the surgery.

        -  The patients would be reassured that their decision in participating in the study would
           not impact in their level of care.

        -  They will be informed that were they to be randomized in arm #1, they would be given an
           appointment time for the following day to meet one of the authors for drain output
           measurement and drain removal. In the very unlikely event that the drain output is &gt;50
           cc/24 hrs, another appointment for the post operative day 3 will be arranged for removal
           and measurement of drain output.

        -  They would also be informed that one of the authors of the study would contact them at
           the 30 day mark to ask about whether they had any bleeding/significant hematoma,
           infection and number of nights spent in hospital and whether or not they had a surgical
           exploration, with the definitions of these outcomes given to them. They would also be
           informed that the obtained information would be confirmed through their hospital and
           medical records.

        -  Time dedicated to discussion of study and prior to consent: 15 minutes unless patients
           has additional questions; this will take place within 2 weeks of the receipt of the
           information package.

        -  Maximum time needed to dedicate to the study if patient is randomized to the group where
           the drain is removed the same post operative day: 1 minute.

        -  Maximum time needed to dedicate to the study if patient is randomized to group where
           drain is removed on the next post operative day: 15 minutes (excluding transportation
           time)

        -  Maximum time required for questionnaire filling/over the phone questionnaire (excluding
           time required to post prepaid envelope): 5 minutes; this will be taking place 1 month
           following the surgery.

        -  Potential benefits to the subject that could arise from his or her participation in the
           proposed research: Possible therapeutic benefits include more frequent follow- up visits
           (and therefore patient reassurance) in the control arm.

        -  Provisions made to break the code of a double-blind study in an emergency situation, and
           indicate who has the code: There will be no need for provisions to unblind the patients
           or surgeon as both arms will have drains placed in. The surgeons and patients will both
           be unblinded at the end of surgery.

        -  All paper form study data including consent forms will be held in a locked filling
           cabinet in the ENT Department at Vancouver General Hospital. Patients will be assigned a
           random and unique number in a patient log, which will be kept in an appropriately
           secured electronic form. Data collected are identified using the unique subject number
           that has not been derived from any personal identifiers; i.e. the data collected is
           already de-identified before being entered in the database. This file containing the
           data collection is also password protected.

      Provisions during the consenting process:

      No provision is possible during the consenting process as the consent will be discussed with
      the patient on the phone.

      Sample size &amp; Statistical Analysis:

      400 patients will be recruited to achieve a power of 0.8, taking into account that an
      intention to treat analysis will be undertaken, where it is assumed that average rate of
      hematoma formation post parotidectomy in the late drain removal group is 10% and 2.5% in
      early drain removal group.

        -  At the 100th patient, an interim analysis will be undertaken, and if there is any
           significant difference in hematoma or infection rate (p&lt;0.05), the study will be
           stopped. Additional patients who would already be enrolled but have not been randomized
           yet would be contacted by writing to be advised of the results of the study and of the
           end of the study.

        -  The results will then be anonymously analyzed using a t-Test by a medical statistician.
           The results of this study will be published in a medical journal. The data will be kept
           for a minimum of five years following publication of the study results, following which
           hard copies will be shredded and computer databases will be deleted.
