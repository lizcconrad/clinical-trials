      The Compare-Acute trial is a prospective randomised trial in patients with multivessel
      disease, who are admitted into hospital with a ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction. The
      purpose of the study is to compare a FFR guided multivessel PCI taking place during the
      primary PCI with a primary PCI of the culprit vessel only.

      Patients will be enrolled after successful revascularisation of the culprit vessel. Patients
      that have at least one lesion with a diameter of stenosis of more than 50% on visual
      estimation, feasible (operators judgement) for treatment with PCI in a non-infarct related
      artery, will be randomised either to the FFR guided complete revascularisation arm or staged
      revascularisation by proven ischemia or persistence of symptoms of angina.

      Approximately 885 patients will be entered in the study.

      Study hypothesis: FFR-guided complete percutaneous revascularisation of all flow-limiting
      stenoses in the non-IRA performed within the same procedure as the primary PCI or within the
      same hospitalisation will improve clinical outcomes compared to the staged revascularisation,
      guided by prove of ischemia or clinical judgment, as recommended from the guidelines.

      Background of the study: At the moment the general opinion is divided over the way the non
      culprit lesions in patients presenting with STEMI should be treated. While the previous
      guidelines stead that these lesions should be treated in a second time ( ie not during the
      primary intervention) the actual guidelines do not touch this argument. The reason is that
      the studies where the previous guidelines were based are old. Meanwhile small sized
      randomised trials from EU region have proven favourable outcomes with NON infarct related
      artery during the primary procedure while registers (non randomised trials) from USA still
      recommend the staged treatment. For this reason we have decided to perform a randomised study
      to address this issue incorporating the state of the art diagnosis and treatment, as well as
      the new medical therapy and PCI techniques.

      Objective of the study: FFR-guided complete percutaneous revascularisation of all
      flow-limiting stenoses in the non-IRA performed within the same procedure as the primary PCI
      or within the same hospitalisation will improve clinical outcomes compared to the staged
      revascularisation, guided by prove of ischemia or clinical judgment, as recommended from the
      guidelines

      Study design: Prospective, 1: 2 randomisation. FFR guided revascularisation during primary
      PCI (1) versus following actual guidelines (2)

      Study population: All STEMI patients between 18-85 years who will be treated with primary PCI
      in &lt; 12 h (more than 12 hr if persisting pain allowed) after the onset of symptoms and have
      at least one stenosis of &gt;50% in a non-IRA judged feasible for treatment with PCI.

      Intervention (if applicable): FFR-guided complete percutaneous revascularisation of all
      flow-limiting stenoses in the non-IRA performed within the same procedure as the primary PCI
      or within the same hospitalisation will improve clinical outcomes compared to the staged
      revascularisation, guided by prove of ischemia or clinical judgment, as recommended from the
      guidelines

    <description>In the FFR-group all flow limiting (FFRâ‰¤0.80) lesions will receive treatment by PCI and stenting. The non-IRA PCI should be performed during the same intervention. Exceptions can be made for complex lesions where the operator estimates that the revascularisation procedure will require significant contrast overload which may lead to deterioration of cardiac and renal function of the patient. Such procedures can be performed in a second procedure which should take place within the same hospitalisation. All lesions with a FFR measurement of &gt;0.80 will not be treated.</description>

    <description>In the randomised to guidelines group the procedure will stop after the FFR measurements and the patient will be referred to his treating cardiologist who will decide whether a staged PCI of the non-IRA artery should take place. The treating cardiologist will be blinded for the FFR measurements (but not angiographic imaging) and must make a decision based on conventional non-invasive ischemia detecting tests or clinical signs and symptoms i.e. very typical angina symptoms in patients with angiographic significant stenosis).</description>
