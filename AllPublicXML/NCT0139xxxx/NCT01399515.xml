      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral valproic acid to
      slow the progression of visual function and/or to improve the visual function in patients
      with retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

      Enrolled subjects in valproic acid group will be treated with oral valproic acid 500mg daily
      for 48 weeks. Visual function and safety will be assess before and after treatment (48 weeks)
      between valproic acid and control groups.

      This study is designed as a single-site, interventional, prospective, non-randomized,
      controlled study of 200 participants. Patients that participate in the study will be assigned
      to either valproic acid group or control in a 3:1 ratio.
