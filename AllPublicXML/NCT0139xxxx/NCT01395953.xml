  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this exploratory 8 week pilot study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of buspirone for the treatment of anxiety in youth (ages 6-17 years) with autism
      spectrum disorders. The study results will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger
      randomized controlled clinical trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical
      power.

    <description>Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders will receive buspirone or matched placebo. Buspirone will be titrated to the maximum daily dose during the first four weeks of the trial (dose titration phase). Week 4 onwards subjects will be maintained on maximum achieved dose till the end of the trial (dose maintenance phase). During the titration phase total dose of buspirone will be increased at each visit by 5mg and on the 4th day after each visit by 5mg.</description>
