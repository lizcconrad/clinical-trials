  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the varying qualities of protein supplements
      utilizing the Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) method and evaluating
      the clinical outcome related to protein stores and absorption.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PDCAAS has been adopted by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the World
      Health Organization (WHO) and is currently recognized as the standard method to evaluate
      protein quality. This study will also examine patient tolerability, satiety, and satisfaction
      while using meal replacements versus protein supplements. This research study looks to gain
      knowledge on the varying qualities of protein and find the most effective protein supplement
      and/or meal replacement that provides increased patient compliance and promotes a healthy
      recovery.
