    <textblock>
      Prognostic factors in locally advanced breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      differ from those of early breast cancer.

      The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical significance of potential predictive
      and prognostic factors including serial FDG PET/CT in breast cancer patients treated by
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

    <time_frame>after completion of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (9 weeks after initiation of chemotherapy)</time_frame>
    <description>The primary end point of this trial was evaluating pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. After 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients were undertook breast surgery. Using post operative pathology specimen, we evaluated pathologic response and calculated pCR rate.</description>

    <description>The chemotherapeutic regimen consisted of docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. After three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patients were re-evaluated for response and underwent curative surgery. Radiologic response was evaluated using breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the primary breast tumor and chest computed tomography (CT) for axillary, supraclavicular, internal mammary lymph nodes with RECIST criteria. Both breast MRI and chest CT were performed in all the 78 patients. Subsequently, the patients received three more cycles of docetaxel and doxorubicin as an adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by hormonal or radiation therapy, if indicated.</description>
