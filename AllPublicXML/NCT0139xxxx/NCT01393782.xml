  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a dose finding study to determine the feasibility of Angiotensin II
      (AII) to increase mean arterial pressure in high-output shock. If AII can be shown to
      increase mean arterial pressure, this could lead to future pharmacologic development based on
      the AII hormonal pathway. The investigators propose a 20 patient, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, blinded study in the treatment of high-output shock. Patients with
      high-output shock and a cardiovascular SOFA (sequential organ failure score) score of &gt; 4
      will be eligible. In addition, patients must already be receiving cardiac output monitoring
      and have a cardiac index &gt; 2.4 L/min/ 1.73 m2. Patients will be randomized to intravenous AII
      or saline in a blinded fashion. There will be 10 patients in each arm. This is a safety and
      dose finding feasibility study. The investigators are starting with a small cohort consistent
      with similar types of studies. The investigators estimate that ten patients in each arm will
      generate a basis for determining if there is sufficient signal for AII to improve blood
      pressure at the doses outlined. The primary endpoint in the study will be the effect of AII
      on the standing dose of norepinephrine which is required to maintain a MAP of 65 mmHg.
      Secondary endpoints will be the effect of AII on urine output, serum lactate, and creatinine
      clearance. 30 day post dose mortality will also be assessed. Subjects discharged prior to day
      30 will be contacted by telephone for this assessment.

    <description>All patients will have their vasopressors titrated to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm of Hg (standard MAP goal in the ICU for patients suffering from shock). Patients will then be randomized to control or IV AII. In the interventional arm, AII will start at a dose of 20ng/kg/min; the dose can then be titrated up to 30ng/kg/min, and then to 40ng/kg/min. The intervention will last for 6 hours. Each patient will start with the assigned starting dose indicated above. After the first hour, if the patient is still requiring standing norepinephrine (the standard vasopressor for the treatment of shock in the GW ICU), the dose of the control/interventional drug can be increased 50%. After the second hour, if the patient is still requiring a standing dose of norepinephrine, the control/interventional can be increased again to twice the initial dose. At the end of 6 hours, the study drug will be titrated off.</description>
