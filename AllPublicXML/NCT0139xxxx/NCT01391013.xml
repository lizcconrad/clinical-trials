    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare change of brachial artery flow mediated
      vasodilatation using Darunavir/Ritonavir (DRV/r) 800/100 mg once daily as a monotherapy (use
      of a single medication) versus a triple combination therapy containing 2 nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and DRV/r in Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infected
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), open-label (all
      people know the identity of the intervention), controlled, single centre study. The study
      consists of 3 phases including, the screening phase (4 weeks before administration of study
      medication), treatment phase (48 weeks), and the follow-up phase (4 weeks). In the treatment
      phase, HIV-infected participants who have not changed their first-line treatment of highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 8 weeks and have documented evidence of
      their HIV- ribonucleic acid (RNA) measurements being virologically suppressed (HIV-RNA less
      than 50 copies/mL) for at least 24 weeks prior to the screening, will be randomly assigned
      equally in two treatment arms: triple combination therapy arm (DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily
      plus 2 NRTIs) or monotherapy arm (DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily). Participants in the triple
      combination arm who are already on 2 NRTIs prior to randomization may remain on these or
      switch them at baseline, where the participants on the monotherapy arm will discontinue HAART
      at baseline and will start DRV/r 800/100 mg once daily. Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, significant vital signs, and significant laboratory tests. The
      total duration of the study will be 56 weeks.

    <description>The Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) is a method used to quantify insulin resistance and beta-cell function. HOMA-IR is reflected in the diminished effect of insulin on hepatic glucose production. HOMA-IR is calculated as: (Glucose [mg/dL] X Insulin [pmol/L]) / (405 X 6.945). Higher scores indicate worse insulin resistance.</description>

    <description>The Framingham Risk Score is used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of a participant. It is calculated according to age, laboratory values of total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, smoking status, and systolic blood pressure. The framingham risk score is calculated as: for males: 0 point (1 percentage) up to 17 points (30 percentages); whereas for females: 0 to 9 points (1 percentage) up to 25 points (30 percentage). Higher scores indicate high cardiovascular risk.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Insulin Sensitivity at Week 24 and Week 48: Median Change in Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)</title>
        <description>The Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) is a method used to quantify insulin resistance and beta-cell function. HOMA-IR is reflected in the diminished effect of insulin on hepatic glucose production. HOMA-IR is calculated as: (Glucose [mg/dL] X Insulin [pmol/L]) / (405 X 6.945). Higher scores indicate worse insulin resistance.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Insulin Sensitivity at Week 24 and Week 48: Median Change in Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)</title>
          <description>The Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA) is a method used to quantify insulin resistance and beta-cell function. HOMA-IR is reflected in the diminished effect of insulin on hepatic glucose production. HOMA-IR is calculated as: (Glucose [mg/dL] X Insulin [pmol/L]) / (405 X 6.945). Higher scores indicate worse insulin resistance.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Framingham Risk Score at Week 24 and Week 48: Medican Change in Framingham Risk Score</title>
        <description>The Framingham Risk Score is used to estimate the 10-year cardiovascular risk of a participant. It is calculated according to age, laboratory values of total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, smoking status, and systolic blood pressure. The framingham risk score is calculated as: for males: 0 point (1 percentage) up to 17 points (30 percentages); whereas for females: 0 to 9 points (1 percentage) up to 25 points (30 percentage). Higher scores indicate high cardiovascular risk.</description>

T score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for a healthy 30 year old adult of the same sex and ethnicity as a participant. This score is calculated from participant's age, gender and race and skeletal site. T score has a mean of ‘50’ and a standard deviation of ‘10’.

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Femoral Neck Z Score: Median Change in Femoral Neck Z Score</title>
          <description>Z score is used to calculate bone mineral density (calcium and other types of minerals) in an area of the bone. Z score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the participant's age, sex and ethnicity. This score is calculated from participant's age, gender and race and skeletal site. Z score has a mean of ‘0’ and a standard deviation of ‘1’. Z score lower than its mean indicate low bone mineral density.</description>

        <description>T score is used to calculate bone mineral density (calcium and other types of minerals) in an area of the bone. T score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for a healthy 30 year old adult of the same sex and ethnicity as a participant. This score is calculated from participant's age, gender and race and skeletal site. T score has a mean of ‘50’ and a standard deviation of ‘10’. T score lower than its mean indicate low bone mineral density.</description>
