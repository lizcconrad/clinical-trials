  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to a) assess the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in the
      treatment of Deficient Emotional Self-Regulation (DESR) among stimulant treated Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) adults, b) assess the side effect profile of omega-3
      fatty acids in the treatment of DESR among stimulant treated ADHD adults, c) assess effects
      of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on ADHD symptoms and associated features in stimulant
      treated ADHD adults, and d) predict value of fatty acids present in RBC cell membranes. This
      study will be a 12-week trial with adults 18-55 years of age with ADHD and symptoms of DESR.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male or female adults ages 18-55 years.

          2. A diagnosis of childhood onset Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, according to
             the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV)
             based on clinical assessment. Childhood onset will be defined according to established
             research criteria, requiring onset of two symptoms of inattentive or of
             impulsive/hyperactive traits by the age of 12.

          3. A score of 24 or more on the Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Report Scale (AISRS), or,
             for those individuals stably treated with a medication approved by the Food and Drug
             Administration for ADHD, a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) ADHD severity score of no
             greater than 4 (&quot;moderately ill&quot;).

             Those subjects treated with traditional ADHD pharmacotherapy must be on a stable,

             and/or a score of 99 or more on the DERS.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. For those subjects not treated for their ADHD at the time of enrollment, a history of
             non-response or intolerance to methylphenidate at adequate doses as determined by the
             clinician.

          3. Pregnant or nursing females.

          4. Serious, unstable medical illness including hepatic, renal, gastroenterological,
             respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic (thyroid), neurologic (seizure),
             immunologic, or hematologic disease.

          5. Glaucoma.

          6. Clinically unstable psychiatric conditions including suicidality, homicidality,
             bipolar disorder, psychosis, or lifetime history of a clinically serious condition
             potentially exacerbated by a stimulant such as mania, or psychosis.

          7. Tics or a family history or diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome.

          8. Current (within 3 months) DSM-IV criteria for abuse or dependence with any
             psychoactive substance other than nicotine.

          9. Allergies to fish or shellfish; multiple adverse drug reactions.

         10. Any other concomitant medication with primarily central nervous system activity other
             than specified in Concomitant Medication portion of the protocol.

         11. Current use of Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitor or use within the past two weeks.

         12. Investigator and his/her immediate family; defined as the investigator's spouse,
             parent, child, grandparent, or grandchild.
