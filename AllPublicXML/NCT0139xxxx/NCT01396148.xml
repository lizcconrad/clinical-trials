    <textblock>
      Children and young adults with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) will be treated with
      sunitinib. The safety (including pharmacokinetics) and tolerability of sunitinib will be
      studied in these patients. In addition, tumor responses and overall survival will be
      assessed.

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to end of study (up to Cycle 18) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both non-serious adverse events (AEs) and SAEs.</description>
