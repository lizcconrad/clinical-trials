    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, open-label study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and assess
      the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of BMN 673 in
      patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS), Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Arm 1 will enroll patients with
      either AML or MDS; Arm 2 will enroll patients with either CLL or MCL.
