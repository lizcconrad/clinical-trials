  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are scheduled to have
      total hip replacement (arthroplasty) surgery. The goal of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the drug, epsilon Aminocaproic Acid (EACA), in decreasing the need for
      patients to receive blood after surgery. Currently, EACA is approved by the Federal Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat a patient who is bleeding. The investigators plan to use EACA
      to prevent bleeding during and after surgery; use of this drug as a means of preventing
      bleeding is not currently approved by the FDA.

      The goal of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a drug,
      epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA), in reducing the frequency of postoperative blood
      transfusion following primary total hip arthroplasty. In our institution, up to 40% of
      patients with a preoperative of 13.5 g/dl or less undergoing total hip arthroplasty will
      require a blood transfusion. Fibrinolytic drugs such as EACA and tranexamic acid (TA) have
      been shown to decrease blood loss during surgery and decrease the likelihood of blood
      transfusion during postoperative hospitalization.. Both drugs decrease the body's ability to
      break down a blood clot, thus pushing the balance of blood clot formation and breakdown
      towards clot formation. This mechanism can decrease the amount of blood loss during and after
      a surgical procedure. The haemostatic effect of EACA has been investigated in multiple
      studies with the majority showing a positive effect on postoperative hemoglobin levels and
      decreased blood transfusion rates. Though several studies exist revealing the effective and
      safe use of perioperative TA, a similar drug to EACA, there is a paucity of information on
      the use of EACA in total joint arthroplasty.

The surgeon performing the case, their staff, the anesthesiologist, nurse anesthetist and the patient will be blinded to whether the patient received EACA or placebo. Pharmacy will prepare the EACA dose or the saline. Serum hemoglobin levels with be drawn preoperatively and on post operative days one, two, and three. The first dose will be given in the operating room prior to incision (within 30 minutes of the incision). The second dose will be given four hours after the first dose. Two doses are given due to the short half-life of EACA. The timing of administration of EACA will be recorded.</description>
