  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial examines whether programs aimed at matching resources to
      patient hypertension (i.e. high blood pressure) control lead to greater reduction in systolic
      blood pressure (top number of blood pressure reading) than simply having maintenance phone
      calls in addition to usual care. Answering this question will provide important evidence
      concerning the overall goal of sustained long-term implementation of the disease management
      programs as part of patient aligned care teams in the Veterans Affairs and other healthcare
      systems.

      Project Objectives: The investigators are conducting a two-arm 18-month randomized clinical
      trial for patients with pharmaceutically treated hypertension for which systolic BP is not
      controlled (&gt;/=140 mmHg for non-diabetic or &gt;/=130 mmHg for diabetic patients). The primary
      aim will be to compare two treatment arms/strategies in terms of impact on systolic BP
      control: Arm 1 - An intervention arm using titrated disease management in which patients'
      hypertension control, assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months, will be used to decide the
      resource intensity of strategies: 1) Medium/level 1 resource intensity strategy: a registered
      nurse will provide monthly tailored behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring;
      2) High/level 2 resource intensity strategy: a pharmacist will provide monthly tailored
      behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring + pharmacist-directed medication
      management; and 3) Booster (low) resource intensity strategy: a license practice nurse (LPN)
      will provide bi-monthly, non-tailored behavioral support telephone calls to patients whose
      systolic BP comes under control. Arm 2 - A control arm, in which an LPN will provide
      bi-monthly non-tailored behavioral support telephone calls (same procedures as the booster
      (low) resource intensity strategy component of the titrated intervention).

    <description>The intervention arm includes three levels of resource intensity targeted to improve patients' systolic blood pressure (SBP) [top number of blood pressure measurement].
Medium/level 1 resource intensity: a registered nurse (RN) will provide monthly tailored behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring.
High/level 2 resource intensity: a pharmacist will provide monthly tailored behavioral support telephone calls + home BP monitoring + pharmacist-directed medication management.
Booster (low) resource intensity: a licensed practical nurse (LPN) will provide non-tailored behavioral support telephone calls every two months to patients whose SBP comes under control.</description>
