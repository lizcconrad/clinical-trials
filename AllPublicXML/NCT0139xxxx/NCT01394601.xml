    <textblock>
      RECONNECT-S ALPHA is a multicentre study to observe the management of schizophrenic patients
      who are hospitalized due to an acutely agitated psychotic episode. The patients should be
      managed according to normal clinical practice until discharge time. Data will be collected by
      review of medical records of the hospitalisation prior the study visit. During the study the
      patients will conduct one visit on the day of their discharge after hospitalisation due to an
      acutely agitated psychotic episode. On the study visit data on demographics, diagnosis and
      medical history will be recorded. Data on antipsychotic and concomitant medication will be
      collected by review of medical records.
