  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite efforts of learned societies, community cardiology and more generally of most players
      in the health, cardiovascular diseases continue to be the leading cause of death among women
      in France and all over the Western world, there where they fell to second place among men.
      Clinical practice and the disparity between the sexes are still insufficiently known.

      Multicenter observational study on a cross-week comparative basis with men

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, as in other industrialized countries, ischemic heart disease is a major cause of
      morbidity and mortality in women. Work to improve epidemiological knowledge, prevention,
      screening, risk stratification and treatment of ischemic heart disease in women has a
      potential impact on all the issues listed.

      There is therefore a double challenge:

        -  A public health issue to alert the female population on cardiovascular risk and its
           consequences, while the female population does not feel concerned by the potential
           danger.

        -  A challenge for health professionals so that they have the same thing vis-à-vis the
           cardiovascular prevention among women and whatever their field of practice.
