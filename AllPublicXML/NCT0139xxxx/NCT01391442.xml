    <textblock>
      The Stanislas Cohort is a monocentric familial longitudinal cohort comprised of 1006 families
      (4295 subjects) from the Nancy region recruited in 1993-1995 at the Centre for Preventive
      Medicine (Centre de Médecine Préventive, CMP), Vandoeuvre lès Nancy for a 5-year periodic
      health examination, under the auspices of the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM).

      This cohort was established with the primary objective of investigating gene-gene and
      gene-environment interactions in the field of cardiovascular diseases, based on the study of
      inter-individual variability and familial segregation analysis of biological and
      morphological intermediate phenotypes of cardiovascular risk. The longitudinal nature of this
      study should enable to take into account the evolution of intermediate phenotypes related to
      genetic factors throughout the follow-up period. The families, consisting of two parents and
      at least two biological children, were deemed healthy, free of declared acute and/or chronic
      illness, in order to assess the effect of genetics on the variability of intermediate
      phenotypes studied under physiological conditions (without the influence, in the absence) of
      pathology.

      The Stanislas Cohort is, both nationally and internationally, the only longitudinal familial
      cohort of supposedly healthy subjects on such a large scale.

      Brief summary of ancillary study &quot;Cardiac Functional Indices Comparison Between MRI and
      Echocardiography&quot; : the ESCIF study is an ancillary study of the Stanislas cohort aiming at
      comparing in a cohort of supposedly healthy subjects different cardiac functional indices
      between two different modalities : Echocardiography and MRI. Indeed, new cardiac functional
      indices have been recently developed in the scope of echocardiography and would be very
      useful in MRI. In echography they are computed either from tissue Doppler imaging or from a
      specific image analysis called speckle tracking. These two techniques are accessible in MRI
      with the Generalized Reconstruction by Inversion of Coupled Systems (GRICS) technology which
      provides a motion model from which strains and strain rates may be derived and which allow
      longer acquisition without the constraint of breath holding (mandatory to reach high temporal
      resolution).

      MAIN STUDY Follow-up visit No. 4 is currently being scheduled, and is planned between 2011
      and 2016.

      Objectives:

        -  Conduct a fourth visit, in 2011-2016, enabling a follow-up at 17 years of the cohort
           population.

        -  Enrich the sample collection with new biobanks and clinical phenotyping of the cohort by
           conducting selected specific investigations and supported by specific scientific
           hypotheses and protocols

        -  Evaluate the long-term (follow-up, monitoring) of clinical, biological, morphological
           data by analyzing:

             -  The influence of aging (average age of parents in 1993: 45 years and in 2010-2012:
                62 years).

             -  The incidence and changes in prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors comprising
                the metabolic syndrome (MS), and their familial segregation, since as early as the
                second visit, in some one hundred families, at least one family member presented a
                MS according the definition of the NCEP-ATPIII. Approximately 20% of adults had
                high blood pressure (hypertension), and 50% had a body mass index above 25 kg/m2.

             -  The genetic and environmental determinants, through a multifaceted approach
                including familial segregation and candidate genes, the progression of
                cardiovascular risk and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (vascular and
                coronary diseases, heart failure).

      Methodology, Organization:

      All Cohort members will be contacted to participate in this fourth visit. The data collected
      will be identical to those collected during the previous visits. However, they will be
      enriched with new clinical phenotyping conducted at the CIC (principal investigator Prof.
      Zannad): collection of blood and urine samples (DNA, RNA, lymphocytic extracts, plasma
      biobank, urology biobank), and morphological investigations (electrocardiogram,
      echocardiography, carotid echotracking, arterial stiffness, systolic pressure index,
      abdominal aortic ultrasound). Based on previous participation rates, the recruitment of 2,000
      participants (500 families) is possible.

      Expected Results:

      This reconvening, for the follow-up at 17 years of the Stanislas Cohort, unique in its
      familial nature and having already contributed in a very significant manner in terms of
      knowledge generated, will enable in addition to the long-term continuation of its initial
      objectives (gene-environment interactions and cardiovascular diseases : Sophie
      Visvikis-Siest) to identify more specifically the natural history of the evolution of
      cardiovascular risk factors, including metabolic syndrome and its components as well as the
      incidence and transition mechanisms toward common cardiovascular diseases, notably vascular
      and coronary diseases and heart failure.

      ANCILLARY STUDY

      Detailed description of the ESCIF ancillary study - Dr. BONNEMAINS :

      Objectives :

        -  to compare cardiac functional indices measured in MRI with the GRICS technique with
           equivalent indices measured with echocardiography.

        -  to assess inter-observer reproducibility of echography and MRI.

      Organization :

      76 subjects from the Stanislas cohort will be included prospectively in two groups according
      to the echocardiographic strains and tissue Doppler velocities acquired during
      echocardiography : 38 subjects with normal indices, and 38 with altered indices. Each subject
      will be proposed an MRI examination with the GRICS technique the same day to assess the same
      indices.
