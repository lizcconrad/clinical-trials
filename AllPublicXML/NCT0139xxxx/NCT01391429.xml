  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subject preferences for care at the end-of-life show wide variability. In the setting of
      advanced disease, some subjects prefer all life-sustaining care while others forgo such
      procedures. The wide variability in preferences may be due to subjects' misconception of the
      disease condition when using solely verbal descriptions. The failure to participate in
      effective goals-of-care discussions may lead to overuse of medical interventions and
      life-sustaining measures that are inconsistent with patients' and families' wishes. Using
      video images -- in addition to words -- to convey goals-of-care options at end-of-life, adds
      a sense of verisimilitude to the condition described and may better inform subjects when
      making their preferences.

      Specific Aim: To assess the effect of a video decision support tool on preferences for
      end-of-life care in patients and surrogate decision makers consulted on by an inpatient
      palliative care service. The investigators hypothesize that those subjects who view video
      images as a supplement to a standard palliative care consult will be more likely to opt for
      comfort oriented care.

      In this study, patient subjects and/or their healthcare proxies who are consulted on by an
      inpatient palliative care team will be surveyed regarding their preferences for end-of-life
      care following either a standard palliative care consult or one which utilizes a short video
      to complement verbal descriptions. The primary analysis will involve the proportion of
      patient subjects/proxies in each group that prefer comfort oriented care and that die in
      accordance with their stated preferences. The investigators will also study the effect of the
      video on patient subjects' and/or proxies' uncertainty with regard to treatment preferences
      and overall satisfaction with the palliative care consult.

      The investigators research will be conducted as a non-randomized, temporal intervention
      study. The specific aim of the study is to assess the effect of a video decision support tool
      on preferences for end-of-life care in patients and surrogate decision makers consulted on by
      an inpatient palliative care service. The first seven months of the study, or until 25
      patient subjects are recruited, will be the observational phase. All participants recruited
      will receive the usual standard of care provided by an inpatient palliative care service.
      Using a battery of surveys, data will be collected regarding treatment preferences near the
      end of life, level of certainty with decision making, pain and symptom management, resource
      utilization and whether patient subjects die in accordance with their stated preferences.
      Once the observational phase is complete, the intervention phase of the study will begin.
      Over the following seven months, or until 25 patient subjects are recruited, all participants
      will view a six-minute digital video outlining different options for care near the end of
      life. The same endpoints will then be followed. In addition to the primary analysis involving
      patient-proxy dyads, an additional exploratory analysis will be performed. This analysis will
      involve surveying additional medical staff including attendings, residents, interns and
      nurses regarding their perceptions of patients' symptoms at the time of the palliative care
      consult. This data will be used to measure concordance between patient subjects' and staffs'
      ranking of symptoms.
