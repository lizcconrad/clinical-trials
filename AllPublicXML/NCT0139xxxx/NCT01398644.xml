  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism, resulting in
      excessive iron overload. Phlebotomy is currently the standard therapy. More recently
      Therapeutic Erythrocytapheresis (TE) has become a new therapeutic modality, which potentially
      offers a more efficient method to remove iron overload with fewer procedures.In the proposed
      clinical trial the investigators will examine whether TE can keep the ferritin levels in
      patients requiring maintenance therapy below 50 microg/L, with minimally half the number of
      treatment procedures when compared to current standard therapy by P.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research population exists of patients with HH ( by genetic analysis confirmed as
      homozygous for C282Y) living in south-east of the Netherlands and currently treated with
      phlebotomy as maintenance treatment to keep their serum ferritin levels &lt; 50 ug/l. Ferritin
      level at start of the inclusion between 30-50ug/l. Exclusion criteria are: patient receiving
      other therapies such as chelating therapy or forced dietary regimen, further patients with
      excessive overweight (BMI&gt;35). After enrollment the patients will be randomized to start
      either with TE or continue with P. After a year of treatment and being at a serum ferritin
      level &lt;50ug/l, patients will continue the study but then being treated with the other of the
      two treatments. Randomization will be done by blocked randomization.
