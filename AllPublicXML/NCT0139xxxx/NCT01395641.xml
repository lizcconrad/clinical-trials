    <textblock>
      Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) is an enzyme responsible for the final step in the
      synthesis of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. AADC deficiency is a rare genetic
      disorder. Taiwanese carry a high prevalence of AADC deficiency due to the founder mutation
      IVS6+4 A&gt;T, and patients usually die before the age 5-6 years due to severe motor
      dysfunction.

      Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 2 (AAV2) driven human AADC (hAADC)
      has been tested in both animal models and Phase I clinical trials of Parkinson disease. We
      have done a compassionate treatment of 8 patients with AADC deficiency by AAV2-hAADC and
      demonstrated a result that among the treated patients, 4 could stand with support, 3 could
      sit with support, and there was no virus-associated toxicity. The longest follow up has
      exceeded 4 years.

      This study is to prove the safety and efficacy of AAV2-hAADC treatment for patients with
      Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A definitive diagnosis of AADC deficiency, including a CSF study showing decreased
             levels of HVA and 5-HIAA, and an elevated L-dopa level, and the presence of at least
             one AADC gene pathologic mutation.

          2. Typical clinical manifestations of the disease, such as oculogyric crisis, hypotonia
             and delayed development.

          3. Over 2 years of age, or has skull bones suitable for surgery.

          4. Participating patient must be fully cooperative for assessments and tests conducted
             before and throughout the entire trial.

          5. The parents or guardians must sign the Informed Consent Form to give their consent.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Obvious brain structural change in the judgment of the investigator.

          2. The subject will be excluded if there is any health or neurological concern which
             might increase the risk of surgery. The principal investigator has the right to assess
             whether the subject is eligible for this trial based on the subject's health
             condition.

          3. Patients with anti-AAV2 antibody titer higher than 1,200, or &gt;1 O.D. value by ELISA
             will be excluded.

          4. Subject participating in this trial must not take any drug that might compromise this
             clinical trial.
