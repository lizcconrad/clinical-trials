      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of endoscopic valve implantation in
      patients with COPD and PH on hemodynamics, symptoms, exercise tolerance and quality of life
      in 10 patients in a prospective study. An improvement of objective parameters may also have a
      prognostic significance

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      So far there is no treatment of COPD in addition to the established treatment of concomitant
      PH. Administration of PH-specific medication outside of clinical trials is not recommended in
      new guidelines for PH of the ERS/ESC. The influence of endobronchial valve implantation on
      the PH has not been studied in detail. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect
      of endoscopic valve implantation in patients with COPD and PH on hemodynamics, symptoms,
      exercise tolerance and quality of life in 10 patients in a prospective study. An improvement
      of objective parameters may also have a prognostic significance
