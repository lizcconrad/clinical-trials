  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast conserving therapy (BCT) is the standard treatment for intraductal or invasive breast
      cancer patients. However cosmetic results, e.g. symmetry and nipple displacement, are
      sometimes poor reducing the quality of life. The use of immediate techniques for oncoplastic
      surgery (iTOP) seems to improve subjective cosmetic outcome. Oncologic safety of iTOP has
      been demonstrated by several authors using restrospective analyses. However, no prospective
      observational trial has been done to objectively evaluate cosmetic and oncologic outcome
      comparing BCT with iTOP. The aim of this study is to investigate this issue within a
      prospective non randomized observational trial at the Medical University Vienna.

        Patients with a BIRADS IV, V or VI breast lesion are preoperatively asked to take part in
        this study if more than 10% of breast tissue will be excised or mastectomy and immediate
        reconstruction is planned. Patients with planned mastectomy without immediate
        reconstruction are not included. Patients scheduled for breast conservation can decide
        whether they undergo regular breast conservation (BCT) or BCT using immediate techniques of
        oncoplastic surgery (iTOP). A contralateral correction may be performed in both groups at
        any time of the trial. The use of a contralateral correction of patients without an
        immediate oncoplastic procedure does not initiate a change into the other group (intention
        to treat analyses).

             defined formular 37) has to be removed or breast cancer patients scheduled for
             mastectomy and immediate reconstruction (immediate or delayed contralateral correction
             is allowed)

          -  BIRADS IV, V or VI are eligible

          -  &gt; 18 years of age
