  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of MGA271 when given by intravenous (IV)
      infusion to patients with refractory cancer. The study will also evaluate how long MGA271
      stays in the blood and how long it takes for it to leave the body, what is the highest dose
      that can safely be given, and whether it may have an effect on tumors.

      An open-label, multi-dose, single-arm, multi-center, Phase 1, dose-escalation study will be
      conducted to define the toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics
      (PK), immunogenicity, and potential antitumor activity of MGA271 in patients with refractory
      cancer that expresses B7-H3.

      In the initial segments of the study, patients will be monitored for a minimum of four weeks
      after administration of the final dose of MGA271. Study assessments will include adverse
      event (AE) monitoring, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, PK analysis of serum MGA271,
      determination of the serum concentration of soluble MGA271 and tumor markers, and an
      assessment of potential anti-MGA271 antibody [human anti-human antibody (HAHA)] response.

      Tumor response assessments using Study Day 43 CT scans or MRI will be performed approximately
      six weeks after the first MGA271 dose for each patient. Patients with evidence of clinical
      benefit (partial or complete response or stable disease by RECIST or RANO Response criteria)
      will be allowed to continue therapy at the same dose, or at a reduced dose if warranted by
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or significant AE in Cycle 1. Subsequent cycles which will begin
      on Study Day 50 will consist of MGA271 administration on Study Days 1, 8, and 15 of each
      28-day cycle, with tumor evaluation every other cycle. Responding patients may receive
      continued antibody therapy until evidence of progression of disease is documented or the
      patient experiences DLT.

      In the Expansion Segment of the study, patients will receive weekly, uninterrupted infusions
      with an initial response assessment at 8 weeks. Tumor evaluation will be carried out by both
      RECIST and immune-related response criteria (irRC).

    <description>Up to 9 dose escalation cohorts will be enrolled to determine the maximum tolerated dose of MGA271. Patients with evidence of clinical benefit will be allowed to continue therapy at the same dose once per week for 3 weeks out of every 4-week cycle until documented progression.
Patients treated in the Expansion Segment at the maximum administered dose will receive weekly, uninterrupted infusions of MGA271 in 8 week cycles for up to 12 cycles.</description>
