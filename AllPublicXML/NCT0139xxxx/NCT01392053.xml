      The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of massage therapy as a resource for
      pain relief during the active phase of labor. The research will be of type randomized
      controlled trial, consisting of low-risk nulliparous pregnant women admitted to the Referral
      Center for Women's Health in Ribeirão Preto. The mothers will be distributed in two groups
      (lumbosacral massage) and control (routine maternity) and will be assessed before and after
      therapy, which corresponds to 30 minutes between 4-5 cm of cervical dilation. The evaluation
      will be performed by numerical category scale, Diagram Location of Pain and Pain
      Questionnaire McGll (reduced form). After delivery will apply a customer satisfaction
      questionnaire.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pain in labor appears as a subjective experience, individual interaction involving a
      broad physiological, psychosocial and environmental influences, representing one of the main
      clinical signs of this phase. Despite presenting an important biological function, is today
      well established the need for their relief, since its persistence is associated with harmful
      effects on mother and fetus. Among the available non-pharmacological resources, we highlight
      the massage therapy that has shown positive effects in relieving pain and promoting the
      comfort of the mother. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of massage
      therapy as a resource for pain relief during the active phase of labor. The research will be
      of type randomized controlled trial, consisting of low-risk nulliparous pregnant women
      admitted to the Referral Center for Women's Health in Ribeirão Preto. The mothers will be
      distributed in two groups (lumbosacral massage) and control (routine maternity) and will be
      assessed before and after therapy, which corresponds to 30 minutes between 4-5 cm of cervical
      dilation. The evaluation will be performed by numerical category scale, Diagram Location of
      Pain and Pain Questionnaire McGll (reduced form). After delivery will apply a customer
      satisfaction questionnaire. After collecting the data, the groups are statistically analyzed
      using the linear regression model with mixed effects (fixed and random), taking into account
      a value of p &lt;0.05 to obtain the statistical significance of 5%.

    <measure>Effectiveness of Massage Therapy in Pain Relief During Labor.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analogue Scale was used to assess the pain intensitiy after each procedure according to the study design. The VAS is a scale composed by a straight line printed on a paper measuring 100 milimeters, where only the 0 (Zero) and the 100 (one hundred) points are marked. The patient is then asked to mark this line accordingly to the intensity of the pain felt in that moment, considering 0 (Zero) to be no pain at all, and 100 (one hundred) to be the most unbearable pain ever suffered. The researcher would measure the distance, in milimeters, from the 0 (Zero)mm to the point were the patient marked, wich was considered to be the intensity of the pain felt by the patient in that moment. A reduction of 13mm or more in this scale is considered to be a significative pain reduction.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacological Analgesia Request According to the Cervical Dilation.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>In the institution where this study was conducted, the request for analgesia, made by the patient, is granted promptly. Considering that the further the cervyx dilation grows, the greater the pain intensity is, the cervical dilation was used as an indicator of the moment that the women in labour requested this procedure, and, therefore, could provide a comparison between methods.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Obstetric Outcomes - Delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Labour can either occur via vaginal canal, also called natural birth, or via caesarian section, which is a surgical procedure used when either the mother or the baby are in distress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Obstetric Outcomes - Duration of Labour</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The time elapsed between hospital admission and delivery was measured to compare the influence of the procedures established in the study design. It was defined two sets of measures dichotomizing the groups into &quot;up to 7 hours&quot; or &quot;more than 7 hours&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Obstetric Outcome - Moment of Corioamniorrhexis</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Corioamniorrhexis may occur during the normal evolution of labour or due to medical conditions. In this study, the moment when this event happened was associated to the dilation of the uterus cervyx, considering this to be a more reliable datum rather than the timelapse of labor. This outcome is measured in centimeter when the women is assessed by the doctor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Obstetric Outcomes - Moment of Utilization of Oxytocin</measure>
    <time_frame>10 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Oxytocin is a drug used to induce or enhance the muscular activity of the uterus. In this study, the moment when this event happened was associated to the dilation of the uterus cervyx, considering this to be a more reliable data rather than the timelapse of labor. This outcome is measured in centimeter when the women is assessed by the doctor.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction of Mothers With the Presence of a Professional by Their Side During the Study Period.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Considering the first labour to be a unique experience to every women, and also a moment of many doubts and insecurities, it is considered that the presence of a healthcare professional, providing information and support, during this moment, could be benefitial to most first time mothers. Therefore, the presence of a physiotherapist could have helped minimize the suffering in both groups. The questionnaire applied after labour intended to assess how most women felt regarding this subject.</description>

        <description>The Visual Analogue Scale was used to assess the pain intensitiy after each procedure according to the study design. The VAS is a scale composed by a straight line printed on a paper measuring 100 milimeters, where only the 0 (Zero) and the 100 (one hundred) points are marked. The patient is then asked to mark this line accordingly to the intensity of the pain felt in that moment, considering 0 (Zero) to be no pain at all, and 100 (one hundred) to be the most unbearable pain ever suffered. The researcher would measure the distance, in milimeters, from the 0 (Zero)mm to the point were the patient marked, wich was considered to be the intensity of the pain felt by the patient in that moment. A reduction of 13mm or more in this scale is considered to be a significative pain reduction.</description>
