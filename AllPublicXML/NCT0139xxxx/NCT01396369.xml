    <textblock>
      PCOS is a disorder which is characterized by hyperandrogenism (high serum male hormone
      levels), ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries (multiple follicles-over 12- in the
      ovary). There is no universally accepted definition for PCOS. The Rotterdam criteria require
      2 of 3 criteria for diagnosis, including hyperandrogenism (clinical hirsutism or serum
      hormone measurement), oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea, and ultrasound findings of polycystic
      ovaries.

      This study is a prospective randomized pilot study designed to evaluate the effects of
      flaxseed supplementation (with Brevail) on hormonal and lipid metabolism balance in
      polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients.

After the lab tests, the patients in the control group will be started on OC (standard clinical practice) and those in the treatment group will be started on OC with Brevail (2 pills once a day). The patients will return to the clinic for a follow up visit after 3 months. If no side effects, Brevail and OC will be continued for 3 more months. The control group will also have a follow up after 3 months of OC. Six months after the initiation of the study, the patients in the both groups will have another H&amp;P as well as repeat ultrasound and blood tests.</description>
