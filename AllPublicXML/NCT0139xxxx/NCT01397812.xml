  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate and validate a breath test for detection of
      biomarkers of heart transplant rejection (Grade 2R heart transplant).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 36 month multi-center, open label, unblinded and blinded study on subjects have had
      a heart transplant within the previous 12 months and are scheduled to undergo an
      endomyocardial biopsy. The breath test will be performed to identify and validate the
      predicative algorithms that identify breath biomarkers for heart transplant rejection.

    <measure>To measure the sensitivity and specificity of the breath test as compared to the primary right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy for the development of an intrinsically safe, painless, and non-invasive detection technique.</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days after completion</time_frame>
    <description>The current &quot;gold standard&quot; for heart transplant rejection diagnosis is a series of endomyocardial biopsies during the first twelve months after operation. This procedure is invasive, painful, and potentially hazardous. The Heartsbreath test is an intrinsically safe, painless, and non-invasive breath test for heart transplant rejection that employs volatile biomarkers of oxidative stress. The Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Heartsbreath test for clinical use with a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE).</description>

    <description>Subjects will comprise of patients who are the recipients of a heart transplant within the previous 12 months and are scheduled for a routine endomyocardial biopsy.
Subjects will provide breath samples for the Heartsbreath test using the BreathScanner 1.0. Optionally subjects will provide breath samples using the BreathLink point of care system.</description>
