  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can provide information about
      heart and blood vessels. The tests let doctors can see the amount of blood vessel narrowing
      and vessel wall thickness. This information may help diagnose and treat heart disease and
      other conditions that lead to heart attacks. Better MRI methods are needed to improve heart
      disease diagnosis, especially by avoiding the use of radiation. Researchers are testing new
      techniques to improve the quality of heart MRI, compared with more complex studies like
      catheterization or angiography.

      Objectives:

      - To compare heart MRI techniques with other tests used to diagnose heart disease.

      Eligibility:

      - People at least 18 years of age who either have or may have heart disease, or are healthy
      volunteers.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood tests.

        -  They will have an angiography to study the inside of blood vessels. This test is an
           x-ray study of the blood vessels. It will be done either separately or as part of a set
           of tests to diagnose possible heart disease.

        -  Participants will have at least one and up to five MRI scans. The scans will involve
           different methods of studying the heart and blood vessels. Participants may also have a
           computed tomography scan to confirm the findings of an MRI scan.

        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this protocol.

      Specialized imaging techniques now available allow a unique opportunity to characterize the
      micro-environment of the human body. Magnetic Resonance (MR) vascular wall imaging and
      angiography (MRA) are developing techniques that permit non-invasive evaluation of arterial
      and venous structures without the need for x-ray based catheter angiography. In addition,
      vessel wall imaging provides unprecedented non-invasive tools to assess vascular endothelial
      function. While dramatic progress has been made to cardiovascular MR imaging in the last few
      years, there are still substantial limitations in the resolution, accuracy, and
      reproducibility of MRA and wall imaging in the comprehensive structural and functional
      evaluation of coronary artery. The first aim of this study is to develop and optimize
      clinical imaging protocols and techniques for fast high-resolution coronary MRA and wall
      imaging for the assessment of coronary and other main arteries structural, distensibility,
      and endothelial functional parameters. Technique optimization and performance evaluation will
      be accomplished in normal subjects without known or suspected coronary atherosclerosis. The
      second aim of this protocol is to evaluate early MR imagery signs of arterial structural,
      distensibility, and endothelial functional disorders associated with atherosclerosis in a
      cohort of patients with known or suspected coronary atherosclerosis. Results from accelerated
      high-resolution MRA will be correlated with corresponding Computerized Tomography Coronary
      Angiogram (CTA) results. The third aim of this protocol is to develop, implement, and
      optimize new non-invasive methods for characterization of the micro-environment in the
      thoracic and abdominal area utilizing specialized techniques such as MR Spectroscopy, MR
      Elastography, and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging. The long-term objective
      of this study and research initiative is to optimize coronary MRA, wall, and body imaging
      techniques to the point that it can reliably be used for routine prevention and assessment of
      early atherosclerosis and other diseases.
