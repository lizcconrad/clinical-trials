  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, multicenter, 2-arm study will investigate the efficacy, safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab when added to postoperative radiotherapy
      with concomitant and adjuvant TMZ as compared to postoperative radiotherapy with concomitant
      and adjuvant TMZ alone in paediatric participants with newly diagnosed histologically
      confirmed World Health Organization (WHO) Grade III or IV localized supratentorial or
      infratentorial cerebellar or peduncular high grade glioma (HGG). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms.

      Upon approval by the Health Authorities/Ethics Committees in the participating countries, an
      additional young participant cohort (YPC) (children &gt;/= 6 months and &lt; 3 years of age with
      progressive or relapsed metastatic or localized, supra- or infratentorial, non-brain stem WHO
      Grade III or IV HGG) was included in the study. Children in the YPC will receive bevacizumab
      and TMZ without radiation therapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is over 1 year.

    <time_frame>From the time of randomization to the date of any defined event (up to approximately 52 months)</time_frame>
    <description>EFS was defined as the time from diagnosis to the earliest occurrence of any of the following: tumor progression, tumor recurrence, second primary non-high-grade glioma (HGG) malignancy or death attributable to any cause. Tumor assessments were conducted using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reviewed by the site-independent CRRC using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Tumor progression was defined as clear clinical progression or a greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 25% increase in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of the contrast enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease was observed) or best response and with the participant on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. Tumor recurrence was defined as recurrence after tumor was completely resected (no disease present at baseline). EFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants with a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) determined on two consecutive occasions &gt;/= 4 weeks apart.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 6 of the adjuvant phase, end of treatment (approximately 58 weeks post-baseline), and yearly during the follow-up period (maximum 5 years in follow-up)</time_frame>
    <description>HUI is a preference-based, multi-attitude, health-related instrument specifically developed for use with children. HUI consists of eight attributes of health status: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition and pain. Each attribute had 5 or 6 levels varying from highly impaired to normal. Each of the eight health dimensions was tested separately and a composite score ranging between 1 (perfect health) and 0 (death) was obtained for participants aged 5 years or older.</description>

        <title>Event-Free Survival (EFS) as Assessed by the Central Radiology Review Committee (CRRC)</title>
        <description>EFS was defined as the time from diagnosis to the earliest occurrence of any of the following: tumor progression, tumor recurrence, second primary non-high-grade glioma (HGG) malignancy or death attributable to any cause. Tumor assessments were conducted using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reviewed by the site-independent CRRC using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Tumor progression was defined as clear clinical progression or a greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 25% increase in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of the contrast enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease was observed) or best response and with the participant on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. Tumor recurrence was defined as recurrence after tumor was completely resected (no disease present at baseline). EFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

          <description>EFS was defined as the time from diagnosis to the earliest occurrence of any of the following: tumor progression, tumor recurrence, second primary non-high-grade glioma (HGG) malignancy or death attributable to any cause. Tumor assessments were conducted using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reviewed by the site-independent CRRC using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. Tumor progression was defined as clear clinical progression or a greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 25% increase in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of the contrast enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease was observed) or best response and with the participant on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. Tumor recurrence was defined as recurrence after tumor was completely resected (no disease present at baseline). EFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

Bevacizumab was given concomitantly at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks throughout the entire treatment period.</description>

          <title>EFS as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
          <description>EFS was defined as the time from diagnosis to the earliest occurrence of any of the following: tumor progression, tumor recurrence, second primary non-HGG malignancy or death attributable to any cause. Tumor assessments were conducted using MRI and reviewed by the investigator using RANO criteria. Tumor progression was defined as clear clinical progression or &gt;/= 25% increase in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of the contrast enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement obtained either at baseline (if no decrease was observed) or best response and with the participant on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. Tumor recurrence was defined as recurrence after tumor was completely resected (no disease present at baseline). EFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

HUI consists of eight attributes of health status: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition and pain. Each attribute had 5 or 6 levels varying from highly impaired to normal. Each of the eight health dimensions was tested separately and a composite score ranging between 1 (perfect health) and 0 (death) was obtained for participants aged 5 years or older.</description>
