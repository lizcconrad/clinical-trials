    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a severely debilitating mental illness that affects approximately 1% of the
      world population. Hallucinations and delusions are the most striking characteristic positive
      symptoms of schizophrenia; however, more subtle negative symptoms (eg, social withdrawal and
      lack of emotion, energy, and motivation) may also be present. The first antipsychotics
      developed for the treatment of schizophrenia were effective against positive symptoms, but
      showed little efficacy for negative symptoms and were also associated with a high incidence
      of side effects. Second generation antipsychotics, represent a significant advancement in the
      treatment of psychotic disorders because they are effective and at the same time exhibit
      fewer side effects than first generation antipsychotics. Although generally safer than first
      generation antipsychotics, the second-generation antipsychotics are not devoid of undesirable
      side effects such as Hyperprolactinemia and weight gain. In addition, the safety of these
      drugs vary considerably.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of 3 subscales with 30 symptom constructs (positive subscale (7): delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/perseckion, and hostility; negative subscale (7): blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and conversation flow, stereotyped thinking and general psychopathology subscale (16): somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms and posturing, depression, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual thought content, disorientation, poor attention, lack of judgment and insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse control, preoccupation, and active social avoidance). Severity was rated on 7-point scale with scores 1 (absence) &amp; 7 (extremely severe). The PANSS total score was sum of rating scores for 7 positive, 7 negative, and 16 general psychopathology subscale items of PANSS panel.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of illness for each participant was rated using the CGI-S. To perform this assessment, the investigator were to answer the following question: &quot;Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally ill was the participant at that time?&quot; Response choices include: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; and 7 = among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance Scale Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP was a validated clinician-rated scale that measured personal and social functioning in four domains: socially useful activities (e.g, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Impairment in each of these domains was rated as absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe, or very severe. These ratings were then converted to a total score based on a 100-point scale using algorithms to identify the appropriate 10-point interval, and the rater's judgment that determined the total score within the 10-point interval. Participants with a PSP total score of 71 to 100 were considered to have mild functional difficulty. Scores of 31 to 70 represented manifest disabilities of various degrees and ratings of 1 to 30 indicated minimal functioning that required intense support and/or supervision.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression - Improvement Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of study medication was rated for each participant using the CGI-I. The investigator rated the participant's total improvement whether or not it was due to the drug treatment. All responses were compared to the participant's condition at Screening/Baseline (i.e, Week 6 visit of Protocol NCT00905307). Response choices included: 0 = not assessed, 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline up to 52 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate was defined as a reduction of ≥ 30% from Baseline in PANSS total score or CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) at the Last Visit.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance Scale Total Score</title>
        <description>The PSP was a validated clinician-rated scale that measured personal and social functioning in four domains: socially useful activities (e.g, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Impairment in each of these domains was rated as absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe, or very severe. These ratings were then converted to a total score based on a 100-point scale using algorithms to identify the appropriate 10-point interval, and the rater’s judgment that determined the total score within the 10-point interval. Participants with a PSP total score of 71 to 100 were considered to have mild functional difficulty. Scores of 31 to 70 represented manifest disabilities of various degrees and ratings of 1 to 30 indicated minimal functioning that required intense support and/or supervision.</description>

Collectively, these dimensions are referred to as the PANSS Marder Factor scores and include positive symptoms score, negative symptoms score, thought score, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, anxiety depression score. The positive factor score was the sum of the 8 components (delusions (P1), hallucinatory behavior (P3), grandiosity (P5), suspiciousness/persecution (P6), stereotyped thinking (N7), somatic concern (G1), unusual thought content (G9) and lack of judgment and insight (G12)) of the positive symptoms scale (range: 8 - best possible outcome to 56 - worst possible outcome).</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in PANSS Marder Factor Scores - Negative Symptoms Score</title>
          <description>Retrospective factor analyses have been performed in recent decades using scores for the 30 individual PANSS items to categorize symptoms into 5 dimensions. Collectively, these dimensions are referred to as the PANSS Marder Factor scores and include positive symptoms score, negative symptoms score, thought score, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, anxiety depression score. The negative factor score is the sum of the 7 items (blunted affect (N1), emotional withdrawal (N2), poor rapport (N3), passive/apathetic social withdrawal (N4), lack of spontaneity and conversation flow (N6), motor retardation (G7) and active social avoidance (G16)) of the negative subscale (range: 8 - best possible outcome to 56 - worst possible outcome).</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in PANSS Marder Factor Scores - Anxiety/Depression Score</title>
          <description>Retrospective factor analyses have been performed in recent decades using scores for the 30 individual PANSS items to categorize symptoms into 5 dimensions. Collectively, these dimensions are referred to as the PANSS Marder Factor scores and include positive symptoms score, negative symptoms score, thought score, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, anxiety depression score. The anxiety/depression factor score is the sum of score from the 4 items (anxiety (G2), guilt feelings (G3), tension (G4) and depression (G6)) on the anxiety/depression subscale (range: 4 - best possible outcome to 28 - worst possible outcome).</description>
          <population>The Efficacy Sample included participants in the Safety Sample who had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy evaluation for PANSS Total Score.</population>
