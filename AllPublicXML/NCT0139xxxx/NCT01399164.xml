      Cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency is highly prevalent in the US and worldwide. Deficiency is
      most common in the elderly, with an average prevalence ≈25% over age 60 y. About 40% of older
      persons with low serum cobalamin have food cobalamin malabsorption (F-CM), in which gastric
      atrophy/achlorhydria and/or dysfunction is implicated. Because of the prevalence of
      deficiency in those over age 60 y, it is generally recommended that the elderly consume a
      higher proportion of their cobalamin from fortified foods than what is recommended for
      younger people. However there is considerable debate about whether crystalline cobalamin is
      absorbed as well by the elderly with F-CM as it is by younger people, especially if it is
      added as a fortificant to food. The data to be collected in this study will provide
      information useful to on-going deliberations concerning the future fortification of wheat
      flour with vitamin B12 in the United States.
