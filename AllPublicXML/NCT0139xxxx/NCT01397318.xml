  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many pregnant women experience stress, fatigue, and poor sleep quality that may influence
      infant outcomes such as prematurity and low birthweight through immunologic pathway of
      biomarkers (serum cytokines and c-reactive protein). In contrast, TaiChi exercise, one kind
      of physical activity, can increase pulmonary and immune functions and reduce stress may
      therefore prevent pregnancy complications and further prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes;
      however, its effects has not been explored in studies. Therefore, this study aims to
      investigate relationships between prenatal stress, fatigue, sleep quality, biomarkers, and
      infant outcomes; modified a TaiChi exercise program suitable for pregnant women; and test the
      effects of the exercise on reducing stress and fatigue, promote sleep quality, modulate
      biomarkers, and prevent adverse infant outcomes. Infant outcomes in the study will be
      measured with gestational age and birthweight. The study is a three-stage longitudinal
      interventional design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first-stage, patterns of prenatal stress, fatigue, and sleep quality will be
      investigated by surveying 300 pregnant women who are over 23 weeks of gestation and screen
      for pregnant women with fatigue and poor sleep quality. In the second-stage, experts in
      obstetrics and TaiChi will be invited to modify a TaiChi exercise program. Thirty women who
      experience fatigue and poor sleep quality will be invited to practice the modified TaiChi
      exercise. Comments from those participants on the program will be used to refine the program
      and a DVD will be made. After the program is well-designed and recorded, participants
      recruited for the third-stage study will be randomly assigned to TaiChi or comparison group.
      They will be asked to complete questionnaires and give blood samples for biomarker tests when
      they are at 27-29, 31-33, and 35-37 weeks of gestation; in labor; and at 4-6 weeks
      postpartum. In addition to practice the exercise at home, participants in the TaiChi group
      will practice TaiChi in groups every month. In contrast, comparison group will be asked to
      keep on their usual daily activities, no other interventions will be introduced. Phone calls
      or postcard will be made or sent routinely to participants to ensure their long-term
      participation. Questionnaires used for the study include 10-item Perceived Stress Scale,
      Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive
      statistics, Pearson correlation, and generalized estimating equations will be applied to
      understand predictive effects of maternal stress, fatigue, sleep quality, and biomarkers on
      infant outcomes; and effects of modified TaiChi exercise on maternal stress, fatigue, sleep
      quality, biomarkers, and infant outcomes. In addition to develop a modified TaiChi exercise
      program suitable for pregnant women, the study anticipates that maternal stress, fatigue, and
      poor sleep quality can predict infant outcomes through immunologic pathway, and the modified
      TaiChi exercise can reduce maternal stress and fatigue, improve sleep quality, modulate
      biomarkers, and hence prevent adverse infant outcomes.
