  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: For the development of a closed loop system, faster insulin absorption after bolus
      administration could help to reduce the system's delay and thus increase patient safety. It
      has been shown that regular insulin absorption is faster when injecting insulin with a
      sprinkler needle (containing holes in the walls and being sealed at the tip). The current
      study will evaluate the impact of different application volumes on pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic properties of rapid acting insulin analogue (insulin aspart).

      Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetic response (based on the time to maximum observed
      serum insulin concentration) and pharmacodynamic properties of rapid acting insulin aspart
      after subcutaneous injection of a defined dose (volume) at 1 versus 9 injection sites in
      patients with type 1 diabetes.

      Study design: Monocentric, randomised, controlled, two-arm cross-over intervention study.

      Population: Twelve type 1 diabetic subjects

      Intervention: The investigational treatment is the subcutaneous administration of insulin
      aspart either as one bolus of 18 IU at one injection site or as 9 separately and
      simultaneously applied bolus of 2 IU each at 9 separate injection sites. Serum and plasma
      samples to assess pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties will be taken during an
      8-hour clamp experiment. Patients will undergo both investigational treatments in a
      randomized order; between the two clamp visits there will be a wash-out period of 5-21 days.

      Main study endpoint: Time to maximum observed serum insulin aspart concentration.
