      The aim of the study is to assess and compare efficacy and safety of BI 54903 at 3 doses
      twice daily (b.i.d.) and fluticasone propionate hydrofluoroalkane metered dose inhaler (HFA
      MDI) at a dose of 88 mcg b.i.d and placebo b.i.d. over an 8-week treatment period in
      asthmatic patients aged 12 to 65 years inadequately controlled on short-acting-beta-agonist
      (SABA) prn therapy only as demonstrated by a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one
      second (FEV1) range10 to 25% and an asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-6) equal or greater
      than 1.5 at time of randomization
