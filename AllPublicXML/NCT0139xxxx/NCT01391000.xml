      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the most effective method between Transcutaneous
      Electrical Stimulation and Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation therapy
      carbon dioxide therapy for pain control in the post-surgical rehabilitation of patients
      treated with reconstruction of the rotator cuff.

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the most effective method between Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation and Light
      Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation therapy carbon dioxide for pain control in
      the post-surgical rehabilitation of patients treated with reconstruction of the rotator cuff
      and to evaluate, at the end of the rehabilitation period, the range of motion, the function
      gained and the quality of life comparatively in the two groups of patients treated with
      Transcutaneous Electrical Stimulation or Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of
      Radiation therapy carbon dioxide therapy.

    <description>To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation carbon dioxide therapy vs Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator during the first cycle of rehabilitation through Visual Analogue Scale, calculating the mean score in values of beginning and end of daily treatment. The scale had values from 0 to 10 where zero represented no pain and 10 the worst possible pain. More than 3 means pain.</description>

    <measure>Short Form 12-PCS for Quality of Life Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in quality of life at the end of the rehabilitation cycle (two weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is weighted and summed to provide easily interpretable scales for physical and mental health. SF-12 score measures substantially limited physical disability, general well-being and the perception of one's state of health, (Physical Component Summary) and also measure the psychological attitude of the patient, the limitation in social and personal activities (Mental Component Summary). Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>

        <title>Short Form 12-PCS for Quality of Life Assessment</title>
        <description>The SF-12 is weighted and summed to provide easily interpretable scales for physical and mental health. SF-12 score measures substantially limited physical disability, general well-being and the perception of one's state of health, (Physical Component Summary) and also measure the psychological attitude of the patient, the limitation in social and personal activities (Mental Component Summary). Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health.</description>
