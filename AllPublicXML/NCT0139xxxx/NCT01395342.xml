      Introduction:

      Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are an important issue in global public health. It is
      current the leading cause of maternal mortality in Brazil.

      Objective:

      To assess the effect of physical exercise using stationary bicycle through blood pressure and
      heart rate measurements, incidence of pre-eclampsia and quality of life survey in pregnant
      women with chronic high blood pressure, previous preeclampsia pregnancies or both factors
      associated comparing to a group with no intervention. Verify the type of births, maternal and
      perinatal outcomes in both groups. Methodology: This randomized clinical trial enrolled
      pregnant women presenting chronic hih blood pressure, previous pre-eclampsia experience or
      both. Women from 12 to 20 gestational weeks were selected from the prenatal outpatient clinic
      and randomly allocated to the study or non-interventional group. Women at the study group
      performed physical exercise using stationary bicycle (horizontal bench model) during 20
      minutes, once a week. The heart rate was maintained at 20% above resting heart rate and up to
      140 bpm. Blood pressure and heart rate measurements were evaluated before and after exercise.
      The non-intervention group followed regular prenatal routine with weekly returns for heart
      rate and blood pressure measurements. Both groups fulfilled the quality of life survey (SF-36
      questionnaire) at three times: between 12 and 20 weeks; 28 and 32 weeks and 36 and 41 weeks
      of gestation. After that data of parturition will be analyzed to compare the incidence of
      pre-eclampsia, types of birth, maternal and perinatal outcomes.

    <description>The comparison between groups will be by the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed after 20 week of gestation with systolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 90 mmHg and proteinuria greater than or equal 0.3 g/d by 24 hour urine collection.</description>

    <description>Before exercise, blood pressure and heart rate are measured in the sitting position.
Exercise is realized using stationary bicycle (horizontal bench mode) once at week, during 20 minutes under physiotherapist supervision.
The heart rate was maintained at 20% above resting heart rate and up to 140 bpm.
After exercise is performed a leg stretching and a low back stretching. The blood pressure and heart rate are measured in the sitting position.</description>
