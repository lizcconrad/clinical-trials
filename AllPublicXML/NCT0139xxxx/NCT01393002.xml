  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a structured web-based survey in selected hospitals with intensive care units in
      Berlin- Brandenburg that will focus on the analysis of current knowledge in ICUs in the field
      of invasive mycoses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care patients with invasive mycosis require a special clinical expertise especially
      in light of a high lethality. Early identification of patients at risk to develop a fungal
      infection is of utmost importance to start effective antifungal therapy. The implementation
      of current knowledge into clinical practice to fight fungal infection is not clear.
