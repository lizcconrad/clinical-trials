  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been known to be controversial for stopping
      malaria transmission.The addition of primaquine (PQ) - the only drug commercially available
      that kills mature transmission stage - to such treatments might be necessary to eliminate
      this stage. A study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
      (DHP) regimens with or without PQ on the sexual and asexual stages of P. falciparum in
      Sumatra, Indonesia.

      The study was conducted in Hanura Primary Health Center, Padang Cermin district, Lampung
      province (105°45'-103°48'E and 3°45'-6°45'S) located at the southern end of Sumatra island.

      The study subjects received either 3 day doses of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine with or
      without 1 day of primaquine according to their body weight.

      Patients with fever or history of fever within the past 24 hours were screened by microscopic
      examination of Giemsa-stained thick blood films to detect P. falciparum infection.

      All subjects were allocated by open-label randomization to receive DHP alone (on Day 0 to Day
      2) or DHP plus a single dose of PQ (Day 3). The procedures of drug administration in the
      study were as follows:

    <description>This study used fixed-dose tablets of 40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine for each tablet (D-ARTEPP®, Guilin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, China. The regimen is based on weight for 3 days (D0, D1 and D2) with maximal dose of 1 x 3 tablets for patients weighing ≥ 41 kg; 1 x 2 tablets for patients weighing 31 - 40 kg, 1 x 1.5 tablets for patients weighing 18 - 30 kg, and 1 X 1 tablet for patients with body weight of 11 - 17 kg.</description>

    <description>For DHP, treatment was as for Arm dihydroartemisinin piperaquine. A single dose PQ of 0.75 mg/kg BW was provided on Day-3 using 15 mg base PQ tablets (local product by PT Pharos Indonesia, batch no 15306002, produced on 30/05/2008 and expiring on May 2012). The maximal dose was 3 tablets for subjects weighing ≥ 60 kg. The dose range for subjects weighing 10 - 13 kg was 0.5 tablet; 14 - 18 kg was 0.75 tablet; 19 - 23 kg was 1 tablet, 24 -30 kg was 1.5 tablet; 31 - 40 kg was 2 tablets; 41- 49 kg was 2.25 tablet; 50 - 59 kg was 2.5 tablet and ≥ 60 kg was 3 tablets.</description>
