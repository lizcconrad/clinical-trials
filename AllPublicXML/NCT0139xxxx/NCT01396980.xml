      -  SDF is validated by measuring changes in microcirculation in sepsis patients with MOF
           (Boerma studies).

        -  SDF is validated by measuring changes in microcirculation in stable chronic hemodialysis
           patients (NDT 2009 Bemelmans).

        -  Ultrafiltration in stable chronic hemodialysis leads to a decrease in sublingual
           microcirculatory flow (NDT 2009 Bemelmans).

        -  Trendelenburg position improves the sublingual microcirculatory flow at the end of
           hemodialysis treatment (NDT 2009 Bemelmans).

        -  Hemodialysis with ultrafiltration leads to a significant reduction of myocardial
           perfusion and cardiac output (NDT 2009 Dasselaar)

        -  Cardiac output measurement during dialysis is not practical.

        -  BVM is a validated method for hypotension due to ultrafiltration to prevent the amount
           of ultrafiltration online change based on the measured haemoconcentration (ref Dasselaar
           et al NDT 2005).

        -  BCM is a validated measurement to the dry weight in hemodialysis patients measured by a
           bioimpedance technique (NDT Passauer et al 2009).

      The search for an optimal method of ultrafiltration with minimal hypoperfusion of vital
      organs.

        -  Stabile hemodialysis patients with dialysis dependancy for more than 3 months, with
           adequate access

        -  Study duration 3 weeks

        -  Number of hemodialysis treatment for purposes of study: 3

        -  Timing hemodialysis treatments for Study session Monday or Tuesday after the weekend
           (randomized design in the sessions)

             -  session a: 5 hours total duration: 4 hours HD without UF followed by 1 hour GUF

             -  Session b: 4 hours total duration: 4 hours HD with UF

             -  session c: 4 hours total duration: 4 hours HD with UF and BVM

        -  UF is determined by actual target weight.

        -  Measurements during sessions:

             -  In each session in advance: blood pressure, pulse, weight, BCM, laboratory tests
                (Hb, Hct, Na, K, urea, creatinine, calcium, albumin, phosphate, nt-proBNP, troponin
                T, CRP)

             -  During each session at t = 0, t = 1 hour, t =2 hours and t = 4 hours: SDF, blood
                pressure, pulse, UF at that time, UF rate at that time

             -  End each session: blood pressure, pulse, weight, BCM, laboratory tests (Hb, Hct,
                Na, K, urea, creatinine, calcium, albumin, phosphate, nt-proBNP, troponin T, CRP)
