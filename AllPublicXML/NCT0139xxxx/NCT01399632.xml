  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Generally, people with low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in blood are more likely
      to get heart disease than those who have normal or high levels. Dietary fat, whether the
      harmful type (saturated) or beneficial type (unsaturated) raises HDL levels. Dietary
      carbohydrate lowers HDL. The investigators are doing this research study to find out why the
      amount of HDL in a person's blood is affected by dietary unsaturated fat and carbohydrate.
      The investigators will trace the ability of the HDL in a person's blood to take up
      cholesterol, get bigger, and then leave the blood by passing into the liver. The
      investigators want to know if dietary unsaturated fat improves the ability of HDL to do this
      compared to dietary carbohydrate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study the kinetics of multiple types of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
      in humans under two strictly controlled dietary conditions, high unsaturated fat and high
      carbohydrate, in 20 individuals with low HDL cholesterol and overweight or obesity. The
      participants will be given the controlled diets for 4 weeks in a randomized crossover design.
      They will be admitted to the Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital Center for Clinical Investigation
      (CCI) the morning of Day 28 when they will be infused intravenously with a stable isotope
      tracer, trideuterated (D3), leucine for 10 minutes as a bolus. Blood will be sampled in the
      hospital through 24 hours, and thereafter at the ambulatory clinical center throughout 94
      hours. HDL subtypes will be prepared in Dr. Sacks's laboratory at Harvard School of Public
      Health (HSPH) and analyzed for content of lipids and proteins, and for incorporation of the
      tracer into apolipoprotein A-I, the principal protein of HDL. These data will be studied by
      interactive modeling to a multi-compartment model of human HDL physiology that best fits the
      observed data. The model will yield HDL metabolic rates during unsaturated fat and
      carbohydrate-rich diets which will be tested for statistical significance.
