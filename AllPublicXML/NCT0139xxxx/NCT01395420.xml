        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures

          -  Healthy male and female subjects with veins suitable for cannulation or repeated
             venepuncture; female subjects must be postmenopausal or surgically sterile. Female
             subjects must have a negative pregnancy test at screening and on admission to the
             unit, must not be lactating and must be of non-child-bearing potential

          -  Male subjects should be willing to use barrier contraception ie, condoms, from dosing
             to 3 months after dosing with the IP

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 kg/m2

          -  As judged by the Investigator, all the subjects must be able to understand and be
             willing to comply with study procedures, restrictions and requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant disease or disorder (including a
             history of chronic respiratory disease eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease [COPD], cystic fibrosis or interstitial lung disease) which, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study

          -  History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of
             drugs

          -  Known allergy to lidocaine/lignocaine, midazolam, alfentanyl or other topical
             anaesthetics/sedatives in similar classes to these agents

          -  Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of IP

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, lung function test,
             ECG, clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation screen, or urinalysis results as
             judged by the Investigator
