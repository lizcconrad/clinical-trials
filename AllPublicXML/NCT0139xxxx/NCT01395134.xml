    <textblock>
      Injury to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) during thyroidectomy
      results in lowered fundamental frequency of the voice and worsened voice performance in
      producing high-frequency sounds. It remains unclear if use of intraoperative nerve monitoring
      (IONM) can improve clinical outcome of thyroidectomy in terms of preserved individual voice
      performance. This study was designed to test that hypothesis.

    <textblock>
      Phonation changes following thyroidectomy have been reported in many investigations. They are
      considered to be multifactorial in origin and can be a consequence of laryngeal nerve injury
      or other events during thyroidectomy including arytenoids trauma after endotracheal
      intubation, cricothyroid dysfunction, strap muscle malfunction or lesion of the perithyroidal
      neural plexus, laryngotracheal fixation with impairment of vertical movement and
      psychological reaction to the operation. Injury to the external branch of the superior
      laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) can occur during the dissection and clamping of the superior thyroid
      vessels and the prevalence of this complication has been reported from 0.5% to 58%. This
      injury causes a complete paralysis of the cricothyroid muscle which results in lowered
      fundamental frequency of the voice and worsened voice performance in producing high-frequency
      sounds. Intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) has gained widespread acceptance as an adjunct
      to the gold standard of visual nerve identification and this technique can be used to
      identify both the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and the EBSLN. However, it remains unclear
      if there is any IONM added-value to the clinical outcome of thyroidectomy in terms of
      preserved individual voice performance. This study was designed to test that hypothesis.
