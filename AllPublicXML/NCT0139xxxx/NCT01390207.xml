      The effect of altering the timing of hCG administration on the ongoing pregnancy rate in
      patients stimulated with recombinant-FSH (rec-FSH)/gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH)
      antagonists for in vitro fertilisation (IVF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progesterone elevation has been associated with prolongation of the follicular phase in GnRH
      antagonists cycles by two days after the commonly used criterion of the presence of at least
      three follicles of &gt;or= 17 mm has been met. Such an intervention is associated with
      significantly lower ongoing pregnancy rates in GnRH antagonist cycles, without an apparent
      deterioration of embryo quality.

      The adverse effect of P elevation on the day of hCG administration might be explained by the
      induction of differences at the histological level as well as at the gene expression level
      between endometrial samples exposed to varying concentrations of progesterone (P).
      Prolongation of follicular phase by delaying hCG administration for two days is associated
      with a higher incidence of endometrial advancement on the day of oocyte retrieval in GnRH
      antagonist cycles (Kolibianakis et al., 2005). Moreover, Vaerenbergh et al., (2011)
      demonstrated a distinct difference in endometrial gene expression profile between patients
      with progesterone serum concentration above and below the threshold of 1.5 ng/ml on the day
      of HCG administration.

      Due to the fact that earlier triggering of final oocyte maturation is expected to result in
      lower progesterone levels on the day of hCG administration it might be assumed that such an
      intervention might result in an improved probability of pregnancy by leading to a less
      deranged and more receptive endometrium.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether triggering of final
      oocyte maturation as soon as ≥ 3 follicles ≥ 16mm are present on ultrasound or one day later
      affects the probability of pregnancy in patients stimulated with rec-FSH/GnRH- antagonists
      for IVF.

    <description>Final oocyte maturation will be achieved by administration of 10.000 IU of hCG (Pregnyl®). Randomization will be into 2 groups:
• Group A (early hCG group): hCG will be administrated as soon as ≥ 3 follicles ≥ 16mm were present on ultrasound.</description>
