  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad the combination of two
      medications, everolimus and bevacizumab, has on kidney cancer. In this clinical trial we are
      now testing these medications in combination. We think that both together might work better
      that either drug alone. Importantly, both of these drugs together have been tested in
      patients with a different type of kidney cancer and patients tolerated the combination well.

    <description>This is a single-institution, single-arm phase II trial of everolimus in combination with bevacizumab in patients with advanced non-clear cell RCC, who have not received prior VEGF-.or mTOR-targeted therapy. A separate cohort of patients with non-clear cell RCC with papillary features will be enrolled in order to gather information regarding the efficacy given the rarity of these entities.</description>

    <description>Cycle length will be defined as 28 days. Treatment will include everolimus 10mg, self administered orally once daily on a continuous schedule (days 1-28), and bevacizumab 10mg/kg, administered intravenously on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. Treatment will be continued until disease progression, major toxicity, or withdrawal from the study for any reason. Dose modification will be permitted based on toxicity. Patients that come off study before 6 months before documented progression/death will be treated as events for the 6 month PFS endpoint.</description>

             study and 8 weeks after. Highly effective contraception methods include combination of
             any two of the following:

               1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or;

             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior
             to randomization. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status

             considered not of child-bearing potential.

             investigational drugs ≤ 4 weeks prior to study treatment start.

             hypersensitivity to Everolimus or other rapamycin analogs (e.g. sirolimus,
             temsirolimus).

             significantly alter the absorption of oral Everolimus.

          -  Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered
             potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study
