  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is designed to (1) establish the feasibility of a research strategy for
      discovering ethnic differences in the frequency of genotypes in patients after bariatric
      surgery and (2) perform a preliminary evaluation of this research strategy. Our goal is to
      identify genetic factors that may influence the success of various surgical weight loss
      interventions and determine whether these factors are associated with specific patient
      populations.

      Goals:

        1. Establish feasibility of obtaining research consent on patients to collect clinical
           data, family history, and blood samples.

        2. Complete comprehensive genetic analyses on a diverse group of severely obese patients
           who have undergone bariatric surgery, specifically the primarily non-Caucasian Bellevue
           population and the Caucasian population of Geisinger Health Systems and NYU Langone
           Weight Management Program, to help define genetic factors that influence which surgical
           interventions work best for which patients. The ultimate aim is to rapidly translate
           these discoveries into practical solutions.

      Methods and Procedures: The participants of this study are all patients who have undergone
      bariatric surgery at Bellevue Hospital, NYU Langone Weight Management Program, and Geisinger
      Health System. The investigators have already completed this in 200 patients and plan to
      increase enrollment for a total of 2500 patients. The investigators will collect blood
      samples on bariatric surgery patients and send the blood to Geisinger for genotyping and
      analysis. An extra sample of venous blood (about 4 tablespoons or 40ml) will be collected at
      the time of routine postoperative visits. In addition, the investigators will use information
      that has routinely been and will be collected during postoperative visits as part of the care
      that bariatric patients receive. The investigators will look at the electronic medical record
      to obtain the preoperative weights. This includes questionnaires patients complete and the
      results of the laboratory tests and other studies.
