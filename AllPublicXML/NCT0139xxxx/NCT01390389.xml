  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study and compare measures of brain energy metabolism in
      geriatric bipolar individuals and healthy older adults. The investigators would also like to
      investigate changes in brain energy metabolites associated with CoQ10 administration in older
      bipolar individuals. Finally, resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) will
      be conducted in order to explore frontal and limbic circuitry in geriatric bipolar disorder.

        -  Primary Hypothesis: Baseline beta NTP and NAA will be lower, and PCr and lactate higher
           in Geri BPD compared with older healthy controls

        -  Secondary Hypothesis: Changes in PCr and beta NTP will be demonstrated in Geri BD group
           challenged with CoQ 10.

      Research Design and Methods:

      Bipolar Depressed Subjects:

      The Bipolar Depressed group will consist of 10 subjects (for the purposes of this study we
      would like to be able to recruit up to 30 subjects, with the goal of getting 10 to complete
      the protocol), ages 55-89, meeting DSM IV-TR criteria for bipolar disorder, current episode
      depressed, with depression severity rated by the MADRS and the Clinical Global Impression of
      severity scale (CGI). The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) will be used to assess concomitant
      manic symptoms and neuropsychological measures to assess cognitive status. Subjects with any
      current or previous Axis I disorder diagnosis other than Bipolar Disorder, including
      dementia, unstable medical illness or any contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) will be excluded. Subjects may be concurrently prescribed other psychotropic
      medications, but dosages must be unchanged for one week prior to study entry and subjects
      must be willing to continue these medications during the study. All subjects must be able to
      provide written informed consent. Furthermore, subjects will be asked to complete a
      demographic information form.

      Recruitment will take place through referrals from the McLean Hospital Geriatric Psychiatry
      Inpatient Service, Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Program: SAGE (Seniors Aging Gracefully
      Everyday) the Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic, other inpatient, partial and outpatient
      psychiatric programs at McLean Hospital, the Cambridge Health Alliance, local geriatricians,
      the Harvard Division on Aging, local retirement communities, community psychiatrists,
      Partners Community Health Care PCP's, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's
      PCP network and similar external programs, as well as through radio and internet
      advertisements. We have obtained permission from the directors of both the Inpatient Service
      (Older Adult Unit) and Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Program (SAGE Program) to have a
      research assistant look through patient charts to identity eligible subjects. Once a
      potential subject has been identified, study staff will discuss the possibility of study
      participation with the patient's doctor to see if the study would be appropriate. If the
      doctor agrees about the patient's eligibility, the doctor will discuss the study with the
      patient and refer patients who are interested in participating to a member of our study
      staff.

      Bipolar Subject Protocol

      Summary:

      This study is 4 weeks long, and will consist of 4 visits to the hospital. After an initial
      phone screening, subjects will come in for a baseline visit where they will meet with a
      psychiatrist to assess their past and current psychiatric and medical history. Subjects will
      also be administered the following mood rating scales: the MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg
      Depression Rating Scale), CGI (Clinical Global Impressions Scale), YMRS (Young Mania Rating
      Scale), GDS (Geriatric Depression Scale), and neuropsychological measures. If the subjects
      are fatigued, or if scheduling does not permit, screening procedures may be split into two
      visits that will occur within one week of each other. Within 7 days after the screening
      visit, subjects will come in for a baseline visit where they will have a 60 minute long 4.0T
      MRS scan. , The baseline and screening visit will take place before starting CoQ10. Subjects
      will be scheduled to have a 3T MRI scan for diagnostic purposes as soon as possible; however,
      this scan can take place at any point during the study. In addition, we will be obtaining a
      Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and a
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging study during the 3T MRI scan to obtain further information about
      specific nerve cell tracts or networks within the brain. During the fMRI portion of the scan
      we will not be asking you to perform any tasks; rather you will be asked to lay still with
      your eyes open and breathe normally. For all other portions of the scan there are no
      restrictions on closing your eyes. After the baseline visit, subjects will start taking CQ10
      (dose schedule on page 13) for the next 4 weeks. Subjects will come in again at week 2 for a
      follow-up evaluation with Dr. Forester and will be administered the MADRS, CGI, and YMRS. At
      week 2, subjects will have another 4T scan, which will last 60 minutes. At week 4, subjects
      will have a third 60 minute long 4T MRI scan and will be re-administered the MADRS, CGI,
      YMRS, GDS and the neuropsychological tests (week 4 procedures may be split into two visits,
      within a week of each other, should subjects become fatigued, or if scheduling does not
      permit). The Wisconsin Card Sort Test and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) will only
      be administered during the baseline visit and will not be administered to subjects during
      their last follow-up visits.

      The study doctor will monitor response to treatment and changes in psychiatric clinical
      symptoms during the course of the 4 week treatment with CoQ10. If at any time during the
      study there are clinical changes that warrant a further clinical assessment by the study
      subject's primary clinician, the study principal investigator will refer the subject to their
      primary care clinician and/or psychiatrist as clinically needed.

      Additionally, in the interest of having a standardized instrument to measure for side
      effects, we would like to include the Frequency and Intensity of Side Effects Ratings scale
      (FISER), a 3-item self-rated measure of medication side effects for our study. The principal
      investigator will continue to monitor for side effects during the clinical interview.

      Control Subjects:

      The control group will consist of 10 subjects (for the purposes of this study we would like
      to be able to recruit up to 30 subjects, with the goal of getting up to 10 to complete the
      protocol), ages 55-89, (matched with BPD group for age) without a known psychiatric disorder,
      unstable medical illness or any contraindications to MRI. A board certified geriatric
      psychiatrist will assess all control subjects for all current and past psychiatric disorders.
      Control subjects with any evidence of current or past psychiatric disorders will be excluded
      from the study. The Control Group will be recruited through contacts with the Harvard
      Division on Aging, local retirement communities and advertisements on the internet, in
      senior/city newspapers, and senior centers. Dr. Forester may also conduct in-service talks at
      local assisted living communities. Control subjects will meet the following conditions:

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  55 years or older

        -  Able to provide informed consent

        -  Must speak English

        -  Women entering this study must be post-menopausal.

      Exclusion Criteria:

      Same criteria for the Bipolar Depressed group with the exception of the &quot;first episode of
      mania&quot; which is not applicable.

      Control Subject Protocol

      Control subjects (N=10) will be consented during the initial screening visit. The control
      subjects will not be given CoQ10. Otherwise, control subjects will follow the same protocol
      as the bipolar depressed subjects for the screening visit and will undergo the same
      psychiatric evaluation, implementation of rating scales and MRIs) as the bipolar depressed
      subjects (see above). The SCID and the clinical labs are not necessary components for the
      control protocol. Dr. Forester will assess current and past psychiatric symptoms and
      diagnoses with a standard clinical psychiatric interview. Approximately 1 week after the
      screening visit, control subjects will be scheduled to undergo the 4T MRS scan. The mood
      measures (MADRS and the YMRS) will be re-administered to the subjects during this visit. The
      3T MRI scan will be scheduled as soon as possible but may be scheduled at any point during
      the subject's participation in the study. Control subjects will return 2 and 4 weeks after
      the baseline 4T visit to repeat the scan using the same protocol. Control subjects will have
      a total of three 4T MRS scans (during the baseline visit and the 2 and 4-week follow-up
      visits). The mood rating scales will be re-administered during the week 2 visit.
      Additionally, the mood measures and the neuropsychological tests will be re-administered
      during the week 4 visit. Control subjects will also be asked to complete a demographic
      information and clinical history form.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Bipolar subjects were recruited from the McLean Hospital Geriatric Psychiatry Inpatient and Outpatients services, and similar external programs, as well as through radio and internet advertisements. Controls through contacts with the Harvard Division on Aging, local retirement communities and advertisements on the internet, and senior centers.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects who met DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Bipolar Disorder and were currently depressed episode were assigned to the CoQ10 group. The CoQ10 group was to receive CoQ10 therapy for 4 weeks. Healthy control subjects no evidence of current or past psychiatric disorders were assigned to the Control group. This group did not receive CoQ10 therapy.</pre_assignment_details>
