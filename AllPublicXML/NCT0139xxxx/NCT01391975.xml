  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newly formed dialysis fistulae can often fail, and failure is usually due to narrowing of the
      blood vessels. Methods of detecting narrowing are available and, more importantly, can detect
      narrowings before a fistula fails. It is not known whether treating these narrowings will
      actually improve fistula survival or if the majority can be left alone. we wish to see if we
      can detect such narrowings with ultrasound scanning and if early detection and treatment
      improves patient outcomes.
