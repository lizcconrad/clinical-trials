      In this survey of X-Lined Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (XLHED) carrier females, Edimer
      proposes to review responses to an XLHED Carrier Outlook toward Reproduction Survey in order
      to understand attitudes toward reproduction, potential treatments and genetic testing in
      order to improve the understanding of the decisions that XLHED carrier females make regarding
      their reproductive future.
