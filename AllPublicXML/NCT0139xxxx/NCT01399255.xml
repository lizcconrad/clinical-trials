      The aim of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of two rapid-acting insulin Lispro
      formulations: Humalog® and Listro™ in healthy subjects based on the pharmacokinetic parameter
      (PK) and the pharmacodynamic parameter (PD).

      The purpose of this study is to assess the bioequivalence of two rapid-acting insulin Lispro
      formulations: Humalog® and Listro™ in healthy subjects, based on the pharmacokinetic
      parameter (PK) AUC (INS-LIS 0-8h) and the pharmacodynamic parameter (PD) AUC (GIR 0-8h) and
      also assess the safety and local tolerability of the two insulin preparations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subjects.

          2. Age ≥18 and ≤50 years.

          3. Considered generally healthy upon completion of medical history, physical examination
             and biochemical investigations as judged by the Investigator.

          4. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 27.0 kg/m2, inclusive.

          5. Non-smoker, defined as no nicotine consumption for at least one year.

          6. Signed and dated informed consent obtained before any trial-related activities.
             (Trial-related activities are any procedure that would not have been performed during
             normal management of the subject)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous participation in this trial or other clinical trials within the last 30 days.

          2. Pregnant, breast-feeding or the intention of becoming pregnant or not using adequate
             contraceptive measures (e.g. intrauterine device (IUD) that has been in place for at
             least 3 months, or sterilization, or the oral contraceptive pill, which should have
             been taken without difficulty for at least 3 months, an approved hormonal implant or
             double barrier method) including male condoms used plus spermicide, diaphragm with
             spermicide plus male condom cap with spermicide plus male condom are acceptable
             options).

          3. Clinically significant abnormal hematology or biochemistry screening tests, as judged
             by the Investigator. In particular, subjects with an elevated fasting blood glucose,
             elevated liver enzymes (AST or ALT &gt;2 times the upper limit of normal) or impaired
             renal function (elevated serum creatinine values above the upper limit will not be
             allowed to enter the trial. Subjects with abnormal TSH may be required to have
             additional testing of thyroid hormones for further clarification. Subjects with
             abnormal TSH judged by the Investigator as clinically significant will be excluded
             from the study.

          4. Any serious systemic infectious disease during the four weeks prior to the first dose
             of test drug, as judged by the Investigator.

          5. History of any illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might confound the
             results of the trial or pose risk in administering the trial drug to the subject. In
             particular, subjects with significant cardiovascular disease, anemia (hemoglobin below
             the lower limit of normal) or hemoglobinopathy will not be allowed to enter the trial.

          6. Cardiac problems defined as decompensated heart failure (New York Heart Association
             (NYHA) class III and IV) at any time and/or angina pectoris within the last 12 months
             and/or acute myocardial infarction at any time.

          7. Clinically significant abnormal ECG at screening, as judged by the Investigator.

          9. Any positive screen for drugs of abuse.

         10. Hepatitis B or C or HIV positive.

         11. Use of prescription drugs within 3 weeks preceding the first dosing of insulin, except
             for oral contraceptives/hormonal implants.

         12. Use of non-prescription drugs, except routine vitamins or herbal products, within 3
             weeks prior to the first dose of the test drug.

         13. Occasional use of acetaminophen is permitted. Acetaminophen is not allowed on the
             dosing day until 4 hours postdosing.

         14. Use of systemic corticosteroids, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, prostaglandin
             blockers, systemic non-selective beta-blockers, growth hormones

         15. Thyroid hormones are not allowed unless stable during the past 3 months.

         16. Any use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) except for low-dose Aspirin is
             not allowed within 7 days prior to dosing and on the dosing day.

         17. Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or co-operation.

         18. Blood donation of more than 500 ml within the last 12 weeks.

         19. History of multiple and/or severe allergies to drugs or foods or a history of severe
             anaphylactic reaction.

         20. Known or suspected allergy to trial product or related products.

         22. Any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would represent an
             unacceptable risk for the subject's safety.
