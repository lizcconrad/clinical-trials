      Subjects will have failed conservative treatment, including, but not limited to oral
      medications, physical therapy, manual manipulation, and/or alternative medicine. They will be
      evaluated by a spine specialist in the Spine Division of the Department of Orthopaedics and
      will be scheduled for a piriformis muscle (PM) corticosteroid injection.

    <time_frame>Following fluoroscopic guidance of the needle placement and prior to the injection, the needle position will be evaluated by ultrasound.</time_frame>
    <description>Following the fluoroscopically guided needle placement, the non-invasive ultrasound probe will then be placed on the skin with gel and will be used to visualize the needle tip and evaluate the accuracy of the fluoroscopically guided needle placement. Needle placement will be recorded as either inside or outside the piriformis muscle.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject Scheduled to receive piriformis injection for buttock pain

          -  Baseline pain visual analogue scale (VAS) value of at least 4 on a scale of 0-10
             points

          -  Subjective complaint of pain in the buttocks with radiation down the thigh and/or leg

          -  Objective clinical diagnosis of piriformis syndrome

          -  Reproduction of pain with maneuvers that stretch or contract the piriformis muscle
             over the sciatic nerve

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Litigation

          -  Those receiving long-term (&gt;6 months) remuneration for their pain or seeking new or
             increased long-term remuneration

          -  Those unable to read English and complete the assessment instruments

          -  Diagnosis of systemic inflammatory arthritis (e.g. rheumatoid, lupus)

          -  Addictive behavior, severe clinical depression or psychotic features. The subjects
             will be identified at the sole discretion of the PI who per the current standard of
             care will consent the potential subjects to the study

          -  Possible pregnancy or other reason that precludes the use of fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy
             is the current standard of care for piriformis injections. Its use in this study is no
             different than the standard of care and will be no different if the subjects are
             enrolling in the study or not

          -  Contra-indication to corticosteroid, including known allergies or sensitivities
