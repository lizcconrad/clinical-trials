  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RIRE-1 is a randomized, open-label with blinded end-point study that will test the hypothesis
      that remote ischemic preconditioning initiated at the time of the admission in the cathlab
      reduces infarct size in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated
      with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Furthermore, it will determine whether a
      combined approach remote ischemic preconditioning and local ischemic postconditioning can
      further reduce infarct size. Infarct size will be determined by cardiac magnetic resonance
      imaging at 3-month follow-up and with 72 hours area under curve of CK-MB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the management of STEMI, prompt reperfusion of the jeopardized myocardium is the most
      effective way to limit infarct size, which is a major determinant of morbidity and mortality.
      However, restoration of blood flow may paradoxically have deleterious consequences and lead
      to lethal myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Local ischemic postconditioning (IPost) and
      remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPer) are promising methods to decrease
      ischemia-reperfusion injury.

      The hypothesis tested in this research proposal is that RIPer initiated at the time of the
      admission in the cathlab reduces infarct size in STEMI patients treated with PCI.
      Furthermore, the investigators will determine whether a combined approach RIPer + IPost can
      further reduce infarct size.
