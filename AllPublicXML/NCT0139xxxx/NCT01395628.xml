      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors learn more about cancer and the development of drug resistance in patients.
      It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial is studying samples from patients with leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Demonstrate the capability of primary human leukemia samples to survive and proliferate
           in the zebrafish embryo.

        -  Confirm the anti-proliferative or toxic effects of known chemotherapeutics on the
           transplanted cells in vivo.

        -  Evaluate the effect of novel anticancer drugs and/or their combinations on individual
           samples.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Cryopreserved specimens are injected into the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos under anesthesia.
      After 1 hour of recovery at 28° C, embryos are maintained at 38° C and screened for
      fluorescence at the injection site. Within 48 hours post-injection, some embryos are treated
      with various chemotherapeutic drugs or dimethyl sulfoxide and incubated in protease solution.
      Proliferation of leukemia cells are monitored by live-cell microscopy. Cells with or without
      drug treatment are then extracted at 24 and 72 hours post-injection. Leukemia cells are
      counted and tested with imatinib mesylate, all-trans retinoic acid (tretinoin), cytosine
      arabinose, and known bioactive chemical compounds from promising drug families, such as
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antiapoptotic agents, channel modulators, and prostaglandin
      agonists.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Samples of blood and tissue cells from patients diagnosed with myeloid disease
             including the following subtypes:

               -  Chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), to complement initial studies in
                  the K562 CML cell line

               -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), to complement initial studies in the NB4 APL
                  cell line

               -  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) expressing the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation, which
                  occurs in approximately 12% of pediatric AML and is associated with good
                  prognosis

               -  AML expressing 5q- or monosomy 7, associated with a poor prognosis

               -  AML expressing the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication
                  (FLT3-ITD), associated with a poor prognosis

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Not specified

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:

          -  Not specified
