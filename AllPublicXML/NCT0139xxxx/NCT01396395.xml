  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study of 402 cases of stable angina subjects who were diagnosed as Coronary Heart
      Disease (CHD) is a randomized, blank controlled, multi-center clinical study. Subjects who
      are taking standard treatment with stable symptoms will receive a 24-hour ambulatory
      electrocardiogram (ECG) (Holter) examination. They will be randomly divided into two groups.
      The nicorandil group will receive nicorandil 5 milligram (mg) (3 times a day = tid) on top of
      the standard treatment for 12 weeks, while the control group will stay on standard treatment.
      Nitrates and beta blockers need to be maintained on a stable dose. Other drugs that do not
      affect the primary endpoint may be adjusted per investigators decision.

    <description>Myocardial ischemia attack was evaluated by 24-hour Holter monitoring based on the following criteria: 0.08 seconds after the J point in electrocardiogram (ECG) or compared with baseline levels, ST-segment with horizontal or downward sloping down greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.1 millivolts (mV), and lasted for &gt;= 1 minute, and at least 1 minute of interval with another ischemic attack, as one array myocardial ischemia.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum ST- depression was evaluated from sum of all leads for all the subjects with myocardial ischemia attack. Absolute value of maximum ST-depression was used for calculation.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Experienced Ischemic Heart Attack During the Six-minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of subjects who experienced ischemic heart attack during the Six-minute walk test (6-MWT) were evaluated.The 6-MWT was the distance that a subject could walk in 6 minutes. Subjects were asked to perform the test at a pace that was comfortable to them, with as many breaks as they needed. The 6-MWT was completed within 1-hour after wearing Holter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Rate: Time Domain</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HRV is the degree of fluctuation in the length of the intervals between heart beats. All HRV parameters are calculated on 'normal-to-normal' (NN) inter-beat intervals (or NN intervals) caused by normal heart contractions. Standard deviation of all NN intervals (SDNN) and Standard deviation of the averages of NN intervals (SDANN) are the two time domain methods used to determine heart rate variability. Two variants of the SDNN, created by dividing the 24-hour monitoring period into 5-minute segments, are the SDNN index and the SDANN index. The SDNN index is the mean of all the 5-minute standard deviations of NN (normal RR) intervals during the 24-hour period, while the SDANN index is the standard deviation of all the 5-minute NN interval means.</description>

    <time_frame>At Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HRV is the degree of fluctuation in the length of the intervals between heart beats. All HRV parameters are calculated on 'normal-to-normal' (NN) inter-beat intervals (or NN intervals) caused by normal heart contractions.

    <description>An AE was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were defined as the AEs that occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        <title>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Rate: Time Domain</title>
        <description>HRV is the degree of fluctuation in the length of the intervals between heart beats. All HRV parameters are calculated on ‘normal-to-normal’ (NN) inter-beat intervals (or NN intervals) caused by normal heart contractions. Standard deviation of all NN intervals (SDNN) and Standard deviation of the averages of NN intervals (SDANN) are the two time domain methods used to determine heart rate variability. Two variants of the SDNN, created by dividing the 24-hour monitoring period into 5-minute segments, are the SDNN index and the SDANN index. The SDNN index is the mean of all the 5-minute standard deviations of NN (normal RR) intervals during the 24-hour period, while the SDANN index is the standard deviation of all the 5-minute NN interval means.</description>

TEAEs were defined as the AEs that occurred between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>
