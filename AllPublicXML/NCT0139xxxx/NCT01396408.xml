    <textblock>
      This research is being done because there is no treatment that will cure this type of cancer.
      Although some types of chemotherapy can cause this cancer to shrink for a time, better
      options are needed.

      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects the study drugs - sunitinib or
      temsirolimus - will have on this type of cancer. The study will begin by finding out if
      sunitinib can shrink the cancer. If sunitinib does not work, temsirolimus will be tested
      next.

               -  Patient or guardian consent must be obtained on all patients according to local

                  Children &gt; 8 years old whose parent or guardian has signed consent on their
                  behalf may also sign assent if desired. It will be the responsibility of the
                  local participating investigators to obtain the necessary local clearance, and to
                  indicate in writing to the NCIC CTG Study Coordinator that such clearance has
                  been obtained, before the trial can commence in that centre. Because of differing
                  requirements, a standard consent form for the trial will not be provided but a
                  sample form is provided. A copy of the initial full board REB approval and
                  approved consent form must be sent to the central office. The patient or their
                  parent/legal guardian must sign the consent form prior to registration. Please
                  note that the consent form for this study must contain a statement which gives
                  permission for the NCIC CTG and monitoring agencies to review patient records.

               -  Patients must be accessible for treatment, response assessment and follow-up.
                  Patients registered on this trial must be treated and followed at the
                  participating centre. This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits
                  (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance) placed on patients being considered
                  for this trial. (Call the NCIC CTG office at 613-533-6430 if questions arise
                  regarding the interpretation of this criterion.) Investigators must assure
                  themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete
                  documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up.

             In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working
             days of patient registration.

                  PDGFR inhibitors. Patients who have had prior treatment with mTOR inhibitors are
                  ineligible for temsirolimus; patients who have had prior treatment with VEGFR,

                       the ability to obtain consent or limit compliance with study requirements

                    2. Active uncontrolled infection

                    3. Any other medical conditions that might be aggravated by treatment
