  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand more about why some patients choose to have
      surgery to treat their papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) and others choose to have their
      papillary microcarcinoma (PMC) regularly watched by their doctor to see if and when they may
      need surgery (referred to as &quot;active surveillance&quot;). The investigators also hope learn more
      about what patients and their family members worry about or feel they will gain from surgery
      or active surveillance.

    <description>We'll conduct focus groups &amp; individual interviews with 2 population segments established by the method of Krueger &amp; Casey &amp; Morgan. The population segments will be thyroid cancer patients who have had surg or have scheduled surg, &amp; any pt-designated significant others who assisted pts with tx decision-making &amp; thyroid cancer pts who chose to not have immediate surg, whether they are either postponing their tx decision until a later date, or have committed to active surveillance rather than surg, &amp; any pt-designated significant others who assisted these patients with tx decision-making.</description>

    <description>In this exploratory study we will conduct focus groups and individual interviews with two population segments according to the established methodology of Krueger and Casey [13] and Morgan [14]. We will conduct 4-6 focus groups, two to three within each population segment, to evaluate the process of decision-making to manage papillary microcarcinoma, factors that influenced decision-making, understanding of risk for recurrence and other negative outcomes due to thyroid cancer, information needed to make informed decisions, and what could influence thyroid cancer patients who have had surgery or have scheduled to have surgery to remove their papillary microcarcinomas to consider active surveillance. Individual interviews will be offered and conducted as needed for those patients who are unable to attend a focus group due to scheduling conflicts or other reasons.</description>
