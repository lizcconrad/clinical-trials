      As a participant in these research program you will be a parent of a child born at Wesley
      Medical Center who plan to use Carriage Park Pediatric Clinic for your child's care. Mobile
      phone text messages will be sent to remind you of your child's immunizations.

      health literacy through an innovative text messaging system regarding immunization schedules
      for children under the age of six.
