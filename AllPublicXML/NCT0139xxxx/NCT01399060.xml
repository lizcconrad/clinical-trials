    <textblock>
      This single-site, within-subject, experimental study is designed to test the hypothesis
      children who live in a household in which one or both of their parent smoke will exhibit a
      higher cough threshold and will prefer more intense sweet tastes than children who live in a
      household where neither parent smokes. Subjects will include at least 50 racially and
      ethnically diverse, healthy children aged 10 to 17 years (a critical time for experimenting
      with tobacco) and a parent. The sample will comprise two groups: Non-Environmental Tobacco
      Smoke (ETS) Exposed (neither the child nor parents has ever smoked or been exposed to
      environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in the home), and ETS-Exposed (the parent has smoked at
      least 3 cigarettes per day for at least five years in the home, with the child living in the
      home continuously). Cough sensitivity will be measured using a standard single-inhalation
      challenge, a test of the minimum concentration of capsaicin (the spicy chemical in hot
      peppers) needed to elicit cough. Sweet taste preferences will be measured using a
      forced-choice paired comparison method of liquids which differ in sucrose content. Measures
      of breath carbon monoxide will validate the smoking status of parents and their adolescent
      children. The key comparison will be between Non-ETS Exposed and ETS-Exposed children, with
      the difference between smoking and non-smoking parents as a positive control. Because smoking
      and non-smoking families may differ in ways besides tobacco exposure, the investigators will
      obtain health histories (with a focus on respiratory illness), smoking histories, measures of
      body weight, diet, and responses to personality tests (including susceptibility to
      addiction). The investigators will also obtain genomic DNA from saliva samples. Genes for
      chemosensory receptors that are part of the cough reflex pathway and genotype may account for
      aspects of cough sensitivity.

      Saliva samples will be obtained from the subjects, if consented. These saliva samples will be
      genotyped at the Monell Center for genes that may play a role in chemical irritation and
      flavor-perception. This testing is exploratory in nature.

        Approximately 50 parent-child dyads (N=100 subjects total) will be tested on two days
        separated by at least 2-3 days. The children will be between the ages of 10 and 17 years.
        Half of sample will be children whose mothers are current smokers and the other have will
        be children whose mothers and fathers never smoked in their lifetimes.
