  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract community infections are one of very frequent reason consultation and
      prescription. Urinary tract represents the second site of bacterial community infection after
      the respiratory system. The management of the acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis was simply
      codified in the past recommendations of the French Agency for Safety Health Products
      (AFSSAPS) in 2008. Treatment is based on two main families of antibiotics, fluoroquinolones
      with 7 days treatment and 3rd generation cephalosporins with 10 to 14 days treatment.

      The practice of a short treatment with ceftriaxone intra venous relayed by cefixime orally
      provides a simplified treatment for patients, a reduced use of fluoroquinolones and a
      probable decrease in correlation with the emergence of fluoroquinolones resistance, and
      finally, a decrease in the cost of treatment of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis.

      Patients will be included by investigators or coinvestigateurs, the day of consultation in
      the emergency adult department in Clermont-Ferrand city.

      The diagnosis of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis is established in the emergency
      department based on the clinical, laboratory and imaging criteria.

      Clinical, biological and radiological data will gathered during this consultation :

        -  Clinical data: flank pain, fever, urinary symptoms,

        -  Biological data: urine dipstick (BU No. 1), cytobacteriological urinary (ECBU No. 1),
           blood prélèvements (Blood count, creatinine, CRP)

        -  Imagery: renal and bladder ultrasound. During the next consultations in the emergency
           department, respectively on day 3 (J3) of treatment and on day 9 (J9), urine tests
           (urinary dipsticks [BU No. 2 and No. 3] and cytobacteriological urinary [ECBU No. 2 and
           No. 3] will be realised. The clinical and biological management of patient will be
           performed by the same department to ensure a better comparability of biological results
           and a centralized real-time clinical data.

      Patient follow-up will end with a phone call on day 37 (J37), and the rate of clinical
      relapses and / or biological occurred between day 9 and day 37.
