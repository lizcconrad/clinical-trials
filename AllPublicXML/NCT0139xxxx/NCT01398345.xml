      Background

      —Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with restricted physical capacity, limited quality
      of life, and a poor prognosis because of right heart failure. The present study is the first
      prospective randomized study to evaluate the effects of exercise and respiratory training in
      patients with severe symptomatic PH.

      Methods

      —Patients with PH on stable disease-targeted medication will be randomly assigned to a
      control and a primary training group. Medication will remain unchanged during the study
      period. Primary end points will be the changes from baseline to week 15 in the distance
      walked in 6 minutes and in scores of the Short Form Health Survey quality-of-life
      questionnaire. Changes in WHO functional class, Borg scale, and parameters of
      echocardiography and gas exchange also will be assessed.

      Prospects

      —We hope this study will indicate that respiratory and physical training are a promising
      adjunct to medical treatment in severe PH.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with severe chronic PH who were stable and compensated under optimized
             medical therapy (such as endothelin antagonists, iloprost, sildenafil, calcium channel
             blockers, anticoagulants, diuretics, and supplemental oxygen) for at least 3 months
             before entering the study will be invited to participate.

        Additional inclusion criteria will be age of between 18 and 75 years and World Health
