      In this study the investigators will determine whether corticosteroids given at the time of
      urinary tract infection help prevent permanent damage to the kidneys.

      Because host inflammatory response is the final and most important step in the formation of
      renal scars, the use of anti-inflammatory agents may be the best strategy to reduce renal
      scarring. In animal studies, the use of corticosteroids has been shown to be effective in
      preventing post-pyelonephritic scarring. We will conduct a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of 3 days of daily adjuvant dexamethasone
      on the incidence of renal scarring 4 to 6 months after a first febrile UTI. We hypothesize
      that the proportion of children with UTI who develop renal scarring will be lower among
      children who are treated with both dexamethasone and antibiotics as compared with children
      treated with antibiotics alone.
