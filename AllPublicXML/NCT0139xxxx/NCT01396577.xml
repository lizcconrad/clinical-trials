        Inclusion:

          1. Healthy male or female subjects, age 18 to 55 years old, inclusive, at Screening

          2. Body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 32 kg/m^2, inclusive, at Screening

        Exclusion:

          1. Subjects who are taking any prescribed or over-the-counter drug or herbal remedies in
             the 2 weeks prior to Screening (unless the OTC drug has a long halflife [i.e., 5 x 1/2
             greater than 2 weeks]) with the exception of acetaminophen (up to 4 g/day), which is
             allowed up to 12 hours prior to dosing

          2. Subjects who have taken St John's Wort or other dietary aids known to induce CYP3A4
             within 4 weeks prior to dosing

          3. Subjects who have taken any inhibitor of CYP450 within 2 weeks prior to the first
             dosing (e.g., grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruit-containing beverages, apple or
             Seville orange products)

          4. Subjects who have received any experimental drug within the 12 weeks leading up to the
             start of study drug treatment or who are currently enrolled in another clinical trial

          5. Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol abuse within the 6 months prior
             to Screening or who have a positive urine drug test or breath alcohol test at
             Screening or Baseline, or who are unwilling to abstain from consumption of alcohol
             throughout the periods of in-patient confinement

          6. Subjects who consume more than 5 caffeinated beverages per day (e.g., 5 cups of tea,
             coffee or cans of cola) or who are unwilling to abstain from consumption of
             caffeine-containing food and beverages throughout the periods of in-patient
             confinement

          7. Subjects who smoke more than 5 cigarettes (or equivalent amount of tobacco) per day or
             who are unwilling to abstain from the use of nicotine-containing products throughout
             the period of in-patient confinement

          8. Subjects who have a history of drug abuse or dependence or have a positive result from
             a urine drug screening test

          9. Women of child-bearing potential who do not agree to use 2 methods of adequate
             contraception (e.g., intrauterine device, barrier methods with spermicide) throughout
             the study and for 30 days after study drug administration
