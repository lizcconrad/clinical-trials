    <textblock>
      Multicentre, retrospective observational cohort study based on LHU administrative databases
      aimed to described the pharmacoutilization of antipsychotics in patients affected by
      schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the resource consumption and medication adherence. A sub
      analysis will be performed for those patients switching from Quetiapine IR to Quetiapine XR
      and comparing the periods before and after the switch.
