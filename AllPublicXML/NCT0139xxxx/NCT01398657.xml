  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized clinical study comparing primary prostate cryoablation alone
      (No-ADT group) with cryoablation plus short-term adjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy
      (Adj-ADT group) in the treatment of patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects (N=182) who have high-risk prostate cancer and have undergone primary prostate
      cryotherapy will be screened and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either adjuvant ADT
      (Adj-ADT) or No-ADT until disease progression. Screening and randomization will be done
      within four weeks after cryoablation. Only those who are assigned to Adj-ADT will receive ADT
      for a total of 12 months. PSA will be checked every 3 months in the first year after Cryo and
      every 6 months thereafter. Long-term follow-up parameters include serum PSA and
      protocol-mandated biopsies (at 36 months after Cryo, irrespective of PSA levels if recurrence
      has not been documented). For-cause biopsy will also be done if post-Cryo PSA elevation
      reaches the Phoenix criteria (Nadir + 2 ng/ml) or when the treating physician thinks it
      necessary to document tumor recurrence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age&gt;20 years

          2. Histopathology proven prostate adenocarcinoma

          3. Non-metastatic localized disease

          4. Prostate cancer is deemed high-risk for recurrence(PSA&gt;20 ng/ml, Gleason score&gt;=8, or
             clinical staging&gt;=T2c)

          5. Subjects have undergone prostate cryoablation as the definitive treatment prior to
             enrolling the study

          6. Subjects who have not been treated with any definitive treatments for prostate cancer,
             including radical prostatectomy or definitive radiotherapy. However, those who have
             undergone focal prostate cryoablation and have cancer recurrence are still eligible.

          7. Subjects may or may not have received neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT)
             in the forms of either castration (medical) and/or antiandrogens. Surgical castration
             (orchiectomy) is not allowed.

          8. Subjects are willing to sign the informed consent and agree to comply with the study
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Those who have been treated with &gt; 8 weeks (collectively if not continuously) of
             neoadjuvant ADT prior to screening.

          2. Subjects who have other cancer that is deemed not cured or are known less than 5 years
             except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin

          3. Other conditions the investigators think may affect subject compliance or safety
