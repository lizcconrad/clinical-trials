  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of an acute session of physical exercise on
      cognitive functioning and humor of traumatic brain injury patients and to investigate whether
      different cognitive responses can be achieved with different intensities of exercise
      (moderate and vigorous).

      The investigators hypothesize that while moderate intensity physical exercise may be
      beneficial to cognitive functioning, vigorous intensity may be detrimental to TBI patients,
      as physical fatigue may impair alertness and other higher cognitive functions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known the benefits of physical exercise to cognitive functioning, which have been
      demonstrated in animal studies and in those with healthy humans or with individuals with some
      type of pathology. Nevertheless, there are few studies investigating the effects of acute
      physical exercise on cognitive functions of people with traumatic brain injury, even though
      they frequently have impairments in several cognitive domains due to their brain damage.

      The effect of two intensities of physical exercise (moderate and exhaustive) in attention,
      processing speed, memory, executive control and decision making will be investigated in
      patients with TBI. For that matter, their performance will be compared to non-brain injured
      subjects submitted to the same protocol and to TBI patients submitted to a stretching
      session.

      Each subject will be submitted to a neuropsychological evaluation before and after the
      physical exercise in order to determine if there is an improvement in cognitive performance
      post-exercise.
