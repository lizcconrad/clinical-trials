  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical oedema is seen after open heart surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass and
      hypothermia in children. The oedema formation is due to increased fluid transport from blood
      to tissue. This transcapillary fluid transport is dependent on differences in interstitial
      and plasma colloid osmotic pressure. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate changes
      in interstitial colloid osmotic pressure before, under and after the use of cardiopulmonary
      bypass in children. The study hypothesis is that oedema developed during cardiopulmonary
      bypass and hypothermia is caused by increased micro vascular protein leakage and reduced
      colloid osmotic pressure gradient through the capillary membrane.
