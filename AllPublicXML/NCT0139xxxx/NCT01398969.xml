  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the outcome of patients with recurrent CDI treated
      with fresh HBT versus frozen-and-thawed HBT in a randomized controlled trial. The specific
      objectives are to evaluate the safety of both types of HBT and to compare the clinical
      response, treatment failure and relapse rate in patients treated with fresh HBT compared to
      those treated with frozen-and-thawed HBT; also to assess the functional health and well-being
      of patients in each arm using a validated tool. The metagenomics will also be conducted from
      the stool samples collected from select patients from each arm: pre and post treatment and
      the matching donors. The metagenomics data will be used to determine the bacteria which may
      have contributed to the cure of CDI.
