  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data suggests that women taking drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have higher
      amounts of drugs in their body compared with men taking the same dose of anti-HIV drugs. The
      reason for this higher drug exposure has not yet been determined. The primary purpose of this
      study is to examine whether a pharmacokinetics (factors that determine the amount of drug in
      the body) of anti-HIV drugs change during different phases of the menstrual cycle in women
      and ultimately result in higher amounts of drug in the body compared with men. In other
      words, we plan to examine whether changes in sex hormones throughout the menstrual cycle
      affect the amount of anti-HIV drugs in HIV infected women. The antiretroviral drugs
      atazanavir, ritonavir, tenofovir and emtricitabine will be studied.
