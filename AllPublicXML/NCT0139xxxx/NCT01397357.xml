      The purpose of this study is to evaluate CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE UTILITIES IN THE ISCHEMIC
      HEART DISEASE as topographical correlation between ischemic territory injury and coronary
      angiography.

      Assessing the accuracy of Cardio-RM identifying ischemic territories and their correspondence
      to the presence of critical coronary lesions, comparing the presence, extent and regional
      inducible ischaemia in the Cardiac-MRI with the presence and characteristics of vascular
      lesions in coronary angiography.

      In particular, the study aims to evaluate the correlation between topography and function of
      the ischemic area revealed by the resonance and coronary artery disease documented coronary
      angiography.
