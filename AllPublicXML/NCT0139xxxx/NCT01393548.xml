      This is a multicenter clinical trial, phase III, non-inferiority, controlled by active
      medicine, open, randomized, enroll 538 children, 2 to 12 years old, with acute inflammation
      upper airway, characterized by nasal congestion and runny nose, lasting at least 24 hours and

      This study evaluate the efficacy and safety of experimental drug The study was designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of fixed combinations Decongex® Plus Syrup and Decongex®
      Plus Oral Solution (consisting of brompheniramine maleate and phenylephrine hydrochloride)
      compared to Resfenol® Oral Solution (paracetamol, maleate chlorpheniramine and phenylephrine
      hydrochloride) in the treatment of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea present in acute attacks
      of viral rhinitis (common cold) and allergic. This study population will consist in
      participants of both sexes, aged between 6 to 11 years old with acute inflammatory condition
      of the upper airways, defined as nasal congestion and runny nose, with no less than 24
      (twenty four) hours and a maximum of 48 (forty-eight) hours prior to inclusion.
