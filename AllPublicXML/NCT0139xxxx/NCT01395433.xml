    <textblock>
      This is a bioequivalence study, which is a regulatory requirement to ensure comparable in
      vivo performance, i.e. similarities in terms of safety and efficacy, after administration of
      two different dosage forms of escitalopram.

      All subjects will receive three separate dosages of 20 mg escitalopram, which are 2 x 10 mg
      of the conventional dosage form (Treatment A) and 2 x 10 mg of the new dosage form being
      tested (Treatment B) and 1 x 20 mg of the new dosage form being tested (Treatment C). Test
      treatments B and C will each be compared to Treatment A, which is the active comparator
      (reference formulation).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 19 kg/m2 and 29 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  The subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, generally healthy based on
             assessment of medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram
             (ECG), and the results of the haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, serology,
             and other laboratory tests

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has taken disallowed medication within 1 week prior to the first dose of
             investigational medicinal product (IMP), or within 5 half-lives prior to inclusion for
             any medication ingested, whichever is longer

          -  The subject has a significant history of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  The subject has taken any investigational products within 3 months prior to the first
             dose of IMP

          -  The subject has a history of or presence of any clinically significant immunological,
             cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             endocrinological, haematological, dermatological, venereal, neurological, or
             psychiatric disease or other major disorder

          -  The subject has a history of cancer, other than basal cell or Stage 1 squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, which has not been in remission for at least 5 years prior to
             the first dose of IMP

          -  The subject has a history of abdominal surgery (excluding laparoscopic cholecystectomy
             or uncomplicated appendectomy) or thoracic or nonperipheral vascular surgery within 6
             months prior to the first dose of IMP

          -  The subject has any concurrent illness that may affect the particular target or
             metabolism of the IMP

          -  The subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to comply with the
             clinical study protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason

        Other inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.
