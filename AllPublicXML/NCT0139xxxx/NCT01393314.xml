  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of telemonitoring vs usual care provided by home care
      agencies for atients with HF.

      The study hypothesis is that Telemonitoring will reduce hospital re-admission rates, urgent
      care visits, unscheduled physician appointments, ER visits in patients with heart failure
      over the 60 day post hospitalization period.
