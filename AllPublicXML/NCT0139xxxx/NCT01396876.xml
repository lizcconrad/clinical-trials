    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that the participation of therapeutic clowns in the pediatric
      emergency department procedure room would reduce anxiety, improve the level of cooperation
      children can provide and avoid some of the adverse effects.

    <textblock>
      Research has demonstrated that cognitive psychological techniques, including distraction, can
      increase pain tolerance. Humor can be an important intervention, able to reduce stress to
      both the child and the parent. In the last decade there has been a rapid growth in the
      presence of therapeutic clowns in hospital, particularly in pediatric settings. If
      therapeutic clowns are shown to positively affect any of the parameters being measured in
      this study, they should be included as aprt of the standard of care in the pediatric
      emergency setting.
