  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have advanced or multiple chronic illnesses present management difficulties for
      primary care providers. Acute medical issues and limited time for patient evaluation can
      complicate complete assessment of physical symptoms that directly impact a patient's quality
      of life. The Cook County Health and Hospitals System (CCHHS) established an Advanced Illness
      Management Clinic to provide care for complex patients. Patient entry into the Advanced
      Illness Management Clinic is by referral only, a passive process. After discharge, general
      medicine clinic patients who do not have a medical provider are given an appointment in the
      clinic. Since the hospital is the source of many patients, this guarantees that these
      patients will have at least one illness advanced enough to require hospitalization, and most
      will have additional chronic illnesses. An outpatient palliative care clinic located in a
      specialty clinic setting was initiated in 2004. The goal of the clinic was to extend the
      benefits realized by hospital patients, for whom palliative care consultation has been
      available for many years, to patients cared for in the outpatient setting. The benefits
      provided include physical symptom management, spiritual counseling, and support for social
      issues. Until recently, this outpatient palliative care model has mainly served patients with
      malignancy. With the addition of the Advanced Illness Management Clinic, palliative care
      clinicians now can provide care to patients with other chronic and serious illness in the
      primary care setting.

      Hypothesis: Complex patients will have improved quality of life and a reduced symptom burden
      if seen by a multidisciplinary clinic post-hospitalization, compared to usual care in a
      general medicine clinic.
