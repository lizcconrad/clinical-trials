  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by the progressive increase in
      pulmonary vascular resistance leading to shortness of breath and exercise intolerance.
      Exercise capacity has been used as the primary endpoint in most recent randomized controlled
      trials evaluating PAH-specific therapies as it correlates with functional class and survival
      in PAH. Exercise test is commonly assessed by the six-minute walk test (6MWT). However, there
      is commonly some discrepancy between significant clinical improvement and minor changes
      (generally &lt;10% from baseline) in 6WMT following therapy. Because important clinical
      decisions are based on patients' functional capacity, a reproducible and sensitive exercise
      test is needed in PAH. The aim of this study was to compare the reproducibility and the
      responsiveness of the 6MWT, the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) and the cycle endurance
      test (CET) following pharmacological therapy in this disease.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the reproducibility and the responsiveness of the 6MWT, the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) and the cycle endurance test (CET) following pharmacological therapy in PAH.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>After completing the 6MWT, the ESWT and the CET in a randomized order, patients will then be randomized to sildenafil (20mg tid) or placebo in a double-blind manner for 28 days. The three exercise tests will then be repeated. After a four-week of wash-out period, patients will repeat the three exercise test and then be crossed over to the alternate therapy for the next 28 days. The same experiments will be repeated after this period. The reproducibility of each exercise test will be assessed following placebo. The responsiveness of each exercise test will be assessed following sildenafil.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of a combination therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Sildenafil will be added to the baseline therapy for one month (20mg tid). The efficacy of this combined therapy will be assessed by three different exercise tests and by a quality of life questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To measure the physiological parameters induced by five different exercise tests in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Within one week, PAH patients will performed five different exercise tests. During each test, a portable telemetric system (Oxycon, Jaegger, Germany) will be used to assess the respiratory cardiovascular adaptations. Symptoms of leg fatigue and dyspnea will be assessed using the Borg scale. Quadriceps fatigability will be assessed by volitional and non-volitional (twitch force, TWq) measurements of the quadriceps strength before and immediately after each test (Magstim Co. Ltd., Whitland, Dyfed, Wales, UK).</description>
