  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this intervention is to determine whether computer-based telephone counseling
      will improve adherence to strength training in a population of elders with knee
      osteoarthritis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Average adherence over the 24 month follow-up period.</time_frame>
    <description>In the literature, adherence is assessed on a continuum as the number of sessions of exercises reported divided by prescribed. This does not provide information on how consistent a participant was in doing exercise and consistency of strength training is critical to its effectiveness. We developed a measure of adherence that reflects consistency, choosing a threshold of a minimum of 1 time per week for 80% of the weeks. An 80% threshold permits vacations/illness/life events that may limit exercise opportunities. We will also measure adherence by exercise sessions performed/sessions prescribed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Instruments</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in self-report pain and function from baseline to the 24 month interval.</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario/McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), National Institutes of Health, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (NIH PROMIS) for physical function, and the Osteoarthritis computer adaptive test methodology (OA-CAT) instrument will be assessed at baseline, post the 1-month exercise class, at the 12 and 24 month follow-up clinic visits and by telephone at 6 and 18 months. We will examine the association of adherence, as a dichotomous and continuous variable, to change in pain and function on these instruments.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quadriceps strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in quadriceps strength from baseline to 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Isokinetic quadriceps strength will be assessed with a Biodex at baseline, post the 1-month exercise class and at the 12 and 24 month follow-up clinic visits. The association of adherence as a dichotomous and continuous variable to change in quadriceps strength will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Physical Function tasks</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in timed physical function task over 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Timed physical function tasks will include a timed get up and go, timed stair ascent and descent, and a 5 and 10 chair stand time. We will examine the association of adherence, as a dichotomous and continuous variable, to change in timed physical function using logistic and linear regression, respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise quality</measure>
    <time_frame>Average measure of exercise quality over 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome will be assessed at the end of the 24 month follow-up period as the number of calendar periods (1 month per calendar period) that the participant exercises at least half the number of prescribed sessions (a minimum of 6 out of 12 over a 4 week period) with the agreed upon level of intensity.</description>
