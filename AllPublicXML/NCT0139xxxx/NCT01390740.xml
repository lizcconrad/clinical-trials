    <textblock>
      Study of the prevalence of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (AAA) (&gt; 3 cm) in patients with
      echocardiography (transthoracic or) during a specific day, with cardiologists in France.

      This is a cross-sectional epidemiological investigation, assembling evidence from a routine
      ultrasound screening for AAA at the waning of echocardiograms performed during a specific
      day.

      The study will be offered a list of centers selected by the Scientific Committee in the
      complete list of locations being in France, the subsidiary of echocardiography
      Echocardiography of French Society of Cardiology. These centers will be 500 in number
      representative of the French centers, geographically and by type of centers.

    <textblock>
      Multicenter observational study collecting data from a routine ultrasound screening for AAA
      at the waning of echocardiograms performed during a specific day. All of the cardiologists
      practicing echocardiography are invited to participate in this study, each cardiologist
      should include echocardiography in 10 patients examined for any reason and will be considered
      referring cardiologist.

      There will be no follow-up, the idea is to have a database with measures of abdominal aortic
      aneurysms and therefore.
