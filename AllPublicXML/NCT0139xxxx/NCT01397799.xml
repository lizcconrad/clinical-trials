      This Phase 1b study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of KX2-391 given as a
      once-daily dose, in elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      KX2-391 has been evaluated in a Phase 1 dose escalation study in patients with solid tumors
      using twice-daily dosing. This study will employ the Storer's two-stage design to determine
      the maximum tolerated dose of KX2-391 mono-therapy,given as a once-daily oral dose,in elderly
      patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who are refractory to or have declined
      standard induction therapy. The safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of
      KX2-391 will be evaluated.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of KX2-391 will be evaluated in AML patients by measuring serum and bone marrow levels of drug and evaluating the disruption of microtubule networks in these samples to determine whether target inhibition has occurred at the doses tested. Hematological and bone marrow response will be assessed according to International Working Group (IWG)-AML criteria.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent.

          -  Either de novo or secondary AML by 2008 World Health Organization (WHO)
             classification.

          -  A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate sample must be obtained between Day -14 to Day -1,
             and this sample must be confirmed to be adequate for morphologic analysis of marrow
             cellularity and blast percentage before the first dose of KX2-391 is administered.

          -  A bone aspirate sample (with or without biopsy) must be obtained after the patient
             signs the informed consent document and be submitted for baseline pharmacodynamic
             assessment. Although this will usually be obtained as part of the baseline assessment
             marrow biopsy and aspirate procedure described above, if a complete marrow evaluation
             was performed prior to the patient signing informed consent, a dedicated bone marrow
             aspiration for this sample can be performed after the patient signs informed consent,
             so long as the pre-consent biopsy and aspirate procedure were done within 14 days of
             the first dose of KX2-391.

          -  Adults age ≥ 60 years of age

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 weeks from first day of study drug administration

          -  Adequate liver function (AST/ALT &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), Alk Phos &lt; 2.5 x
             ULN, and Direct Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN)

          -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN)

          -  Documented QTc ≤ 0.48 seconds within 14 days of first dose of KX2-391

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, AML FAB type M3), or chronic
             myelogenous leukemia (CML).

          -  Have not resolved toxicity from previous anticancer treatments or investigational
             agents, other than hematologic toxicities or alopecia, to ≤ Grade 1 according to the
             most recent CTCAE guidelines.

          -  Subjects with rapidly proliferative AML that is likely to require treatment within the
             next 30 days (e.g. hydroxyurea).

          -  Received an investigational agent within 5 half-lives of that agent from the
             anticipated Cycle 1 Day 1 of treatment with KX2-391.

          -  Have clinical evidence of central nervous system involvement by AML or other
             malignancy.

          -  History of major surgery to the upper gastrointestinal tract, or have a history of
             inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption syndrome, or other medical condition that
             may interfere with oral drug absorption.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (at time of dosing).

          -  Other medical conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, make it
             undesirable for the subject to participate in the study.

          -  Known history of hepatitis B, C, or human immunodeficiency (HIV) infection.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection. Patients receiving intravenous antibiotics for infections that are under
             control may be included in this study.

          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

          -  Subjects who are taking moderate or strong CYP450 3A4 modulators, with the exception
             of fluconazole (see Appendix 2 for list of medications currently known to be moderate
             or strong CYP450 3A4 modulators). Subjects who can safely discontinue these
             medications can become eligible for this trial.

          -  Subjects receiving azole-based antifungal prophylaxis other than fluconazole (see
             Appendix 2) who are unable to switch their prophylaxis to fluconazole, or discontinue
             antifungal prophylaxis, for 7 days prior to first day of study drug administration.

          -  Active cancer, other than AML, requiring systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy
             within 6 months of study entry. Patients who have received only hormonal therapy in
             the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting in the past 6 months may participate in this
             study.

          -  Symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or cardiac arrhythmia.

          -  Other conditions that could jeopardize the subject's ability to comply with the
             protocol, including, but not limited to, dementia, psychosis, or other major
             psychiatric disorder

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding
