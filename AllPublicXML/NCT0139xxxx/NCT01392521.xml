  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PI3K (phosphoinositol 3-Kinase) inhibitor Copanlisib and the MEK (mitogen-activated
      protein kinase) inhibitor Refametinib (BAY86-9766)have both been tested as single agent
      treatments in other phase I studies. This study will test the combination of these two drugs
      to try and answer the following questions:

        1. What are the side effects of the combination of Copanlisib and Refametinib
           (BAY86-9766)when given together at different/increasing dose levels?

        2. What dose level of Copanlisib and Refametinib (BAY86-9766) should be tested in future
           clinical research studies?

        3. How much Copanlisib is in the blood at specific times after administration and does
           adding Refametinib (BAY86-9766) have an affect?

        4. How much Refametinib (BAY86-9766) is in the blood at specific times after administration
           and does adding Copanlisib have an affect?

        5. Does the combination of Refametinib (BAY86-9766) and Copanlisib have an effect on
           tumors?
