  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to recruit patients who have experienced a recent first episode of
      psychosis who have a chart diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Schizophrenifom, Schizoaffective
      Disorder, Psychosis NOS, or Bipolar I Disorder with psychotic features and self identify
      themselves as a current cigarette smoker. Aiding this population with smoking cessation is
      crucial as the majority of people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (50-90%) smoke, which
      is leading to early mortality. While these individuals can benefit from standard
      evidence-based treatment, these treatments are underutilized. Web based programs, such as the
      EDSS and thetruth.com, can provide education and motivational tools to help people with a
      recent onset of psychosis use evidence-based smoking cessation treatments. This study aims to
      test these two web-based programs among young people with a recent episode of psychosis for
      usability and likeability and to explore whether use of these two programs will motivate
      users to seek smoking cessation treatment or to engage in other quitting behaviors in the
      month following use of the programs. Information gathered from this proposal will be used to
      help the researchers decide whether either of these two programs will be reasonable to
      include in a larger study of a comprehensive treatment for individuals with first episode
      psychosis.

    <description>The Electronic Decision Support System (EDSS) is a 5-module computer program aimed to assess, motivate, educate, solicit preferences, and provide feedback and referrals for people with severe mental illness. The program provides: a) a personalized assessment of the individual's smoking, b) information to improve knowledge of smoking risks and treatment benefits, c) interactive exercises to personalize the impact of smoking, improve attitudes about quitting, and increase self-efficacy for seeking smoking cessation treatment, and d) a video patient vignette to develop social norms for smoking cessation treatment and increase self-efficacy. Usability testing among people with severe mental illness established that the system was comprehensible, easy to use, and took 30-90 minutes to complete.</description>

    <description>Participants who are assigned to use the web-based thetruth.com website will be asked to navigate through the website as they wish. The home page of thetruth.com site has links to access video games, fact sheets, and videos that highlight negative aspects of cigarettes or tobacco companies. Thetruth.com website is not structured and participants can utilize whatever aspects of the website they wish and in any order they wish to view them.
Individuals will use the computer with a research staff member present who can provide assistance if needed. The sections of the two programs website that are used and the time spend on each portion of the program will be recorded. Participants who use TheTruth.com will be given a referral for assistance in quitting smoking if requested.</description>
