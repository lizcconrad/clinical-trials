      The purpose of the study is to learn more about how phosphorus-based food additives affect
      phosphorus metabolism in people with normal kidney function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phosphorus is a mineral that is found in foods such as dairy products, nuts, and meat, and is
      important for strengthening the bones. However, too much phosphorus in the blood may be bad
      for the health of your heart and blood vessels. The kidneys keep the blood levels of
      phosphorus normal by getting rid of extra phosphorus in the urine. New research has found
      that common forms of food additives that are high in phosphorus may increase blood phosphorus
      levels in individuals with kidney disease. In addition, these food additives may increase
      blood levels of hormones that control phosphorus such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and
      fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). Like high blood phosphorus levels, high levels of PTH
      and FGF23 in the blood may also be bad for the health of your heart and blood vessels. In
      this study, the investigators would like to examine the effects of food additives on blood
      levels of phosphorus, PTH and FGF23 in individuals with normal kidney function.

    <description>Participants will be provided specially prepared meals to eat at home for two weeks. During the first week, participants will eat foods that do not have any phosphorus-based food additives in them (this is called the control diet). During the second week, participants will eat foods that all have phosphorus-based food additives in them (called the intervention diet).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers, 19 - 45 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  abnormal urinalysis—presence of hematuria, proteinuria, or leukocyturia.

          -  pregnancy or breast-feeding

          -  Medical conditions impacting phosphate metabolism—primary hyperparathyroidism;
             gastrointestinal malabsorption disorders such as Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis,
             celiac disease, or liver dysfunction; hyper- or hypothyroidism; irregular menses for
             female subjects.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30 g/m2 since obesity is independently associated with
             impaired phosphorus metabolism.

          -  Medications known to affect phosphorus metabolism— current use of phosphorus
             supplements, high-dose or activated vitamin D compounds, regular antacid or laxative
             use, anticonvulsants.

          -  Hyper- or hypophosphatemia (≥ 4.6 mg/dl or ≤ 2.5 mg/dl respectively), hyper- or
             hypocalcemia (≥ 10.6 or ≤ 8.5 mg/dl respectively), or severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 8
             g/dl for women and &lt; 9 g/dl for men).
