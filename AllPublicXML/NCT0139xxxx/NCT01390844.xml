  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy of boceprevir (BOC) in combination with PegIntron
      (pegylated interferon alfa-2b) (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV) in response guided therapy compared
      to the efficacy of standard-of-care therapy alone in adult subjects with chronic hepatitis C
      (CHC) genotype 1 who failed prior treatment with pegylated interferon and RBV in the Asia
      Pacific population. The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of participants achieving
      sustained virologic response in the experimental therapy regimen (BOC/PEG+RBV) is superior to
      that in the control arm (Placebo/PEG+RBV), in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population.

    <description>SVR is defined as undetectable plasma HCV-RNA at Follow-up Week (FW) 24. If FW24 is missing and other HCV-RNA values after FW24 are available, the last available value would be used for FW24. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing values; if a participant is missing at and after FW24 and has FW12 data, then FW12 data will be carried forward to FW24. Cross-over participants are considered as non-responders in SVR.</description>

    <description>Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin concentration is insufficient to meet the body's physiologic needs. This measure gives the percentage of participants who experienced an occurrence of modified World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1-4 anemia during the treatment period. A higher grade indicates a higher degree of anemia. This table summarizes the worst category observed within the period per participant per laboratory test (i.e., the lowest value for the hemotologic parameters).</description>

        <description>SVR is defined as undetectable plasma HCV-RNA at FW24. If FW24 is missing and other HCV-RNA values after FW24 are available, the last available value would be used for FW24. The LOCF method was used to impute missing values; if a participant is missing at and after FW24 and has FW12 data, then FW12 data will be carried forward to FW24. Cross-over participants are considered as non-responders in SVR.</description>

        <description>Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin concentration is insufficient to meet the body's physiologic needs. This measure gives the percentage of participants who experienced an occurrence of modified World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1-4 anemia during the treatment period. A higher grade indicates a higher degree of anemia. This table summarizes the worst category observed within the period per participant per laboratory test (i.e., the lowest value for the hemotologic parameters).</description>

          <description>Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or hemoglobin concentration is insufficient to meet the body's physiologic needs. This measure gives the percentage of participants who experienced an occurrence of modified World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1-4 anemia during the treatment period. A higher grade indicates a higher degree of anemia. This table summarizes the worst category observed within the period per participant per laboratory test (i.e., the lowest value for the hemotologic parameters).</description>
