  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial was to determine the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in the
      prevention of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in sensitized recipients of a living donor
      kidney transplant requiring desensitization therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eculizumab to
      prevent AMR in sensitized recipients of living donor kidney transplants requiring
      desensitization therapy prior to transplantation. The primary endpoint focused on acute AMR
      during the first 9 weeks post-transplantation.

      Patients were to be vaccinated against N. meningitidis at least 14 days prior to study drug
      initiation and revaccinated 30 days later. If not vaccinated 14 days prior, prophylactic
      antibiotics were to be administered. Pre-transplant infectious disease assessment was to be
      performed as part of the screening assessment.

      Patients were to undergo desensitization therapy according to the practice of the local
      transplant center prior to transplantation, and this desensitization practice was to be
      uniformly applied for all patients at that center throughout the study. The actual length of
      desensitization for an individual patient was based on the clinical judgment of the
      Transplant Center team. Rituximab was prohibited in all patients as part of the
      pre-transplantation desensitization therapy due to potential pharmacodynamic interactions.

      The control group was designed to test eculizumab against the best available care (referred
      to as standard of care, or SOC) consisting of plasmapheresis (PP) and/or intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IVIg). The best available care consisting of PP and IVIg was chosen because
      these modalities combined represented the most prevalent therapy reported in the literature
      and were the best available therapies at the time of this protocol's inception as per the
      transplant community.

    <description>The primary efficacy variable was a binary outcome variable where patients meeting the composite endpoint of the occurrence of 1) biopsy-proven acute AMR, 2) graft loss, 3) patient death, or 4) loss to follow-up definition at Week 9 post-transplantation were considered treatment failures and all others were considered treatment successes.</description>

    <description>Patients were to receive eculizumab 1200 mg prior to allograft transplantation (Day 0, starting approximately one hour prior to kidney allograft reperfusion), eculizumab 900 mg (Days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28), and eculizumab 1200 mg (Weeks 5, 7 and 9). All doses of eculizumab were administered intravenously: the median infusion time was 39 minutes.</description>

    <description>Patients received standard of care (SOC) prophylactic therapy for acute AMR according to the SOC choice at each participating investigative site, which could have included any combination of plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Patients randomized to SOC who were diagnosed with AMR could have received eculizumab for the treatment of AMR after initially receiving PP and/or IVIg.</description>
