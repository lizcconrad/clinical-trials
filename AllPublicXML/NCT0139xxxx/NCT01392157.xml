  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main side-effect of Implanon is the changes induces in bleeding patterns including
      amenorrhea, infrequent to irregular bleeding and frequent and prolonged bleeding; without any
      previous symptom and it was characterized as &quot;breakthrough bleeding&quot; (BTB). BTB is the main
      causes of early discontinuations. Unfortunately, there is no indication to predict prior to
      insertion what sort of bleeding pattern any individual woman may have after insertion and the
      proposed treatments were disappointed. Nevertheless, previous studies with other
      progestin-only contraceptives (including Implanon) provide evidence that the provision of
      adequate and intensive counseling to potential users and new acceptors about bleeding changes
      can help to improve method continuation.

      The availability of Implanon in the public sector could help in the development of strategies
      to introduce the method in the public sector network and the training of medical residents.

      100 women were either allocated to received Implanon contraceptive implant, the LNG-IUS or
      TCu380A copper-IUD. The women were allocated according to their preference on each of the
      contraceptive methods.

      half of the women will receive the common counseling at the clinic and the other 50% will
      receive intense counselling about menstrual changes induced by these three contraceptive
      methods. The continuation rate up to one year will be evaluated through life-table analysis
