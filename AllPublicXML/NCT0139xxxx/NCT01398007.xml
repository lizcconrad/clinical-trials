  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental fear and anxiety in children constitue a crucial challenge to dental care delivery as
      well as future behavior related to dental problems in children. A common cause of such
      anxiety and fear is the procedural intervention that uses needles and syringes since a visual
      impact due to the needle acts as a deterrent to the child's cooperation during dental
      procedures. We therefore improvised the syringe such that it will camouflage the needle. We
      hypothesized that the use of this needle will alleviate the child's anxiety and therefore
      will demonstrate improved outcomes related to pain, fear and anxiety. This study is a group
      randomized trial to test the efficacy of the camouflage syringe as compared to the
      conventional syringe in children.

      The present study was conducted with an aim to evaluate the efficacy of a needle-covering
      camouflage syringe as compared to the conventional syringe in reducing dental anxiety and
      fear in children. The study was carried out in 100 children who consecutively reported to the
      study center and were allocated to the camouflage syringe arm or conventional syringe arm
      using block randomization to ensure equal distribution across trial arms. The study assessed
      the degree of dental anxiety and fear using Venham's clinical rating scale in conjunction
      with rating scale for movement, crying and overall behavior and Venham's Picture Test. The
      study also assessed parental emotional stress status when the child underwent the injection
      procedure and the reaction of the child after going home by Parental Emotional Stress
      Questionnaire and Recall Questionnaire, respectively. The study used appropriate statistical
      methods to determine the efficacy of the camouflage syringe in reducing the anxiety and fear.

    <description>The camouflage syringe is divided into three parts: head, body and tail. Head consists of bristles to apply topical anesthesia. The body holds the normally used conventional syringe and presents with a slot to check the aspiration results. The tail hides the conventional syringe loaded with the local anesthetic solution. This syringe is made up of cold-cure acrylic with a colorful toy-like look.</description>
