    <textblock>
      Constipation is a common problem in palliative cancer patients. However, there were
      insufficient randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to identify the &quot;best&quot; laxative or
      combination of laxatives in these patients.

      Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in holistic approach is popular among cancer patients.
      More than half had received at least one form of TCM therapy according to the survey carried
      in 2008. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in compound formulation with nourishing and purging
      effects simultaneously may be more preferred to relieve constipation by local palliative
      cancer patients.

      TCM syndrome differentiated by collecting all symptoms and signs through the classic four
      diagnostic methods is the foundation for making diagnosis and prescription in TCM practice.

      The present study is the first local study to evaluate the bowel habits and TCM syndrome of
      advanced cancer patients with constipation. We hope that the results not only can shed light
      on patient's own reporting or experience of constipation and the effectiveness of current
      practice, but also can draw up a CHM formulation for advanced cancer patients with
      constipation.
