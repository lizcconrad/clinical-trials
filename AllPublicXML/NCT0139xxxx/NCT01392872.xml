  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis is the first cause of neurological handicap in France. The importance of
      cognitive disabilities, their evaluation and their impact on patients' life have only been
      comprehended recently. Immunosuppressants represent new treatments in Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
      but imply a lot of constraints. This study will evaluate the impact of these treatments on
      cognitive disabilities, tiredness state, emotion and quality of life in general, on a
      lengthened period.
