  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use data from the Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) to
      determine the degree of variation in glucose levels of individuals with an eating disorder
      and type 1 diabetes and only an eating disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the proposed research are to:

      2.1 Determine the degree of variation in glycemic profiles of individuals with an Eating
      Disorder and Type 1 Diabetes (ED-DMT1) and an Eating Disorder only (ED/only); and

      2.2 Determine the impact of nutritional intake and planned physical activity on glucose
      profiles of individuals with ED-DMT1 and ED/only.

      These aims will be examined by characterizing:

        -  glucose exposure, as measured by area under the Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP) median
           curve;

        -  glucose variability, as measured by the AGP inter-quartile range; and

        -  glucose stability, as measured by change in the AGP median curve.

          -  Diagnosed with an eating disorder (Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa or Eating
             Disorder Not Otherwise Specified)

               1. For ED-DMT1 group: Diagnosis of an eating disorder AND diagnosis of type 1
                  diabetes.

               2. For ED/only group: Diagnosis of an eating disorder AND no history/diagnosis of
                  type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

          -  Female.

          -  At least 14 years of age.

               1. If the potential participant's age is at least 18 years she must be able to
                  provide informed consent.

               2. If the potential participant is less than 18 years she must have a parent or
                  guardian able and willing to provide written informed consent on the
                  participant's behalf. In addition, the participant must be willing to sign a
                  consent on her own behalf.

          -  Participants must be able and willing to utilize the CGM system and perform required
             calibrations using self-monitored blood glucose.

          -  Male.

          -  Age &lt; 14 years.

          -  History of self-injurious behavior that the senior clinician feels precludes
             participation.

          -  Unwilling to follow the study protocol.

          -  Participation in any competing research study.

          -  Planned ISL admission for &lt;4 days.

          -  Pregnant.
