  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of eliminating traditional resident work
      shifts (i.e. greater than 24 hours in length) on patient safety and resident educational
      outcomes. In addition, the investigators will explore with key stakeholders (patients and
      their families, nurses, resident physicians and attending physicians) their experiences when
      residents are undertaking shifts greater than 24 hours in length as compared to 16 hours or
      less.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Preventable adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Occurring during course of ICU admission and within first 72 hours of ICU discharge if event is attributable to process of care in the ICU</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the rate of preventable adverse events per 1000 patient days. An adverse event will be defined as any unplanned injury arising as a consequence of medical care that is associated with morbidity, requires treatment, prolongs hospital stay, or results in disability at discharge. Adverse events are not caused by the disease process itself, but do include any procedural or therapeutic complications. Preventable adverse events will be defined as those adverse events that could have been avoided given current knowledge and standards of care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Professionalism</measure>
    <time_frame>End of each 28 day rotation</time_frame>
    <description>In order to further explore this qualitative outcome measure, during structured interviews of residents, attending physicians, nurses and patients and their families, specific questions will be used to probe the perceived level of resident professionalism. For example, degree of commitment and professional investment in individual patients, and degree of commitment to the profession of medicine.</description>

    <measure>Nursing impact</measure>
    <time_frame>Over course of study (12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to further explore this qualitative outcome measure, during focus groups with nurses specific questions will be used to probe the perceived level of impact on nursing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attending physician workload</measure>
    <time_frame>Over course of study (12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to further explore this qualitative outcome measure, during structured interviews of attending physicians specific questions will be used to probe the perceived level of physician workload. For example, the difference in level of direct involvement in patient care activities (writing notes, performing procedures, etc) between the two schedules.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived continuity of care</measure>
    <time_frame>Over course of study (12 months)</time_frame>

    <time_frame>End of each 28 day rotation</time_frame>
    <description>In order to further explore this qualitative outcome measure, during structured interviews of residents specific questions will be used to probe the perceived level of quality of life for the different call schedules.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Within two weeks of ICU discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Given the multitude of potential variables that impact patient satisfaction, during the interviews of patients and their families, the following questions will be used to inform the outcome measure: a global assessment of the patient's experience, their satisfaction with the overall care provided by the healthcare team and their satisfaction with their experiences with resident physicians in particular.</description>
