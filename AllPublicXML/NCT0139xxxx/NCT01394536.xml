  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting after outpatient surgery are significant sources of patient
      dissatisfaction. The prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) should be equally
      as important as prevention of pain because both are large sources of patient dissatisfaction
      and can necessitate admission after routine outpatient procedures.

      None of the currently available pharmacological interventions are able to totally abolish
      PONV. The use of electroacustimulation is a useful adjunct in prevention of PONV, but has yet
      to be studied when the patient takes the device home with them after leaving an outpatient
      facility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to perform a pilot study to determine if sending patients home
      with the electroacustimulation device will decrease their PONV and subsequently increase
      their overall satisfaction.

      The primary outcome will be post-operative nausea and vomiting scores on a scale of 1-10
      based on surveys which will be performed at 30m, 60m, 120m, and 24h post-op.

      Secondary outcomes will be the amount of rescue nausea medications required by the patients,
      time to discharge, subjective pain assessment and the impact of their symptoms on the
      activities of daily living since being discharged from the surgery center based on survey,
      and amount of narcotic received.

      This project would also aim to reduce the amount of time patients spend in recovery
      post-operatively, reduce hospital admissions secondary to persistent nausea and vomiting, and
      educate students and trainees about alternative methods of treating and preventing
      postoperative nausea and vomiting.

    <description>In the sham arm, this device will not be turned on. The device to be used is the ReliefBand (Aeromedix, Jackson, Wy), an FDA-approved, reusable, battery-operated electroacustimulation device. The ReilefBand is a portable battery powered (lithium coin cells) device that is worn on the wrist like a watch. Two electrodes contact the skin with the aid of the application of electroconductive gel, and an electrical current of 25 mHz is transmitted through the skin. The device is applied at the Neiguan (P6) point, which is located on the inside of the wrist and is thought, in traditional Chinese medicine, to relieve nausea and vomiting (NV).</description>
