  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in combination with methotrexate versus RoActemra/Actemra
      monotherapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to methotrexate.
      All patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously (iv) every 4 weeks plus
      oral methotrexate for 16 weeks. Patients achieving low disease activity at Week 16 will be
      randomized to receive a further 12 weeks of RoActemra/Actemra treatment plus either
      methotrexate or placebo. Anticipated time on study treatment is 28 weeks.

    <measure>Change in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count (DAS28) From Week 16 to Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16, and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen (range 0-28) and tender (range 0-28) joint counts, acute phase response (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] in millimeters per hour [mm/hr]), and general health status (participant global assessment of disease activity using visual analog scale [VAS], range 1-100 mm). DAS28, which uses a 28-joint count, is derived from the original DAS, which includes a 44-swollen joint count. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With DAS28 Score Less Than (&lt;) 2.6 at Week 28</measure>

DAS28, which uses a 28-joint count, is derived from the original DAS, which includes a 44-swollen joint count. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate worsening. DAS28 &lt;2.6 equals (=) remission.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) &lt;2.8 at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>CDAI is the sum of tender and swollen joint count based on 28 joints and the participant and physician global disease assessment (VAS 0-10 centimeters [cm]). CDAI total score 0-76; higher scores = greater affect due to disease activity. CDAI &lt;2.8 = clinical remission.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) &lt;3.3 at Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SDAI is calculated by a simple numerical sum of tender and swollen joint count (based on a 28-joint assessment), participant and physician global assessment of disease activity (VAS 0-10 cm), and level of C-reactive protein in milligram per deciliter (mg/dL). SDAI total score 0-86; higher scores = greater affect due to disease activity. SDAI &lt;3.3 = clinical remission.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) From Week 16 to Week 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16 and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Quality of Life Questionnaire (Short Form-12 [SF-12]) From Week 16 to Week 28 in Mental Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16 and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life questionnaire (SF-12) scores were computed using the scores of 12 questions and ranged from 0 to 100, where a 0 score indicated the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicated the highest level of health. A negative change from baseline indicated decline in health and higher scores indicated improvement in health.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16 and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life questionnaire (SF-12) scores were computed using the scores of 12 questions and ranged from 0 to 100, where a 0 score indicated the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicated the highest level of health. A negative change from baseline indicated a worsening of quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Change From Week 16 to Week 28 in Global Assessment of Disease Activity as Assessed With the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Performed by Participant</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16 and Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate their global assessment of disease activity on a scale ranging from 0=very good to 100=very bad. The scale was represented by a line with 0 at the left edge and 100 at the right edge. The participant was asked to mark the line corresponding to the assessment of their disease activity. The distance from the left edge was measured in mm.</description>

        <title>Change in Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count (DAS28) From Week 16 to Week 28</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen (range 0-28) and tender (range 0-28) joint counts, acute phase response (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] in millimeters per hour [mm/hr]), and general health status (participant global assessment of disease activity using visual analog scale [VAS], range 1-100 mm). DAS28, which uses a 28-joint count, is derived from the original DAS, which includes a 44-swollen joint count. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>
