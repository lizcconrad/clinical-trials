      This reported observational clinical study aims at identifying epigenetic markers in a sample
      of patients undergoing high dose inpatient psychotherapy suffering from a variety of
      psychiatric/psychosomatic diseases such as somatoform disorders, posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety disorders and eating disorders.

      The exact epigenetic markers that will be traced are yet to define.

      The investigators believe that

        1. Epigenetic patterns found in the group of psychiatric patients show differences from
           healthy controls

        2. Different diagnosis show differences in epigenetic patterns as well

        3. Epigenetic patterns correlate to the severity of the psychosocial disorder as measured
           in interviews or psychometric ratings

        4. Epigenetic patterns can change under inpatient high dose psychotherapy

        5. Changes correlate to clinical psychometric variables.

        The present study includes all patients selected for multi-modal inpatient or day-clinic
        treatment in the department of psychosomatic medicine (as part of the centre of
        psychiatry)of the hannover medical school - given the informed consent of the patients. The
        patients treated in this unit are first seen in primary care and sent to us because of e.g.
        depression, somatization, eating-disorders, panic disorders, PTSD, or other psychiatric
        diseases commonly refered to as &quot;psychosomatic&quot; in Germany. They are subject to at least 2
        diagnostic sessions in which further treamtment options are assessed.

        For about one third of the patients with grave psychiatric disorders, intensive
        &quot;multimodal&quot; psychotherapy in an inpatient or day-clinic setting is recommended.
