  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) has become the dominant strategy for the
      treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as studies have shown that PPCI is
      superior to fibrinolytic therapy. Recent evidence suggests that transradial access (TRA) is
      superior to transfemoral (TFA) for patients undergoing PPCI. Two large trials report a
      mortality benefit favouring TRA. The results of these two trials could significantly impact
      practice guidelines and lead to a recommendation that the approach of choice for primary PCI
      be radial rather than femoral. This would have significant implications for both PCI centers
      and interventionalists associated with a large impact on practice and education. Yet, many
      centers and interventionalists in Canada and in the USA prefer TFA and currently feel
      pressured in making the change to TRA. With that said, these trials did not include new
      pharmacotherapy and new technology that would likely have closed or eliminated the gap
      between TFA and TRA by improving the safety and efficacy of these two approaches.
      Furthermore, these trials were not powered to conclusively show a mortality benefit. The
      authors of the two large trials emphasized the need for further trials to confirm the
      benefits of TRA.

      The SAFARI-STEMI trial aims to compare TFA with TRA in patients undergoing primary
      percutaneous intervention (PPCI). The primary outcome will be defined as all cause mortality
      measured at 30 days. The trial will also evaluate: 1) bleeding events and 2) the composite of
      death, reinfarction, or stroke defined as major adverse clinical events (MACE). The trial
      will include the use of antithrombotic therapy with monotherapy, with either bivalirudin or
      unfractionated heparin; the use of glycoprotein inhibitors IIb/IIIa inhibitors will be
      avoided. The study will encourage liberal use of vascular closing devices. The trial will
      also compare delays to reperfusion between the two strategies. Finally, a cost analysis is
      proposed.

      In view of recent publications, there is now a need for a large randomized trial using
      contemporary adjunct therapies to assess the safety and efficacy of the TRA vs. the TFA in
      PPCI. The proposed trial aims to conclusively show whether there is a survival benefit
      associated with the TRA approach.
