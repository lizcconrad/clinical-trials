  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether contacting the parents of adolescents
      overdue for routine vaccines or contacting both the parents AND adolescents overdue to
      routine vaccines improves immunization rates as compared to usual care.

      This randomized controlled trial is a 3-armed study designed to evaluate an immunization
      recall system in adolescents. In the control arm (Group 1), the adolescents will receive
      usual care, in which they will primarily receive immunizations at annual physical exams, or
      as recommended by providers at urgent care visits. In one intervention arm (Group 2), the
      parent/guardian will receive a telephone call informing them that the adolescent is overdue
      for one or more immunizations (conjugated Neisseria meningitidis (MCV4) vaccine,
      tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) booster, and/or the second varicella (VZV) vaccine). In
      the second intervention arm (Group 3), both the parent/guardian and the adolescent will
      receive a telephone call informing them that the adolescent is overdue for one or more
      immunizations. Immunization rates will be compared between the 3 groups at a four week and a
      twelve month follow up period.

    <description>A telephone call will be made to the parent/guardian informing them that the adolescent has not received one or more vaccines (Td/Tdap in the past 5 years, the MCV4 vaccine, or the 2nd VZV vaccine). The phone call will include a brief informational statement about the vaccine(s) that the adolescent has not yet received. Up to 4 telephone calls will be attempted. As part of the phone call, we will offer to schedule an appointment for the adolescent to receive the missing immunization(s). We will also ask them to mail or fax to the Adolescent/Young Adult Medicine clinic records of immunizations given at other sites.</description>
