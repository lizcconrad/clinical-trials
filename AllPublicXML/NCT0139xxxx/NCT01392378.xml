    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are assess the immunological response (measure the amount of
      antibodies, i.e. proteins that fight off germs) produced by children after they have been
      given the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (13vPnC) and INFANRIX hexa at 2, 3, 4 and 12 months
      of age when medications to prevent fever are given on the same day as the vaccination. Also
      to evaluate the safety of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC) in children who
      receive medications to prevent fever on the day of vaccination.

        <description>Antibody geometric LS mean concentrations (GMCs) for 13 pneumococcal serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F, 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A) are presented. GMC (13vPnC) and corresponding 2-sided 95% CI were evaluated. Geometric means (GMs) were calculated using all participants with available data for the specified blood draw. Here ‘N’ (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure and ‘n’ signifies participants with a determinate IgG concentration to the given serotype for each arm respectively.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Reporting Fever Within 4 Days: Infant Series Dose 3</title>
        <description>Participants' rectal temperature was collected for 4 days after each vaccination using an electronic diary. Participants' temperature was collected at 6 to 8 hours after vaccination, 6 to 8 hours following that and coincidentally with antipyretic administration for groups receiving antipyretics. Temperature was recorded at bedtime daily for 3 following days (Day 2 to Day 4) and at any time during the 3 days when fever was suspected. The highest temperature for each day was recorded in the e-diary. Incidences of fever were presented in following categories: &gt;=38 but &lt;=39 degree C, &gt;39 but &lt;=40 degree C and &gt;40 degree C. Report of fever &gt;40 degrees C after 13vPnC Infant Series Dose 3 was confirmed as data entry error.</description>

        <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received vaccine without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE: an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent events for infant series were events between infant series Dose 1 and up to 1 month (28 to 42 days) after infant series that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Reported non-SAEs included AEs other than SAEs collected using electronic diary (fever, systematic assessment) and events spontaneously collected on case report form at each visit (non-systematic assessment).</description>
