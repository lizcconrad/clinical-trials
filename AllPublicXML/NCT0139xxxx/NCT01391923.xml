        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects &gt; 18 years of age and &lt; 65 years of age.

          2. Subject has clearly visible fat on the underside of the upper arm, generally located
             over the triceps muscle. (Figure 1)

          3. Subject has not had weight change exceeding 10 pounds in the preceding month.

          4. Subject agrees to maintain their weight (i.e., within 5 pounds) by not making any

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has had a surgical procedure(s) in the area of intended treatment.

          2. Subject has had an invasive fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction or mesotherapy)
             in the area of intended treatment.

          3. Subject has had a non-invasive fat reduction and/or body contouring procedure in the
             area of intended treatment within the past 6 months.

          4. Subject needs to administer, or has a known history of, subcutaneous injections into
             the area of intended treatment (e.g., heparin, insulin) within the past month.

          5. Subject has a known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, or paroxysmal cold
             hemoglobinuria.

          6. Subject has a known history of Raynaud's disease, or any known condition with a
             response to cold exposure that limits blood flow to the skin.

          7. Subject has a history of bleeding disorder or is taking any medication that in the

         10. Subject has any dermatological conditions, such as moderate to excessive skin laxity,

             or evaluation.

         11. Subject is pregnant or intending to become pregnant in the next 6 months.

         12. Subject is lactating or has been lactating in the past 6 months.

             investigational drug or device.

         15. Any other condition or laboratory value that would, in the professional opinion of the
             investigator, potentially affect the subject's response or the integrity of the data
             or would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject.
