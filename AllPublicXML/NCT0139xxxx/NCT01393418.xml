      The purpose of the study is to evaluate kidney biomarkers and determine if there is a
      correlation between Erythropoietin (EPO) levels and acute kidney injury after cardiac
      surgery. An early biomarker for kidney injury may be helpful in identifying, monitoring and
      managing patients at risk for kidney failure after cardiac surgery. To evaluate
      Erythropoietin's role as a predictor of poor renal function in the immediate post-bypass
      period we plan to compare EPO levels to Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL).

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication after cardiac surgery and
      cardio-pulmonary bypass. AKI is associated with high mortality.

      Erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, will be evaluated as a potential biomarker
      of kidney injury. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) has been studied as a
      biomarker of kidney injury. Early kidney injury detection has been long sought and NGAL has
      been shown to be a promising biomarker. A troponinlike biomarker of AKI that is easily
      measured and capable of both early detection and risk stratification would represent an
      advancement in our ability to differentiate acute kidney injury from failure.

      Investigating EPO as a biomarker may prove to have increased predictive value in the clinical
      care of cardiac surgery patients.
