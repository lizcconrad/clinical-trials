  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High fiber foods are recommended as a preferential source of carbohydrate by the Nutrition
      Study Group of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. Dietary fibers may delay
      glucose absorption and reduce postprandial glycemic excursion. They also appear to have a
      beneficial effect on cholesterol levels. It has been shown, in few short term adult studies,
      that high fiber foods reduce postprandial blood glucose levels. The American Diabetes
      Association feels that there is little evidence confirming the positive effect of high fiber
      foods on blood glucose control. It is not clear whether a high fiber diet can improve
      glycemic control and/or reduce the risk of hypoglycemic events. Our hypothesis is that
      children with type 1 diabetes will benefit from having added fibers in their diet. The
      investigators plan to study blood glucose values using a continuous blood glucose monitor
      before and after dietary fibers are introduced. This will help us determine whether a diet
      rich in fiber should be recommended in all children with type 1 diabetes mellitus
