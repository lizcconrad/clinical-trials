      The aim of the study is to assess and compare efficacy and safety of BI 54903 at 3 doses
      twice daily (b.i.d.), fluticasone propionate hydrofluoroalkane metered dose inhaler (HFA MDI)
      at a dose of 220 mcg b.i.d. and placebo b.i.d. over an 8-week treatment period in asthmatic
      patients aged 12 to 65 years inadequately controlled on low dose Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
      as demonstrated by a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1 (range 10-25%)
      and an asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-6) greater or equal 1.5 at time of randomisation
