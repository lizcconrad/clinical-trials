  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of hospitalization in premature infants
      worldwide. Severity rates are particularly high in developing countries. Numerous viruses can
      cause severe disease, but the most frequent agent of hospitalization is respiratory syncytial
      virus (RSV). In a recent study in Argentina, 58% of RSV infected VLBW infants required
      hospitalization and 19% required mechanical ventilation. One every twenty infected infants
      died. Unlike industrialized nations, VLBW infants in developing countries often lack access
      to prophylaxis against RSV with a commercially available monoclonal antibody (palivizumab).
      No vaccine or preventive intervention is available against any respiratory virus for infants
      younger than 6 months of age in developing countries and the public sector of most
      middle-income countries.

      The protective role of breastfeeding against respiratory infections in developing countries
      is well established. But while similar beneficial effects have been described for premature
      infants, the dropout rate for breastfeeding in families exposed to the uncertainties and
      stress of the early months of life in the neonatal intensive care unit is very high. The
      World Health Organization recommends the use of Human Milk Donor Banks to feed infants that
      cannot be breastfed by their own mothers. These banks are established with the purpose of
      collecting, screening, processing (including pasteurizing), testing and distributing donated
      human milk. The potential benefit of donated milk against acute disease elicited by RSV is
      unknown. The investigators propose to study the role of supplemental donated human milk in
      the prevention of hospitalizations caused by RSV in non-breastfeeding premature infants.
      Since the investigators expect the benefits of breast milk to extend beyond protection
      against RSV, the effect of human milk against respiratory infections elicited by other
      viruses will also be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  VLBW preterm neonates (birth weight &lt;1,500 g at birth; gestational age &lt;37 weeks) born
             alive at any of the two participating maternity hospitals integrating our network in
             Argentina will be enrolled in the study after signature of informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  VLBW infants older than one month of age (e.g.: transferred from another institution),
             or formula fed for over ten days, or with congenital heart disease, congenital
             anomalies of the respiratory tract (i.e.: tracheoesophageal fistula, pulmonary
             hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia), immune suppression, severe malformations affecting
             breathing (i.e. anencephaly) as well as infants who die prior to completion of the
             first questionnaire, or living more than 40 km away from the Hospital will be excluded
             from participation. Infants born from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive
             mothers will also be excluded
