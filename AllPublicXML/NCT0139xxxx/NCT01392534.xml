  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common adverse effects resulting from the therapy with thiazides,
      thiazide-like diuretics and loop diuretics is increased potassium secretion. Disregulation of
      plasma potassium may be a life-threatening condition due to increased risk of arrythmias.
      Moreover, it has been postulated that decrease in plasma potassium level may negatively
      affect glucose metabolism resulting in the increased risk of new-onset type 2 diabetes.The
      main goal of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of
      telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide in a broad population of hypertensive patients, including the
      effects of the therapy on plasma potassium level and also on selected parameters of glucose
      and lipid metabolism.
