  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CWP232291 blocks proliferation of cancer cells via activation of caspases. Active caspase
      have been shown to target beta-catenin, the hallmark of canonical Wnt signaling, for
      degradation through caspase-directed cleavage. CWP232291 targets beta-catenin for degradation
      and thereby inhibits the expression of cell cycle and anti-apoptotic genes such as cyclin D1
      and survivin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent form (ICF) prior to
             initiation of any study-specific procedure and treatment

          -  18 years of age

          -  3. A pathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML or CMML-2 by World Health Organization
             (WHO) classification that is relapsed or refractory or for which no current therapies
             are anticipated to result in a durable remission, or MDS by WHO classification are
             RAEB-1 or RAEB-2 and that have failed at least three cycles of hypomethylating
             therapy, or primary (PMF), post-polycythemia vera (PPMF) or post-essential
             thrombocythemia (PTMF) MF by WHO classification, are high-risk category by the Dynamic
             International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS Plus), have ≥1% circulating blasts, and
             have failed treatment with ruxolitinib

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0-2

          -  In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to
             time of study drug administration should be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents or
             at least 5 half-lives for noncytotoxic agents. If a patient is on hydroxyurea to
             control peripheral blood leukemic cell counts, the patient must have discontinued
             hydroxyurea for at least 24 hours before initiation of treatment with study drug.
             Persistent clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must not be
             greater than grade 1

          -  Adequate renal function:

               -  Serum creatinine =/&lt; 2.0mg/dL

          -  Adequate hepatic function:

               -  Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to
                  Gilbert's syndrome

               -  Alkaline phosphatase (AP) =/&lt; 2.5 x ULN

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤3 x ULN, unless

             sterile) must use acceptable contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device
             [IUD], oral contraceptive, or double barrier device), and must have a negative serum
             or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial.
             Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive methods for the duration of

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiac arrhythmia, or

             requirements

          -  Active heart disease including myocardial infarction (MI) within previous 3 months,
             symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmias not controlled by medication,

          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) disease

          -  Therapy with any other standard or investigational treatment for hematologic
             malignancy (except hydroxyurea, as mentioned in the inclusion criteria)

          -  Therapy with anticoagulant or antithrombotic agents (including aspirin) within 7 days
             prior to study drug administration

          -  Known positive status for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or active hepatitis B
             or C

          -  Pregnant or nursing women. Pregnant and nursing patients are excluded because the
             effects of CWP232291 on a fetus or nursing child are unknown.

          -  Patients eligible for bone marrow transplant, regardless of age
