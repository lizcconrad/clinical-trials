  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to correlate the link between palpatory findings of somatic
      dysfunction and gastrointestinal endoscopic evidence of changes in mucosa. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that there is a direct connection between somatic palpatory changes and
      intestinal mucosal changes via a somatovisceral/viscerosomatic mechanism.

      The study protocol is limited to an extra physical examination (the focused structural exam)
      prior to a scheduled routine or diagnostic endoscopy. Immediately prior to the scheduled
      endoscopy, subjects enrolled in the study will be palpated by a Neuromuscular Medicine
      (NMM)/Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) specialist for spinal tenderness, tissue
      texture changes and asymmetry or restricted range of motion as well as tenderness of Chapman
      points. The entire spine from the occipitoatlantal joint to the sacrum will be evaluated
      along with specific intercostal abdominal and lower extremity areas. The positive structural
      examination findings of spinal tenderness, tissue texture changes and asymmetry or restricted
      range of motion will be compared to the visual and pathological findings recorded in the
      operative report of the endoscopy procedure and the pathological report of any biopsies
      obtained during the endoscopic procedure.

    <measure>Osteopathic structural exam findings of somatic dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>Structural exam will be conducted prior to the scheduled endoscopy on the same day. The results will be recorded on a somatic dysfunction findings worksheet during the exam. This exam will only occur one time on the day of the endoscopy.</time_frame>
    <description>A musculoskeletal exam will be done by a Neuromuscular Medicine (NMM)/Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) specialist for spinal tenderness, tissue texture changes, asymmetry, and restricted range of motion as well as tenderness of Chapman Points. The entire spine from the occipitoatlantal joint to the sacrum will be evaluated along with specific intercostal abdominal and lower extremity areas. The exam will identify whether tenderness, tissue texture changes, asymmetry, and range of motion restrictions exist at each of the vertebral segments.</description>
