  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effects of aerobic exercise on hippocampal volumes and severity of psychotic
      symptoms in a population of psychosis patients compared to healthy age/gender matched
      volunteers. Psychosis patients often suffer from a number of cognitive difficulties,
      including poor memory function, poor problem-solving capacity and difficulties with attention
      and concentration. These problems are not well addressed by current clinical treatments.
      Evidence from aging research strongly suggests that increased cardiovascular fitness may
      provide numerous cognitive benefits by promoting brain growth, particularly in the frontal
      lobes and the hippocampi. The current study will measure the effects of aerobic exercise on
      brain volumes in a population of chronic psychosis patients to determine if 1) hippocampal
      volumes increase in response to exercise and 2) if parallel improvements in cognitive
      functioning occur.

      This is a 12-week, randomized trial with two parallel groups. Throughout the trial, subjects
      will be treated on their prescribed dose of medication. Once informed consent is obtained,
      subjects and healthy volunteers will be randomly assigned to either an aerobic or a
      resistance exercise program (N = 24 per diagnostic group in each of two exercise conditions).
      Patients will continue to receive their antipsychotics and other prescribed medications.
      Healthy volunteer data will be used to establish normal exercise-induced neuroplasticity in a
      non-psychiatric, non-medicated population. All training will be conducted at the Riverview
      Hospital fitness facilities and at dedicated exercise training facilities at the University
      of British Columbia. All exercise sessions will be monitored by trained research assistants
      (RAs) under the guidance of the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology-Certified Exercise
      Physiologists (CSEP-CEPs). The RAs will receive pre-study exercise training from the
      CSEP-CEPs. During the course of the study, the training intensity will be changed according
      to the individual participant's response and needs via the CSEP-CEPs and RAs.

    <time_frame>Base-line, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hippocampal volumes will be measured from structural MRI scans. T1-weighted 3D SPGR (spoiled gradient recalled) and high-resilution T2- weighted structural images will be obtained for the purposes of volumetric assessment of the hippocampi and the whole brain</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Increases in hippocampal volumes will be positively associated with improvements in working memory performance in schizophrenia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, 8 and 12.</time_frame>
    <description>The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT), will be used to assess memory function. Multiple versions of the HVLT exist (12) so practice effects will be minimized. The Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCF), in which subjects are asked to reproduce a complex line drawing from memory, will be used to assess attention and working memory.</description>
