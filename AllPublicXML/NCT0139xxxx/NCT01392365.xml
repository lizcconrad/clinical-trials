      The aim of this study is to develop a scoring system and a prediction model for differential
      diagnosis between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease and intestinal tuberculosis mimic each other in clinical, endoscopic, and
      histological features. In addition, the yield of microbiological/histological test (AFB
      stain, caseating granuloma) is not high in clinical setting. Therefore, distinguishing CD
      from ITB especially in highly endemic areas for TB is challenging. The aim of this study is
      to develop and to validate a scoring system and a prediction model for differential diagnosis
      between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease

    <description>Patients with suspected diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis or Crohn's disease will be invited to participate in this study. Study variables including past medical history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory variables, radiologic findings (Chest X-ray and small bowel follow-through, colonoscopic features) will be gathered at study enrollment. Final diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis or Crohn's disease will be made according to the diagnostic criteria previously described (Lee YJ, et al. Endoscopy 2006;38:592-597). A prediction model using various variables for intestinal tuberculosis or Crohn's disease will be constructed in the development group and will be validated in the validation group.</description>
