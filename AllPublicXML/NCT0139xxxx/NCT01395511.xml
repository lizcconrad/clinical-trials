      The purpose of this study is to determine whether acupuncture is effective and safe
      therapeutic method in the treatment of cervical pain, shoulder and upper extremity pain and
      discomfort due to Whiplash associated disorder. (Traumatic car accidents)

      We recruit 40 participants who had cervical, shoulder and upper extremity pain and had
      discomfort due to Whiplash associated disorder. And then we check initial data of 40
      participants (Pain;VAS, Cervical ROM, SF-36, SDS, CMI)

      40 participants were randomly allocated to two groups ; acupuncture group or waiting-list
      group.

      Acupuncture group: participants were given acupuncture treatment three times a week during 2
      weeks, for 15 minutes at each session. After 6 times acupuncture treatments, we check
      information of participants again after 2 weeks(VAS, ROM, SF-36, SDS, CMI)

      Waiting-list group : The waiting-list group did not receive acupuncture treatment. After 2
      weeks we check information of participants again (VAS, ROM, SF-36, SDS, CMI)

      The waiting-Patients in both groups were permitted to receive usual care including physical
      therapy and exercise and were not permitted to take analgesics and antiphlogistics during the
      trial periods.

    <textblock>
      We recruited participants through advertisements in local newspapers or on the homepage of a
      Kyung-hee Medical Centre during December 8, 2009 to October 14, 2010.

      Patients who met eligibility criteria were randomly allocated into either acupuncture
      treatment group or waiting-list group. Random sequences were generated by computerized number
      table. Allocation was concealed using sealed envelopes. According to priority, sealed
      envelope was matched when the patients had given informed consent.

      The method of acupuncture: participants were given acupuncture treatment three times a week
      during 2 weeks, for 15 minutes (Needle retention time) at each session. (Total 6 times)

      We select about ten acupuncture points

        -  Local Acupoints : SI14, SI15, BL10, BL12, BL13, BL14, TE15, GB20, SI9

        -  Distal Acupoints :

             -  Upper extremities: LU6, LU7, LU9, LI11, HT3, SI2, SI3, SI5, SI7, PC4, PC6, TE5

             -  Lower extremities: SP3, SP4, BL59, BL60, BL61, BL62, BL66, KI3, KI4,KI6, KI7, GB40,
                GB41, LR4

      All Acupuncture points were prepared with 70% alcohol pads, and disposable stainless steel
      needles were used. Most of acupuncture were inserted vertically 1~2cm in depth until patient
      can feel De-Qi. (No more additional stimulation)
