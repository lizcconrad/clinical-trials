      1.1 Study characteristics This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of Clariti Monthly
      silicone hydrogel contact lenses (Sauflon Pharmaceuticals Limited) by comparison with Air
      Optix Aqua silicone hydrogel contact lenses (Ciba Vision Inc.). Subjects used OptiFree
      Replenish solution(Alcon Laboratories Inc.) for daily lens maintenance, care and storage.

      The key study features were as follows:

        1. Three months duration.

        2. Seven investigator sites.

        3. Daily wear soft (hydrophilic) silicone hydrogel contact lenses, replaced on a monthly
           basis: Clariti Monthly and Air Optix Aqua. OptiFree Replenish was used as a care system
           by all subjects.

        4. A total of 95 subjects were enrolled, and 94 subjects accounting for 188 eyes were
           dispensed lenses. This group was randomized into 64 test subjects (128 eyes)and 30
           control subjects (60 eyes).

        5. Of the 64 test subjects, 56 (87.5%) completed three months of use. Of the 30 control
           subjects, 29 (96.7%) completed three months of use.

        6. No eyes remained active at the end of the study.

        7. There were no adverse reactions.

      1.2 Study period The study was conducted over three months of wear. Subjects were examined
      initially,and at five follow-up visits after one week, two weeks, four weeks, eight weeks and
      12 weeks. Study visits commenced on September 6, 2010 and were completed on March 16, 2011.

      1.3 Demographics Seven investigator sites dispensed 64 test subjects (128 eyes) who used
      Clariti Monthly as their contact lens during the work. Also enrolled were 30 control subjects
      (60 eyes)who used Air Optix Aqua as their contact lens during the work. All recruited
      subjects were existing contact lenses wearers.

      Of the 64 test subjects, 56 (87.5%) completed three months of use and eight (12.5%)were
      discontinued. Of the 30 control subjects, 29 (96.7%) completed three months of use and one
      (3.4%) was discontinued.

      The enrolled control group was made up of 22 females (73%) and eight males (27%) with an age
      range from 19 to 63 years (mean 35.6 years). The enrolled test group was composed of 41
      females (63%) and 24 males (37%) with an age range from 17 to 62 years (mean 32.8 years). One
      ineligible subject (age 17 years) was enrolled and assigned to the test group but was not
      dispensed lenses.

                  corneal oedema, corneal vascularisation, corneal staining, tarsal conjunctival
                  changes or any other abnormality which would normally contraindicate contact lens
                  wear.

               9. They have taken part in any other clinical trial or research, within two weeks
                  prior to starting this study.
