      The aim of this study is to find out the safety and efficacy of Laparoscopic Greater
      Curvature Plication (LGCP) procedure. This study procedure is an alternative restrictive
      weight loss surgery that has the potential to reduce the complications associated with
      gastric banding and sleeve gastrectomy by creating a small sized stomach without the use of
      an implant and without cutting stomach.

    <description>This procedure creates a small sized stomach by folding the stomach twice into itself vertically. The functional capacity of the stomach is decreased by 80% of its normal(At least two rows of five continuous stitches are placed laparoscopically about the greater curvature of the stomach starting at or near the angle of His and ending in the antrum).</description>
