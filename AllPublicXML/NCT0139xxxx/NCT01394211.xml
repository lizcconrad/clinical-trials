      This phase II trial studies how well giving pazopanib hydrochloride and anastrozole before
      surgery works in treating patients with stage II-III estrogen receptor-positive breast
      cancer. Pazopanib hydrochloride and anastrozole may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride and
      anastrozole together before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of
      normal cells that have to be removed

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate at surgery.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate alternative measurements of anti-tumor activity: proportion of patients
      achieving sustained decrease in antigen KI-67 (ki-67) at 12 weeks of therapy with anastrozole
      plus pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride); proportion of patients achieving down-staging to a
      pathologic stage 0 or 1 at surgery.

      II. To assess qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this combination, with special
      emphasis on the frequency of events grade 3 or greater, or the occurrence of unexpected
      toxicities.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride* orally (PO) once daily (QD) and anastrozole PO QD
      for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then
      undergo definitive surgery.

      NOTE: *Pazopanib hydrochloride is stopped 7-14 days before surgery.

          -  Radiation therapy, surgery or tumor embolization within 14 days prior to first dose of
             pazopanib OR

          -  Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy or hormonal
             therapy within 14 days or five half-lives of a drug (whichever is longer) prior to the

             CYP3A4 inhibitors are ineligible

          -  Concomitant: the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole,
             ritonavir, clarithromycin) may increase pazopanib concentrations and should be
             avoided; if coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted, reduce the
             dose of pazopanib to 400 mg; further dose reductions may be needed if adverse effects
             occur during therapy; this dose is predicted to adjust the pazopanib AUC to the range
             observed without inhibitors; however, there are no clinical data with this dose
             adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors; grapefruit juice should be
             avoided as it inhibits CYP3A4 activity and may also increase plasma concentrations of
             pazopanib

          -  Concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer: the concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.
             rifampin) may decrease pazopanib concentrations and should be avoided
