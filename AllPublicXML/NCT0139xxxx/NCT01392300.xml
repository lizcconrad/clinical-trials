  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of Botulinum toxin type A into
      muscles of the upper limb are effective in treating spasticity in patients after stroke.

      The study consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      single-dose main period followed by an open-label, non-controlled, repeated-dose extension
      period (Open-Label Extension Period - OLEX).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ashworth Scale (AS) Score of Primary Target Clinical Pattern</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Primary target clinical pattern was defined by investigator for each subject at baseline visit and was either flexed wrist or clenched fist or flexed elbow.
The Ashworth Scale is well known and commonly used in clinical trials with spasticity. It was used to categorize severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).</description>

    <measure>Investigator's Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>This is the co-primary outcome measure. The Global Impression of Change Scale [GICS] is used to measure the investigator's impression of change due to treatment. The response option is a common 7-point Likert scale that ranges from -3 = very much worse to +3 = very much improved.</description>

        <description>Primary target clinical pattern was defined by investigator for each subject at baseline visit and was either flexed wrist or clenched fist or flexed elbow.
The Ashworth Scale is well known and commonly used in clinical trials with spasticity. It was used to categorize severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).</description>

        <title>Response Rates on the Ashworth Scale at Week 4 Calculated for the Muscle Group Flexed Wrist</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale is well known and commonly used in clinical trials with spasticity. It was used to categorize severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the efficacy analysis.</description>

        <title>Response Rates on the Ashworth Scale at Week 12 Calculated for the Muscle Group Clenched Fist</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale is well known and commonly used in clinical trials with spasticity. It was used to categorize severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the efficacy analysis.</description>

        <title>Response Rates on the Ashworth Scale at Week 8 Calculated for the Muscle Group Pronated Forearm</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale is well known and commonly used in clinical trials with spasticity. It was used to categorize severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension). Subjects with a reduction of one point were defined as responder for the aim of the efficacy analysis.</description>

        <description>The Ashworth Scale is well known and commonly used in clinical trials with spasticity. It was used to categorize severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).</description>

        <description>The Ashworth Scale is well known and commonly used in clinical trials with spasticity. It was used to categorize severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).</description>

        <title>Changes From Baseline to Week 4 in Ashworth Scale Score for Treated Muscle Group Pronated Forearm.</title>
        <description>The Ashworth Scale is well known and commonly used in clinical trials with spasticity. It was used to categorize severity of spasticity by judging resistance to passive movement. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).</description>
