      The purpose of the project is to formulate, implement and evaluate a new type of
      activity-orientated, evidence-based prevention programme to prevent fall injuries among
      elderly people. The question examined by the study is whether the intervention programme can:

        -  significantly reduce accidents and incidents involving falling among the participants,

        -  influence variables such as satisfaction with life, confidence in one's own ability and
           a feeling of involvement,

        -  be shown to be cost effective in terms of the use of resources. The intervention
           programme - Active lifestyle all your life - is being developed in and for primary care
           for the cost effective prevention of fall injuries among elderly people using a method
           that results in continued active life. The aim is to ensure that the elderly person is
           able to continue living an active life with commitment and involvement, which can in
           itself prevent fall injuries. This presupposes a knowledge of how to avoid fall injuries
           and the measures and aids that are available to prevent such injuries. The programme
           will also provide the participants with a social community in self-supporting groups
           which, by their own efforts but also with social support, are able to continue some of
           the activities provided through primary care.

    <description>Intervention After the first data collection the participants are randomised in an intervention and control group. The control group receives the normal treatment that may be given after a radius fracture and may vary from one care unit to another (but there is no preventive programme within the normal activity as far as we know). In groups of 6-8 participants the intervention group starts the programme &quot;Active lifestyle all your life&quot; with group meetings around every other week (10-12 times) and with 2 individual meetings directed at discussing fall risks in the participant's own home environment. After a summer break, Christmas and New Year three follow-up meetings take place, one of which is an individual meeting. The intervention is then terminated, but the participants are encouraged to continue the activity themselves.</description>
