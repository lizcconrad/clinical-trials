      Despite the availability of effective anti-tuberculosis agents that exist to treat this
      illness, hepatotoxicity during first-line drugs anti-tuberculosis medications (ATT) such as
      isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and pyrazinamide (PZA) is not uncommon and limit their use.
      There is no consensus on method of the reintroduction of anti-TB medications. The risk of
      reintroducing of a anti-TB medications could be hazardous. There are several differences
      between the guidelines from the ATS, BTS and the Task Force of the European Respiratory
      Society, the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease about the
      methods of reintroducing of anti-TB medications.

      The investigators plan to do a prospective study to evaluate the outcome and safety of
      reintroduction of anti-TB medications after resolution of hepatitis during anti-TB treatment
      among TB patients in the investigators hospital.

    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading health problem in both developing and developed
      countries. Despite the availability of effective chemotherapeutic agents that exist to treat
      this illness, hepatotoxicity during first-line drugs anti-tuberculosis medications (ATT) such
      as isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and pyrazinamide (PZA) is not uncommon and limit their
      use. In the case of confirmed moderate or severe drug-induced hepatotoxicity, treatment
      should be interrupted and reintroduced after the hepatotoxicity has resolved.

      There is no consensus on method of the reintroduction of anti-TB medications. The risk of
      reintroducing of a anti-TB medications could be hazardous. There are several differences
      between the guidelines from the ATS, BTS and the Task Force of the European Respiratory
      Society, the WHO and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease about the
      methods of reintroducing of anti-TB medications.

      We plan to do a prospective study to evaluate the outcome and safety of reintroduction of
      anti-TB medications after resolution of hepatitis during anti-TB treatment among TB patients
      in our hospital.
