  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer is changing. Currently, there are
      several active schedules of chemotherapy that can be used, such as gemcitabine as monotherapy
      or in combination with capecitabine or erlotinib, and FOLFIRINOX. Moreover, the development
      of biomarker (therapeutic targets) that can predicte response to treatment is a new important
      tool to be used in clinical practice to select the best scheme for each patient. Preliminary
      studies showed that therapeutic target determination, using tumor tissue collected from
      patients, could determine the presence of groups of &quot;chemotherapy responders&quot;. Such is the
      case of EGFR amplification and/or K-Ras gene status and correlation with response to
      erlotinib. Moreover, Thymidilate Synthase, Thimidine Phosphorylase, ERCC-1 and Topoisomerase
      I expression by immunohistochemistry in GI tumor samples has been related to resistance or
      response to 5FU-capecitabine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan respectively. Based on this data the
      investigators designed a phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of selected
      treatment for pancreatic cancer patients based on the determination of therapeutic targets.
      The therapeutic target-driven treatment efficacy will be compared to the prospective
      treatment of a control group of patients treated at the discretion of the
      physician-researcher

      Study Phase: Phase 2 Trial

      Study Objetives:

        -  Primary end-point. Proportion of patients alive after 12 months in patients with
           advanced pancreatic carcinoma individually selected and grouped according to the
           expression in tumor tissue for therapeutic targets.

        -  Secondary end-points. 1. Assessing the feasibility of the method of
           patient-treatment-selection based on tumor tissue expression of therapeutic targets. 2.
           Overal survival comparison between Gemcitabine single agent treatment and the rest of
           chemotherapy schedules. 3. Determination of progression-free survival for each treatment
           group. 4. Determination of toxicity in all the patients.

      Study population and Number of subject: A total of 60 pancreatic cancer patients with
      advanced pancreas cancer with no previous systemic treatment are expected to be enrolled.

      Study design and schedule. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to a control arm or an
      experimental treatment arm guided by therapeutic targets. In the control arm, patients are
      treated with conventional chemotherapy regimens at the discretion of the investigator. In the
      experimental arm, patients are treated as determined in tumor tissue available for biomarker
      TS, TP, ERCC-1, Topo-1, K-Ras mutation and EGFR FISH, choosing FOLFIRINOX schemas, FOLFOX,
      FOLFIRI, Gemcitabine-Capecitabine Gemcitabine-Erlotinib, Gemcitabine single agent. All
      patients will be analyzed by intention to treat
