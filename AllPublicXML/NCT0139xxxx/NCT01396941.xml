      This pilot clinical trial will test the hypotheses that sleep restriction (for 5 nights), in
      comparison to &quot;normal sleep&quot;, will:

        1. Decrease peripheral insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, as measured by the
           hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and oral glucose tolerance test.

        2. Decrease hepatic insulin sensitivity, as assessed by stable isotope studies of
           endogenous glucose production, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past 50 years, the incidence of diabetes has increased dramatically, while sleep
      duration in the US has decreased significantly. Epidemiological studies and small clinical
      trials suggest that these trends are causally related. In this study, our goal is to
      determine the mechanisms by which decreased sleep duration directly affects insulin
      sensitivity. The investigators will perform a clinical study in 20 healthy volunteers to
      determine whether 5 nights of sleep restriction decreases insulin sensitivity in the
      peripheral tissues (ie, skeletal muscle) or liver.

      Peripheral insulin sensitivity will be measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, and
      hepatic insulin sensitivity will be quantified by measurement of hepatic glucose production,
      gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (using stable isotope tracer methods). Subjects will be
      randomized to an initial period of &quot;normal sleep&quot; or sleep restriction and will be admitted
      to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) for 9 days to undergo comprehensive metabolic studies
      and sleep assessments under the assigned sleep condition. After a 1-month washout period,
      subjects will be re-admitted to the CRC to undergo these same assessments under the opposite
      sleep condition.

    <description>The investigators will compare the effects of sleep restriction vs. normal sleep in healthy volunteers, using a randomized crossover study design. Each subject will undergo a period of normal sleep and a period of sleep restriction, separated by a 1-month washout period. Subjects will be randomized to receive either sleep restriction first (later followed by normal sleep) or normal sleep first (later followed by sleep restriction).</description>
