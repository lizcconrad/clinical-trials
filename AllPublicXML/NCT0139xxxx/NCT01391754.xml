  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a field trial comparing the SafeCare family preservation model to a comparable
      usual care model for parents in child welfare. The study also compares two levels of service
      quality control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a cluster-randomized field trial of the SafeCare(SC) home-based family
      preservation model for families in the child welfare system. The trial is conducted in
      collaboration with the state child welfare agency and their contracted in-home service
      system. The service system is regionalized and provides in home services to families referred
      by child welfare. Regions of the state are assigned by the study to either the SC model or to
      services as usual. Provider teams, nested within regions, are assigned to either a monitored
      or unmonitored model implementation quality control condition. The aims of the project are to
      test client level child welfare reentry outcomes between SC and standard conditions, across
      the two implementation and quality control conditions.
