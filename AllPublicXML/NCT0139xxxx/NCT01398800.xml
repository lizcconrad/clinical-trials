      Long term follow-up is needed to determine whether current Mobile Bearing revision Total Knee
      Arthroplasty (TKA) designs will improve implant longevity. The potential advantages of mobile
      bearings in the revision TKA setting include reduction in polyethylene wear, decreasing
      fixation stresses, and protection of the constraining mechanisms. Several studies have
      reported satisfactory clinical results after revision total knee arthroplasty but no study
      with a large number has specifically addressed the clinical outcomes after revision total
      knee arthroplasty using the mobile bearing design

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Failure modes of revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) that include prosthetic loosening and
      damage to constraining mechanisms often require revision TKA. Mobile bearing revision TKA
      components have been developed in hopes of lessening these failure mechanisms. Our purpose is
      to evaluate the use of mobile bearings in revision TKA.

      Retrospective clinical and radiographic evaluation of 340 revision mobile bearing TKAs using
      the PFC Sigma and LCS posterior stabilized rotating platform implants (Depuy, Warsaw, IN)
      will be performed. Indications for revision include instability, loosening, arthrofibrosis,
      chronic hemarthrosis, failed patellofemoral replacement, failed unicompartmental knee
      replacement, infection reimplantation, and supracondylar fracture nonunion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Requiring a revision of a primary knee replacement. Indications for revision include
        instability, aseptic loosening, failed unicompartmental knee replacement, infection
        reimplantation, arthrofibroisis, chronic hemarthrosis, failed patellofemoral replacments,
        and non union of a supracondylar femur fracture.

        Exclusion Criteria: None since they have all required a revision.
