        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years

          2. Patients with one of the following advanced or recurrent solid tumor types, who failed
             standard therapy or for whom no effective standard therapy is available:colorectal;
             gastric or cancers of the gastro-esophageal junction; non-small cell lung cancer;
             ovarian (or primary peritoneal); pancreatic (including ampullary); triple-negative
             breast

          3. Measurable tumor disease (or non-measurable ovarian cancer that can be followed by
             CA-125)

          4. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          5. Acceptable organ and marrow function at baseline (protocol defined laboratory
             parameters)

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1

          7. Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or
             investigational agents within 4 weeks prior to starting study drug or who have not
             recovered from side effects of prior therapies

          2. Symptomatic brain metastases (including leptomeningeal disease) indicative of active
             disease

          3. Peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE v4 grade 2

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would unduly increase the risk of toxicity or
             limit compliance with study requirements

          5. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Men or women of reproductive potential who
             are not willing to apply effective birth control

          6. Systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg observed
             as part of the screening examination.

          7. Patients treated with a calcium channel blocker or who require combination of more
             than 2 antihypertensives to control blood pressure.

          8. Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
