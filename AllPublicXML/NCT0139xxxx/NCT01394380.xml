    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 68 overweight male and female subjects with a high (&gt; 2 3dl-can
      soda/day) consumption of sweetened beverage per day. After a run-in period of 4 weeks,
      subjects will be randomized to either a 12-week intervention arm in which sweetened beverages
      will be replaced by artificially sweetened, calorie-free beverages, or to a control arm. The
      following measurements will be performed at the end of the run-in period and at the end of
      the intervention period

        -  intrahepatic fat concentration

        -  visceral fat volume

        -  changes in day-long metabolic profile from baseline(plasma glucose, insulin, and
           triglyceride concentrations)

        -  changes in food intake and daily energy, carbohydrate and sugars intake from baseline
