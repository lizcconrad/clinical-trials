    <textblock>
      During cataract operations a capsulorhexis is being performed. This is done in order to
      enable the removal of lens material while keeping the capsule intact in order to put inside
      the lens capsule an artificial intra ocular lens.

      The capsulorhexis must be round and with regular edge and no tears. While performing a
      cataract surgery we use phako emulsification machine that sends an ultrasonic wave that
      creaks the lens nucleus and at the same time irrigates the anterior chamber of the eye and
      sucks the fluid and the lens material of the creaked lens.

      The round shape and the regularity of the capsulorhexis are a must in these surgeries since
      the lens capsule must stay intact and stable in order to enable the phacoemulsification and
      the implant of the artificial lens.

      Today capsulorhexis are done with a bent needle or with special forceps; the act of
      capsulorhexis is delicate, sometime un predicted and difficult to teach. The learning curve
      is relatively long and difficult.

      The proposed device enables a capsulorhexis which is round and has regular edges, done almost
      automatically and is predicted. The learning curve is short and easy. The capsulorhexis is
      done through the original operating wound with no need to widen it.

      Planed Procedure

      20 patients will be tested in this trail.

      Consecutive patients that have senile cataract will be examined preoperatively as is done
      usually and the data of the examination will be collected/ a special attention will be given
      to the type of cataract and lens stability.

      Systemic diseases will not be considered as exclusion criteria.

      Patients with dens or mature cataract will be excluded.

      Patients will be explained about the new device and those who will agree will sign a consent
      form.

      During the cataract surgery all steps will be done as usually except of the capsulorhexis
      which will be done by using the new device.

      The capsulorhexis will be photographed for further evaluation by a microscope camera.

      After the operation the surgeon will record his impression about the convenience of using the
      new device, the shape and form of the capsulorhexis and its stability and any other relevant
      information.

      Post operative follow up will be done as usually, one day, one week, 3 weeks and six weeks
      after operation. The results of those examinations will be recorded and collected with
      special attention of IOL stability, the shape of capsulorhexis and intra ocular post
      operative inflammation if will occur.

      The data, including the surgeons' comments, shape and form of capsulorhexis IOL stability and
      the rest will be collected and processed.

      In case in which the use of the device will not perform a round and regular capsulorhexis, or
      instability of the capsule will occur or a un predicted intraocular inflammation will be seen
      the trail will be stopped immediately

    <description>As the title of this experiment:&quot;The trying a new device for performing capsulorhexis in cataract surgery&quot;.Becuase we are not changing the protocol of Cataract surgery,the outcome measure of this experiment is the efficiency of this device, the safety and the simplicity of the use the device inorder to give a simple and safe solution for capsulorhexis.Therefor the outcome measure will be IOL stability, the shape of capsulorexis and intra ocular post operative inflammation if will occur. The trail is not comparative.</description>
