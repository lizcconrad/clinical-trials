  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine in genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-infected
      participants, the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the
      body, how it is distributed within the body and removed from the body over time) and
      antiviral activity of repeated doses of TMC649128 given as monotherapy and given in
      combination with pegylated interferon + ribavirin. We assess the
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (how the study medication affects the body) (PK/PD)
      relationship for antiviral activity, active metabolite and safety of TMC649128 and its
      metabolites. We determine the short term safety and tolerability of the co-administration of
      TMC649128 and pegylated interferon + ribavirin during multiple dosing for 14 days in
      treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV-infected participants. We explore the effect of pegylated
      interferon + ribavirin on the pharmacokinetics of TMC649128 during the multiple dosing for 14
      days in treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV-infected participants. We also assess in a preliminary
      way the short term antiviral effect of the combination of TMC649128 with pegylated interferon
      + ribavirin during a 14-day dosing period in treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV-infected
      participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TMC649128 is a nucleoside inhibitor (NI) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase in development
      for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. Treatment-naive genotype 1 HCV-infected
      participants are participants who have never received (pegylated) interferon ([Peg]IFN),
      ribavirin (RBV) or any other approved or investigational treatment for chronic HCV infection.
      Treatment-experienced genotype 1 HCV-infected participants are defined as previous
      non-responder and relapse subjects to previous treatment regimens (IFN/RBV or PegIFN/RBV),
      who have never received a HCV polymerase inhibitor and HCV protease inhibitor treatment was
      stopped since at least one year. This study is a Phase Ib, double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial in genotype 1 HCV-infected participants to determine the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of repeated doses of TMC649128 given as
      monotherapy and given in combination with pegylated interferon + ribavirin. This trial
      consists of 2 phases. In the first phase TMC649128 will be given as monotherapy during 10
      days at different doses and dosing regimens. In the second phase TMC649128 will be
      administered at one selected dose regimen in combination with PegIFN a-2a/RBV for 14 days.;
      All dosages of TMC649128 or placebo are given orally under fed conditions.; The monotherapy
      phase includes 3 panels (panel 1-3) and the combination therapy phase includes 1 panel (panel
      4). In panel 1, subjects are randomly assigned to receive TMC649128 at 1000 mg q24h (every
      24h) (n=8) or placebo (n=2) q24h on Days 1-10. In panel 2 subjects are randomized into Arm 1
      and Arm 2 and within each arm, subjects are randomly assigned to receive TMC649128 or placebo
      as follows: In arm 1 volunteers receive TMC649128 at a selected dose (n=8) or placebo (n=2)
      q12h on Days 1-10. In arm 2 volunteers receive TMC649128 at a selected dose (n=8) or placebo
      (n=2) q24h on Days 1-10. Panel 3: TMC649128 at a selected dose (n=8) or placebo (n=2) q12h
      (every 12h) OR q24h on Days 1-10 where the assignment is determined by randomization; Panel 4
      volunteers are randomized into Arm 1 and Arm 2. In panel 4, arm 1, 10 volunteers receive
      placebo (q12h OR q24h, dosing regimen matched to Arm 2 of Panel 4) + PegIFN a-2a/RBV on Days
      1-14. In Panel 4, arm 2, 10 volunteers receive TMC649128 at a selected dose (q12h OR q24h) +
      PegIFN a-2a/RBV on Days 1-14.; The actual dose of Panel 1 is derived from data obtained from
      the currently ongoing MC649128HPC1001 trial. The actual dose in Panel 2 will depend on the
      results of Panel 1 (total daily dose of TMC649128 administered in both arms of Panel 2 will
      be the same. The dose of TMC649128 of the q24h regimen in Arm 2 will be higher than the q24h
      dose administered in Panel 1 [1000 mg q24h]). The actual doses and dose regimens in Panels 3
      and 4 will depend on the results of Panels 1 and 2 (data review meetings). Selection of doses
      and dose regimens in Panels 2, 3 and 4 will also depend on the data obtained from trial
      TMC649128HPC1001. Dosing will stay within the exposure limits. The intended doses for Panels
      2 and 3 are 2000 mg or 3000 mg q12h or q24h, but may be adapted based on previous clinical
      data. If needed and based on the outcome of the Panel 1 results, subjects in Panel 3 may
      eventually receive a lower dose than in Panel 1. See detailed study description.
