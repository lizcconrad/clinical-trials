  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed two stage study will evaluate patterns of local recurrence after EBRT and
      brachytherapy in spatial reference to baseline functional MRI and FLT/F-Miso PET scan in
      patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for postoperative recurrences of cervical cancer. The
      first stage of the study will focus on developing MR guided interstitial brachytherapy and
      validating the concept of high risk gross tumor volume (on the basis of functional imaging
      features).

      The second stage thereafter will focus on developing biologically modulated interstitial
      brachytherapy.

      In the proposed two staged study the investigators intend to prospectively evaluate and
      validate concept of HRGTV and develop technique of biologically dose modulated brachytherapy.
      The demonstration of technical feasibility and clinical safety of biologically modulated
      image guided radiotherapy in this pilot study for may pave the way for improving local
      control in patients with postoperative recurrences.

      Aims

      Stage I

      Aim 1: To spatially characterize biologically heterogenous subvolumes within the gross tumor
      through multimodality (18 F-Miso/FLT/Functional MR) image fusion.

      Aim 2: To evaluate post external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) response in spatial reference to
      biological heterogeneous sub-volumes on imaging.

      Stage II:

      Aim 3: To evaluate technical feasibility of delivering dose modulated biologically optimized
      interstitial brachytherapy.

      Aim 4: To evaluate acute and late toxicity and quality of life associated with biologically
      optimized brachytherapy

    <description>Stage II involves dose modulated brachytherapy wherein higher dose will be delivered to biologically high risk target volume. Saftey will be assessed initially by an interim analysis undertaken at 50 % accrual(median follow up 1 yr). If incidence of grade III-IV rectal and bladder toxicity &gt;15% than the trial will be stopped else continued till target accrual. The technique will be considered to be safe if Grade III bladder and bowel toxicity remain to be under 15%.</description>
