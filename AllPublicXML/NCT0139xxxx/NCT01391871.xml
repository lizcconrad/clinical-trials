      The purpose of this study is to compare vascular healing of the stented segment after
      deployment of new PRO-Kinetic drug eluting stent and Endeavor Resolute zotarolimus-eluting
      stent in patients with acute coronary syndromes requiring percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Objective: The aim of the trial is to compare vascular healing and vasodilation at 3 months
      after deployment of PRO-Kinetic drug-eluting stent and Endeavor Resolute zotarolimus-eluting
      stent in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

      Design: A prospective, randomized and controlled study comparing coronary flow reserve and
      coverage of the PRO-Kinetic DES and Endeavor Resolute DES implanted in acute coronary
      syndrome. OCT and CFR measurement at 3 months. Clinical follow up is scheduled at 3, 6 and 12
      months.

      Primary endpoint: Uncovered stent struts and CFR at 3 months after stent implantation.

      Secondary clinical endpoints: MACE and stent thrombosis.

      Enrollment: 40 patients (20 receiving PRO-Kinetic DES and 20 receiving Endeavor Resolute
      DES).

          -  STEMI or NSTEMI or unstable angina

          -  Patient or legally authorized representative has been informed of the nature of the
             study, agrees to its provisions and has been provided written informed consent,
             approved by the appropriate Medical Ethics committee or Institutional Review Board.

          -  Single de novo or non-stented restenosis lesion of LAD

          -  Patients with two-vessel disease may have undergone successful treatment of the
             non-target vessel with approved devices up to and including the index procedure but
             must be treated prior to the index target vessel treatment.

          -  Target lesion (maximum 20 mm length by visual estimate) to be covered by a single
             stent of maximum 23mm length.

          -  Reference vessel diameter must be &gt;2.5mm and &lt;4.0mm by visual estimate.

          -  The vessel diameter should be measured after pre-dilation procedure and after
             intracoronary nitroglycerin if vasospasm is suspected.
