  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed project is designed to collect data and specimens from patients/subjects
      presenting to the University of Michigan with a disease affecting the pancreas (or specific
      control populations). This protocol is focused on collecting data, blood samples, and tissue
      on subjects with pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cysts,
      pancreatitis, diabetic controls, jaundice/biliary obstruction controls, and otherwise healthy
      controls.

      We are collecting up to 50 mls of blood for research purposes only. Plasma, serum and buffy
      coat are collected and stored according to strict SOPs.

      The recently funded GI SPORE, here at the University of Michigan, is focused on pancreatic
      and colon diseases. This protocol is focused on collecting data, blood samples, and tissue on
      subjects with pancreatic diseases, including pancreatic cancer, pancreatic cysts,
      pancreatitis, diabetic controls, jaundice/biliary obstruction controls, and otherwise healthy
      controls. A SPORE is an NCI-funded, Specialized Program in Research Excellence, with specific
      requirements. Those requirements include 4 projects with a clinical and a basic science Co-PI
      and several COREs, including a biospecimen core. Each project that has a human subjects
      component will require a separate protocol and IRB submission when those projects are to
      begin.

      The specific populations we are recruiting are determined by the aims of project 2 and by the
      need to create a repository as part of the biospecimen core (please see the grant for details
      on the aims of these 2 projects).

      A specially designed database is being built for this study to handle the data aspects. Our
      collaborators at Dartmouth College have significant experience in managing data as they have
      been our partners for our work in the EDRN (PI Brenner). Case report forms and other data
      collection tools have been developed and are being used to populate the database. All of the
      actual data will be completely deidentified per HIPAA regulations.

      We intend to model the data and specimen collection on the model used by our work with the
      NCI-EDRN. This includes a customized database, the use of kits with pre-labled, bar-coded
      aliquots, and standardized data collection forms (CRFs).
