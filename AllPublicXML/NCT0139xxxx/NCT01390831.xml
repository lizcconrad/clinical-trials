      The purpose of this study is to determine whether renal denervation is safe and effective in
      the treatment of Chinese patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

    <textblock>
      Prevalence of hypertension is increasing in China.While actually,the controlled rate of
      hypertension is relatively low,though numerous safe and effective pharmacological therapies
      are used in clinical practice.Studies confirmed that renal sympathetic nerves contributed to
      development and perpetuation of hypertension. Previous study has stated that renal
      denervation was effective and safe in patients with resistant hypertension, while little data
      is known in Chinese patients. We hypothesis that renal denervation is effective and safe in
      treatment of Chinese patients with uncontrolled hypertension. This trial plan to recruit 100
      patients(Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1) with a follow up duration of 3 years.Patients
      in ablation group will receive percutaneous renal denervation combined with necessary
      antihypertension drugs and patients in control group will receive appropriate
      antihypertension drugs. We aim to explore the long term safety and validity of renal
      denervation in Chinese patients with uncontrolled hypertension.
