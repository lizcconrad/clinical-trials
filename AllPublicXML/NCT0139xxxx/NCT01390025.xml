      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety profile in healthy volunteers of a single
      intravenous administration of TCN-032 as compared with placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is a highly communicable acute respiratory disease that is considered to be one of
      the major infectious disease threats to the human population. Annual vaccination is generally
      effective only against those strains included in the vaccine. Because of the frequent
      emergence of divergent variants and the periodic emergence of strains with novel
      hemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase surface proteins that can result in global pandemics, the
      availability of potent antiviral agents for the prevention and/or treatment of influenza
      remains an urgent clinical and public health priority.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety assessment - number of participants with adverse events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by physical examinations, vital signs, serial electrocardiograms and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis). A clinically significant laboratory value will be any abnormal result that is an unexpected or unexplained laboratory value or change in value from the patient's prior values. AEs will be reported by severity and relatedness to study treatment and classified according to MedDRA</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetic analysis (PK)- Evaluate the single, ascending dose PK of TCN-032</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>PK evaluation of TCN-032 plasma concentrations will include: tmax (time at which maximum concentration is observed),Cmax (maximum observed concentration), t1/2 (terminal-elimination half-life), CL (clearance), Vd (volume of distribution).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunogenicity - detect and measure generation of anti-drug antibodies (ADA)specific for TCN-032</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days post infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity will be assessed based on induction of TCN-032 anti-drug antibodies. Baseline and serial post-treatment serum measures of anti-TCN-032 antibodies will be detected by immunoassay and summarized by dose and time point with means, standard deviations, medians, quartiles, and ranges. Change from baseline in anti-TCN-032 antibody levels will be similarly analyzed.</description>

    <description>TCN-032 is a human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to a conserved epitope of the amino-terminal extracellular domain (M2e) of the influenza virus matrix protein 2 (M2). The drug is intended for use as an antiviral agent for the treatment of disease caused by type A influenza viruses. Treatments within the study will consist of single ascending dose-escalation ranging from 1 to 40 mg/kg.</description>
