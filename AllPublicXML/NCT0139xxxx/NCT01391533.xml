      Primary Objectives:

      To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR125844. To confirm safety profile of
      SAR125844 when administered as single agent at the MTD.

      To evaluate the preliminary anti-tumoral effect of SAR125844 in patients with MET-gene
      amplified solid tumors (including sub-group of MET-amplified non-small cell lung cancer
      [NSCLC] patients) and in patients with Phospho-MET positive tumors without MET-gene
      amplification.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To characterize the global safety profile including cumulative toxicities. To evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic profile of SAR125844 in the proposed dosing schedule(s).

      To assess preliminary antitumor activity in patients with measurable/evaluable disease,
      according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

      To explore the pharmacodynamic effects (PD) of SAR125844. To explore MET gene amplification
      status in Circulating Tumoral Cells (CTCs) and on tumor biopsies collected during the study,
      in the escalation part only.

      To evaluate other pharmacodynamic biomarkers and help selection of patients who could benefit
      from SAR125844.

      To explore MET-gene amplification status in circulating DNA.

      The duration of the study for one patient in the dose escalation phase of the study will
      include a screening period of up to 3 weeks and a 4-week treatment cycle(s). The patients may
      continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or willingness to stop,
      followed by a minimum of 30-day follow-up. The study will also include 2 expansion cohorts.
      If a patient treated in dose escalation part or in an expansion cohorts, continues to benefit
      from the treatment at the time of Clinical Study Report, the patient can continue study
      treatment for a maximum of 1 year and will continue to undergo all assessments as per the
      study flowchart. Such patients will be followed at least until 30 days after the last IMP
      administration.
