    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to investigate whether and to what extent a cautious respiratory and
      exercise therapy can complement medical treatment and change the condition, oxygen uptake,
      quality of life, the pulmonary vascular pressures, the size of the right heart and the
      6-minute walk distance in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
