  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess and compare efficacy and safety of BI 54903 at three
      different dosages (b.i.d)., fluticasone propionate hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered dose
      inhaler (MDI) at a dose of 440 mcg b.i.d and low dose fluticasone propionate 88 mcg b.i.d.
      over an 8-week treatment period in asthmatic patients aged 12 to 65 years inadequately
      controlled medium dose ICS therapy as demonstrated by a decrease in forced expiratory volume
      in one second (FEV1) range 10 to 25 % and an asthma control questionnaire-6 (ACQ-6) equal or
      greater than 1.5 at time of randomisation.
