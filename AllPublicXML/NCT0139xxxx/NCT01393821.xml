      This clinical trial studies menadione topical lotion in treating skin discomfort and
      psychological distress in patients with cancer receiving panitumumab, erlotinib
      hydrochloride, or cetuximab. Menadione topical lotion may prevent rash or other skin
      discomfort and help alleviate psychological distress and pain in patients receiving treatment
      with panitumumab, erlotinib hydrochloride, or cetuximab

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the effectiveness of a menadione topical lotion to the face to prevent cutaneous
      and psychological discomfort from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the adverse event profile of a menadione topical lotion to the face to prevent
      rash from EGFR inhibitors.

      II. Explore whether rash or adverse events worsen over a 4 week period after this 4-week
      intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients apply menadione topical lotion twice daily (BID) for 28 days.

      ARM II: Patients apply topical placebo lotion BID for 28 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Patient scheduled to start an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (must be one
             of these three: panitumumab, erlotinib, cetuximab) within the next 3 days or patient
             has already started the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor but has not been on
             it for longer than 3 days and has no signs or symptoms potentially suggestive of EGFR
             inhibitor toxicity.

          -  Ability to reliably apply Menadione Topical Lotion / placebo twice a day to the face.

          -  Ability to complete questionnaire(s) by themselves or with assistance.

          -  Use of any antibiotic at the time of study or their anticipated use in the 8 weeks
