  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain assessment and management deficiencies in nursing homes (NHs) are well documented.
      Unrelieved pain in this setting results in poorer resident outcomes, including depression,
      decreased mobility, sleep disturbance, and impaired physical and social functioning. This
      randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a pain management algorithm coupled
      with intense diffusion strategies in improving pain, physical function and depression among
      NH residents. Specific aims of the study are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of a pain
      management algorithm (ALG) coupled with intense diffusion strategies, as compared with pain
      education (EDU) and weak diffusion strategies, in improving pain, mobility, and depression
      among NH residents; 2) Determine the extent to which adherence to the ALG and organizational
      factors are associated with changes in resident outcomes and the extent to which changes in
      these variables are associated with changes in outcomes; 3) Evaluate the persistence of
      changes in process and outcome variables at long-term follow-up and 4) Evaluate the
      relationships among behavioral problems and pain in severely cognitively impaired residents
      who are unable to provide self-report.

      Inadequate pain management in nursing homes (NHs) is well documented. Unrelieved pain in this
      setting results in depression, decreased mobility, sleep disturbance, and impaired physical
      and social functioning. This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a pain
      management algorithm delivered using intense diffusion strategies. Outcomes are facility pain
      practices and residents' pain, physical function and depression. Specific aims of the study
      are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of a pain management algorithm (ALG) coupled with
      intense diffusion strategies, as compared with pain education (EDU) and weak diffusion
      strategies, in improving pain, mobility, and depression among NH residents; 2) Determine the
      extent to which adherence to the ALG and organizational factors are associated with changes
      in resident outcomes and the extent to which changes in these variables are associated with
      changes in outcomes; 3) Evaluate the persistence of changes in process and outcome variables
      at long-term follow-up and 4) Evaluate the relationships among behavioral problems and pain
      in severely cognitively impaired residents who are unable to provide self-report.

    <description>The NH pain management algorithm is a series of decision-making tools that begins with regular, comprehensive pain assessment matched to residents' cognitive status and proceed through analgesic therapy appropriate to the character, severity, and pattern of pain. The algorithm is coupled with intense diffusion strategies (e.g., education, consultation, boosters) to increase adoption of these evidence-based practices</description>
