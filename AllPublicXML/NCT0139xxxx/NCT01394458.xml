  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently in Canada, either 4% sodium citrate or heparin 1,000-10,000 U/ml solutions are
      &quot;locked&quot; into hemodialysis catheters between dialysis sessions to prevent thrombosis. The use
      of an ethanol/sodium citrate locking solution may have advantages over either of these agents
      alone. The investigators hypothesize that the 30 % ethanol/4% sodium citrate catheter locking
      solution is safe and effective in the prevention of catheter-related infections and
      thrombosis.

      The pilot study will utilize a prospective, randomized design. After meeting the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and providing written informed consent, patients will be
      randomly assigned to a 30 % ethanol/ 4% sodium citrate locking solution or heparin 1000 U/ml.
      Patients will be enrolled from the Health Sciences Centre and the Sherbrook Dialysis Units in
      Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

    <description>For patients randomized to the 30% ethanol /4 % sodium citrate group, the lock solution will be provided in pre-filled syringes for single use only. After each dialysis session, the locking solution will be instilled into both catheter lumens, the lumens clamped and caps tightly secured to the hubs. Any remaining 30% ethanol/4% sodium citrate solution in each syringe will be discarded. The locking solution will be withdrawn from the catheter lumens before the next dialysis session.</description>

    <description>For patients randomized to the heparin group, the heparin will be provided in 10 ml glass vials. Two, 3 ml syringes will be used to draw up the required volume of heparin to fill each lumen. A separate syringe will be used to fill each catheter lumen. The necessary volume should match the lumen volume with no overfill. The locking solution will be instilled into both catheter lumens, the lumens clamped and caps tightly secured to the hubs. The locking solution will be withdrawn from the catheter lumens before the next dialysis session.</description>
