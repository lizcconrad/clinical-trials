    <textblock>
      This study is being done to collect information about people who have or may have
      Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia (HED) or X-linked Hypohidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia
      (XLHED). This study will allow Edimer Pharmaceuticals to know more about HED/XLHED so that
      hopefully the investigators can develop a drug to treat this condition. In this study Edimer
      will retrospectively review and abstract (summarize) medical records of people that have or
      may have HED/XLHED in order to further understand the natural history and disease
      characteristics.
