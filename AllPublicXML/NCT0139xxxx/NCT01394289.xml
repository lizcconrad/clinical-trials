  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the biologic activity of a Lolium perenne
      allergen extract in histamine equivalent prick (HEP) units, in order to be used as in-house
      reference preparation (IHRP).

    <textblock>
      Four concentrations of Lolium perenne allergen extract, together with a positive and negative
      control, using 10 mg/ml histamine dihydrochloride solution and a glycerinated phenol saline
      solution, respectively, will be tested in every patient in duplicate on the volar surface of
      the forearm.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has provided written informed consent, appropriately signed and dated by the
             subject (or legal representative, if applicable).

          -  Subject can be male or female of any race and ethnic group.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years and &lt; 50 years at the study inclusion day.

          -  Positive skin prick test with a standardized commercially available preparation of
             Lolium perenne allergen extract. The skin prick test will be considered positive if
             the test results in a wheal major diameter of at least 3 mm and at least the size of
             the positive control. Positive skin prick test results are valid if performed within
             one year prior to the inclusion of the subject in the study

          -  A positive test for specific IgE to Lolium perenne (CAP-RAST ≥ 2). IgE results are
             valid if performed within one year prior to the inclusion of the subject in the study.

          -  Allergic symptoms during the pollen season of Lolium perenne.

          -  Mean of the forearm major diameters of the wheals provoked by histamine
             dihydrochloride (10 mg/ml) ≥ 3 mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Immunotherapy in the past 5 years with an allergen preparation known to interfere with
             the allergen to be tested (e.g., grass group extracts).

          -  Use of drugs that may interfere with the skin reactions (e.g., antihistamines). See
             Appendix 1

          -  Treatment with any of the following medications: tricyclic or tetracyclic
             antidepressants, β-blockers or corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or
             equivalent).

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Dermographism affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

          -  Atopic dermatitis affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

          -  Urticaria affecting the skin area at the test site at either study visit.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last month.
