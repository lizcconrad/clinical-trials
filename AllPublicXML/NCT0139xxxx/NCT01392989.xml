    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (transplant of blood cells from another individual) is a
      treatment option for patients with Myelodysplasia or Myeloproliferative Disorders. During the
      course of this study, we will attempt to learn whether a particular type of blood cell,
      called a Cytokine Induced Killer (CIK) cell may add benefit to allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation. CIK cells are present in small quantities in the bloodstream but their
      numbers can be expanded after a brief period of nurturing in a laboratory.
