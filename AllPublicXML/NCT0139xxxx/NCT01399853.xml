  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness in infants and children caused
      by viruses that belong to the enterovirus genus of the picornavirus family. Although most
      HFMD cases do not result in serious complications, outbreaks of HFMD caused by enterovirus 71
      (EV71) can present with a high rate of neurological complications, including
      meningoencephalitis, pulmonary complications, and can even cause infant death. HFMD caused by
      EV71 has become a major emerging infectious disease in Asia and the highly pathogenic
      potential of EV71 clearly requires the attention of world medical community.

      The phase I study of inactivated vaccine (vero cell) against EV71 has completed last month in
      Jiangsu Province in China. The data from the phase I study suggested that the inactivated
      EV71 vaccine had a clinically acceptable safety and good immunogenicity for healthy Chinese
      children and infants. In order to provide more evidence for the immunogenicity of the
      vaccine, to further explore the probable immunizing dose and the safety profile of this
      vaccine, a phase II clinical trial is planed to conduct.
