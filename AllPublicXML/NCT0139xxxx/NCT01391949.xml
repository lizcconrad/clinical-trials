  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to determine the effect of different levels of feedback on
      participation in a home exercise regimen and the amount of walking performed by patients
      recently discharged from the acute rehabilitation setting.

    <textblock>
      The UCFit (University of California's U Cycle to Fitness) device is a standard commercial arm
      and leg restorator modified to collect pedaling data and to transmit it wirelessly to a
      central database, allowing for remote exercise monitoring. In this study, patients with
      stroke will perform pedaling exercise on the UCFit device prior to and then for a period of
      twelve weeks after discharge to home from inpatient rehabilitation. Differing levels of
      feedback will be provided to study subjects and corresponding changes in the amount of
      pedaling and walking performed will be identified. The results of this study will offer
      insight into the activity levels of disabled persons in their home environments. Furthermore,
      it will help in the identification of strategies that can increase activity levels in the
      critical period after discharge to home.
