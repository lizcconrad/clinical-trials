        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  BMD as measured by DEXA at screening, should range between (-1)to (-2.5) SD from
             normal values.

          -  At least 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea or at least 6 weeks postsurgical

          -  The following washout periods should be before baseline assessments are made for
             subjects previously on estrogen alone or estrogen/progestin containing products:

               1. 8 weeks or longer for any prior use of estrogen and/or progestin products.

               2. 6 months or longer for prior progestin injectable drug therapy.
