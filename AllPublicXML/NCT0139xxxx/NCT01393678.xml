    <textblock>
      The drug in this study is combined product of biphenyl dimethyl dicarboxylate (DDB) and
      garlic oil. This components showed synergistic enhancing effects in previous tests. In phase
      2 test, 6 cap three times a day dosage (2cap T.I.D) is better than other dosage. Based on
      above, this study is phase 3 test to prove efficacy and safety of PENNEL.
