    <textblock>
      The HEPAR study is aimed at determining the safety of radioactive holmium containing
      microspheres for the treatment of tumors in the liver. These microspheres will be
      administered by infusion in the liver artery using a arterial catheter in the femoral artery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting the following criteria may enter the study:

          1. Patients must have given written informed consent.

          2. Female or male aged 18 years and over.

          3. Confirmed histological diagnosis of metastatic malignancy with dominant liver
             metastases without standard therapeutic options for treatment including chemotherapy
             or surgery. Dominant liver metastases are defined (according to the Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) methodology, see Appendix IV) as the
             diameter of all metastases in the liver must be more than 200% of the sum of the
             diameters of all soft tissue lesions outside the liver.

          4. Life expectancy of 12 weeks or longer.

          5. World Health Organisation (WHO) Performance status 0-2 (see Appendix III).

          6. One or more measurable lesions at least 10 mm in the longest diameter by spiral
             Computed Tomography (CT) scan (5 mm slice thickness) according to the RECIST criteria.

          7. Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria cannot enter the study:

          1. Brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless irradiated at least 4 weeks prior
             to the date of the experimental treatment and stable without steroid treatment for at
             least 1 week.

          2. Radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks before the start of study therapy.

          3. The last dose of prior chemotherapy has been received less than 4 weeks prior the
             start of study therapy.

          4. Major surgery within 4 weeks, or incompletely healed surgical incision before starting
             study therapy.

          5. Any unresolved toxicity greater than National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common
             Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE version 3.0, see Appendix II) grade 2
             from previous anti-cancer therapy.

          6. Serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN).

          7. Serum creatinine &gt; 185 µmol/L.

             phosphatase (ALP) &gt; 5 x ULN.

             syndrome, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart disease ≥2 within
             3 months before entry, or presence of cardiac disease that in the opinion of the
             Investigator increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.

         11. Pregnancy or breast feeding (women of child-bearing potential).

         12. Comorbidity with a grave prognosis (estimated survival &lt;3 months) and/or worse then
             the basic disease for which the patients will be included in the study.

         13. Patients with abnormalities of the bile ducts (such as stents) with a increased chance
             of infections of the bile ducts.

         14. Patients suffering from diseases with a increased chance of liver toxicity, such as
             primary biliary cirrhosis or xeroderma pigmentosum.

         15. Patients suffering from psychic disorders that make a comprehensive judgement
             impossible, such as psychosis, hallucinations and/or depression.

         16. Patients who are declared incompetent.

         17. Previous enrolment in the present study or previous treatment with radio-embolisation.

         18. Treated with an investigational agent within 42 days prior to starting study
             treatment.

         19. Female patients who are not using an acceptable method of contraception (oral
             contraceptives, barrier methods, approved contraceptive implant, long-term injectable
             contraception, intrauterine device or tubal ligation) OR are less than 1 year
             postmenopausal or surgically sterile during their participation in this study (from
             the time they sign the consent form) to prevent pregnancy.

         20. Male patients who are not surgically sterile or do not use an acceptable method of
             contraception during their participation in this study (from the time they sign the
             consent form) to prevent pregnancy in a partner.

         21. Evidence of portal hypertension, splenomegaly or ascites.

         22. Body weight over 150 kg.

         23. Active hepatitis (B and/or C).
