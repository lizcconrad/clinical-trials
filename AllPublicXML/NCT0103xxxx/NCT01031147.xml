  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Chinese Cerebral Aneurysms Survey is a continuing prospective study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of unenhanced, three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography
      (3D-TOF-MRA) with volume rendering (VR) at 3-T in the detection of intracranial aneurysms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent years,three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA (3D-TOF-MRA) has become a useful,
      contrast-free method for observing intracranial vessels and is widely utilized as a screening
      examination for intracranial aneurysms. The studies available in Medline show mixed
      results.Some of these studies just included MRI/MRA in the analysis, which have a high rate
      of false-positives and are unreliable, and some were lack of control (ruptured aneurysm),
      precise numbers of false-positive results, standard images process and review, or
      corroborative IADSA in some patients. Furthermore, most previous studies included small
      sample size with aneurysm detection at 0.5-T or 1.5-T MR. Thus, these results have been
      inconclusive because of certain pitfalls in these studies.

      Since 2007, we have conducted a clinical study to objective detection of intracranial
      aneurysms in our routine diagnostic work-up of intracranial aneurysms by our
      neuroradiologists using a standard procedure with 3D-TOF-MRA with VR at 3T. The investigators
      want to establish the quality data to prospectively compare 3D-TOF-MRA with VR at 3T vs
      3D-RDSA in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms in a largest cohort of patients and test
      it accuracy in screening for suspected patients

        We estimated that a sample of 350 patients including 12% dropout rate would be enrolled to
        determine an accuracy of VR 3D-TOF-MRA versus VR RDSA as reference standard with a 95%
        confidence interval of 5% (i.e., a standard error of approximately 2.5 %) above and below
        the expected VR 3D-TOF-MRA accuracy of 95%. A P value of 0.05 was considered to indicate
        statistical significance.
