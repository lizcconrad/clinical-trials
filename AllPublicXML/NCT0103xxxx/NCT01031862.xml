      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of radiolabeled particulate cholesterol
      administered intravenously in association with albumin, as a method to study reverse
      cholesterol transport (RCT) in humans by analyzing changes in the tracer activity in total
      plasma, lipoproteins and feces.

      The study will use 3H-cholesterol bound to albumin (particulate cholesterol) to assess the
      ability of HDL to transport cholesterol to the liver to be eliminated. This process is called
      Reverse Cholesterol transport and is one of the main mechanisms by which HDL protect against
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The availability of a method to assess RCT is
      important for the development of new drugs which affect RCT and may result in useful
      treatments for atherosclerosis.

      This study will evaluate the use of radiolabeled particulate cholesterol administered
      intravenously in association with albumin, as a method to study reverse cholesterol transport
      (RCT) in humans by analyzing changes in the tracer activity in total plasma and lipoproteins.
      The study population is healthy volunteers.
