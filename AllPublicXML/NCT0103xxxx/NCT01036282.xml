      The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of computerized cognitive skills training
      for improving memory and problem-solving skills in inpatients with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are stable inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
      who are receiving atipsychotic medication at Manhattan Psychiatric Center.

      Patients receive baseline assessments (MCCB-MATRICS; Personal and Social Performance Scale,
      FEDT/FEIT and PANSS) and then are assigned to Cognitive Remediation (CRT) using the COGPACK
      program, patients are then randomly assigned to a social cognition program (Mind Reader
      Interactive Guide to Emotions) for a period of 12 weeks. Following 12 weeks of treatment in
      either CRT + Mind Reader or CRT alone, assessments are repeated by raters.

      Cognitive Remediation (CRT): CRT (COGPACK, Marker and Olbrich, 1998) consists of computerized
      practice tests for seven cognitive domains. There are 64 programs for testing and training,
      each with several variants for the domains of visuomotor skills, comprehension, reaction,
      vigilance, memory, language, and intellectual skills. Exercises in COGPACK can be edited and
      expanded. Patients attend 2 (45-minutes each) groups and 1 discussion group.

      Social Cognition Training: Mind Reader (Baron-Cohen et al, 2004) is an interactive
      computerized program of emotions and mental states. It is based on a taxonomic system of 412
      emotions and mental states, grouped into 24 emotion groups, and six developmental levels
      (from age 4 to adulthood). The emotions and mental states are organized systematically,
      according to the emotion groups and developmental levels. Patients assigned to Mind Reader
      attend 1 group per week.

      Both the CRT and Mind Reader are administered in small groups of six to eight patients each.
