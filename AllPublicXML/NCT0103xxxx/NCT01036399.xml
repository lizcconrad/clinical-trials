    <textblock>
      Revlimid is a potent immunomodulatory analogue without the teratogenic effects, which has
      direct anti-tumor effects, anti-angiogenic and both anti-inflammatory and T-cell
      costimulatory properties. Both preclinical and clinical data indicate its efficacy solid
      tumor and multiple myeloma including advanced/refractory stages with its role in enhancing
      host antitumor immunity that provided the rationale to use in patients with PTCL.
