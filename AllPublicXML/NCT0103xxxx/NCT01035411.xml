      This clinical study will aid future formulation development and optimisation of AZD9668
      tablets by evaluating possible effects of minor changes to the formulation and process on the
      rate and extent of absorption.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures

          -  female subjects may be of non-child bearing potential (i.e. post menopausal or
             surgically sterile) or of child bearing potential

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥18.0 and ≤30.0 kg/m2 calculated from height and weight at the
             screening visit; minimum weight 50 kg.

          -  Clinically normal physical and laboratory findings as judged by the investigator,
             including negative test results for drug-of-abuse, alcohol, cotinine and negative test
             results for Hepatitis B surface antigen, antibodies to Hepatitis C virus and
             antibodies to HIV-1/2 at the screening visit

          -  Be a none smoker or ex-smoker who has stopped smoking for &gt;6 months prior to visit 2
             (pre-entry)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant disease or disorder (eg infections/viral disease,
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological,
             musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic, malignant, psychiatric, major physical
             impairment), which in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at
             risk because of participation in the study, or influence the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism and excretion of drugs.

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs,
             clinical chemistry, haematology, urinalysis, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may put the subject at risk because of his/her participation in the
             study

          -  Any ECG abnormality (including cardiac arrhythmia) which in the opinion of the
             investigator may put the subject at risk
