    <textblock>
      The objective of this project was to evaluate a population-based, computerized tailored
      intervention that addresses recommended guidelines for three target behaviors related to
      obesity risk: physical activity (at least 60 minutes on at least 5 days per week), fruit and
      vegetable consumption (at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day), and limited TV
      viewing (2 hours or less of TV each day).

    <description>Students interacted with the 30-minute program through a series of Transtheoretical Model (TTM) based assessments and tailored feedback messages. A full TTM intervention was delivered for physical activity, in which each of the appropriate constructs of the TTM based on stage of change was addressed. Optimally tailored interventions were delivered for fruit and vegetable consumption and limited TV viewing. These interventions offered feedback on the most important TTM constructs based on stage of change for each behavior. Multimedia components, including audio, video, and animations helped to capture students' interest.</description>
