  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to establish the clinical and cost
      effectiveness of an SSRI antidepressant, citalopram, in the management of persistent negative
      symptoms of schizophrenia over a year.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The negative symptoms of schizophrenia represent an important dimension of psychopathology,
      and reflect the absence or diminution of normal behaviours and functions. They include
      deficiencies in emotional responsiveness, drive, and emotional and social engagement.
      Persistent negative symptoms are held to account for much of the long-term morbidity and poor
      functional outcome in patients with established schizophrenia, but if they prove resistant to
      antipsychotic medication there is a very limited evidence base regarding specific treatments.
      The aim of this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to establish the clinical and cost
      effectiveness of an SSRI antidepressant, citalopram, in the management of negative symptoms
      of schizophrenia over a year. The study sample will be adults with a diagnosis of
      schizophrenia, clinically stable for 3 months with a consistent antipsychotic regimen, and
      characterised by persistent negative symptoms to a criterion level of severity.
