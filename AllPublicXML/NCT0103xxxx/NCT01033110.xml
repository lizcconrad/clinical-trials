      Background:

      Despite the well-known benefits of exercise, 64% of the Swiss population do not fulfill the
      public health recommendation of physical activity. A survey of female staff members over 45
      years of age from the University Hospital Zurich at the end of 2003 showed that physical
      inactivity is also prevalent in this population.

      Aim:

      To assess whether inactive women working at a large hospital centre prefer Nordic Walking
      (NW) or a Jogging (J) as a health promotion strategy. (2) To test whether the method chosen
      by the majority improves physical performance, physical activity, body weight and
      composition, and bone mineral density.

      Methods: The investigators will send out a questionnaire to all female staff members at a
      large hospital centre age 45 and older, ask whether they are inactive, and whether they
      prefer Nordic Walking or Jogging as a health promotion strategy. Depending on the preference
      of the majority of the women, the investigators will then ask inactive female staff members
      age 45+ to participate in a 12-months randomized controlled trial comparing training plus
      nutrition education to nutrition education alone. The training will have a 3-month
      building-up phase followed up by an in part unsupervised training of 9 months. All
      participants will receive a lecture on healthy nutrition once a months for 12 months. The
      investigators will assess diet with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline and after 12
      and 24 months.

      The primary endpoint is: physical performance, measured with the 12-minute Coopertest.

      The secondary endpoints are: level of physical activity, body mass index, body composition
      and bone mineral density at the spine and the hip.

      Importance: This project will address the questions which physical activities are preferred
      by inactive women and whether the preferred training improves physical performance, physical
      activity, body mass index, body composition and bone mineral density. In addition, our study
      will explore whether those women who changed their diet in addition to being randomized to
      the training group have an enhanced benefit.
