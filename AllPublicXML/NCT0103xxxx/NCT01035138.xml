  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the original study was to assess the safety of semagacestat in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients during 24 months of open-label treatment. Baseline for the
      efficacy measures is defined as the baseline for feeder studies LFAN (NCT00594568) and LFBC
      (NCT00762411). For all safety analyses (adverse events), baseline for patients will be week 0
      of this study (LFBF).

      Preliminary results from LFAN and LFBC showed semagacestat did not slow disease progression
      and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to
      perform activities of daily living. Study drug was stopped in all studies. Studies LFAN, LFBC
      and LFBF have been amended to continue collecting safety data, including cognitive scores,
      for at least seven months. The CT-Registry will reflect results of analyses from the original
      protocol in addition to those from the amended protocol. Very few participants from LFBC
      rolled over into LFBF (N = 9). Due to insufficient sample size, the data for LFBC
      participants who rolled into LFBF were not analyzed.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14) at Week 16 After Cessation of Study Drug</title>
        <description>The ADAS-Cog14 is the ADAS-Cog11 augmented with delayed free recall, digit cancellation, and maze completion measures. A score of 0 to 10 for delayed free recall and a conversion code of 0 to 5 for digit cancellation and maze completion provide total score ranges for this extended ADAS-Cog14 of 0 to 90. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity.</description>

        <description>The CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. The participant's cognitive status is rated in 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. A severity score is assigned for each of the 6 domains with total score ranging from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Least Square (LS) Mean value was controlled for baseline value, age, investigator, and concomitant standard of care (SOC) medication.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Resource Utilization in Dementia-Lite Questionnaire (RUD-Lite) at Week 12</title>
        <description>RUD-Lite assesses the healthcare resource utilization of participants and their caregivers to determine the level of formal and informal care attributable to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Information on both caregivers (caregiving time, work status) and participants (accommodation and healthcare resource utilization) is collected from the baseline and follow-up interviews. Reported the change in number of hospitalizations per participant to week 12.</description>
