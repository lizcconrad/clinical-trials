  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be consented and screened within 2 to 6 months of the index ACS. Patients who
      have elevated depression (BDI&gt;=15 or BDI&gt;=10 assessed twice over two week period) and who
      continue to meet all of the trial's eligibility criteria will be consented. Through informed
      consent, both arms of the trial will be described with equipoise as to these approaches to
      postACS depression care. Patients who consent to randomization will be enrolled in the
      treatment trial.

      The intervention phase will be 6 months, and hence the final outcome assessments will be
      performed approximately 9 months after the index ACS. Interim measures of depression will be
      obtained at 2 and 4 months post-enrollment. Major adverse cardiac events and all-cause
      mortality will also be ascertained at 6 months post-enrollment. Quality assurance by an
      independent medical event adjudication committee using prospective guidelines will be
      employed.

    <description>Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). This 21-question, multiple choice self-report instrument includes items pertaining to symptoms of depression, including hopelessness and irritability, physical symptoms such as fatigue, and thoughts such as guilt. Each item has at a set of four possible responses, ranging in intensity for least intense to most intense. The total score is calculated by adding the responses to each item. Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The total score on the scale ranges from 0 to 63. Total scores on the scale of less 10 indicate minimal depression; total scores between 10 and 15 indicate mild depression; and total scores greater than 16 indicate a probable clinical diagnosis of depression.</description>

    <description>Immediately after the initial post-ACS screening, the participant's physician will be notified in writing if the participant is depressed according to the BDI. Depending upon the physician's own evaluation of the participant, he or she may elect to defer depression treatment, initiate it, or to refer the patient to a mental health specialist.</description>

    <description>Stepped Care participants will be given a description of the choices available in this arm, including choosing antidepressant medication and/or telephone-based, Problem-Solving Therapy (PST). If the patient is randomized to Stepped Care, their physician will be informed that depression treatment is being provided by the trial. Patients will select their preferred treatment approach. Depression symptoms will be monitored to determine whether the patient is improving relative to his/her baseline score. Relapse monitoring and maintenance therapy will continue for the duration of the study.</description>

    <description>Problem Solving Therapy (PST) will be administered by a trained provider. The concepts of PST will be taught to the participant in the first session and reinforced across subsequent sessions. Sessions will last between 30 and 60 minutes each and continue weekly for the duration of the study (6 months).</description>

    <description>Antidepressants should be started at the lowest dose, but should be adjusted upward to be within the therapeutic range within 1 week,with further adjustment higher in the therapeutic range possible at 3-4 weeks. Dosage of the first medication selected will be in the therapeutic range by 3 weeks of the initial step, as tolerated. If a patient cannot tolerate a particular treatment (i.e., intolerable side effects even with careful titration and clinical management), a switch to an alternative antidepressant or PST-PC after 2-4 weeks and 'restart' step 1.

        <title>Depressive Symptom Reduction</title>
        <description>Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). This 21-question, multiple choice self-report instrument includes items pertaining to symptoms of depression, including hopelessness and irritability, physical symptoms such as fatigue, and thoughts such as guilt. Each item has at a set of four possible responses, ranging in intensity for least intense to most intense. The total score is calculated by adding the responses to each item. Higher scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The total score on the scale ranges from 0 to 63. Total scores on the scale of less 10 indicate minimal depression; total scores between 10 and 15 indicate mild depression; and total scores greater than 16 indicate a probable clinical diagnosis of depression.</description>
