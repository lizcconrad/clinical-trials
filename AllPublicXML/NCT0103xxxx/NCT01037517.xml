  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors needed to support autologous transplantation
      is a serious clinical problem. We are investigating the role of plerixafor administered in an
      at risk population to augment successful stem cell collection.

      OBJECTIVES

      To determine if plerixafor when administered on the day prior to planned autologous
      collection on first mobilization attempt in those with a peripheral blood CD34 ≤ 10X106/L
      will:

        -  increase the number of patients successfully collected in one day

        -  increase the number of patients successfully mobilized on first collection attempt

        -  is cost neutral within a Canadian setting
