    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial was to assess the bioequivalence for two concentrations
      (5.83 mg/mL and 8 mg/mL) of the new r-hGH liquid multidose formulation using the r hGH
      freeze-dried multidose formulation (Saizen® 8 mg, 8.8 mg/1.51 mL) as reference.

      Each volunteer received three r hGH treatments, with each treatment being administered as a
      single subcutaneous dose of 4 mg r-hGH in a randomized sequence with at least one week of
      wash-out period between successive treatments.
