  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48 week randomized, prospective, controlled, open-label, proof-of-concept pilot
      clinical trial.

      Patients with HIV-1 infection on HAART PI-based regimen will be randomized to switch from the
      PI to etravirine (400 mg dissolved in water every 24 hours) or to continue with the same
      approach.

      The aim of the study is to compare the virological efficacy of the etravirine-based regimen
      with standard PI-containing regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Etravirine is a second generation non-nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor
      (NNRTI) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2008 and by the
      European Medicines Agency in September 2008 for clinical use in adults with incomplete
      virologic suppression and resistance to previous NNRTI and other antiretroviral classes.

      A question that has not been explored is whether subjects with sustained undetectable HIV-1
      RNA-levels experiencing antiretroviral-related toxicity can safely switch their current PI to
      etravirine. This treatment strategy could allow improvements in tolerability and lipid
      profile and would permit an easy posology (400 mg dissolved in water every 24 hours). We
      designed a proof-of-concept study to test the efficacy and safety of switching from a
      Protease Inhibitor (PI) to etravirine in subjects with viral suppression as an antiretroviral
      strategy of simplification therapy, based on the high antiviral potency, low toxicity,
      together with its easy posology (in water dissolution).

      Patients with HIV-1 infection on HAART PI-based regimen will be randomized to switch from the
      PI to etravirine (400 mg dissolved in water every 24 hours) or to continue with the same
      approach.

      The primary endpoint would be the percentage of patients who maintain virological suppression
      at week 48.

          1. Adult patient having a diagnosis of HIV-1 infection.

          2. Antiretroviral therapy started at least 12 months before, always with a HAART
             combination including 2 NRTIs plus a PI.

          3. Maintained undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA (VL &lt; 50 copies/mL) since the beginning of
             antiretroviral therapy, for at least 6 months.

          4. Absence of suspected or documented resistance mutations in the RT associated to NNRTIs
             or to any NRTI.

          5. Patient having at least one of the following conditions:

               -  Dyslipemia (LDL cholesterol &gt;130 mg/dL or triglycerides &gt; 350 mg/dL) derived from
                  their current PI regimen or current use of lipid-lowering agents due to
                  dyslipemia,

               -  Antiretroviral-related gastrointestinal disturbances, or

               -  Low patient's satisfaction associated with the current regimen posology (BID
                  regimen, ritonavir use, ritonavir intoleranceâ€¦).

          6. Good treatment adherence.

          7. Voluntary written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous therapy with mono or dual antiretroviral therapies after initial of HAART
             era.

          2. Previous antiretroviral treatment failures, treatment interruptions (A) or blips (B)
             in viral load (VL &gt; 50 copies/mL).

          3. Acute infections or uncontrolled chronic infection in the 2 months previous to the
             inclusion.

          4. Pregnancy or fertile women willing to be pregnant.

          5. Clinically significant malabsorption syndrome within 30 days prior to randomization.

        (A) Patients who in the past made any interruption of treatment (provide that it has not
        been in the last year) may be considered candidates for the study, if they meet other
        criteria for inclusion, since the break in the treatment should not assume the emergence of
        mutations.

        (B) Small blips that are preceded or forwarded by 2 undetectable viral loads will not be
        taken in care.
