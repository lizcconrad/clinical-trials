    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the biological activity of elacytarabine in
      combination with idarubicin in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia who has failed the first
      course of a remission-induction treatment with cytarabine (ara-C). In addition, the
      correlation between hENT1 (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1) and overall survival
      will be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elacytarabine (CP-4055) is a pro-drug of ara-C currently used in the treatment of patients
      with acute myeloid leukaemia. Patients with nucleoside transporter deficiency (hENT1) seem to
      have less benefit from cytarabine compared to those with a high expression of the
      transporter. Preclinical studies indicate that elacytarabine is independent of this
      transporter. Therefore, patients with low expression of hENT1 and treated with elacytarabine
      are anticipated to have a better outcome compared to patients treated with ara-C. The main
      objective of this study is to assess the biological activity of elacytarabine in combination
      with idarubicin in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. In addition, the correlation
      between hENT1 (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1) and overall survival will be
      studied. Patients will be treated with elacytarabine plus idarubicin independent of their
      hENT1 status. Determination of the patients' hENT1 expression level will be done
      retrospectively. This study will also explore the safety profile of elacytarabine in
      combination with idarubicin.

    <description>Elacytarabine 1000 mg/m2/d will be administered as a continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) in a d 1-5 q3w cycle.
Idarubicin will be administered IV at a fixed dose of 12 mg/ m2/d IV on d 1-3 q3w.
It is intended that patients receive remission-induction treatment either as two combination courses, elacytarabine 1000 mg/m2/d + idarubicin 12 mg/m2/d or one combination course, elacytarabine 1000 mg/m2/d + idarubicin 12 mg/m2/d followed by one course elacytarabine 2000 mg/m2/d single therapy.</description>

             means documented residual disease (i.e. circulating blasts, persistent chloromas,
             other evident disease from day 12 on).
