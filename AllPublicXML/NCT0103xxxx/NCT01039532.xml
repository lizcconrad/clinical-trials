      It is a proven fact that Basal Bolus insulin regimen is the near- physiological regimen &amp;
      Thrice daily Biphasic Insulin Aspart is a comparable alternative for glycemic control in type
      2 diabetes mellitus patients. In this study the investigators evaluated whether Biphasic
      Human Insulin can be used in a thrice daily regimen in place of BIAsp.

      As the regimen is less expensive and one prick less than the basal-bolus regimen, it can be a
      good alternative for a diabetics in India.

      This is a 12 week Open labelled parallel-Randomised controlled pilot study - 50 patients with
      type 2 Diabetes mellitus was selected after satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria's
      .Metformin and pioglitazone were continued and they are randomised into 2 groups at base line
      and was allotted into any of the two regimens.

        1. Basal detemir + bolus aspart or

        2. Thrice Daily Biphasic Human Insulin Regimen.

      The two regimens were compared by the following variables:

      Primary endpoint:

      Glycaemic control

      Secondary endpoint:

      Weight gain, Hypoglycaemic episodes, Adverse effects and Cost effectiveness
