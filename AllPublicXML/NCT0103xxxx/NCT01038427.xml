    <textblock>
      This study will compare the safety and efficacy of a generic mometasone nasal spray to the
      reference listed drug in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Additionally both the
      test and the reference formulations will be tested for superiority against a placebo nasal
      spray.
