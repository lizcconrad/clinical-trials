    <textblock>
      Resistance to antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel) is a recognized phenomenon with a
      prevalence from 17% to 35%. Resistance as detected by in vitro tests such as Multiple
      Electrode Aggregometry (MEA) has been shown to predict clinical therapy failure. Resistance
      can be caused by clinical, cellular and pharmacogenetic factors. Non compliance is suspected
      to be an important contributing factor. In this study, compliance will be assured with an
      electronical compliance monitoring system. Factors to non response will be identified to find
      plausible explanations when in vitro platelet aggregation inhibition is insufficient despite
      assured compliance. This study will help to disclose the relationship between compliance,
      biomarker and clinical outcome as well as to quantify the impact of non compliance to the
      resistance phenomenon as measured by MEA.
