      RATIONALE: PD 0332991 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well PD 0332991 works in
      treating patients with refractory solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rates following treatment with PD 0332991 in the following
      malignancies: 1) Metastatic breast cancer, 2) Metastatic colorectal cancer, 3) Metastatic
      melanoma with CDK4 mutation or amplification, or 4) Cisplatin-refractory, unresectable germ
      cell tumors.

      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PD 0332991 administered to subjects with
      refractory solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of PD0332991 on tumor and non-tumor tissue.

      II. To investigate the relationship between selected biomarkers, PK and/or efficacy and
      safety outcomes.

      III. To estimate the population pharmacokinetic for PD 0332991 and to correlate PK with
      efficacy outcomes.

      IV: To perform a Phase II evaluation of PD 0332991 in a population defined as potential
      responders on the basis of CCND1 gene amplification.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral PD 0332991 once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      up to 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

        esophageal and/or gastric cancer (15-30 enrollment slots) D. Cisplatin-refractory,
        unresectable germ cell tumors (15-30 enrollment slots) E. Any tumor type if tissue tests
        positive for CCND1 amplification, CDK4/6 mutation, CCND2 amplification OR any other
        functional alteration at the G1/S checkpoint. (15-30 enrollment slots)

        - Biopsy Requirements: For Subjects with accessible disease amenable to biopsy: A biopsy
        will be obtained pre-treatment and in during cycle 1 (while patient is receiving drug) for
        molecular markers of the cell cycle, and its inhibition.

          -  Subjects will be &gt; 18 years old

          -  The subject has disease that is assessable by tumor marker, physical, or radiologic
             means.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
             or 1.

          -  The subject has adequate organ function, defined as follows A. Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the
             upper limit of normal (ULN) B. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL or calculated creatinine
             clearance ≥ 60 mL/min, and C. For subjects without liver metastases: alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN D. For
             subjects with liver metastases: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
             aminotransferase ≤ 5 x ULN

          -  All tumors must test positive for Rb expression except:

        A. ER positive metastatic breast tumors (data now shows all to be Rb positive.) B. Any
        tumor type if tissue tests positive for CCND1 amplification, CDK4/6 mutation, CCND2
        amplification OR any other functional alteration at the G1/S checkpoint.

        - The subject has adequate marrow function, defined as follows: A. Absolute neutrophil
        count (ANC) &gt;1500/mm3 B. Platelets &gt;100,000/mm3, and C. Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL

          -  The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements

             alopecia.

          -  The subject has untreated or uncontrolled brain metastases or evidence of

             s/he may be eligible if all other eligibility criteria are met

          -  The subject has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to:

               1. ongoing or active infection

               2. diabetes mellitus

               3. hypertension

               4. symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, stroke or
                  myocardial infarction within 3 months

          -  The subject has a baseline corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 ms.

          -  The subject is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  The subject is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Note:

        baseline HIV screening is not required
