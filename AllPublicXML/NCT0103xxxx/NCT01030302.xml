      The purpose of this study is to monitor such factors as a past history, a previous history of
      drug use, the degree of response to initial treatment, the frequency of previous therapies,
      age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, which is used by doctors
      and researchers to assess how a patient's disease is progressing, assess how the disease
      affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate treatment and
      prognosis, before the bortezomib re-treatment, the concomitant drugs that are used for
      re-treatment and the pattern of treatment in patients with multiple myeloma who were
      re-treated with injectable bortezomib.

      It will be essential to obtain the Korean clinical data about the efficacy and safety of the
      re-treatment with bortezomib as well as to analyze its actual pattern. The current trial is a
      prospective, multi-center, Phase 4, observational study that will be conducted to collect
      such demographic data as a past history, a previous history of drug use, the degree of
      responses to initial treatment, the frequency of previous therapies, age, Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, the concomitant drugs that are used for
      re-treatment and the pattern of treatment for patients with multiple myeloma and who were
      re-treated with injectable bortezomib. Also safety data will be collected. Observational
      Study -No investigational drug administered
