  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the project is a test-of-concept of an intervention to reduce the effects of
      the perception of discrimination on the care of patients with chronic illness. Perception of
      discrimination manifests itself as stereotype threat. We hypothesize that stereotype threat
      impairs communication between minority patients and their physicians because of increased
      stress and diminished trust, resulting in interactions that are less successful at enhancing
      patient self-efficacy, in turn resulting in lower rates of adherence with anti-hypertensive
      medication.

      The intervention is a self-affirmation exercise performed prior to a patient-physician visit.
      A similar intervention has been shown to reduce the racial gap in academic performance in
      middle school classrooms.

      We will explore the mechanistic effects of the intervention by analysis of audiotapes of
      patient-provider visits following the intervention. We will measure the effect of the
      intervention on minority hypertensive patients' adherence with antihypertensive medication
      and blood pressure.

      We will enroll 200 African American and Latino patients with hypertension and randomize 100
      patients to perform the exercise and 100 patients to perform a null control exercise before
      the visit. We will assess change in patient's adherence with antihypertensive medications and
      in blood pressure over the six months following the index visit. In order to better
      understand the effects of the intervention we will measure subject's mood following the
      exercise, and self-reported stress levels, trust in the physician, and medication
      self-efficacy following the visit. We will also assess the quality of the patient-provider
      interaction from detailed analysis of audiotapes and from patient questionnaires. Following a
      subsequent patient-physician visit, we will conduct telephone interviews with patients to
      assess for persistence of any effects of the intervention.
