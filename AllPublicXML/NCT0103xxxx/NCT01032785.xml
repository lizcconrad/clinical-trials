  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the foramen ovale closes in most infants during the first 6 months of life,
      however, most of the important papers in the field concentrated on observing infants with
      murmurs and following those with patent foramen ovale by echocardiography until 6-24 months.
      The purpose of this study is to observe the natural profile of closure of the foramen ovale
      and ductus arteriosus for the first 36 hours after birth. This understanding may help to
      avoid unnecessary treatment and exams for newborns with findings that are natural for their
      stage of development.

      We will observe the patency and size of foramen ovale five times within the first 36 hours of
      life. We will also describe the anatomy of the foramen ovale and the septum primum during
      this time. The direction of flow across the foramen ovale will also be observed. Other
      cardiac lesions will be checked for as well. We will measure the change in size of the
      pulmonary arteries and the closure of the ductus arteriosus.
