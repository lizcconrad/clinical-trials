      This study will determine if one week inpatient SMP can reduce FM symptoms and increase
      patients self-efficacy, health status, quality of life and being active health consumers.

      The one-week SMP is designed to help people manage their rheumatic disease and challenges in
      daily life. The program has the same core concepts as outpatient programmes and comprises
      information, discussions on how to cope with the disease and daily life, cognitive management
      skills, exercise, engagement in self-care and interactions with healthcare professionals.
      During the program, the inpatient education unit takes up to 16 patients and 5 relatives per
      week within one diagnostic group. Each educational session lasts for 1.5-2.5 hours and the
      physical activity sessions for 0.5-1 hour. In the evening group sessions, the patients are
      divided into small groups of approximately five participants. They talk together for one hour
      under leadership of one health professional who is educated in coaching. The focus is on
      coping with the disease and daily life.

      For the intervention group there will be a one year follow up study.
