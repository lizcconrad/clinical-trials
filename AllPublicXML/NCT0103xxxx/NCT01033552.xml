  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single institution, phase II study in patients with epidermolysis
      bullosa (EB). The underlying hypothesis is that the infusion of bone marrow or umbilical cord
      blood from a healthy unaffected donor will correct the collagen, laminin, integrin, or plakin
      deficiency and reduce the skin fragility characteristic of severe forms of EB. A secondary
      hypothesis is that mesenchymal stem cells from a healthy donor will enhance the safety and
      efficacy of the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant as well as serve as a source of
      renewable cells for the treatment of focal areas of residual blistering.

      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the event-free survival rate by 1 year
      post-transplant with an event defined as a death or failure to have a demonstrable increase
      in collagen, laminin, integrin, keratin or plakin deposition by 1 year post-transplant or
      other biochemical, structural or physical measure of improvement.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to i) determine the incidence of
      transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 180 days; ii) describe the pattern of biochemical
      improvement as measured by an increase in protein expression (collagen, laminin, integrin,
      keratin or plakin) and related structural and physical changes; iii) describe health quality
      of life at day 365 and 730 as compared to pretreatment results; iv) describe the pattern and
      durability of HSC and third party MSC engraftment in the skin; v) determine the probability
      of survival at 1 year.

      Patients with severe epidermolysis bullosa will be screened to meet the eligibility
      requirements, related or unrelated donor marrow or UCB will be infused, and subjects will be
      followed for a minimum of 5 years after stem cell transplant. A target accrual of 75 subjects
      over 5 years will be recruited to the study.
