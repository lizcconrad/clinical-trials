      This study, PRISMS-15 is a single visit, exploratory pharmacogenetic trial and long-term
      follow-up of the PRISMS (Prevention of Relapses and Disability by Interferon beta-1a
      Subcutaneously in Multiple Sclerosis) trial.

      The aim of this trial is to provide additional data on the driving factors of IFN beta
      response and the long-term outcomes of RebifÂ® treatment.

      This is a Phase IV trial involving subjects who previously participated in the PRISMS trial.
      To address the trial objectives, a single visit will be performed, at least 3 months after
      the onset of the last relapse.
