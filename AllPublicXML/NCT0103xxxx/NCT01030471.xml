  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an unmet treatment need for depressed adolescents with type 1 diabetes. To address
      this unmet need, we have designed a new, family-based, cognitive-behavioral intervention to
      reduce depressive symptoms, improve family functioning, and improve medication compliance.
      The intervention is delivered in two phases (1 - reduction of depressive symptoms and family
      conflict, 2 - adherence promotion) as efforts to improve adherence will have a greater
      likelihood of success if individual and family functioning variables are addressed first. To
      test the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing depressive symptoms and improving
      adherence, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing this new intervention to
      usual care in a sample of fifty-two adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their primary
      caregivers. Given the absence of this type of intervention and the significance of the
      problem, this study is timely and important, as it has the potential to positively impact
      diabetes-specific health outcomes.
