  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory mixed-methods research study that compares an efficacious behavioral
      HIV-prevention intervention (3MV) alone to the behavioral HIV-prevention intervention
      combined with a biomedical intervention (PrEP). After completing the 3MV behavioral
      intervention, participants will be randomly assigned to one of three study arms: 1) daily
      FTC/TDF as PrEP, 2) placebo pill control, or 3) &quot;no pill&quot; control. Behavioral and biomedical
      data will be collected at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter for 24 weeks. Youth who
      decline to participate will be asked to complete a brief survey about their opinions on PrEP.
      Qualitative interviews will be completed with six study participants and the study
      coordinators at the end of the trial to explore further the issues of trial acceptability and
      feasibility. Finally, focus groups will be conducted to explore feasibility and acceptability
      issues with YMSM who meet all eligibility requirements of the study except for not being age
      18 or older, but are at least 16 years of age.

    <measure>Number of Missed Doses Based on Self-Report Calendar Data-Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Missed doses were calculated as the number of days between the date that subject came in for their current visit and the last date the subject was dispensed medication minus the total number of days the subject records having taken their medication in the last 31 days based on self-report calendar data. Since each subject is given a 30 day supply of medication at each visit, any days after 30 days are assumed to be missed medication days and are included in the total. Participants were taking only one dose per day and thus, the number of missed doses is the same as the number of missed medication days.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This research was conducted at two clinical sites in Chicago. Accrual was open between August 2009 and May 2011.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Young males were approached for screening in the community. If eligible, a clinic-based screening was done to confirm eligibility. If confirmed, participants attended a behavioral intervention. Then a week 0 was scheduled for randomization. 68 participants were enrolled; 10 discontinued prior to randomization, for a total of 58 participants.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Missed Doses Based on Self-Report Calendar Data-Week 4</title>
        <description>Missed doses were calculated as the number of days between the date that subject came in for their current visit and the last date the subject was dispensed medication minus the total number of days the subject records having taken their medication in the last 31 days based on self-report calendar data. Since each subject is given a 30 day supply of medication at each visit, any days after 30 days are assumed to be missed medication days and are included in the total. Participants were taking only one dose per day and thus, the number of missed doses is the same as the number of missed medication days.</description>

        <title>Number of Missed Doses Based on Self-Report Calendar Data-Week 8</title>
        <description>Missed doses were calculated as the number of days between the date that subject came in for their current visit and the last date the subject was dispensed medication minus the total number of days the subject records having taken their medication in the last 31 days based on self-report calendar data. Since each subject is given a 30 day supply of medication at each visit, any days after 30 days are assumed to be missed medication days and are included in the total. Participants were taking only one dose per day and thus, the number of missed doses is the same as the number of missed medication days.</description>
