    <textblock>
      MEK113583 is a Phase II open-label, multi-site study to investigate the objective response
      rate, safety, and pharmacokinetics of GSK1120212 in subjects with BRAF mutation-positive
      melanoma who were previously treated with or without a BRAF inhibitor. GSK1120212 is a potent
      and highly selective inhibitor of MEK activation and kinase activity.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Best Confirmed Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until the time of the first documented evidence of a confirmed complete response or partial response (up to approximately 25 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Best confirmed response was assessed by the Investigator per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Best response was measured either as a complete response (CR), defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and pathological lymph nodes &lt;10 millimeters (mm), or a partial response (PR), defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. To be assigned a status of confirmed CR or PR, a confirmatory disease assessment was required no less than 28 days after the criteria for response were first met.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Best Confirmed Response in the Indicated Subgroups of Participants Previously Treated With Standard Therapy But Not BRAF Inhibitors</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until the time of the first documented evidence of a confirmed CR or PR (up to approximately 25 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants with best confirmed response was analyzed for the following subgroups of participants previously treated with standard therapy but not BRAF inhibitors: (1) participants with prior (before the start of this study) brain metastases (mets); (2) participants without prior brain mets; (3) participants with BRAF mutation V600E; (4) participants with BRAF mutation V600E and no prior brain mets; and (5) participants with BRAF mutation V600K. Objective response was assessed per RECIST version 1.1. Objective response was measured either as CR, defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and pathological lymph nodes &lt;10 mm, or PR, defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions. To be assigned a status of confirmed CR or PR, a confirmatory disease assessment was required no less than 28 days after the criteria for response were first met. Brain metastasis is a cancer that has spread to the brain from another location of the body.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Best Unconfirmed Response at the Time of the Interim Analysis (Week 8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>An interim analysis was performed using data collected approximately 12 and 13 weeks after the 30th participant was enrolled in the prior BRAF inhibitor and prior standard therapy groups, respectively. The best unconfirmed response by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 was assessed. The study design permitted stopping the study for futility if &lt;3 best confirmed responses were observed in the first 30 participants of each treatment arm after completing the first post-dose assessment at Week 8. Best response was measured as either a CR, defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and pathological lymph nodes &lt;10 millimeters, or a PR, defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Plasma Concentrations</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15, pre-dose, 0.5-2 hours (hrs) post-dose, 2-4 hrs post-dose, and 4-8 hrs post-dose; Week 4, pre-dose; Week 8, pre-dose; Week 12, pre-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Human plasma samples were analyzed for trametinib using a validated analytical method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of the first dose of study medication until 28 days after the last dose (up to 477 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered to be related to the medicinal product. AE and serious AE (SAE) data were collected from the start of the investigational product and continued until the End of Treatment Visit. Refer to the general Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>From the time of the first documented evidence of a confirmed CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause (up to approximately 40 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of tumor response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a CR or PR to disease progression (at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the appearance of a new lesion) or death due to any cause. No participants who were previously treated with BRAF inhibitors had a CR, defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and pathological lymph nodes &lt;10 millimeters, or a PR, defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions; thus, no duration of response data can be presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until the time of disease progression or death due to any cause (up to approximately 57 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the interval between the treatment start date and the earliest date of disease progression (at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the appearance of a new lesion) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Participants who had not progressed or died were censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment at the time of the cut-off.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PFS in the Indicated Subgroups of Participants Previously Treated With Standard Therapy But Not BRAF Inhibitors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until the time of disease progression or death due to any cause (up to approximately 57 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was analyzed for the following subgroups of participants previously treated with standard therapy but not BRAF inhibitors: (1) participants with prior (before the start of this study) brain metastases (mets); (2) participants without prior brain mets; (3) participants with BRAF mutation V600E; (4) participants with BRAF mutation V600E and no prior brain mets; and (5) participants with BRAF mutation V600K. Per RECIST version 1.1, PFS is defined as the interval between the treatment start date and the earliest date of disease progression (at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the appearance of a new lesion) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earliest. Brain metastasis is a cancer that has spread to the brain from another location of the body.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until death due to any cause (up to 134 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the treatment start date until death due to any cause. Participants who had not died were censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment at the time of the cut-off.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Survived Until 6 Months, 12 Months and 24 Months From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6, Month 12 and Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (defined as the time from the treatment start date until death due to any cause) data data are presented as the number of participants who were alive 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after Baseline. Participants who had not died were censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment at the time of the cut-off.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Tumor Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) until tumor progression (up to approximately 57 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor progression was assessed as disease progression (DP), defined as at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (representative of all involved organs), taking as reference the smallest sum on study; unequivocal progression of non-target lesions; or the appearance of a new lesion. Because melanoma often progresses to the brain/central nervous system (CNS) and this study enrolled approximately 20% participants with prior brain metastases, tumor progression in the brain/CNS was summarized. Paticipants could have been included in more than one category.</description>

          <title>Trametinib 2 mg: Prior BRAF Inhibitors</title>
          <description>Participants who were previously treated (before the start of this study) with BRAF inhibitors received trametinib (GSK1120212) 2 milligram (mg) tablets orally once daily (qd) until treatment discontinuation criteria were met. Per the pre-specified study design, enrollment could have been stopped if objective response was observed in fewer than 3 participants among the first 30 participants enrolled. Per this criterion, enrollment in this cohort was stopped because, after enrollment of the first 30 participants, no objective responses were observed. Eligible participants who had been consented at the time the 30th participant was dosed were allowed to enroll, leading to overenrollment of 10 participants (total of 40 participants in this cohort). An interim analysis was performed after 30 participants had completed the first target post-dose disease assessment at 8 weeks.</description>

          <description>Participants who were previously treated with standard therapy, but not with BRAF inhibitors, received trametinib 2 mg tablets orally qd until treatment discontinuation criteria were met. Per the pre-specified study design, enrollment could have been stopped if objective response was observed in fewer than 3 participants among the first 30 participants enrolled. Per this criterion, 55 participants were enrolled in this cohort because objective responses occurred in 6 participants at the time of the interim analysis. Eligible participants who had been consented at the time the 55th participant was dosed were allowed to enroll. This led to the overenrollment of 2 participants (total of 57 participants in this cohort).

Per the pre-specified study design, enrollment could have been stopped if objective response was observed in fewer than 3 participants among the first 30 participants enrolled. Per this criterion, enrollment in this cohort was stopped because, after enrollment of the first 30 participants, no objective responses were observed. Eligible participants who had been consented at the time the 30th participant was dosed were allowed to enroll, leading to overenrollment of 10 participants (total of 40 participants in this cohort).

        <title>Number of Participants With Best Unconfirmed Response at the Time of the Interim Analysis (Week 8)</title>
        <description>An interim analysis was performed using data collected approximately 12 and 13 weeks after the 30th participant was enrolled in the prior BRAF inhibitor and prior standard therapy groups, respectively. The best unconfirmed response by the investigator per RECIST version 1.1 was assessed. The study design permitted stopping the study for futility if &lt;3 best confirmed responses were observed in the first 30 participants of each treatment arm after completing the first post-dose assessment at Week 8. Best response was measured as either a CR, defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and pathological lymph nodes &lt;10 millimeters, or a PR, defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions.</description>

        <description>Duration of tumor response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of a CR or PR to disease progression (at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study; unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, or the appearance of a new lesion) or death due to any cause. No participants who were previously treated with BRAF inhibitors had a CR, defined as the disappearance of all target lesions and pathological lymph nodes &lt;10 millimeters, or a PR, defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions; thus, no duration of response data can be presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Tumor Progression</title>
        <description>Tumor progression was assessed as disease progression (DP), defined as at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (representative of all involved organs), taking as reference the smallest sum on study; unequivocal progression of non-target lesions; or the appearance of a new lesion. Because melanoma often progresses to the brain/central nervous system (CNS) and this study enrolled approximately 20% participants with prior brain metastases, tumor progression in the brain/CNS was summarized. Paticipants could have been included in more than one category.</description>

            <description>Participants who were previously treated (before the start of this study) with BRAF inhibitors received trametinib 2 milligram (mg) tablets orally once daily (qd) until treatment discontinuation criteria were met. Per the pre-specified study design, enrollment could have been stopped if objective response was observed in fewer than 3 participants among the first 30 participants enrolled. Per this criterion, enrollment in this cohort was stopped because, after enrollment of the first 30 participants, no objective responses were observed. Eligible participants who had been consented at the time the 30th participant was dosed were allowed to enroll, leading to overenrollment of 10 participants (total of 40 participants in this cohort).

Per this criterion, 55 participants were enrolled in this cohort because objective responses occurred in 6 participants at the time of the interim analysis.
