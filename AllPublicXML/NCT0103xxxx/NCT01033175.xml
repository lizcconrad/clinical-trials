      Hypothesis:

      The first part of the study is a survey on the prevalence of anemia of chronic disease (ACD)
      among COPD patients. The 2nd and 3rd part will test 2 null hypotheses (Ho): 1.serum
      inflammatory markers and plasma erythropoietin do not differ between COPD patients with and
      without ACD and 2. exercise capacity does not differ between COPD patients with and without
      ACD.

      Rationale-Aim:

      ACD is an immune driven disorder, developing in subjects suffering from chronic inflammatory
      diseases. COPD is a disorder very likely to be associated to ACD due to its systemic
      inflammatory dimension. Currently, data on the prevalence of ACD and on the level of
      inflammatory markers which are implicated in the pathogenesis of ACD in COPD subjects are
      limited and controversial. Furthermore, there is no data on the effect of ACD on exercise
      capacity of COPD subjects.

      Based to the aforementioned, this study has three goals:

        1. to determine the prevalence and the epidemiologic characteristics of ACD in a population
           of clinical stable COPD patients

        2. to investigate whether the levels of serum inflammatory markers and of plasma
           erythropoietin differ between COPD patients with ACD and without ACD

        3. to determine potential differences regarding the aerobic exercise capacity between these
           two groups, using the cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).

    <description>In the 1st part of this clinical study the prevalence ACD in COPD subjects will be estimated in a consecutive population of COPD subjects who will visit the hospital's pulmonary clinics as outpatients. During the first visit, subjects will give a detailed medical history and will undergo clinical examination and pulmonary function testing 15 minutes post-bronchodilation. Eligible patients will then undergo peripheral venous blood analysis. The first 30 COPD subjects from the population described above, fulfilling the criteria of ACD will constitute the first arm (group of &quot;cases&quot;).ACD is defined by low Hb levels (men: &lt;13 mg/dl, women: &lt;12 mg/dl), no other cause of anemia present, normal or increased serum ferritin and decreased total iron binding capacity.</description>

    <intervention_name>maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing</intervention_name>
    <description>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) will be performed on a cyclic ergometer with continuous monitoring of a 12-lead electrocardiogram, heart rate and blood pressure. While breathing with a mask, the patients will perform a ramp protocol which includes 2-minutes free pedaling and progressive increase of power by 10, 15 or 20 watts/minute; power size will be selected after considering the patient' s daily activity and parameters of pulmonary function. CPET will be performed until exhaustion, unless the subjects reveal symptoms or signs indicating the exercise should stop (e.g. severe breathlessness).</description>

    <description>Peripheral venous blood samples will be collected again in the morning after a fasting period of ≥12 hours. After immediate centrifugation, aliquots will be stored at -75˚C until analysis. Inflammatory markers and erythropoietin will be analyzed by flow cytometry and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, using commercially available kits.</description>
