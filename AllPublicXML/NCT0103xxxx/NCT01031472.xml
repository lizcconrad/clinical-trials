  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, two part, open-label, crossover study in healthy adult
      subjects to assess the effect of up to three formulations on the relative bioavailability of
      GSK2248761 100mg administered with and without food. Part A will evaluate two new
      formulations compared to the current formulation. Part B will evaluate one additional
      formulation if the bioavailability of the two formulations in Part A do not meet
      pre-specified criteria. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected during
      each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days after the last dose of study
      drug.

    <description>A total of twelve subjects who complete Part A will participate in Part B. Subjects from Part A will be asked to participate on a first come first serve basis until there are 12 subjects, at which time enrolment to Part B will be closed. Part B will be a 2 way cross over study design. Subjects will be randomized to one of a single dose of GSK2248761 100mg Formulation 2 or 4 (based on the evaluation of Part A data) administered with food or in the fasted state. Subjects in Part B will not receive the reference formulation since they previously received this in Part A</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory
             tests, and ECGs.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:

          -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy
             (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or is post-menopausal defined as 12 months
             of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be
             performed to confirm a post-menopausal status. For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 MlU/ml
             is confirmatory.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until the follow-up visit.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg for men and greater than or equal to 45 kg
             for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of the medical interview, physical examination, or screening
             investigations, the Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  Unwilling to refrain from the use of illicit drugs and adhere to other protocol-stated
             restrictions while participating in the study.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study.

          -  Unwilling to abstain from alcohol for 48 hours prior to the start of dosing until
             collection of the final pharmacokinetic sample during each treatment period.

          -  History or regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3 months
             prior to screening.

          -  History/evidence of symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass
             grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA) or
             any clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  History/evidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  The subject has received GSK2248761 in a previous clinical trial.

             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. In addition, if heparin is used
             during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period. Note: this does not include plasma
             donation.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody

             dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects at Screening and predose
             Day 1.
