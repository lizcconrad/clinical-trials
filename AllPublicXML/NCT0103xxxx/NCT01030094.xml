  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of topiramate monotherapy on the
      bone and mineral metabolism markers, and bone density (the amount of mineral per square
      centimeter of bone ) in female participants with epilepsy (seizure disorder), before
      menopause (time in life when a woman stops having a menstrual period), as compared with
      healthy participants and comparative group received either carbamazepine or valproic acid
      monotherapy for at least last one year.

      This is a cross-sectional (observations or measurements made at a single point in time,
      usually at participant enrollment), multi-center (conducted in more than one center), and
      comparative study of topiramate monotherapy in female participants with epilepsy. Female
      participants must have received either topiramate, carbamazepine, or valproic acid
      monotherapy for more than one year for the treatment of epilepsy. Blood samples will be
      obtained from fasting participants to investigate the effect of study drug on the bone and
      mineral metabolism markers, and bone density compared to healthy participants and comparative
      group (carbamazepine and valproic acid monotherapy). Bone mineral density will be measured
      from the participants' lumbar spine or femur. A survey of food intake and physical activity
      for the participants will be performed using a standardized validated detailed questionnaire.
      The post-study visit (or follow up phone contact) will be performed for the occurrence of
      serious adverse events (SAE) for safety evaluation. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute Concentration of Calcium in Serum and Random Urine</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Bone and mineral metabolic marker represents the structure, cyclical metabolism, and hormone regulation of bone. Urinary calcium is one of the indicators of bone resorption (bone loss due to osteoclastic activity). Absolute concentration of calcium in serum and random urine will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute Concentration of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D, Osteocalcin, Carboxy-terminal Telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx) and Somatomedin-C (IGF-1) in Serum</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Osteocalcin is a vitamin K-dependent calcium-binding protein synthesized by osteoblasts and found primarily in bones. Serum osteocalcin measurements provide a noninvasive specific marker of bone metabolism. CTx is marker for bone resorption (bone loss due to osteoclastic activity). IGF-1 has growth-regulating, insulin-like, and mitogenic activities. Absolute concentration of 25-hydroxy vitamin D, osteocalcin, carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx) and somatomedin-C (IGF-1) in serum will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute Concentration of 1-alpha 25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3, Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) in Serum</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Bone and mineral metabolic marker represents the structure, cyclical metabolism, and hormone regulation of bone. 1-alpha 25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (vitamin D-3) and Parathyroid hormone (PTH) were assessed. The PTH maintains intracellular calcium levels in the body.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute Concentration of Bone-specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BSAP) in Serum</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Bone and mineral metabolic marker represents the structure, cyclical metabolism, and hormone regulation of bone. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) reflects formation of organic matrix in bone. Absolute concentration of BSAP in Serum will be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute Concentration of Bicarbonate in Serum</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Bicarbonate levels in the blood are an index of the alkali reserve or buffering capacity. Difference in Bicarbonate level between topiramate, carbamazepine and valproic acid monotherapy groups will be assessed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute Concentration of Calcium in Urine in 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Absolute concentration of calcium in urine will be examined by urine test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spine, Total hip and Femoral Neck Z-Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Z-score is number of standard deviations a participant's bone mineral density (BMD) differs from the average BMD of their age, sex, and ethnicity. Positive scores indicate BMD above the mean; Positive values are &quot;best values&quot; and negative values are &quot;worst values&quot;. Z-score will be evaluated for spine, hip and femoral neck.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Osteopenia and Osteoporosis Based on Spine T-score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Osteoporosis means reduction of bone mass without alteration in the composition of bone, leading to fractures. Osteopenia is a metabolic bone disease. The T-score is a radiographic diagnosis that compares bone mineral density (BMD) to that of a &quot;normal, healthy, 30-year-old female&quot;. The lower the T-score, the lower the BMD. A T-score of +1 to -1 is normal. A T-score decrease of -1 indicates a 10%-15% decrease in BMD. Percentage of participants with osteopenia and osteoporosis based on spine T-score will be assessed.</description>
