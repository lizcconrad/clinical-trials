  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal CPAP will improve cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) performance in patients with
      overlap syndrome(COPD and OSA). Nasal CPAP is proven to improve cardiopulmonary exercise
      testing in patients with OSA. The investigators hypothesis is that patients with overlap
      syndrome will have a greater improvement in their cardiopulmonary exercise testing besides a
      possible improvement in their lung function test and airway resistance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be included if they have overlap syndrome. Patients will undergo a spirometry
      and CPET before being started on CPAP. Those tests will be repeated after 8-12 weeks of CPAP
      use. Patients will be excluded if they have any contraindication to mild exercise or they
      can't perform an exercise test due to limited mobility.
