      This is an open label, phase II, single center trial of ketoconazole/dexamethasone to
      determine if the administration of ketoconazole/dexamethasone, after disease progression with
      ketoconazole/hydrocortisone slows or reverses disease progression in men with progressive
      prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL. Patients must continue primary androgen deprivation with an
             LHRH analogue if they have not undergone orchiectomy.

          -  Progressive non-metastatic or metastatic disease after androgen deprivation. Patients
             must have EITHER:

               1. Progression as defined by RECIST criteria. OR

               2. Progressive PSA documented within 4 weeks of enrollment. PSA evidence for
                  progressive prostate cancer consists of a PSA level of at least 5 ng/ml which has
                  risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least 2 weeks apart. If the
                  confirmatory PSA value is less than the first documented rising PSA value, then
                  an additional test for rising PSA will be required to document progression.

          -  Patients who are receiving an antiandrogen as part of primary androgen ablation must
             demonstrate disease progression following discontinuation of antiandrogen.

               1. Disease progression after antiandrogen withdrawal is defined as 2 consecutive
                  rising PSA values, obtained at least 2 weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft
                  tissue progression.

               2. For patients receiving flutamide, at least one of the PSA values must be obtained
                  4 weeks or more after flutamide discontinuation.

               3. For patients receiving bicalutamide (Casodex) or nilutamide, at least one of the
                  PSA values must be obtained 6 weeks or more after antiandrogen discontinuation.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%.

          -  Patients receiving any other hormonal therapy, including any dose of megestrol acetate
             (Megace), Proscar (finasteride), any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels
             (e.g., Saw Palmetto and PC-SPES), or any systemic corticosteroid must discontinue the
             agent for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients on stable doses of bisphosphonates may continue on this medication; further,
             patients may initiate bisphosphonate therapy at the time of ketoconazole initiation.

          -  Prior radiation therapy completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  Liver function tests (ALT, AST, and Bilirubin) must be within normal limits.

          -  ANC &gt;1500/µl, Platelet count &gt; 100,00/µl, Creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal
             (ULN), Hemoglobin &gt; 8 mg/dl.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer is not allowed with the exception of cases in
             which chemotherapy has been administered in a neoadjuvant or adjuvant fashion AND &gt;1
             year has elapsed since the administration of this therapy.

          -  No prior ketoconazole, abiraterone, aminoglutethimide or corticosteroids for treatment
             of progressive prostate cancer.

          -  No supplements or complementary medicines/botanicals are permitted while on protocol
             therapy, except for any combination of the following: (conventional multivitamin
             supplements, selenium, lycopene, soy supplements) No prior radiopharmaceuticals
             (strontium, samarium) within 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  No &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy, other than non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  No serious intercurrent infections or nonmalignant medical illnesses that are
             uncontrolled.

          -  No psychiatric illnesses/social situations that would limit compliance

          -  No active or uncontrolled autoimmune disease.

          -  No adrenal insufficiency as demonstrated by a baseline ACTH stimulation test
             demonstrating a peak cortisol &gt;18 µg/dL.
