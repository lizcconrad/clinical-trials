  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will use Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab plus non-biological DMARD in patients with
      moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to non-biological
      DMARDS. Patients will be randomized to receive either intravenous tocilizumab at 8mg/kg
      (minimal dose 480mg, maximum dose 800mg) or placebo every 4 weeks, in addition to their
      stable dose of non-biological DMARD. Anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks, and
      target sample size is &lt;100.

    <description>Synovitis is defined as an area in the synovial compartment that shows above normal postgadolinium enhancement of a thickness greater than the width of the normal synovium. T1-weighted images were acquired before and after the administration of intravenous contrast agent containing gadolinium. Intravenous contrast was required to demonstrate enhancing synovitis. Three wrist regions (distal radioulnar joint, radiocarpal joint, the intercarpal and intermetacarpal joint) and the 2nd to 5th metacarpophalangeal (MCP) were assessed for synovitis via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and scored using a scale ranging from 0-3 where 0 is normal and scores 1-3 (mild, moderate, severe) are by thirds of the presumed volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. These values were then summed yielding scores of 0-9 in the wrist region, 0-12 for MCP joints, and 0-22 on the aggregate. A negative value in synovitis change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Bones from the wrist regions (carpal bones, distal radius, distal ulna and metacarpal bases) and the MCP joints (metacarpal heads and phalangeal bases) were assessed for erosion via MRI and scored separately based on the proportion of eroded bone compared to the 'assessed bone volume' judged from all available images. Scoring ranges from 0 (no erosion) to 10 (91-100%). For long bones, the 'assessed bone volume' is from the articular surface to a depth of 1 centimeter (cm) (if the articular surface is absent its best estimated position is used), and in carpal bones it is the whole bone. Results were summed, resulting in scores from 0 to 80 for the wrist region, 0 to 150 for the MCP joints, and 0 to 230 on aggregate. A negative value in change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast enhancement was quantified in terms of initial rate of enhancement (IRE) and number of voxels (Nvox), which are extracted by examining individual signal intensity vs time curves derived from defined regions of interest (ROIs). A volume ROI was manually drawn around wrist and MCP 2-5 joints at each visit representative of size/volume of enhancement and underlying inflammation. Maximum enhancement (ME)=mean of ME and Nplateau+Nwashout (Nvoxels) are number of voxels that have a plateau and washout, used to assess volume of enhancing voxels within drawn ROIs. IRE=percentage increase of signal intensity (SI) until l ME is reached calculated as maximum increase in post-contrast SI divided by baseline SI; IRE=increase in SI in %/s from time of onset of enhancement to ME. EER reflects the IRE parameter and the output is the mean from all the assessed ROIs (range=between 0 and 1; 0=no change/enhancement, 1=maximum change/enhancement. Negative change from Baseline score=improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Synovitis Measured by Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Image Scoring System (RAMRIS) Score</title>
        <description>Synovitis is defined as an area in the synovial compartment that shows above normal postgadolinium enhancement of a thickness greater than the width of the normal synovium. T1-weighted images were acquired before and after the administration of intravenous contrast agent containing gadolinium. Intravenous contrast was required to demonstrate enhancing synovitis. Three wrist regions (distal radioulnar joint, radiocarpal joint, the intercarpal and intermetacarpal joint) and the 2nd to 5th metacarpophalangeal (MCP) were assessed for synovitis via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and scored using a scale ranging from 0-3 where 0 is normal and scores 1-3 (mild, moderate, severe) are by thirds of the presumed volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. These values were then summed yielding scores of 0-9 in the wrist region, 0-12 for MCP joints, and 0-22 on the aggregate. A negative value in synovitis change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline to Week 12 in OMERACT-RAMRIS Synovitis Score</title>
        <description>Synovitis is defined as an area in the synovial compartment that shows above normal postgadolinium enhancement of a thickness greater than the width of the normal synovium. T1-weighted images were acquired before and after the administration of intravenous contrast agent containing gadolinium. Intravenous contrast was required to demonstrate enhancing synovitis. Three wrist regions (distal radioulnar joint, radiocarpal joint, the intercarpal and intermetacarpal joint) and the 2nd to 5th MCP were assessed for synovitis via MRI and scored using a scale ranging from 0-3 where 0 is normal and scores 1-3 (mild, moderate, severe) are by thirds of the presumed volume of enhancing tissue in the synovial compartment. These values were then summed yielding scores of 0-9 in the wrist region, 0-12 for MCP joints, and 0-22 on the aggregate. A negative value in synovitis change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 12 in OMERACT RAMRIS Bone Erosion Score</title>
        <description>Bones from the wrist regions (carpal bones, distal radius, distal ulna and metacarpal bases) and the MCP joints (metacarpal heads and phalangeal bases) were assessed for erosion via MRI and scored separately based on the proportion of eroded bone compared to the 'assessed bone volume' judged from all available images. Scoring ranges from 0 (no erosion) to 10 (91-100%). For long bones, the 'assessed bone volume' is from the articular surface to a depth of 1 centimeter (cm) (if the articular surface is absent its best estimated position is used), and in carpal bones it is the whole bone. Results were summed, resulting in scores from 0 to 80 for the wrist region, 0 to 150 for the MCP joints, and 0 to 230 on aggregate. A negative value in change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 12 in OMERACT RAMRIS Bone Edema Score</title>
        <description>Bones from the wrist regions (carpal bones, distal radius, distal ulna and metacarpal bases) and the MCP joints (metacarpal heads and phalangeal bases) were assessed for edema via MRI and scored separately based on the proportion of bone with edema. Scoring ranged from 0 to 3 as follows: 0: no edema; 1: 1-33% of bone edematous; 2: 34-66% of bone edematous; 3: 67-100%. Summing these values yielded a scale from 0-45 for the wrist region, 0-24 for the MCP joints, and 0-69 on aggregate.</description>

        <description>Contrast enhancement was quantified in terms of initial rate of enhancement (IRE) and number of voxels (Nvox), which are extracted by examining individual signal intensity vs time curves derived from defined regions of interest (ROIs). A volume ROI was manually drawn around wrist and MCP 2-5 joints at each visit representative of size/volume of enhancement and underlying inflammation. Maximum enhancement (ME)=mean of ME and Nplateau+Nwashout (Nvoxels) are number of voxels that have a plateau and washout, used to assess volume of enhancing voxels within drawn ROIs. IRE=percentage increase of signal intensity (SI) until l ME is reached calculated as maximum increase in post-contrast SI divided by baseline SI; IRE=increase in SI in %/s from time of onset of enhancement to ME. EER reflects the IRE parameter and the output is the mean from all the assessed ROIs (range=between 0 and 1; 0=no change/enhancement, 1=maximum change/enhancement.

        <title>Absolute Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE)-MRI Early Enhancement Rate (EER) Global Score</title>
        <description>Contrast enhancement was quantified in terms of IRE and Nvox, which are extracted by examining individual signal intensity vs time curves derived from defined ROIs. A volume ROI was manually drawn around wrist and MCP 2-5 joints at each visit representative of size/volume of enhancement and underlying inflammation. ME=mean of ME and Nplateau+Nwashout (Nvoxels) are number of voxels that have a plateau and washout, used to assess volume of enhancing voxels within drawn ROIs. IRE=percentage increase of SI until l ME is reached calculated as maximum increase in post-contrast SI divided by baseline SI; IRE=increase in SI in %/s from time of onset of enhancement to ME. EER reflects the IRE parameter and the output is the mean from all the assessed ROIs (range=between 0 and 1; 0=no change/enhancement, 1=maximum change/enhancement. Negative change from Baseline score=improvement.</description>

          <description>Contrast enhancement was quantified in terms of IRE and Nvox, which are extracted by examining individual signal intensity vs time curves derived from defined ROIs. A volume ROI was manually drawn around wrist and MCP 2-5 joints at each visit representative of size/volume of enhancement and underlying inflammation. ME=mean of ME and Nplateau+Nwashout (Nvoxels) are number of voxels that have a plateau and washout, used to assess volume of enhancing voxels within drawn ROIs. IRE=percentage increase of SI until l ME is reached calculated as maximum increase in post-contrast SI divided by baseline SI; IRE=increase in SI in %/s from time of onset of enhancement to ME. EER reflects the IRE parameter and the output is the mean from the MCP ROIs (range=between 0 and 1; 0=no change/enhancement, 1=maximum change/enhancement.

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 24 in DCE-MRI EER Wrist Score</title>
        <description>Contrast enhancement was quantified in terms of IRE and Nvox, which are extracted by examining individual signal intensity vs time curves derived from defined ROIs. A volume ROI was manually drawn around wrist and MCP 2-5 joints at each visit representative of size/volume of enhancement and underlying inflammation. ME=mean of ME and Nplateau+Nwashout (Nvoxels) are number of voxels that have a plateau and washout, used to assess volume of enhancing voxels within drawn ROIs. IRE=percentage increase of SI until l ME is reached calculated as maximum increase in post-contrast SI divided by baseline SI; IRE=increase in SI in %/s from time of onset of enhancement to ME. EER reflects the IRE parameter and the output is the mean from the wrist ROIs (range=between 0 and 1; 0=no change/enhancement, 1=maximum change/enhancement. Negative change from Baseline score=improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in DAS28 Global Score</title>
          <description>DAS28 was calculated from the number of swollen joints and tender joints (SJC and TJC) using the 28-joint count, the ESR (mm/hr) and global health assessment (participant rated global assessment of disease activity using 10-mm VAS); DAS28 score ranged from 0 to 10, where higher scores correspond to greater disease activity. Change in DAS28 global score was determined as the difference in the scores at baseline and Week 24. A negative number indicated improvement.</description>

          <description>Patient's Global Assessment of Pain was assessed using a 10-mm horizontal VAS (0 to 10 mm) where 0=pain absent and 10=intolerable pain. Participants responded by placing a mark on the line to indicate their current level of pain; the distance from the left edge to the mark was recorded. Change in Patient Global Assessment of Pain was determined as the difference in the scores at baseline and Week 12. A negative number indicated improvement.</description>
