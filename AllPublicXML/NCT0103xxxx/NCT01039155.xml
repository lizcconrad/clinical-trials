      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and the best dose of azacitidine and
      oxaliplatin in treating patients with advanced cancers that do not respond to treatment or
      have returned after any platinum therapy. Azacitidine is designed to activate (turn on)
      certain genes in cancer cells whose job is to fight tumors. Oxaliplatin is designed to block
      the growth and spread of new cancer cells, eventually destroying them, by damaging their
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Giving azacitidine with oxaliplatin may kill more cancer cells
      and may also reverse resistance to platinum-based drugs.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) and oxaliplatin
      combination regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphomas relapsed or
      refractory to any platinum compound.

      II. To define 5-azacytidine and oxaliplatin pharmacokinetics.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients treated in the expansion phase of this study: (a) to assess copper transport
      protein (CTR1) score; (b) to assess changes in global DNA methylation; and (c) to measure
      changes in oxaliplatin levels in tumor biopsies between pretreatment and day 12 of the first
      cycle of 5-azacytidine plus oxaliplatin therapy.

      II. To correlate results of the pharmacokinetic studies of 5-azacytidine and oxaliplatin with
      changes in CTR1, changes in global DNA methylation and changes in oxaliplatin levels in
      tissue biopsies of patients treated in the expansion phase of this study.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive azacitidine IV over 15-30 minutes on days 1-5 and oxaliplatin IV over 2
      hours on days 2-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
