      The purpose of this study is to determine whether higher doses of radioiodine increase
      treatment efficacy in severe Graves' disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves' disease (GD) is the most frequent cause of hyperthyroidism, affecting mainly women
      aged 40-60 years. Radioiodine (¹³¹I), introduced in 1941, has become a cornerstone in the
      treatment of GD hyperthyroidism. Because of its safety, low costs and rapid effect, it is
      considered a first line therapy in the United States. However, treatment failure occurs in
      about 15-25% of patients treated with radioiodine. Patients not cured with the first dose of
      radioiodine usually present severe hyperthyroidism, characterized by large goiter, high
      24-hour radioiodine uptake (24h-RAIU) and very high levels of thyroid hormones. We have
      previously shown that large goiter (≥48ml) is an independent predictor of treatment failure.
      In these patients, the therapeutic failure was 40.0% while in patients with smaller goiter
      was only 6.5% (P=0.005; unpublished). It is generally accepted that higher doses of
      radioiodine improves cure rates. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis found a correlation between
      radioiodine dose and therapeutic success in GD patients. To our knowledge, there are no
      published studies evaluating cure rates with different radioiodine doses in severe GD.
