  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the persistence of the immune response to HAV (hepatitis A virus)
      antigens and HBs (hepatitis B surface) antigens in healthy adults previously vaccinated with
      Twinrix™ Adult in the primary study, HAB-032 (208127/022). The subjects will be invited for
      blood sampling 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 years after the primary vaccination to evaluate the
      antibody persistence. For subjects in whom low circulating antibodies are detected, the
      presence of immune memory against hepatitis A &amp; B antigens will be investigated by the
      administration of a challenge dose of the appropriate vaccine (Havrix™ and/or Engerix™-B) at
      the next planned visit.

      No new subjects will be recruited during this study.

As lot to lot consistency was assessed during the primary study, the 3 groups (lot A, B or C) were pooled into the Twinrix Group for data analyses during the first long-term follow-up NCT00289718 and this long-term follow-up.
A challenge dose of the Havrix™ or Engerix™-B vaccines can be administered in this study based on serology results at each time point.</description>

      <desc>Unsolicited AEs were collected/assessed for the subjects who received the challenge doses, but no unsolicited AEs were reported. Among all the subjects who entered this LTFU study, no SAEs related to study participation or a concurrent GSK medication were reported until Year 20 time point.</desc>

          <title>Twinrix Group</title>
          <description>Subjects who received 2 doses of Twinrix™ (lot A, B or C) in the primary study.
As lot to lot consistency was assessed during the primary study, the 3 groups (lot A, B or C) were pooled into the Twinrix Group for data analyses during the first long-term follow-up NCT00289718 and this long-term follow-up.
A challenge dose of the Havrix™ or Engerix™-B vaccines can be administered in this study based on serology results at each time point.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>GSK agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing. GSK supports the publication of results from all centers of a multi-center trial but requests that reports based on single-site data not precede the primary publication of the entire clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>A decrease in specificity of the anti-HB ELISA had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody(10-100 mIU/mL).The tables show updated results following complete retesting/reanalysis for Y16-18.Y19 &amp; 20 results were only analyzed by CLIA.</limitations_and_caveats>
