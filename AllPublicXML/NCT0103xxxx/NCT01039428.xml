    <textblock>
      This was a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HS219, chitosan-loaded chewing gum,
      when given three times a day for 3 weeks to the hemodialysis (HD) patients with
      hyperphosphatemia whose serum inorganic phosphorus was not well controlled with calcium
      carbonate or sevelamer hydrogen chloride.
