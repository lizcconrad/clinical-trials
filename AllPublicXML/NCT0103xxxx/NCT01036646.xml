    <textblock>
      This multi-center study is designed to evaluate the ability of intended lay users (patients
      on oral anticoagulation therapy, OAT, or their caregivers) to 1) operate the INRatio
      Prothrombin Time (PT) Monitoring System utilizing the INRatio test strip newly designed for
      low sample volume and heparin insensitivity, and 2) obtain accurate results for the
      quantitative determination of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when self-testing using
      fingerstick capillary blood. Patients will be trained by their healthcare provider using the
      instructions for use and product labeling provided. The accuracy of the patient INR results
      will be assessed by comparison to the INR results obtained by the site's trained healthcare
      professional using the same INRatio system (from a separate fingerstick collected from the
      same patient at the point-of-care), and with the INR results obtained on venous plasma
      obtained from the same patient and analyzed at a central laboratory with the Sysmex CA-560
      System INR reference method.
