    <textblock>
      B type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is the most prevalent leukemia in the western
      world. It is a disease that occurs primarily in aging individuals and occurs more frequently
      in males than females. Although B-CLL was considered a homogeneous condition, recent studies
      by our laboratory and others suggest that B-CLL cases can be divided into two subgroups.

      These sub-groups can be identified by either the presence or the absence of mutations in
      antibody genes and/or by the percentage of B-CLL cells expressing a particular protein called
      CD38. These two sub-groups (unmutated antibody genes high percent CD38 and mutated antibody
      genes low percentage CD38) follow strikingly clinically different courses. For example, the
      unmutated/CD38+ group experiences a much more aggressive disease and these patients almost
      invariably die much sooner than the cases in the other group. In addition, the patients in
      the mutated CD38+ group require much more chemotherapy than mutatedlCD38-. Finally,
      surprisingly there is a much higher representation of males in the poor outcome unmutated
      CD38 group than in the better outcome group. The reasons for these differences in clinical
      outcome and gender bias are unknown.
