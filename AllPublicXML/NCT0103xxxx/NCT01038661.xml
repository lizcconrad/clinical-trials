      The Primary Objective is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS).

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To compare the disease control rates of different doses of Docetaxel+Cisplatin as
           first-line treatment according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)
           criteria;

        -  To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR);

        -  To evaluate the time to disease progression (TTP);

        -  To evaluate the overall survival (OS);

        -  To evaluate the toxicity.

      The study consists in:

        -  A first line treatment phase: participants receive 4 cycles of chemotherapy (each cycle
           contains 3 weeks) with either docetaxel (75 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) or
           docetaxel (60 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m2) ,

        -  A maintenance treatment phase: participants with disease control (complete response
           [CR], partial response [PR] or stable disease [SD]) after the initial treatment receive
           up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy with docetaxel (60 mg/m2) or best supportive care (BSC).

        -  A follow-up period from the end of study treatment until participant death or end of
           study.
