      The objective of this study is to establish patient preferences in regards to common
      complications of cervical cancer treatments, and to compare these preferences to those of
      medical providers who care for cervical cancer patients. These preferences will be determined
      via a interview using the Standard Gamble, which is a well-recognized method for establishing
      utilities.

        Patient Population: Patients ≥18 and &lt;61 years old who were diagnosed with early cervical
        cancer (stages I and II) at least 3 years prior to the interview. We cannot limit our
        population to stage IB2 patients and meet our accrual goals due to the rarity of the
        disease. Patients with stages I and II cervical cancer are included because they have the
        potential to be exposed to the same treatment complications as patients with stage IB2
        disease. Patients of all health statuses will be accepted.

        Provider Population: Providers who care for patients with cervical cancer at the University
        of Wisconsin, including: gynecologic oncologists, radiation oncologists, physician's
        assistants and nurses. Providers must be ≥18 and &lt;61 years old in any health status.
