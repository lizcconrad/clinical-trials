      Objective: To investigate effects of home-based somatosensory stimulation associated with
      motor training on improvement in performance of the paretic upper extremity in patients in
      the chronic phase after stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design: Double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Setting: Home-based
      rehabilitation. Subjects: Patients in the chronic phase (&gt; 6 months) after stroke.
      Interventions: Patients will be randomized to an active and a control group. In both groups,
      treatments will be performed at home, daily, over four weeks. Patients in the active group
      will be instructed to use a device that provides somatosensory stimulation in the form of
      electrical stimulation of the median nerve for two hours. Patients in the control group will
      also be instructed to use the device for two hours, and sham stimulation will be
      administered. In both groups, patients will be instructed to train activities with the
      paretic hand immediately after nerve stimulation.

      Main measures: The primary outcome will be improvement in performance of the paretic hand
      evaluated by the Jebsen-Taylor test at end of treatment and four months after end of
      treatment, compared to baseline. Secondary outcomes were: 1) Compliance with the
      interventions, assessed through a daily written log, and oral reports of the patients; 2)
      safety profile of the interventions.
