  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of AZD5847 after
      receiving oral doses on a single day (Part A) or after receiving a single oral dose in two
      periods (Part B). For volunteers in Part B, the effect of food on the PK of AZD5847 will also
      be studied. Another purpose is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD5847 and its
      metabolites in blood and urine.
