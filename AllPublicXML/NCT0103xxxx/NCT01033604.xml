  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The application of Glyaderm for skin restoration intends to provide a more stable wound
      closure with enhanced pliability and function of the skin and a more favourable scar. The
      dermal substitute would be affordable for widespread application in full thickness skin
      defects and burns.

      Patients with burn wounds or large full thickness wounds will be evaluated before enrollment.
      All burn wounds that are not clearly full thickness on clinical assessment will be treated
      during the first 48 hours with a hydrocolloid paste and covered with a paraffin gauze
      dressing. This hydrocolloid paste combined with paraffin gauze will ensure maintenance of a
      moist wound environment for the first 48 hours prior to assessment by LDI and randomization.
      This is the standard treatment for all burns admitted to the Ghent Burn Centre.

      Wounds will be photographed on a daily basis. In order to obtain an optimal preparation for
      LDI, the burn wounds will be meticulously debrided during dressing changes. LDI is most
      reliable between 48-72 hours. Patients whose burn wounds meet the inclusion criteria, i.e.
      full thickness burns with LDI values &lt; 200 will be randomized to receive either GLYADERM and
      split skin graft versus split skin graft alone.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All burn wounds with flux values measured by Laser Doppler Imaging, corresponding with
             an expected healing time longer than 28 days. Dark blue color on the palette of the
             LDI software with flux values below 200

          -  All clearly full thickness burns on clinical assessment done by two plastic surgeons
             and thereafter treated with FlammaceriumÂ®.

          -  Wounds treated with a hydrocolloid paste prior to LDI and with low flux values &lt; 200

          -  All assessments are done during first days before final decision at day three

          -  Possibility to follow the complete treatment schedule until final graft take and
             subsequently wound healing and finally participation on complete follow-up schedule

          -  Informed consent has been obtained

          -  TBSA Full Thickness Burn &lt; 40%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All burn wounds with flux values measured by Laser Doppler Imaging, corresponding with
             faster healing times ( flux values &gt;200 )

          -  TBSA &gt;40 %

          -  Not following the complete treatment schedule or missing some evaluations during the
             follow-up period

             complete this study.

          -  Patient has participated in another study utilizing an investigational drug within the
             previous 30 days

          -  Patient has one or more medical condition(s), diabetes, including renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the investigator
