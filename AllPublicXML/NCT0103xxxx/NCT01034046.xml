  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of two different reduced calorie
      diets that have different combinations of carbohydrate, fat, and protein content in 2 groups
      of study participants: insulin sensitive participants and insulin resistant participants. The
      hypothesis of the study is that people with high and low levels of insulin resistance may
      respond differently to different diet compositions in a real-world environment using meals
      that are commonly available.
