  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relevance of the study will be in establishing whether Health Related Quality of Life
      (HRQoL) measures obtained repeatedly during hemophilia care are sensitive to significant
      changes in health or personal circumstances related to the transition from youth to
      adulthood. This may support the future use of HRQoL measures as part of routine care in order
      to identify important changes that are not detectible by other clinical means.
