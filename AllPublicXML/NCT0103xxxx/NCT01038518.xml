  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the Health2010-14 is to monitor the prevalence and trends of common
      chronic diseases (osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, asthma, allergy, and
      eczema) that are often un-diagnosed in the general population as well as biomarkers of
      micronutrient status. Specific aims include identification of novel lifestyle and genetic
      risk factors for the above diseases by investigating gene-lifestyle interactions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a 5-year period a series of population-based studies are carried out including a total
      of up to 10,000 persons aged 18-69 years selected from the general population of Copenhagen,
      Denmark. The study also include a follow-up of a previous population study (the Health2006).
      Participants complete questionnaires on health, lifestyle, and social factors and undergo a
      health examination including measurements of metabolic biomarkers, allergy tests,
      anthropometric measures, bioimpedance, biomarkers of micronutrients, spirometry.
