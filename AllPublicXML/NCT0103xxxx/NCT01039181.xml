  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), cancer of the bile duct, is the first cause of cancer death of the
      people in the northeast of Thailand. The incidence of CCA in this region is highest not only
      in the country but in the world. CCA is a slow growing but highly metastatic tumor. At
      present, there is no standard chemotherapy or effective treatment for CCA. Most of the
      patients have short survival after diagnosis. Strong evidences from in vitro, animal and
      clinical studies indicate that vitamin D can prevent and control growth of cancer. Our
      preclinical studies in CCA cell lines, animal and patient tissue culture indicate that
      vitamin D effectively reduce growth of CCA. Supplementation of vitamin D to chemotherapeutic
      drugs enhance drug toxicity and better response. At present, there are several clinical
      trials in USA on supplementation of vitamin D or its analogs to cancer patients. The side
      effect or toxicity of using vitamin D supplementation is low, some patients had stable
      disease and some had good response. The current study is set up a clinical trial phase II of
      vitamin D (calcitriol) in combination with 5-fluorouracil, Mitomycin C and Leucovorin in an
      open label-non-randomized study to evaluate the tumor response in patients with advanced
      intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. This study will provide an alternative/effective
      chemotherapy treatment for CCA patients. Better survival and improved quality of life are
      also expected.

      -  OUTLINE: This is a dose-limiting toxicity study of calcitriol.

        -  EVALUAITON: During the initial phase, 14 patients will be accrued for this study. If the
           number of patient's response to calcitriol and 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin C/leucovorin is
           less than 1/14, the study will be stopped. However there is one patient who responses to
           calcitriol and 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin C/leucovorin, the new 14 patients will be
           accrued during the secondary phase of study.
