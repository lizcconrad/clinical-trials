      Purpose: To compare the pain perception at laser treatment of peripheral retinal
      degenerations with green and infrared wavelengths.

      Methods: Thirty patients (60 eyes) were enrolled in the study. Each patient had one eye
      treated with infrared laser (diode, 810nm) and the other eye treated with green laser
      (frequency-doubled solid state laser, diode-pumped, with 532-nm). The laser treatment was
      performed following a standardized protocol. Immediately after photocoagulation, the patient
      was asked to grading pain perception according an 11-point (i.e. 0-10) numerical rating scale
      (NRS) 2,3, accompanied by the instructions &quot;Please rate your pain by indicating the number
      that best describes it&quot;. This NRS is represented as a straight line (10 cm in length). The
      numbers between 0 and 10 are spaced at regular intervals along the line, at either end of the
      line are two poles that are defined as the extreme limits of the response to be measure, with
      '0' meaning 'No pain' and '10' meaning 'Pain as bad as you can imagine'.
