  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Studies conducted at the National Cancer Institute suggest that certain chemotherapy
           drugs may be more effective if given by continuous infusion into the vein rather than by
           the standard method of rapid intravenous injection. One combination of six chemotherapy
           drugs, known as EPOCH-R, has had a high degree of effectiveness in people with certain
           kinds of cancer.

        -  Recent evidence also indicates that the effects of chemotherapy may be improved by
           combining the treatment with monoclonal antibodies, which are purified proteins that are
           specially made to attach to foreign substances such as cancer cells. A monoclonal
           antibody called campath (alemtuzumab) has been manufactured to attach to a protein
           called CD52 that may target tumor cells or the surrounding inflammatory cells.

        -  Researchers are interested in developing new treatments for large B-cell lymphoma or
           Hodgkin lymphoma that can best be treated with chemotherapy. This protocol is
           specifically for people with diffuse large B-cell or Hodgkin lymphomas that have not
           responded to standard treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test whether giving campath (alemtuzumab) in combination with continuous infusion
      EPOCH-R chemotherapy will improve the outcome of lymphoma treatment.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who have large B-cell lymphoma or Hodgkin lymphoma
      that has not responded well to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  During the study, patients will receive standard EPOCH-R chemotherapy, which includes
           the following drugs: etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
           and rituximab. The additional drug, campath, will be given by IV infusion on the first
           day of treatment over several hours.

        -  When the campath IV infusion and rituximab IV infusion are complete, the drugs
           doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine will each be given by continuous IV infusion
           over the next 4 days (that is, continuously for a total of 96 hours). Cyclophosphamide
           will be given by IV infusion over several hours on Day 5. Prednisone will be given by
           mouth twice each day for 5 days.

        -  Patients may be given other drugs to treat the side effects of chemotherapy, to prevent
           possible infections, and to improve white blood cell counts.

        -  The campath-EPOCH-R therapy will be repeated every 21 days, as a cycle of therapy, for a
           total of 6 cycles. Following the fourth and sixth treatment cycles (approximately weeks
           12 and 18) of campath-EPOCH-R treatment, study researchers will perform blood tests and
           CT/MRI scans on all patients to assess their response to the treatment.

      Background:

      Two signatures of the microenvironment were recently identified that are predictive of
      outcome in patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL treated with R-CHOP. These signatures, called
      stromal 1 and stromal 2 , are associated with genes expressed by infiltrating mononuclear
      cells. The stromal 2 signature, which includes genes associated with angiogenesis, is
      predictive of an inferior outcome. Based on these observations, we are interested in
      targeting the reactive cells in the microenvironment as a therapeutic strategy in patients
      with relapsed and refractory DLBCL. Along the same principles, we are also including patients
      with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The surrounding reactive cells around Hodgkin Reed
      Sternberg (HRS) cells are now not thought to be bystander cells and they appear to provide
      important survival signals to HRS cells.

        -  CD52 is one such promising target that is highly expressed in most of these infiltrating
           cells and on most DLBCL although not on HRS cells specifically. Anti-CD52 antibodies may
           have therapeutic value by depleting reactive B and T cells, and monocytes from the
           microenvironment.

        -  The dose of alemtuzumab in combination with DA-EPOCH is 30 mg IV, as determined by a
           prior study done in patients with untreated peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The main
           toxicities of this combination are myelosuppression and opportunistic infections.

        -  An important component of this study will be to obtain tumor tissue for gene expression
           profiling and to assess microenvironment signatures and look at other molecular
           signatures and targets before treatment and in patients who progress and ultimately
           correlate response and outcome with these various end-points.

      Objectives:

      - Assess response, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in
      relapsed/refractory DLBCL and Hodgkin Lymphoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Previously treated orrefractory classical large B-cell lymphomas, Grey-zone lymphoma and
           Hodgkin lymphoma, including Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (LPHL).

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years with adequate organ functions.

        -  HIV negative and no active CNS lymphoma.

      Study Design:

        -  Patients will receive 30mg of Alemtuzumab on day 1 of therapy, followed by Rituximab on
           day 1 and dose-adjusted EPOCH chemotherapy days 1-5, up to six cycles of therapy.

        -  Tumor biopsies will be done before treatment, after 1 cycle of therapy and at relapse.

        -  It is anticipated that up to 10-15 patients per year may be enrolled onto this trial.
           Thus, accrual of up to 52 patients is expected to require approximately 4-5 years.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Previously treated orrefractory classical large B-cell lymphomas, Grey-zone
                  lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, including Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma
                  (LPHL).

               2. Confirmed pathological diagnosis by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI.

               3. Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

               4. ECOG performance 0-2

               5. Laboratory tests: ANC greater than or equal to 1000/mm(3), platelet greater than
                  or equal to 75,000/mm(3). Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or
                  creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 ml/min; AST and ALT less than or
                  equal to 5 times the ULN. Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl except &lt; 5mg/dL in patients
                  with Gilbert s (as defined as &gt; 80% unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without other
                  known cause); unless impairment due to organ involvement by lymphoma.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Active symptomatic ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction or congestive heart
             failure within the past year. If ECHO is obtained, the LVEF should exceed 40%.

          2. HIV positive, because of the unknown effects of combined therapy with chemotherapy and
             an immunosuppressive agent on HIV progression.

          3. Female subject of child-bearing potential not willing to use an acceptable method of
             birth control (i.e. a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with
             spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the duration of the study and
             two years beyond treatment completion.

          4. Female subject pregnant or breast-feeding. Confirmation that the subject is not
             pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin
             (beta-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening. Pregnancy testing is not
             required for women without childbearing potential.

          5. Male subject unwilling to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration
             of the study and one year beyond treatment completion.

          6. Invasive or active malignancy in past 2 years.

          7. Serious concomitant medical illnesses that would jeopardize the patient s ability to
             receive the regimen with reasonable safety.

          8. Active CNS lymphoma. These patient have a poor prognosis and because they frequently
             develop progressive neurological dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurological and other adverse events.

          9. Systemic cytotoxic therapy within 3 weeks of treatment.
