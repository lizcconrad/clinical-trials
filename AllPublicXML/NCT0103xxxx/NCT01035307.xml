      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at biomarkers in tissue samples from young patients
      with acute myeloid leukemia previously enrolled on clinical trial POG-9421.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To profile basal and potentiated phospho-protein networks (PPPNs) using tissue samples
           from pediatric patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) previously enrolled on
           clinical trial POG-9421.

        -  To classify AML-based signal transduction mechanisms.

        -  To correlate profiles of basal and PPPNs with specific molecular lesions (e.g.,
           FLT3-ITD, NPM, WT1, c-kit, CEPBα, PASGΔ75, and karyotype) and profiles of gene
           expression in tumor tissue samples.

      OUTLINE: Banked tissue samples are collected for laboratory studies, including
      phospho-protein signaling and gene expression profiling studies.
