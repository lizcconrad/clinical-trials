  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to assess the genotype - phenotype correlations of the CNS
      manifestations of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL), a fatal, rare,
      recessive disorder of the CNS in children. This study will be accomplished by comparing the
      genotype to a neurologic assessment and Weill Cornell LINCL scale, the UBDRS scale, the
      standardized CHQ quality of life scale, and the Mullen scale; magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI); and routine clinical evaluations. This study is designed to run parallel to a separate
      study which is being done by the Department of Genetic Medicine, which will use gene transfer
      to treat the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of late infantile neuronal ceroid
      lipofuscinosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to study the natural disease process of LINCL. We propose to assess
      the correlation between genotype (genetic constitution) and phenotype (observable
      characteristics) of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) in children
      diagnosed with LINCL in all stages. LINCL is a form of Batten disease that affects the brain
      of children and prevents it from functioning properly. These children are born with genetic
      changes called mutations that result in the inability of the brain to properly recycle
      proteins in the brain. The recycling failure leads to death of the nerve cells in the brain
      and progressive loss of brain function. Children with Batten disease are normal at birth but
      by age 2 to 4 have motor and vision problems which progress rapidly to death at age
      approximately 10 years old. There are no therapies available to treat the disease. This study
      is designed to run parallel to the gene transfer protocol, which will include 16 individuals
      in two groups: Group A will receive 9.0x10^11 genome copies (gc) of the vector and Group B
      will receive 2.85x10^11 gc; we anticipate that we will be able to capture a one-time genotype
      - phenotype snapshot for all n=32, and an 18 months genotype - phenotype progression
      assessment for n=16.

    <description>MRI assessment at various intervals Day 0 and month 18. Based on previous analyses, we have determined that 3 imaging parameters (% grey matter volume, % ventricular volume and cortical apparent diffusion coefficient) correlate best with age and with the Weill Cornell LINCL scale. These 3 imaging parameters will be used to assess disease progression in this screening protocol and the effect of the gene transfer in the IRB approved gene transfer trials (IRB #0810010013 and #1005011054). For those children available to continue in the study, all parameters will be re-assessed by comparing baseline evaluations to month 18 evaluation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria.

          1. Definitive diagnosis of LINCL, based on clinical phenotype and genotype.

          2. The subject must be between the age of 2 and 18 years.

             participation.

        Exclusion criteria.

          1. Presence of other significant medical or neurological conditions may disqualify the
