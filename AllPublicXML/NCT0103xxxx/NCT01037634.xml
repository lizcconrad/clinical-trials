    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no standard treatment for influenza with related lower respiratory tract
      infection (LRTI) in children younger than one year of age, even though influenza related LRTI
      is a potentially fatal illness in these children. This study will test a medicine for
      influenza in children younger than one year of age to see if it is safe and effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza-related lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) can cause serious illness or death
      in children younger than a year old. Only four medications are registered to treat influenza,
      and these do not have detailed recommendations for treating children younger than one year of
      age. One of these medications, oseltamivir, has no official recommendation for usage in
      children younger than one year of age, but it may be the best treatment for certain strains
      of influenza. A small number of children younger than one year of age have received
      oseltamivir in several countries with good clinical outcomes and apparently good
      tolerability. This study will test oseltamivir in children younger than one year of age to
      see if it is safe and effective.

      Children younger than one year of age with influenza will be recruited for this study.
      Participants will receive the usual care for influenza with the addition of oseltamivir.
      Oseltamivir will be given orally for 5 days to children with human influenza, 7 days to
      children with H1N1 influenza in Vietnam, and 10 days to children with avian influenza.
      Participants will need to remain in the hospital between 5 and 12 days, depending on their
      illnesses.

      Study assessments will be performed daily for 14 days with follow-up examinations occurring 1
      to 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after study entry. These assessments will include normal
      tests for children with influenza, such as blood tests and chest x-rays, but additional blood
      and nose, throat, and mouth samples will be collected for the study. Participants on a
      breathing machine will give lung samples.
