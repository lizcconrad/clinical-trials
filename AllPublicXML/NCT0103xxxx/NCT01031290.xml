    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Cannabis, also known as marijuana, is a commonly abused drug. There is no approved
           medication to treat cannabis addiction. The desire to use cannabis often increases when
           seeing others use it or seeing pictures of it. Researchers are interested in determining
           which parts of the brain are active when looking at pictures associated with cannabis.

        -  Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) uses magnetic pulses to stimulate
           the brain. These pulses can change activity in parts of the brain. Researchers are
           interested in determining whether rTMS can decrease activity in the parts of the brain
           that respond to cannabis, and thereby lessen cravings for cannabis.

      Objectives:

      - To determine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation can lower craving for cannabis when
      people who use cannabis are shown images that increase craving.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who are physically healthy and currently use cannabis
      (at least 3 times weekly for the past 2 years).

      Design:

        -  The study will involve eight visits over 3 weeks, with each visit lasting 1 to 2 hours.

        -  Participants will have an initial assessment about cannabis use and provide blood and
           urine samples before beginning the study.

        -  Participants will have three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. The first MRI
           scan will look at the structure of the brain at rest. During the other two scans,
           participants will look at images related to and not related to cannabis use.

        -  The rTMS sessions (with either actual TMS or inactive [sham] TMS) will be held daily for
           5 consecutive days. During these testing visits, researchers will ask questions related
           to drug use and craving, and collect urine and breath samples for further study.

        -  Participants will have two follow-up visits, 1 week and 2 weeks after the rTMS sessions,
           to evaluate memory and mood, and one final MRI brain scan at the end of the study.

      Primary objective:

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) provides a non-invasive means of altering
      brain neural activity. This pilot study will test whether 5 days of rTMS reduces cue-induced
      cannabis craving and use in cannabis users.

      Hypothesis:

      We predict that active rTMS will significantly lower craving for cannabis compared with sham
      rTMS.

      Study population:

      Thirty healthy adult cannabis users (for at least 2 years, currently averaging 3 times
      weekly) with no other major psychiatric disorders except nicotine dependence (DSM IV
      criteria) will be recruited from the community.

      Design:

      Following a baseline phase to evaluate subject characteristics, subjects will be randomly
      assigned to receive 5 days of active or sham rTMS. rTMS at 1 Hz and strength 120% of the
      motor threshold will be applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using a figure
      8 coil , beginning 1 second after presentation of a cannabis-associated visual cue and
      lasting for 30 seconds. Brain site localization will use a computerized navigation system
      based on structural MRI scans obtained before the first session. Each rTMS session (lasting
      around 31 minutes) will consist of 54 trials (cue presentations): 36 with cannabis-associated
      cues and 9 each with non-drug-associated positive or neutral cues. No rTMS will be
      administered with the non-cannabis-associated cues. Subjects return for follow-up assessments
      one and two weeks after the final rTMS session.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary outcome measure will be cannabis craving assessed by the Marijuana Craving
      Questionnaire and visual analog scales before and after every rTMS session and at one- and
      two-week follow-up. Secondary outcome measures will be self-reported cannabis use and urine
      drug testing at each rTMS session and follow-up visit, and changes in regional brain
      responses to cannabis-associated visual cues assessed by fMRI done before and after the 5
      rTMS sessions.

      Benefits:

      The future benefit to society may be development of better methods for treatment of cannabis
      addiction.

      Risks:

      The primary risks from rTMS are transient headache, scalp discomfort, decreased spatial
      recognition memory, and hearing loss (minimized by wearing ear plugs). Seizures are very rare
      when rTMS is administered within accepted safety guidelines and individuals at increased risk
      of seizures are excluded. The risk of inducing a manic episode is minimized by excluding
      individuals with a history of non-drug-induced mania/hypomania.
