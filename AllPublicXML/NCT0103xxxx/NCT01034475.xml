  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy resistance is a major cause of death in patients with advanced hematologic
      malignancies. The proposed novel mechanism of action, non-cross resistance with
      chemotherapeutic agents currently used in the clinic, and lack of CPI-613-related
      myelosuppression preclinically and clinically to date make CPI-613 a suitable candidate for
      phase I clinical trial in these patients. The current trial is one of several clinical trials
      of CPI-613. Other clinical trials that are conducted in patients with solid tumors have
      already been initiated.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and MTD of CPI-613 when
      administered 2x weekly for 3 consecutive weeks.

      The secondary objective is to determine the PKs of CPI-613 following IV administration and to
      observe the anti-tumor effects of CPI-613, if any occur.

    <description>This is a Phase I open label trial using a 2-stage dose-escalation scheme (single-patient &amp; traditional stages):
Single-Patient Dose-Escalation Stage: In the single-patient stage, a single patient will be accrued per dose level. The starting dose will be 420 mg/m². Dose level will be escalated (by doubling the previous dose) if there is no toxicity or if the toxicity is grade 1 or less. If toxicity is &gt;Grade 1, the traditional dose-escalation stage will be triggered.
Traditional Dose-Escalation: All dose escalations conducted in this Traditional Dose-Escalation stage will be escalated according to the modified Fibonacci Dose-Escalation scheme.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  histologically or cytologically documented relapsed and/or refractory hematologic
             malignancy

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of &gt;70%.

          -  Must be ≥18 years of age.

          -  Expected survival &gt;1 month.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must use accepted contraceptive methods

          -  No radiotherapy, treatment with cytotoxic agents (except CPI-613), treatment with
             biologic agents or any anti-cancer therapy within the 3 weeks prior to treatment with
             CPI-613.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the
             past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or New York Heart Association Class
             III or IV), or severe debilitating pulmonary disease, that would potentially increase
             patients' risk for toxicity.

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) or epidural tumor.

          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding, and any patients with a bleeding diathesis (e.g.,
             active peptic ulcer disease).

          -  Pregnant women, or women of child-bearing potential not using reliable means of
             contraception.

          -  Lactating females because the potential of excretion of CPI-613 into breast milk.

          -  Life expectancy less than 1 month.

          -  Any condition or abnormality which may, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise
             the safety of patients.
