  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Macular Edema (Swelling of a particular site of the retina) can become a significant problem
      for Diabetics undergoing Cataract surgery. And a significant number of people who undergo
      Cataract surgery each year are diabetics. And when you multiply these two factors together
      you are left with a significant number of people who do not gain as much vision as their
      peers. Diabetics who develop Macular Edema actually can loose some vision after surgery and
      when you follow them up, they don't gain as much vision. This Study aims to prevent such an
      event from happening and therefore allow Diabetics to gain as much vision as they can from
      cataract surgery. This study will use Dexamethasone injected intravitreally (into the gel of
      the eye) at the end of cataract extraction to control Macular edema brought about by surgery.
      The main outcome is the central retina thickness and retinal volume as measured by Optical
      Coherence Tomography. Secondary outcomes are BCVA and incidence of Laser Treatment.

      Other Drugs, life Bevacizumab and Pegaptanib, have been used for this purpose but they are
      expensive and have potential systemic side-effects due to anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial
      growth factor) actions. Dexamethasone has been used in the eye for decades and is
      short-lived, minimizing possible systemic effects. Moreover, this drug is at least 15x
      cheaper than the previously mentioned ones and therefore has tremendous benefit for
      developing countries. We seek an alternative drug that can reduce or prevent Macular edema at
      a less expensive and safer way.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetic patients for Cataract Surgery with vision of â‰¤ 20/50 and &gt; grade 3 any
             cataract type using the Lens Opacities Classification System III. Diabetics included
             must have at least one microaneurysm in the posterior pole (defined by the Superior
             and Inferior Arcade).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Without any diabetic retinopathy and those with active uncontrolled proliferative
             disease

          -  Retinal disease,other than Diabetes, that can affect macular edema

          -  Uveitis, a history of any other intraocular surgery or a history of uncontrolled
             glaucoma

          -  Eyes with cataract precluding proper OCT measurement pre-operatively

          -  Patients who will experience longer than usual operating time, complicated surgery,
             rupture of the posterior capsule, and iris or corneal burns
