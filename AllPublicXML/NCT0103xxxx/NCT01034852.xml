    <textblock>
      Specific Aims: The primary objective of this registry is to determine the percentage of
      patients who are free from atrial fibrillation (AF) at 6 and 12 months following a surgical
      ablation procedure when the patient has a history of failing one or more previous catheter
      based ablations for AF. The first 3 months following surgical ablation will be a blanking
      period; any arrhythmia occurring during this time will not be used to determine success.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. Determine the percent success of surgical ablation for AF at 6, and 12 months both on
           and off of antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) following a failed catheter based ablation for AF

        2. Record and evaluate all complications associated with the surgical procedure.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Evaluate usage of anticoagulants at 6, and 12 months.

        2. Determine the percentage of Pulmonary Veins (PV) that were electrically isolated by
           intra-operative, pre-surgical mapping
