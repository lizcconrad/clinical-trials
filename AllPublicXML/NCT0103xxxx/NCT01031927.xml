  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence implicate glutamatergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of
      obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Sarcosine, also known as N-methylglycine, is an
      endogenous antagonist of glycine transporter-I (GlyT-I), which potentiates glycine's action
      at the glycine site of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In this 10-week open-label
      trial, we examined the efficacy and safety of sarcosine treatment in OCD patients.
