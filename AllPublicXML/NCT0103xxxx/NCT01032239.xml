    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) Therapy, compared to Best Medical Treatment
      (BMT), has superior efficacy in the treatment of severe spasticity in adult post-stroke
      patients with generalized spastic hypertonia who have not reached their therapy goal with
      other treatment interventions assessed by a decrease in the average Ashworth Scale (AS) score
      in the lower extremities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled open-label parallel group study to demonstrate the efficacy
      benefit of ITB Therapy over BMT in post-stroke patients with severe spasticity who have not
      reached their therapy goal with other treatment interventions.

      In order to evaluate the efficacy benefit of ITB Therapy over BMT in post-stroke patients, a
      two-arm parallel group design will be applied. Patients will be equally randomized to one of
      two treatment arms:

        1. ITB Therapy arm; or

        2. BMT arm

      The study consists of a run-in phase of 21 days for the BMT treatment arm and 2-25 days for
      the ITB Therapy treatment arm, followed by a 6 month active trial.

      The BMT treatment arm will receive a combination of oral antispastic medication and
      physiotherapy. Patients must be prescribed at least one or a combination of the following
      oral antispastic medications: oral baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam (or other benzodiazepines)
      or dantrolene. Following the run-in phase, patients will enter the 6 month active trial.

      The ITB Therapy treatment arm will receive a combination of ITB Therapy and physiotherapy.
      During the run-in phase, a test with intrathecal baclofen will be performed to evaluate the
      response of the patient. Patients fulfilling the test success criterium will be implanted
      with a Medtronic SynchroMed®II infusion system. Following implant, patients will enter into
      the 6 month active trial, which includes a 6 week titration phase, during which time oral
      antispastic medications must be gradually reduced with complete discontinuation by the end of
      the titration period.

      During the 6 month active trial, patients will be assessed at 3 and 6 months. All primary and
      secondary endpoint assessments will be performed by a blinded assessor.

      The total study duration is expected to be 60 months, including a 39 month enrollment period.
      The total duration per patient is approximately 7 months (approximately 1 month run-in period
      followed by 6 months active treatment).

    <measure>Change in Average Ashworth Scale (AS) in Affected Lower Extremities From Baseline to Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 6</time_frame>
    <description>AS is a manual test, measuring the resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity. Scores range from 1-5, with 5 choices. A score of 1 indicates no resistance, and 5 indicates rigidity. The following muscle groups in the lower extremities were assessed: hip flexors, hip adductors, knee extensors, knee flexors, plantar flexors and ankle-dorsal flexors. Average AS was calculated as the average of AS scores of the 6 muscles of the affected lower extremity. Change in average AS in affected lower extremities from baseline to month 6 between ITB and BMT arm was assessed.
Change= AS at month 6 - AS at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) From Baseline to Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 6</time_frame>
    <description>NPRS is designed to assess the level of pain a patient is feeling at a point in time. The following questions has been presented to patients: What is your actual spasticity-related or spasm-related pain? What was your least spasticity-related or spasm-related pain during the last week? What was your worst spasticity-related or spasm-related pain during the last week? The patient indicated how much pain he is feeling on a scale from 0 to 10. A score of 0 (zero) is &quot;no pain&quot; while a score of 10 (ten) is &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. Change in NPRS related to actual, least or worst pain from baseline to month 6 between ITB and BMT arm was assessed. Change=NPRS at month 6 - NPRS at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Their Primary Therapeutic Goal Assessed With the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>month 6</time_frame>
    <description>GAS is designed to measure the achievement of treatment goals using the following 6 levels of achievement: worse than start (-3), much less than expected (-2), somewhat less than expected (-1), as expected (0), somewhat more than expected (+1), much more than expected (+2). The primary therapy goal and the criteria for the levels of achievement was defined by the medical team together with the patient and his/her family/legal representative/caregiver at the first day of the study. The number and percentage of patients who achieved the therapeutic goal at Month 6 was compared between the ITB and BMT arm.</description>

    <measure>Change in Euro QoL Group-5 Dimensional, 3 Level Version (EQ-5D-3L) From Baseline to Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a generic measure of health status consisting in the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system is characterized on five dimensions: mobility, self-care, ability to undertake usual activities, pain and anxiety/depression. Patients were asked to indicate their level of health on each dimension using one of three levels: &quot;no health problems&quot;, &quot;moderate health problems&quot;, and &quot;severe health problems&quot;. Responses from the questionnaire were converted to a single health index utility score; this ranges from -0.595 to 1. EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 where the endpoints are labelled 'Best imaginable health state' (100) and 'Worst imaginable health state' (0). Change in EQ-5D-3L utility score and VAS score from baseline to month 6 between ITB and BMT arm were assessed. Change=EQ-5D-3L utility or VAS score at month 6 - EQ-5D-3L utility or VAS score.</description>

    <measure>Change in SF-12 (12-item Short Form) From Baseline to Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is generic assessment of health-related quality of life, which evaluates 8 health dimensions (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health, and general health). Subscale scores for each dimension were aggregated into summary scores for physical (PCS) and mental health (MCS) components (ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health). Changes in the PCS and MCS from baseline to Month 6 were both compared between the BMT and ITB arms. Change=SF-12 score at month 6 - SF-12 score at baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SS-QoL ) From Baseline to Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and month 6</time_frame>
    <description>SS-QoL questionnaire is a self-assessed quality of life questionnaire specifically designed for post-stroke patients. It evaluates 49 items across 12-domains: personality, energy, language, mobility, vision, upper extremity function, thinking, mood, work/productivity, self-care, and family and social roles. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert Scale, measuring either positive or negative response to a statement. Summary score is composed of an unweighted average of the 12 domain scores, with higher scores indicating better QoL. Total score ranges from 1 to 5. Change in SS-QoL summary score from baseline to month 6 between ITB and BMT arm was assessed.
Change=SS-QoL score at month 6 - SS-QoL score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change in Average Ashworth Scale (AS) in Affected Lower Extremities From Baseline to Month 6</title>
        <description>AS is a manual test, measuring the resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity. Scores range from 1-5, with 5 choices. A score of 1 indicates no resistance, and 5 indicates rigidity. The following muscle groups in the lower extremities were assessed: hip flexors, hip adductors, knee extensors, knee flexors, plantar flexors and ankle-dorsal flexors. Average AS was calculated as the average of AS scores of the 6 muscles of the affected lower extremity. Change in average AS in affected lower extremities from baseline to month 6 between ITB and BMT arm was assessed.

        <description>NPRS is designed to assess the level of pain a patient is feeling at a point in time. The following questions has been presented to patients: What is your actual spasticity-related or spasm-related pain? What was your least spasticity-related or spasm-related pain during the last week? What was your worst spasticity-related or spasm-related pain during the last week? The patient indicated how much pain he is feeling on a scale from 0 to 10. A score of 0 (zero) is “no pain” while a score of 10 (ten) is “worst possible pain”. Change in NPRS related to actual, least or worst pain from baseline to month 6 between ITB and BMT arm was assessed. Change=NPRS at month 6 - NPRS at baseline.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a generic measure of health status consisting in the EQ-5D-3L descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system is characterized on five dimensions: mobility, self-care, ability to undertake usual activities, pain and anxiety/depression. Patients were asked to indicate their level of health on each dimension using one of three levels: “no health problems”, “moderate health problems”, and “severe health problems”. Responses from the questionnaire were converted to a single health index utility score; this ranges from -0.595 to 1. EQ VAS records the patient’s self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 where the endpoints are labelled ‘Best imaginable health state’ (100) and ‘Worst imaginable health state’ (0). Change in EQ-5D-3L utility score and VAS score from baseline to month 6 between ITB and BMT arm were assessed. Change=EQ-5D-3L utility or VAS score at month 6 - EQ-5D-3L utility or VAS score.</description>

        <description>SS-QoL questionnaire is a self-assessed quality of life questionnaire specifically designed for post-stroke patients. It evaluates 49 items across 12-domains: personality, energy, language, mobility, vision, upper extremity function, thinking, mood, work/productivity, self-care, and family and social roles. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert Scale, measuring either positive or negative response to a statement. Summary score is composed of an unweighted average of the 12 domain scores, with higher scores indicating better QoL. Total score ranges from 1 to 5. Change in SS-QoL summary score from baseline to month 6 between ITB and BMT arm was assessed.
Change=SS-QoL score at month 6 - SS-QoL score at baseline.</description>

          <title>Change in Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SS-QoL ) From Baseline to Month 6</title>
          <description>SS-QoL questionnaire is a self-assessed quality of life questionnaire specifically designed for post-stroke patients. It evaluates 49 items across 12-domains: personality, energy, language, mobility, vision, upper extremity function, thinking, mood, work/productivity, self-care, and family and social roles. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert Scale, measuring either positive or negative response to a statement. Summary score is composed of an unweighted average of the 12 domain scores, with higher scores indicating better QoL. Total score ranges from 1 to 5. Change in SS-QoL summary score from baseline to month 6 between ITB and BMT arm was assessed.
Change=SS-QoL score at month 6 - SS-QoL score at baseline.</description>
