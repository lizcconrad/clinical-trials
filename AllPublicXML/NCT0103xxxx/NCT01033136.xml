  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of Multiple Channel Exposure
      Therapy-Veterans (MCET-V) as a treatment for returning service members with comorbid PTSD and
      panic disorder (PD) in two phases. The second phase of the study will examine the
      effectiveness of MCET-V by comparing it to Cognitive Processing Therapy, a standard PTSD
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increasing number of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF)
      Veterans returning from war-zone areas, many will experience anxiety disorders such as PTSD
      and comorbid problems. Currently, about one in every six OIF/OEF Veterans experiences PTSD
      and co-occurring PD. Although effective treatments exist for treating one or the other, we do
      not yet have treatments that can simultaneously target PTSD and PD. Thus, recent attention
      has focused on the development of multi-component treatments that simultaneously address PTSD
      and PD. This study is the first systematic investigation of a time-limited, multi-component
      cognitive-behavioral treatment for Veterans with specific comorbid anxiety problems. The
      purpose of the second phase of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the
      multi-component cognitive-behavioral treatment in comparison to standard PTSD treatment in
      military personnel returning from active duty.
