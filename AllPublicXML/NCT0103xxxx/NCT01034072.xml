      The purpose of this study is to evaluate for iron overload in pediatric oncology and
      transplant patients who have completed their treatment between one to ten years ago.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long term survivors of childhood cancer, are a distinct group requiring specific follow-up in
      order to enhance their quality of life. Studies have shown that many of these patients will
      go on to develop chronic issues within different organ systems. Because of the iron burden of
      the frequent transfusions required to care for these patients, iron overload may indeed be
      one of the problems these survivors potentially face. Research primarily in thalassemia and
      bone marrow transplant patients who were extensively transfused has shown that iron overload
      can have a significant impact on their overall health. Complications from increased iron
      burden can include growth retardation, gonadal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, impaired glucose
      metabolism, cardiac arrhythmias and failure, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, and increased
      susceptibility to infections. However all of these conditions related to iron overload can be
      prevented with the use of either phlebotomy or chelation therapy. Based on this knowledge,
      our objective is to determine if pediatric oncology and transplant patients heavily supported
      with transfusions develop consequential biochemical and clinical evidence of iron overload.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients six and a half to twenty five years of age with a history of acute
             myelogenous leukemia, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and neuroblastoma
             who have completed their treatment or received their last packed red blood cell
             transfusion at least one year prior to enrollment (which ever occurred later) and are
             one to ten years post-treatment.

          -  Patients six and a half to twenty five years of age who have undergone hematopoietic
             stem cell transplant for any malignancy and are at least one year from their last
             transfusion or transplant date prior to enrollment (which ever occurred later) and are
             one to ten years post-transplant.

          -  Patients who were treated at Schneider Children's Hospital or at Children's Hospital
             of Philadelphia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have clinical evidence of chronic graft vs. host disease of skin, liver
             or gastrointestinal tract.

          -  Patients with a chronic infection (viral hepatitis), liver disease (fibrosis,
             cirrhosis), or a history of radiation to the liver.

          -  Patients who cannot have an MRI due to metallic implants (i.e. pacemakers, prosthetic
             valves, etc.)

          -  Patients who are pregnant.
