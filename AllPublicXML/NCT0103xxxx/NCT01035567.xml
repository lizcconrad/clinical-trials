        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 or more

          -  Angiographically confirmed multivessel CAD with involved LAD and critical (&gt;70%)lesion
             in at least one (apart LAD) major epicardial vessel amenable to both PCI and CABG

          -  Indication for revascularization based upon symptoms of angina and/or objective
             evidence of myocardial ischaemia

          -  Patient is willing to comply with all follow-up visits

          -  Patient signed an Informed Consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe congestive heart failure (class III or IV according to NYHA, or pulmonary
             edema, cardiogenic shock) at the time of enrollment

          -  Prior surgery with the opening of pericardium or pleura

          -  Prior stroke (within 6 months)or more than 6 months if there are substantial
             neurological defects

          -  Prior history of significant bleeding (within previous 6 months) that might be
             expected to occur during PCI/CABG related anticoagulation

          -  One or more chronic total occlusions in major coronary territories

          -  Left main stenosis (at least 50% diameter stenosis)

          -  Acute ST-elevation MI within 72 hours prior to enrollment requiring revascularization

          -  Planned simultaneous surgical procedure unrelated to coronary revascularization (e.g.
             valve repair/replacement, aneurysmectomy, carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting)

          -  Contraindication to either CABG, MIDCAB or PCI/DES because of a coexisting clinical
             condition

          -  Significant leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, or known bleeding
             diathesis.

          -  Intolerance or contraindication to aspirin or both clopidogrel and ticlopidine

             oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, active hepatitis or
             significant hepatic failure, severe renal disease

          -  Suspected pregnancy. A pregnancy test will be administered prerandomization to all
             women of child-bearing age

          -  Concurrent enrollment in another clinical trial

          -  Patient inaccessible for follow-up visits required by protocol
