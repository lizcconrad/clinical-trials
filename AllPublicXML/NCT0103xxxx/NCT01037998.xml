  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iressa [epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)] has been reported to
      activity against Non-small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) failed previous chemotherapy. UFUR was
      found to have anti-angiogenesis effect when long term treatment was given. Combination of
      EGFR-TKI and anti-angiogenesis agents is a novel treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iressa is a selective epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).
      It is an orally active agent for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in those who
      have failed a previous platinum-based regimen and taxane treatment. UFUR (Tegafur/Uracil) is
      effective agent against chemo-na√Øve NSCLC. It has anti-angiogenesis effect when used as
      long-term low dose treatment.

      Present phase II randomized clinical trial is designed to answer whether or not adding an
      oral anti-angiogenesis agent (UFUR), that has low toxicity profiles when long term use, to
      EGFR-TKI (Iressa) could increase patients survival and response rate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic or cytological diagnosis of NSCLC who failed previous platinum-based and
             taxanes chemotherapy.

          -  No prior radiotherapy on measurable lesion(s).

          -  Performance status of 0 to 3 on the Zubrod scale. (Reference 1)

          -  Clinically measurable disease, defined as bidimensionally measurable lesions with
             clearly defined margins on x-ray, scan, or physical examination. Lesions serving as
             measurable disease must be at least 1 cm by 1 cm, as defined by CT scan, MRI, or chest
             x-ray.

          -  Informed consent from patient.

          -  Males or females 18 years of age or older.

          -  If female: childbearing potential either terminated by surgery, radiation, or
             menopause, or attenuated by use of an approved contraceptive method (intrauterine
             contraceptive device [IUD], birth control pills, or barrier device) during and for
             three months after trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active infection (at the discretion of the investigator).

          -  Inadequate liver function (total bilirubin &gt;1.5 times above normal range); alanine
             transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) greater than 5 times normal.

          -  Inadequate renal function (creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL).

          -  Breast feeding.

          -  Second primary malignancy (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or adequately
             treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin)

          -  Concomitant myelosuppressive radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or
             immunotherapy will not be allowed except as for palliative radiation to non-measurable
             lesion.
