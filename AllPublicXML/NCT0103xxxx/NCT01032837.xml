  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, multi-center study of Tamiflu (Oseltamivir) will evaluate the
      efficacy against viral activity, the effectiveness in resolving the disease symptoms, and the
      safety and tolerability in patients with influenza. Patients with (H1N1) 2009 influenza
      strain or influenza A are eligible for this study. Patients will be randomized to one of four
      treatment regimens. Patients will receive oral doses of either 75 mg (adults) or 150 mg
      (adults) of study drug twice daily for 5 or 10 consecutive days. The dose will be body
      weight-adjusted for pediatric patients.

    <measure>Time to Cessation of Viral Shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 40</time_frame>
    <description>The time to cessation of viral shedding was measured by viral culture and defined as the time from treatment initiation to the time of the first negative culture with no subsequent positive cultures. Any patient with a positive culture at the last sample time was censored at that time point. Median time to cessation was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>

    <description>Viral shedding was measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from samples obtained from nasal and throat swabs and performed by the central laboratory.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Development of Oseltamivir-Resistant Influenza Virus</measure>
    <time_frame>40 days</time_frame>
    <description>The last positive viral isolate from each patient was tested for reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir. Phenotypic assay was performed to determine the susceptibility of the last positive viral isolate from each patient. If required, a genotypic assay to determine the contribution of both the neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) genes to decreased susceptibility was also performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Resolution of Fever</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 through Day 40</time_frame>
    <description>Temperature was recorded by the patient in a diary twice daily for 10 days and once daily thereafter. Fever was defined as a body temperature greater than or including 37.8 degrees Celsius (or ≥ 100.04 Fahrenheit). Time to resolution of fever was defined as the total number of hours from the first dose of study medication to the first time at which temperature is ≤ 37.2 degrees Celsius and lasts at least 21.5 hours. Patients who were still febrile at the end of the study period were censored at that time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Alleviation of All Clinical Symptoms - Children</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 40</time_frame>
    <description>Daily influenza-like symptoms (such as poor appetite, irritability, low energy, nasal congestion, runny nose etc) were recorded in a diary on a scale from 0 (no problem) to 3 (major problem). A patient is considered free of all clinical influenza symptoms if all symptoms were checked as 'no problem' or 'minor problem' (i.e., symptom score ≤1). Time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms was defined as the number of hours from the first dose to the first time the patient had alleviation of all symptoms. Patients without alleviation of symptoms were censored at the last available assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Alleviation of All Clinical Symptoms - Adults</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 40</time_frame>
    <description>Daily influenza-like symptoms (such as nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, aches and pains, fatigue, headache, chills) were recorded in a diary on a scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). A patient is considered free of all clinical influenza symptoms if all symptoms were checked as 'absent' or 'mild' (i.e., symptom score ≤1). Time to alleviation of all clinical symptoms was defined as the number of hours from the first dose to the first time the patient had alleviation of all symptoms. Patients without alleviation of symptoms were censored at the last available assessment.</description>

        <title>Time to Cessation of Viral Shedding</title>
        <description>The time to cessation of viral shedding was measured by viral culture and defined as the time from treatment initiation to the time of the first negative culture with no subsequent positive cultures. Any patient with a positive culture at the last sample time was censored at that time point. Median time to cessation was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>

        <description>The last positive viral isolate from each patient was tested for reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir. Phenotypic assay was performed to determine the susceptibility of the last positive viral isolate from each patient. If required, a genotypic assay to determine the contribution of both the neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) genes to decreased susceptibility was also performed.</description>
