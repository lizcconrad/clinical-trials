    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to evaluate the performance of the Chembio Diagnostics Systems,
      Inc. DPP® HIV 1/2 rapid test. The device is intended to qualitatively detect the presence of
      antibodies against HIV-1/2 in oral fluid, whole blood (capillary and venous), serum or
      plasma. This study will assess the DPP® HIV 1/2 Screen assay's ability to detect HIV-1.
