  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown &quot;Doing the month&quot;, a traditional practice for postpartum women in
      China and other Asian countries, may be associated with higher prevalence of postpartum
      problems. The current multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to evaluate outcomes
      of diet and lifestyle interventions in Chinese postpartum women.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current multicenter RCT will be conducted in three representative areas in China,
      Shandong province, Hubei province and Guangdong province, which locate in northern, central
      and southern parts of China, respectively. Women who attend routine pregnancy diagnosis in
      hospitals or maternal healthcare centers will be invited to take part in this study. At least
      800 women who meet our eligibility criteria will be recruited and randomly assigned to the
      intervention group (n&gt;=400) and the control group (n&gt;=400). A three-dimension comprehensive
      intervention strategy, which incorporates intervention measures simultaneously to individual
      postpartum woman, their family members and community environment, will be utilized to
      maximize the effectiveness of intervention. Regular visiting and follow-up will be done in
      both group; nutrition and health-related measurements will be assessed both before and after
      the intervention.

    <description>For individual postpartum woman, we will set antepartum participatory training courses, provide specially prepared brochures and supporting VCD, set up a specialized counseling hotline and give individual bedside guidance after birth. For their family members, we will invite every postpartum woman's husband and mother to take part in workshops or seminars, making them know some basic knowledge of postpartum care, and persuading them to promote adoption of the diet and lifestyle we advocated by the postpartum woman. For community environment, we will put up posters about basic knowledge of postpartum care in the community bulletin boards for general population educating and mobilize community leaders and heads from and maternal and child health centers for maximum support.</description>
