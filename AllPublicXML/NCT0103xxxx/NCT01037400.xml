      This study will examine the magnitude and time course of changes in circulating (serum and
      plasma) biomarker concentrations associated with musculoskeletal injury created by total knee
      replacement surgery. The sensitivity to injury will be characterized by the changes in mean
      serum concentration before and after surgery. Specificity for the injured state will be
      evaluated comparing the baseline to peak change (injury response) with the pre-surgery to
      follow-up baseline fluctuation (i.e. measurement noise).
