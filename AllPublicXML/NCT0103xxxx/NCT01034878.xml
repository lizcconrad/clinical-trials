    <textblock>
      Sunitinib is the registered treatment for first-line therapy of metastatic clear-cell
      carcinoma of the kidney.Data from the Expanded Access Study have shown activity also in
      non-clear cell renal cancer (NCCRC). The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the
      anti-tumor activity and safety of sunitinib as a first-line therapy in metastatic NCCRC
      patients.

      This is a prospective, open label, multicenter phase II study to evaluate efficacy of
      Sunitinib (in advanced/metastatic renal cancer with non-clear cell histology (papillary or
      chromophobe).

      Sunitinib will be administered orally at a dose of 50 mg once daily, in six weeks cycles
      consisting of 4 weeks on treatment followed by 2 weeks off.

      Treatment with the study drug will continue until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      The planned total sample size for this study is 55 patients. Approximately 10 study sites
      will be involved.
