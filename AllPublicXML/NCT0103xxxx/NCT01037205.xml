      This protocol will seek to enroll adult otherwise healthy subjects presenting with
      influenza-like illness (ILI). Subjects will enter the study based on listed
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, including a positive diagnostic test for influenza virus (IFV).

      Based upon a Rapid Diagnostic Test of IFV, subjects will be randomized into one of three
      groups: a single dose DAS181 10 mg group, a multiple dose DAS181 10 mg, 10 mg, 10 mg dose
      group or a placebo group.

      The full analysis set will include subjects with confirmed influenza as documented with Rapid
      Diagnostic Testing. The set will be used for activity analysis and will include all
      randomized subjects with baseline and treatment data. Study staff may visit subjects outside
      the clinic. Per protocol, the safety analysis sets are described below in Statistical
      Methods.

      Peripheral venous blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenic analysis of DAS181
      will be obtained on 10 subjects enrolled in each study arm.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects in generally good health in the opinion of the investigator
             as determined by vital signs, medical history, and a targeted physical exam based on
             medical history.

          2. Subjects must be able to verbalize understanding of the consent form, provide written
             informed consent and verbalize willingness to complete study procedures.

          3. Be 18 to 70 years of age (inclusive).

          4. Subjects must weigh at least 55 kg and must have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of no greater
             than 35.99

          5. Febrile, oral temperature &gt;100°F (37.8°C) and one or more of the following:

               -  Respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, nasal symptoms)

               -  Constitutional symptom (headache, myalgia, sweat/chills, prostration)

          6. Positive rapid antigen test (RAT) for influenza performed using FDA-Cleared and
             CLIA-Waived commercially available rapid antigen test. A subject may be enrolled
             following a positive RAT of any manufacturer. Test may be conducted by a primary care
             physician prior to study enrollment if documentation of a positive RAT can be provided
             (documentation may consist of subjects medical records and must be included in subject
             documentation). A subject with a negative RAT result may still enroll if the sponsor
             and investigator agree that there is a known influenza outbreak circulating in the
             community. Blood pressure within normal limits (systolic 90-150 mmHg; diastolic 50-95
             mmHg) and heart rate between 45 and 140 beats per minute.

          7. Blood pressure within normal limits (systolic 90-150 mmHg; diastolic 50-95 mmHg) and
             heart rate between 45 and 140 beats per minute.

          8. Onset of illness no more than 48 hours prior to diagnosis. Note: Time of onset of
             illness is defined as either (1) the time when the temperature was first measured as
             elevated (at least one degree (°C) of elevation temperature), OR (2) the time when the
             subject experienced the presence of at least one respiratory symptom or the presence
             of at least one constitutional symptom.

          9. Female subjects must be post-menopausal (one year or greater without menses),
             surgically incapable of childbearing, practicing abstinence or practicing two
             effective methods of birth control. Acceptable methods may include intrauterine
             device, spermicide, barrier and hormonal contraception. A female subject must agree to
             practice an acceptable method of birth control during study period and for 12 weeks
             after study terminates. All female subjects regardless of menopausal status or
             surgical history must have had a negative urine pregnancy test (urine betahuman
             chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) during the screening visit. The urine pregnancy test
             must be sensitive to at least 50 mU/mL of beta-hCG.

         10. Male subjects must agree to use a medically accepted form of contraception from time
             of enrollment to 12 weeks after study termination.

        Exclusion:

          1. Have received any investigational drug or vaccine within 8 weeks prior to study drug
             dosing.

          2. Have had a serious adverse reaction or hypersensitivity to any drug.

          3. Have received blood products within 6 months of study enrollment.

          4. Have concurrent cystic fibrosis, emphysema or previous episodes of anaphylaxis.

          5. Have sickle-cell disease.

          6. Allergy or history of allergy to milk or lactose.

          7. Any history of congenital or acquired bleeding abnormalities.

          8. Existence of any surgical, medical, or laboratory condition that, in the judgment of
             the clinical investigator, might interfere with the safety, distribution, metabolism
             or excretion of the drug.

          9. Use of antiviral influenza medications within 10 days prior to screening (subjects
             will be prohibited from taking antiviral influenza medications during the course of
             the trial).

         10. Current clinical evidence of a recognized or suspected uncontrolled non-influenza
             infectious illness with onset prior to screening.

         18. Subjects with a chronic medical condition that have initiated or changed dosing or
             regimen of prescription medications for their chronic medical condition within the
             last 3 months (any changes in chronic medications during the 28 day enrollment period
             will be captured in the source documentation under concomitant medications).

         19. Subjects with previous or current history of the following systemic disorders:
             immunological disorders, HBV, HCV or cirrhosis, transplant recipients, HIV infection,
             or other immunosuppressive illness.

         20. Subjects with cancer or history of hematologic malignancy. Cancer is defined as any
             active neoplastic diseases excluding noninvasive basal cell carcinoma.
