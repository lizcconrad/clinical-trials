    <textblock>
      Gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) are regarded as a fairly rare
      disease. They are derived from the neuroendocrine system of the gastrointestinal tract and
      the pancreas and share common clinical features. So far, there is still uncertainty about the
      cell biology and mechanistic regulation of these tumours. Therefore targeted treatment is
      limited and management challenging. Treatment options include surgery, medical and ablative
      therapy, and more recently peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy. In order to better
      understand the characteristics of GEP-NETs and to evaluate treatment strategies, the SwissNET
      registry aims at the collection of data from patients presenting with a GEP-NET in
      Switzerland. Data will be entered prospectively and anonymized in a specifically designed
      database after the patient has given informed consent. All hospitals and general
      practitioners are invited to report on patients with a GEP-NET diagnosis and to participate
      to the registry. Data will be evaluated within regular time frames, focussing on types of
      GEP-NETs, treatment modalities and patient outcomes (e.g. mortality, hospitalisation rate),
      thereby contributing to the better understanding of these tumours.

      Background

      Gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs) are generally classified as rare
      diseases. Little is known about their cell biology and their mechanistic regulation. During
      the last years, the incidence of GEP-NETs is continuously increasing worldwide. In parallel,
      novel treatment options are currently evaluated which may substantially improve prognosis of
      patients with NETs. Data on such tumours in Switzerland, however, is scarce and treatment
      strategies vary throughout the country.

      Objective

      To systematically and prospectively collect clinical information of patients with GEP-NETs in
      Switzerland based on a histologically confirmed diagnosis.

      Methods

      All NETs of both, gastrointestinal and pulmonary origin are included provided that patients
      have given informed consent. Data will be entered prospectively and anonymised in a
      specifically designed database. Contributing centres and general practitioners are visited by
      a study nurse, patient files are analysed and data is transferred to the database. In case of
      conflicting evidence, questions are resolved in collaboration with a review board of
      SwissNET. Evaluation of treatment modalities and patient outcomes (e.g. mortality,
      hospitalisation rate) will take place within regular time frames.
