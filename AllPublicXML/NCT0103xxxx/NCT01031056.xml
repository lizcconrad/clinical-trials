  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have an active research program in gastrointestinal cancers including clinical trials,
      epidemiologic, and translational studies. We would like to establish a biospecimen bank
      linked to useful clinical information in order to learn more about diagnostic, predictive and
      prognostic markers for gastrointestinal cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1. To collect and store tumor and normal tissue (previously collected paraffin embedded or
      frozen specimen) and blood in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. Collect detailed clinical information via a patient questionnaire that includes
           demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, family, past medical, medication and cancer
           histories

        2. Collect details about the tumor specimen extracted from patient charts.
