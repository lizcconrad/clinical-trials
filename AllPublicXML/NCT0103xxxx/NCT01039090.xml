  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Parkinson's disease, treatment mainly aims to improve motor functions. However, other
      dysfunctions are often observed in Parkinson's patients, and may have important consequences
      on the quality of life of patients.

      Cognitive and neuropsychological troubles may be observed, as memory impairment or anxiety
      for example. As this kind of troubles is worrying for the patient himself (herself) and
      his/her family, treatment needs to take into account those troubles in addition to motor
      difficulties. In our centre, we have already used continuous Apomorphine infusions among
      Parkinson's patients and it seems to have good results. The present study aims to objectively
      assess the efficacy of continuous Apomorphine infusions on cognitive and neuropsychological
      functions in Parkinson's disease using clinical and positron emission tomography (PET)-scan
      measures.
