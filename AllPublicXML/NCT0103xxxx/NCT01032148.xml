  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out the effects of a drug called LBH589 when given to
      people with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The safety of this
      drug will also be studied. The participants' physical state, changes in the size of the
      tumor, or state of Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and laboratory findings taken while
      on-study will help the researchers decide if LBH589 is safe and effective.

      This is an open-label, standard 3-3 dose finding scheme with a modification that allows
      intra-patient dose modification to determine maximum tolerated dose and toxicity profile of
      LBH589 in patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
