  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a randomised controlled trial to investigate the clinical
      and cost effectiveness of Ramipril which is an anti-hypertensive medication in patients with
      intermittent claudication. The investigators aim to recruit 78 participants in total. The
      investigators will randomise the 78 participants into two groups: Ramipril group with 39
      participants and Placebo group with 39 participants. The investigators will measure
      Ramipril's effect on walking by doing a simple treadmill test and measuring the maximum
      walking distance the participant can walk. The investigators also want to examine Ramipril's
      effect on arterial function, cardiovascular prognosis, quality of life and cost
      effectiveness.
