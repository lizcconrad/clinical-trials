  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The field of secondary prevention remains an extremely important goal for diagnostic and
      therapeutic approaches keeping in mind that 40% of all patients with acute myocardial
      infarction have prediabetes, commonly as impaired glucose tolerance, which has not been known
      and treated and for which there are no guidelines for treatment. In this context,
      accumulating evidence shows beneficial effects for treating diabetes mellitus early in the
      course of disease, whereas other evidence shows that aggressive antidiabetic therapy may be
      associated with undesired risks. Accordingly, the present randomized and controlled pilot
      study is designed as hypothesis creating study to create first data about potential
      medication in early type 2 diabetes including impaired glucose tolerance of patients with
      known coronary artery disease as means of secondary prevention by comparing oral antidiabetic
      therapy with metformin with insulin glargine o.d. and by studying the respective effects on
      cardiovascular function and metabolism both in the fasting state and after a standardized
      meal. As diastolic myocardial function has emerged as important prognosticator, the
      hypothesis was tested that treatment with insulin glargine improves myocardial function in
      patients with coronary artery disease and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes including impaired
      glucose tolerance.

      This is a single centre, short term (24 weeks), therapy controlled and randomized prospective
      study with blinded analysis of the ultrasound data in 28 patients with known coronary artery
      disease, normal systolic cardiac function and with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes including
      impaired glucose tolerance who are treated by ≤1 oral antidiabetic medication. After
      recruitment and informed consent, patients are randomized to two treatment arms which takes
      into account age and presence or absence of therapy with statins.

      In one treatment arm, therapy is based on insulin glargine sc o.d., while in the other
      treatment arm, therapy is based on oral metformin, up to 2000 mg daily. Both treatment arms
      will be titrated to the target of fasting glucose ≤110 mg/dl during the first 12 weeks. The
      patients in the insulin treatment arm will be instructed in the skills of self-medication by
      the departmental diabetic teaching programme prior to starting study medication and are
      encouraged to keep records of any episode of hypoglycemia throughout the study.Outpatients
      visits for metabolic control and ultrasound assessment are at weeks 4, 12 and 24 after
      baseline and are associated with life style instructions for all patients.
