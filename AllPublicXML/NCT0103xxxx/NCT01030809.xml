  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. During
      disease exacerbations, pharmacological or surgical intervention is usually needed to
      re-establish remission. Ideally, strategies should be employed to maintain patients in
      long-term remission while minimizing exposure to corticosteroids and reduce therapy-related
      toxicity.

      Nevertheless, in reality many patients with CD do not receive effective therapy and their
      disease often remains active, leading to uncontrolled inflammation and complications from
      either the underlying disease or corticosteroids. Although treatment guidelines exist, they
      do not adequately define treatment goals and the duration of treatment cycles is not
      specified Optimizing outcomes in CD requires rapid control of inflammation. Intuitively,
      persistent inflammation leads to persistent symptoms, tissue damage, and disease-related
      complications. Conventional therapy is frequently ineffective in moderate to severe CD, and
      is often continued for a prolonged time. Consequently, many patients are under-treated. An
      alternate strategy that minimizes the use of corticosteroids and encourages the earlier use
      of immunosuppressive agents and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists may be optimal.
      However it is unknown whether this approach is superior to usual care
