    <textblock>
      The main objective of this pilot study is to observe and document the range of changes in the
      blood concentrations of certain hormones, inflammatory chemicals and immune chemicals in
      response to the stimulus of Head and Neck cancer

      This project is in keeping with the strategy of the anaesthetic and intensive care
      departments to push towards greater understanding of the immune, metabolic and inflammatory
      changes associated with surgery and how these may be modified through use of different
      anaesthetic and intensive care techniques. Through increased understanding of the stress,
      inflammatory and immune responses to surgery we may be able to modulate peri-operative care
      to reduce cytotoxic(Natural Killer and Cytotoxic T cell) immunosuppression and hence
      micrometastatic spread at the time of surgery in future studies.
