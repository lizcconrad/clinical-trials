      Background:

      - The Neuroimaging Research Branch of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is
      interested in developing a pool of potential research participants who may be eligible for
      research studies on drug abuse and addiction, pharmacological and psychosocial therapies for
      substance addiction, and the long-term effects of drugs on the development, function, and
      structure of the brain and other organ systems. To develop this pool of potential
      participants, researchers intend to screen adolescents and adults who may be eligible for
      future research studies.

      Objectives:

      - To identify, recruit, and screen participants for NIDA neuroimaging research protocols.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 13 years of age and older who are able to provide informed consent.

      Design:

        -  Eligible participants will undergo two screening interviews: a telephone interview and
           an in-person interview. The phone interview will determine eligibility for the in-person
           interview. Adolescents who are eligible for further screening must bring a parent or
           guardian with them to the in-person interview.

        -  The in-person interview may require up to five visits to the NIDA clinical center. The
           in-person visit will involve any or all of the following procedures: (1) full physical
           examination and medical history; (2) psychiatric interview; (3) psychological testing;
           (4) electrocardiogram; (5) samples of blood, urine, and hair; and (6) other minimally
           invasive procedures as directed by the research staff.

        -  During the screening process, participants will be explicitly asked for permission to
           recontact them after the 1-year duration of the screening protocol. For minors, both the
           adolescent and the parent/guardian must agree to future contact.

        -  No clinical care will be provided under this protocol.

      This protocol describes the screening process used by the National Institute on Drug Abuse
      (NIDA IRP) to assess potential research participants eligibility for entering protocols of
      either the NIDA/IRP. Through its clinical research protocols, the IRPs attempt to: elucidate
      the nature of drug abuse and addiction; determine the potential use of new therapies, both
      pharmacological and psychosocial; and decipher the long-term effects of drugs of abuse on the
      development, maturation, function, and structure of the brain and other organ systems. In
      support of the IRPs work, the scientific goal of this screening protocol is to assess
      potential research participants eligibility for the IRPs research studies. Screening will
      include medical and psychological tests and procedures. The data collected during screening
      are a unique and valuable source of information that aids in the IRPs missions. Therefore, a
      secondary goal of this protocol is to obtain data that characterizes the population of
      subjects contacting the IRPs about research participation and to analyze data so obtained,
      such as that on the prevalence and consequences of HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, and related
      diseases. The population screened includes male and female adolescents ages 13-17 for NIDA
      only and adults age &gt; 18 for both IRPs. Screening procedures include standard medical and
      psychological tests and procedures are minimal risk. There is no direct benefit to subjects.
      Participants are paid for undergoing the screening process.

      Most genetics data will be collected under the aegis of protocol 10-DA-N457 and will be
      compared with data collected under this study. Some studies require genotyping to be done as
      part of screening. Those DNA samples will be stored so that if active or returning
      participants are screened for future studies requiring genotyping during screening an
      additional blood draw won t be required.
