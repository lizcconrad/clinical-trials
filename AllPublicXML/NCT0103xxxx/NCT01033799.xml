      This single-center, randomized, double-blind and controlled study aims to examine the effect
      of a fermented dairy product containing the probiotic Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001
      (Actimel® = tested product) on the incidence of respiratory and gastro-intestinal common
      infectious diseases (cumulated number of infections during the intervention period: primary
      criteria), and on immune functions in healthy shift workers. Volunteers received either
      200g/day of tested product (N=500) or control product (N=500) for 3-months, followed by a
      1-month follow-up.
