  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the addition of panitumumab to standard
      chemotherapy in first-line treatment of advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer improves the
      treatment outcome. Patients are selected based on triple mutational status.

    <textblock>
      Advanced NSCLC holds a very poor prognosis with a moderate response rate to standard
      chemotherapy. The standard first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC is platinum based
      combination chemotherapy. The response rates are less than 30% and a substantial amount of
      patients will experience unnecessary toxicity in terms of e.g. nausea, vomiting, neuropathies
      or a considerable risk of renal toxicity. The median progression free survival is 3-4 months
      and consequently, the median overall survival is less than one year (Hotta et al 2007).
      Addition of new biological agents to standard chemotherapy regimens may improve the outcome
      for these patients.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    1. Very low enrollment rate.

      2. Recent studies question the effect of adding panitumumab in this category of patients.

      3. Too high toxicity rate
