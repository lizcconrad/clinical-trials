      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy, such as proton beam radiation therapy, that
      delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause
      less damage to normal tissue in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma. PURPOSE: This phase I
      trial is studying the side effects and and best dose of proton beam radiation therapy in
      treating patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma.

      Detailed DescriptionPRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and toxicity of proton radiotherapy for retroperitoneal
      sarcomas.

      II. To determine the maximum safe proton radiotherapy dose for retroperitoneal sarcomas.

      III. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of proton radiotherapy for patients with
      potentially resectable retroperitoneal sarcoma. (Pre-operative cohort) IV. To assess acute
      side effects from irradiation using proton beam therapy and dose/volume constraints that are
      derived from conventional radiotherapy. (Postoperative cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical effectiveness of proton radiotherapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma.

      II. To determine the long-term toxicity of proton radiotherapy to the abdomen and pelvis
      region.

      III. To monitor for effects of proton treatment on tumor and normal tissues using
      radiographic imaging (both cohorts) or ex-vivo analysis of tissue samples (preoperative
      cohort only).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histologic diagnosis of sarcoma in the
             peritoneum/retroperitoneum/pelvis are eligible for this study

          -  Patients must have either radiographic(pre-operative) or pathologic (post-operative)
             evidence of disease limited the peritoneum/retroperitoneum/pelvis without evidence of
             peritoneal sarcomatosis

          -  For pre-operative cases, the patient must be considered operable/resectable as judged
             by the attending surgeon (this is determined by an extensive radiographic and medical
             evaluation that includes but is not limited to: CT Chest and Abdomen with contrast,
             MRI/CT Brain and Medical/Cardiac Clearance)

          -  Patients should have an EGOC status of 0-2

          -  Patients must sign a document that indicates that they are aware of the investigative
             nature of the treatment of this protocol, and the potential benefits and risks
             (patients unwilling or unable to sign informed consent are excluded from the study)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential as long as she agrees to use a recognized method of
             birth control (e.g. oral contraceptive, IUD, condoms or other barrier methods etc.);
             hysterectomy or menopause must be clinically documented

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior or simultaneous malignancies within the past two years (other than cutaneous
             squamous or basal cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or thyroid carcinoma)

          -  Pregnant women, women planning to become pregnant and women that are nursing

          -  Patients who experience surgical complications that prevent radiation from starting
             for 5 months or more, unless there is evidence of gross residual disease
