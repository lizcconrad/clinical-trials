    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter phase II study comparing risedronate 35mg
      (ActonelR 35mg weekly tablet) versus placebo in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis
      (AS) treated with standard first and second-line therapies.

      Primary efficacy endpoint: Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). The
      time schedule for performing the BASDAI was at screening, upon inclusion (T0), then after 3,
      6 and 12 months or at the time of premature withdrawal in case of drop-out.

      secondary endpoints:

        -  Clinical endpoints: The secondary efficacy measures were the following: Bath Ankylosing
           Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) , Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index
           (BASMI), ASAS (Assessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis) Working Group core set of domains,
           Spinal pain VAS, ESR, CRP and the percentage of patients achieving 20% or greater
           decrease in each of these parameters. These parameters were determined at T0, T3, T6,
           T12 or at the time of premature withdrawal in case of drop-out. The spinal pain assessed
           by VAS was also done at screening.

        -  DEXA: Dual Energy X-Ray-Absorptiometry (DEXA) measurements were performed in all
           patients upon inclusion (T0) and at the end of the study (T12).

        -  Biochemical markers: selected biochemical markers of bone metabolism were measured at
           T0, T3, T6 and T12 or at the time of premature withdrawal in case of drop-out using
           commercially available kits. Bone formation was assessed by serum bone-specific alkaline
           phosphatase (BAP) and osteocalcin (OC) levels using commercially available kits. Bone
           resorption was assessed in serum by the C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen
           degradation (Crosslaps R) and urinary N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen
           degradation (Osteomark R).
