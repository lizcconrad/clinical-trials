  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the basis for the reported good effects of
      antioxidant supplementation. A blood test using Mass Spectrometry will measure DNA damage
      which is expected to decrease with antioxidant administration and therefore decrease the risk
      of cancer.

      In this pilot study, the overall purpose is to establish the molecular basis for the
      hypothesis that oxidative stress is a risk factor for cancer. This will be achieved by
      establishing base line levels of oxidative DNA damage in a population of healthy individuals
      before and after taking antioxidant and mineral supplements for 8 weeks.
