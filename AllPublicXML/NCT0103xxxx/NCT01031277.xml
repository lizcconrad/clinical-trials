      The purpose of the study is to establish the proportion of patients on lipid-lowering
      pharmacological treatment reaching the LDL-C goals according to the NCEP ATP III/updated 2004
      NCEP ATP III guidelines, overall and by country, to establish the proportion of patients on
      lipid-lowering pharmacological treatment reaching the LDL-C goals according to the NCEP ATP
      III/updated 2004 NCEP ATP III in the following sub-populations:

        -  Primary/secondary prevention patients.

        -  Patients with metabolic syndrome (according to NCEP III definition). And to establish
           the proportion of patients on lipid-lowering pharmacological treatment reaching the
           LDL-C goals according to the Third Joint European Task Force guidelines/national
           guidelines, in the survey population and in the following sub-populations:

             -  Primary/secondary prevention patients.

             -  Patients with metabolic syndrome.
