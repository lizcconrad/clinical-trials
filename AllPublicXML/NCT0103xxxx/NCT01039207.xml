    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well rilotumumab works in treating patients with ovarian
      epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has failed to respond to other
      therapies (persistent) or has returned after a period of improvement (recurrent). Rilotumumab
      is a type of drug called a monoclonal antibody, and may interfere with the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread by targeting certain cells and blocking them from working.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months
      and the proportion of patients who have objective tumor response (complete or partial) in
      patients with persistent or recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with
      AMG 102 (rilotumumab) as assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      II. To determine the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the association between a panel of biomarkers (as assayed by
      immunohistochemistry and mutation analysis) and measures of response to treatment with AMG
      102 (rilotumumab) and clinical outcome in archived tumor tissue.

      II. To evaluate circulating pre- and post-treatment levels of hepatocyte growth
      factor/scatter factor and markers of angiogenesis and their association with response to
      treatment with AMG 102 (rilotumumab) and clinical outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rilotumumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 14. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

    <time_frame>CT scan or MRI if used to follow lesion for measurable disease every other cycle during treatment then every 3 months thereafter until disease progression is confirmed; also repeat at any time if clinically indicated up to 5 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Complete and Partial Tumor Response by RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines complete response as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above. Complete and partial responses are included in the objective tumor response rate.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the period from study entry until disease progression, death, or the last date of contact. Progression was based on RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines progressive disease as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered progression.</description>

        <description>Complete and Partial Tumor Response by RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines complete response as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above. Complete and partial responses are included in the objective tumor response rate.</description>
        <time_frame>CT scan or MRI if used to follow lesion for measurable disease every other cycle during treatment then every 3 months thereafter until disease progression is confirmed; also repeat at any time if clinically indicated up to 5 years.</time_frame>

Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above. Complete and partial responses are included in the objective tumor response rate.</description>

        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the period from study entry until disease progression, death, or the last date of contact. Progression was based on RECIST 1.1. RECIST 1.1 defines progressive disease as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of non-target lesions is also considered progression.</description>
