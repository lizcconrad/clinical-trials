    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of interventions to improve
      adherence to medication and healthier lifestyle choices on blood pressure over a 6 month
      period in a group of people at high risk for recurrent stroke events. The participants have
      already had a stroke or TIA, and have uncontrolled blood pressure, as well as problems with
      memory and problem-solving, or miss taking medications, or who do not believe in the
      effectiveness of their medications. Interventions focus on motivational interviewing,
      adherence counseling with memory cuing, and self-monitoring of blood pressure.
