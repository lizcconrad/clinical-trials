    <textblock>
      This project is a pilot study of caffeine abstinence in coffee-drinkers who have type 2
      diabetes. Evidence suggests that caffeine may impair the control of glucose levels,
      especially in those people who have type 2 diabetes. Eliminating caffeinated beverages from
      the diet might improve glucose control, but the difficulty of quitting is unknown. This pilot
      study will follow a small number of type 2 diabetic patients for three months after a brief
      intervention designed to help people quit caffeine. Data on success with maintaining
      abstinence and on changes in glucose control will be collected.
