      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of manual treatment and a patient
      education programme for patients without indication for hip surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip osteoarthritis (hip OA) is the second most common arthritis of the larger joints and may
      result in pain and disability and lead to reduced quality of life (QoL). The prevalence of
      hip OA, in the adult population, &gt; 35 years, is estimated to 4-11% in the western society. In
      specific countries hip OA affects up to 25% in adults &gt; 60 years. With a growing elder
      population, these prevalence rates will increase and the demand for cost-effective and safe
      interventions will increase as well.

      International guidelines, 2008, on the management of hip and knee OA recommend a combination
      of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment. For years the majority of
      interventional research for hip and knee OA has focused on surgery and drugs. Surgery is an
      option, when pain and disability have reached severe levels, and an increasing group of
      patients are today looking for other treatment options than drug treatment (pharmacological).
      In the last 4-6 years, new randomized controlled trials (RCT) have shown promising results
      with non-pharmacological treatment, such as exercise, patient education, manual therapy and
      acupuncture.

      The purpose of this RCT is to investigate the effect of combining manual treatment and a
      patient education programme and compare it to a minimal intervention in form of a home
      stretching programme. It will further investigate the specific effect of manual treatment.
