  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether a computerized, self-administered assessment of patient
      medication adherence and health behaviors, plus support for adherence, improves the ability
      of clinicians to identify adherence problems and leads to better adherence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antiretroviral medications are highly effective in controlling HIV, if patients adhere to the
      regimen. However, HIV medication adherence problems are very common, and evidence is clear
      that providers have great difficulty 'diagnosing' poor adherence accurately. If healthcare
      providers can identify patients with adherence problems, they can intervene to help patients
      overcome these problems and take their medications as prescribed, which can improve symptoms
      and quality and length of life. Both clinicians and HIV positive patients will be recruited
      to this study. Before each clinic visit, patients randomized to the intervention will be
      asked to answer questions about their medications, medication-taking behavior, and
      risk-factors for non-adherence on MedCHEC, a tablet touch-screen computer that generates
      provider and patient reports. We will give these reports to the provider and patient to
      assist with the clinical visit. Based on the MedCHEC-generated report, the patient may be
      referred to an Adherence Care Manager (ACM). The ACM will assist the patient in overcoming
      adherence barriers by telephone and in-clinic counseling. The study will evaluate the effects
      of this system on adherence and clinical care using both quantitative methods (randomized
      controlled trials of effects on adherence and providers' adherence estimates), and
      qualitative methods.
