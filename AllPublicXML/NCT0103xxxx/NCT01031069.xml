  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause
      of cervical cancer. This Phase IV, observer-blind study is designed to evaluate the safety
      and immunogenicity of Cervarix™ in HIV infected females aged 15 to 25 years as compared to
      Merck's HPV vaccine (Gardasil®). For comparative purposes, a group of HIV negative females
      will also be evaluated. All subjects will receive the HPV vaccine (either Cervarix™ or
      Gardasil®) according to a three-dose schedule (Day 0, Week 6, Month 6).

      This Protocol summary has been updated following Protocol Amendment 7, December 2013,
      following: • Addition of a new EU country, change in assay and assay cut-off and enrollment
      of additional subjects and to clarify that some activities in the protocol are mandatory only
      for HIV+ subjects.
