      RATIONALE: Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating
      patients with or metastatic urothelial cancer or bladder cancer that has relapsed or not
      responded to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the activity of daily oral doses of pazopanib hydrochloride monotherapy in
           patients with relapsed/refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma or transitional cell
           tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pazopanib hydrochloride monotherapy in a
           population of chemotherapy pretreated patients.

        -  To assess progression-free survival of these patients.

      Tertiary

        -  To evaluate the ability of whole-body 18FDG-PET to image metastases and monitor tumor
           response and to determine the rate of concordance with CT imaging and RECIST response
           criteria.

        -  To evaluate the relationship existing between tumor response measured by 18FDG-PET and
           progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral pazopanib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo whole-body 18FDG-PET at baseline and periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 2 years.
