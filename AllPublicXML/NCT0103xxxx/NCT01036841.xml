  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alarm-treatment as well as Desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of human vasopressin, are
      considered the only evidence-based medicine (EBM) IA treatments in monosymptomatic nocturnal
      enuresis (MNE). Desmopressin exists in three different formulations for ambulant use: nasal
      spray, tablet and lyophilisate (MELT) each with differences in bioavailability (spray 2%,
      tablet 0.2%, MELT 0.5%). There 's insufficient evidence to confirm the actually used
      bioequivalent doses ( 10µg spray = 120µg MELT= 0.2mg tablet).

      Although so frequently used, very few pharmacokinetic and -dynamic data on desmopressin are
      available for children.

      Due to prolonged half life, associated with waterintoxication,the nasal spray has a black box
      warning from the FDA and is no longer recommended . For some authors oral formulations appear
      to be a safer alternative. However, based on clinical experience of less response rate with
      oral formulations, lower biodisponibility is suspected. Adult research confirms low
      bioavailability of tablets but also show major influences by food-intake and changes in
      gastro-intestinal motility.

      To achieve maximum efficacy, recommendations are to take desmopressin tablet 1 hour before
      bedtime and 2 hours after meal: this is unrealistic in schoolaged children since there never
      is 3 hours between evening meal and bedtime.

      In 2005 a dose response study demonstrated superior pharmaco-kinetic and dynamic properties
      for desmopressin Lyophilisate MELT formula.

      Since these results implicate superior action of MELT, often a change to MELT is recommended
      if there is a suboptimal response with tablet: sublingual absorption would eliminate the
      influence of food-intake.

      However, for this statement there's no evidence, since these tests were all conducted in
      children in fasting condition. Only one clinical study demonstrates bioequivalence for MELT
      and tablet.

      Hypothesis is that desmopressin MELT formulation has a better bioavailability when
      administered together with meal due to its sublingual absorption.
