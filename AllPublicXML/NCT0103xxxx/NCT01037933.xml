    <textblock>
      Primary aims: To compare changes in (a) symptoms related to cancer and chemotherapy, (b) a
      marker of immune function (salivary immunoglobulin A), and (c) a hormonal marker of emotional
      stress (salivary cortisol) between two groups of patients who view a humorous or non-humorous
      DVD.

      Secondary aim: To describe the perception of patients, caregivers, and nurses regarding the
      overall intervention experience.

      Patients were recruited from the Outpatient Oncology (OPO) clinic at QMC. After signing an
      informed consent, patients receiving intravenous chemotherapy were randomly assigned to view
      a 45-minute humorous DVD or non-humorous DVD. The following measurements were obtained before
      and after patients viewed the DVD: Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and the state
      portion of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI-S) to assess symptoms related to
      cancer and chemotherapy, salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) to assess immune function and
      salivary cortisol to assess emotional stress. In addition, patients, caregivers, and nurses
      were asked open-ended questions after the intervention to ascertain their impression of the
      overall intervention experience. Multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) were be used to
      analyze changes in ESAS, STAI-S, IgA and cortisol within and between the two groups.
