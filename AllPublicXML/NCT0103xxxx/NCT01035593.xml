  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rhC1INH
      in renal transplant recipients with biopsy-confirmed antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) within
      30 days of renal transplantation. This study will combine the investigational drug rhC1INH
      with a standard regimen of plasmapheresis (PP) and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and
      compare this to PP and IVIG alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an Investigator-initiated, prospective, open-label, randomized, adaptive design study
      to enroll 30 adult renal transplant recipients with biopsy-confirmed AMR within 30 days post
      transplantation. After informed consent is obtained and study eligibility is confirmed,
      subjects will be enrolled immediately after biopsy confirmation of AMR and positive donor
      specific antibody (DSA). Subjects will then be randomized into one of two treatment groups
      (SOC [control] or rhC1INH). An initial cohort of 8 subjects (3 SOC, 5 rhC1INH) will receive
      intensive safety monitoring of the coagulation system and for thromboembolic events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipients of renal transplantation within 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  AMR documented by light microscopic changes and immunohistochemical C4d staining on
             renal biopsy within 30 days post-transplant.

          -  Positive DSA as detected by magnetic microbeads using a Luminex® system.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (CBP) must have negative pregnancy test at screening.

          -  Women of CBP and men with sexual partners of CBP must agree to use a medically
             acceptable method of contraception throughout the study and for 3 months following
             discontinuation of assigned treatment.

          -  Subjects must be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study and must
             sign a statement of informed consent.
