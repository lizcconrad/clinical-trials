    <textblock>
      The first objective of this thesis is to investigate the hypothesis that prerecorded
      autosuggestion (PA) can be a theoretically valuable (efficacy) and practical (efficiency)
      tool in the care of many patients with chronic pain. With a prevalence in chronic pain
      conditions of +/- 20% of adults, chronic pain is a huge problem for individuals as well as
      for society, absorbing an enormous amount of resources. Even with all available treatments,
      many people still suffer from chronic pain, in particular when this pain has a psychosomatic
      ('functional') origin. In the PALPI study (Prerecorded Autosuggestion in Long-standing Pain
      Intervention), accompanying this thesis, efforts are made to mainly involve chronic pain of
      clearly psychosomatic origin.

      A number of GPs will be contacted. A working definition of 'chronic pain patient' is put
      forward. Only patients with chronic pain for which present research suspects a substantial
      degree of psychosomatic causality are withheld. A randomization of these into three groups is
      performed by the appropriate department of the VUB. The three groups are: a control group
      (receiving 'care as usual'), a group receiving additionally to care as usual, 5
      autosuggestion CDs (containing +/- 25 different sessions of autosuggestion) and a group
      receiving additionally to care as usual, email assistance (through a specific internet
      module), including downloadable CDs as appropriate and access to 'AurelisOnLine' (an internet
      application with &gt; 900 different sessions of autosuggestion). Three of the CDs contain
      pre-recorded sessions of relaxation + autosuggestion aimed at diminishing pain. Other CDs are
      about relaxation, general wellness, etc. Each arm of investigation contains 30 subjects.
      Assessments are made at 3 points in time: at the start, at 1 month from the start and at 3
      months from the start. The following will be measured: quality of life (through a Dutch
      version of the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI)), levels of pain
      intensity and quality (through a Dutch version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)) and
      use of painkillers. In addition to this, the acceptance/satisfaction of physicians and
      patients of this kind of treatment will also be the subject of this investigation.

          -  The subject has one of the following syndromes and has been sufficiently investigated
             upon it in order to exclude a physical medical cause:

               -  chronic neck pain

               -  fibromyalgia

               -  temporomandibular pain dysfunction (TMPD)

               -  complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) = RSD

               -  chronic tension-type headache

               -  chronic pelvic pain

             this)

          -  The subject has a CD and/or mp3 player at disposal or will buy one.

        As an additional 'inclusion criterion', we explicitly ask the referring physician to
        include preferably patients whom he would otherwise also advise PALPI.
