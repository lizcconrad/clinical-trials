  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a novel and highly promising imaging method for that
      allows in vivo imaging of the mucosal layer at resolution of approximately 1 micron. Cellular
      and sub-cellular structures as well as capillaries and single red blood cells can be
      visualized. CLE is now well established as a highly accurate method for distinguishing
      neoplasia in the gastrointestinal tract lumen via endoscopy. A major new breakthrough is the
      development of sub-millimeter CLE probes that can be passed via an image guided needle (nCLE)
      into solid organs and cysts.

      It is hypothesized that nCLE will help distinguish the benign, premalignant and malignant
      cystic lesions of pancreas by visualizing the cellular lining of the cysts, thereby, avoiding
      unnecessary surgery in patient with benign cysts and guiding to early and effective surgical
      removal of high risk neoplastic lesions.

      A prototype minimal risk nCLE system has been developed that can be passed via standard
      endoscopic ultrasound needles into the pancreas but FDA clearance for in vivo use is not
      expected until late 2010. The investigators propose to evaluate this prototype nCLE system in
      vivo during endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), as an initial pilot study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: the confocal laser endomicroscopy imaging of the nCLE can differentiate between
      non-mucinous, mucinous non- malignant and malignant pancreatic cysts in vivo and has
      increased sensitivity compared to endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA)
      tissue sampling. In this pilot study the investigators will primarily evaluate technical
      feasibility and interobserver agreement.

        1. In patients undergoing EUS for suspected pancreatic cysts, the investigators will
           evaluate the key nCLE image features of non mucinous, mucinous, and malignant pancreatic
           cystic neoplasms (PCN).

        2. The investigators will estimate the initial image quality, feasibility, and
           interobserver agreement of nCLE

        3. The investigators will establish the preliminary accuracy of nCLE to be used for
           planning a larger comparative trial

    <description>The investigators are testing a new method called confocal laser endomicroscopy to see if it can detect pre-cancerous abnormalities in the lining of the cysts found in your pancreas. This will involve using a very thin fiber-shaped microscope which will be passed through a needle during the EUS procedure.</description>

    <description>The investigators will do the standard EUS procedure. If a cyst is seen in the pancreas during EUS, the investigators will administer a special dye called fluorescein through the IV, and then use the new fiber-shaped microscope to take pictures of the lining of the cysts.</description>
