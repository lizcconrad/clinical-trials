  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators center has also analyzed data over the last 7 years from deceased donor
      (DD) and living donor (LD) kidney transplant recipients who were randomized into 3
      immunosuppressive arms between 2000 and 2001. Thus the goal of the investigators study is to
      reduce the toxic effects of traditional immunosuppressive regimens involving high-dose
      calcineurin inhibitor agents by comparing low-dose TAC-MYF with low-dose TAC and de novo SRL
      regimens. In order to minimize exposure to TAC, the investigators center has previously shown
      favorable outcomes using combination Thymoglobulin and Zenapax (Daclizumab) for
      anti-lymphocyte induction in the investigator population of patients.

      A total of 150 randomized patients divided into 2 arms: 75 patients will be randomized to
      receive TAC-SRL, and 75 patients to receive TAC-MYF.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-HLA identical living donor kidney transplant patients

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has previously received or is receiving an organ transplant other than a
             kidney.

          -  Patient is receiving an ABO incompatible donor kidney.

          -  Recipient or donor is known seropositive for human immunodeficiency (HIV) or Hepatitis
             C virus, or Hepatitis B virus antigenemia.

          -  Patient has a current malignancy or a history of malignancy (within the past 5 years),
             except non-metastatic basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has been
             treated successfully, or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix that has been treated
             successfully.

          -  Patients with significant liver disease, defined as having during the past 28 days
             continuously elevated AST (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) levels greater than 3 times the
             upper value of the normal range at our center.

          -  Patient has uncontrolled concomitant infections and/or severe diarrhea, vomiting,
             active upper gastro-intestinal tract malabsorption or an active peptic ulcer or any
             other unstable medical condition that could interfere with study objectives.

          -  Patient is currently participating in another clinical trial of an investigational
             drug in the 30 days prior to transplant.

          -  Patient will be receiving any immunosuppressive agent other than those prescribed in
             the study.

          -  Patient is unable to take medications orally or via nasogastric tube by the morning of
             the second day following completion of the transplant procedure (i.e., skin closure).

          -  Patient is receiving or may require Warfarin, Fluvastatin, or herbal supplements
             during the study.

          -  Concurrent use of Astemizole, Pimozide, Cisapride, Terfenadine, or Ketoconazole.

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity to Tacrolimus, Thymoglobulin®, IL-2 receptor
             inhibitor monoclonal antibodies, Rapamune, Myfortic®, or corticosteroids.

          -  Patient is pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients with a screening/baseline (or within 96 hours of transplant) total white
             blood cell count &lt;4000/mm3; platelet count &lt;100,000/mm3; fasting triglycerides &gt;400
             mg/dl (&gt;4.6 mmol/L); fasting total cholesterol &gt;300 mg/dl (&gt;7.8 mmol/L); fasting
             HDL-cholesterol &lt;30 mg/dl; fasting LDL-cholesterol &gt;200 mg/dl.

          -  Patient is unlikely to comply with the visits scheduled in the protocol.

          -  Patient has any form of substance abuse, psychiatric disorder or a condition that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may invalidate communication with the investigator.

          -  If Tacrolimus cannot be instituted for longer than 5 days postoperatively.
