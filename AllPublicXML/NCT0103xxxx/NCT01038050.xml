  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is associated with a markedly increased risk for atherosclerotic coronary
      arteries and cerebrovascular diseases. The major cause of death in diabetic patients is
      cardiovascular disease in the world including Taiwan. Atherosclerosis is a progressive
      disease characterized by the response of the vessel wall to chronic, multifactorial injury,
      which leads ultimately to the formation of atheromatous or fibrous plaques. Endothelial
      dysfunction is thought to be the initial stage of atherosclerosis. Endothelial dysfunction
      leads to impaired control of vascular tone, a decreased in the release of anti-inflammatory
      factors and reduced availability of nitric oxide. Endothelial dysfunction portends diabetic
      vasculopathy. The loss of intact endothelial integrity and function sets in motion a cascade
      of serial events that lead to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications.

      The standard extracts of G. biloba leaves [G. biloba extract (GBE)] are now demonstrated the
      cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and neuroprotective effects. The mixture of biologically
      active ingredients in GBE accounts for the pleiotropic effects, including antioxidant
      effects, inhibition of platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 production, vasodilation and
      modulation of cholesterol metabolism. Clinically, GBE was widely used in management of
      vertigo、dementia and improving peripheral circulation. In our previous study, ginkgo biloba
      extract inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced reactive oxygen species generation,
      transcription factor activation, and cell adhesion molecule expression in human aortic
      endothelial cells. In addition, the similar benefit of prevention atherosclerosis was also
      found in animal study.

      Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a factor associated with higher risk of developing some vascular
      disease and also a rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation, leading to the generation of
      free iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide (CO). CO exerts potent antiproliferative and
      anti-inflammatory effects in the vascular walls, thereby influencing neointimal formation
      after vascular injury. In addition, biliverdin is subsequently metabolized to bilirubin by
      the enzyme biliverdin reductase. Therefore, induction of HO-1 elicits potent
      anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antithrombotic, and antioxidant effects in the
      circulation via the generation of CO and bilirubin. Interestingly, recent study found that a
      long guanidine thymidine dinucleotide repeat [(GT) n≧ 30] in the HO-1 promotor, which is
      linked to impaired inducibility, is associated with a higher frequency of vascular access
      failure.

      In the present study, we will investigate the effect of GBE on recovering endothelial
      dysfunction and inflammation in diabetic patients with stable coronary artery disease. In
      particularly, we intend to determine whether the GBE modulates the HO-1 expression and
      investigate whose genotyping including some candidate gene about atherosclerosis and
      hypertension will have most therapeutic effect of GBE.
