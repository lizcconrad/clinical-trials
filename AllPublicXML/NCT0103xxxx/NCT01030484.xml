  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NAFLD Database 2 will recruit at least 1,500 new adult participants suspected or known to
      have NAFLD or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-related cirrhosis and will also invite
      adult participants from the prior NAFLD Database and related studies (PIVENS trial and TONIC
      trial) to enroll in the NAFLD Database 2. To elucidate, through the cooperative effort of a
      multidisciplinary and multicenter group of collaborators, the etiology, natural history,
      diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of NAFLD, and in particular its more severe form of NASH
      and its complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To add to the existing NAFLD Database an additional 1,500 adult participants with a diagnosis
      of NAFLD, supported by a recent liver biopsy, with a broad range of severity. Core data
      collection will include clinical, demographic, laboratory, imaging, and histological features

        -  To increase the population diversity of the NAFLD Database to provide greater
           representation of Hispanic, Native American, African American, and Asian patients among
           the new adult participants recruited into the NAFLD Database 2

        -  To expand the current specimen bank comprised of liver tissue, serum, plasma, and DNA
           obtained from new participants and continuing participants undergoing repeat liver
           biopsy with the specific goal of optimizing the collection of plasma or serum suitable
           for biomarker development studies by obtaining specimens in close temporal proximity to
           the performance of liver biopsy

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Continuing participants:

          -  Previously enrolled in the NAFLD Database study, PIVENS or TONIC trials

          -  Age at least 18 years during the consent process

          -  Willingness to continue to be followed for up to 4 years

          -  Ability and willingness to give written, informed consent to be enrolled into Database
             2

        New participants:

          -  Age at least 18 years during the consent process

          -  Willingness to be followed for up to 4 years

          -  Ability and willingness to give written, informed consent to be screened for and, if
             eligible, to be enrolled into the Database 2 study

          -  Minimal or no alcohol use history consistent with NAFLD (see exclusion criteria)

          -  Collection of a standard of care liver biopsy that is obtained within 120 days of
             enrollment

          -  Collection of biosamples (serum, plasma, DNA, and, if available, liver tissue) within
             90 days prior to enrollment and 0-90 days before or 4-90 days after the standard of
             care liver biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition or circumstances, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             interfere with completion of scheduled follow-up visits and procedures for the
             duration of the Database 2 study

               -  Clinical or histological evidence of alcoholic liver disease: Regular and
                  excessive use of alcohol within the 2 years prior to interview defined as alcohol
                  intake greater than 14 drinks per week in a man or greater than 7 drinks per week
                  in a woman. Approximately 10 g of alcohol equals one 'drink' unit. One unit
                  equals 1 ounce of distilled spirits, one 12-oz beer, or one 4-oz glass of wine

                  biopsies obtained during bariatric surgery cannot be used for enrollment because
                  of the associated surgical or anesthetic acute changes and the weight loss
                  efforts that precede bariatric surgery
