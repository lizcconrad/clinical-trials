  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study in Ireland and United Kingdom to determine the effects, safety
      and tolerability of a drug called CyCol™ in improving mild to moderate ulcerative colitis
      (UC).

      Informed consent will be obtained and following confirmation of eligibility and disease
      assessment, study participants will be randomised (allocated by chance) to take either
      CyCol™, or placebo, orally once every day for four weeks. Study visit assessments will
      include blood and stool tests, physical examinations and flexible sigmoidoscopies (inspection
      of the bowel wall using a flexible camera).

      Half the participants will receive CyCol™ and half will receive placebo. At the end of
      treatment (4 weeks) study participants will be reassessed again and the findings in those who
      received CyCol™ will be compared with those who received placebo. Any side effects
      experienced during the study and the safety of treatment with CyCol™ will also be evaluated.
