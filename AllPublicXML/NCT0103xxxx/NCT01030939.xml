      The purpose of this study is to determine whether SB-649868 is safe, tolerable after repeated
      administrations in adult and elderly healthy volunteers. Pharmacokinetics and effects on
      cardiac function of repeated doses are studied

      The present clinical study will assess safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SB-649868
      20mg administered for 28 consecutive days in adult (18 to 65 yrs old) and elderly (&gt;65 yrs

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subject as determined by a responsible and experienced
             physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical
             examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical
             abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the population
             being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor
             agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not
             interfere with the study procedures. However,

               -  Subjects with cTpn I values above 99th percentile of normal range of the selected
                  assay should always be excluded from enrollment;

               -  Subjects with AST or ALT &gt; 2xULN should always be excluded from enrollment;

               -  Subjects with alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN should always be
                  excluded (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
                  and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          2. Age &gt; or equal to 18 years (applied only to Cohort 1 and 2); age &gt;65 years (applied
             only to Cohort 3 and 4);

          3. Body weight ≥50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 inclusive. Slight
             deviations from these values will be discussed and approved by the Investigator and
             the GSK Medical Monitor to allow subject inclusion into the study

          4. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 3 days post last dose (equivalent to 5 terminal half-lives post-last
             dose).

          5. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their Hormone Replacement Therapy
                  (HRT) during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
                  confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms
                  of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the
                  blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
                  confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during
                  the study without use of contraceptive methods

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  for 6 weeks following discontinuation of study medication.

          6. Having given written informed consent, which includes compliance with the requirements
             and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          7. Average QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; PQ 120-220ms; QRS &lt;120ms; no significant rhythm
             disorders in SCR 24h Holter-ECG

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or presence of significant psychiatric, neurological, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, pancreatic or renal diseases or of any condition known to
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          2. History of cardiovascular diseases and/or evidence of repolarization defects

          3. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

             • an average weekly intake of greater than 21 units (14 units for female) or an
             average daily intake of greater than 3 units (2 units for female). 1 unit is
             equivalent to a half-pint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits or 1 glass
             (125ml) of wine.

          4. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          5. Vulnerable subjects , or subject is mentally or legally incapacitated, or language
             barrier precluding adequate understanding of cooperation.

          6. Any history of suicidal behaviour or any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 in the last
             month on the C-SSRS administered at screening

          7. Pregnant females as determined by positive Serum beta-hCG test at screening or prior
             to dosing.

         13. Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.

         14. Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

         15. Consumption of broccoli, radish sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, orange juice,
             grapefruit juice or grapefruit within 7 days prior to the first dose of study
             medication until collection of the final pharmacokinetic blood sample.

         16. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an IP within the
             following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current study: 30 days, 5
             half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the IP (whichever is
             longer).

         17. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

         18. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

         19. Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

         20. The subject is unable or unwilling to abstain from strenuous physical activity in the
             48 h before screening and up to the follow up visit.

         21. Subject is the investigator or his/her deputies, research assistant, pharmacist, study
             coordinator, other staff or relative thereof involved in the conduct of the study.
