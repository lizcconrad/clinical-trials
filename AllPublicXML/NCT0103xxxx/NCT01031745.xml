    <textblock>
      Drug use (DU) is a major risk factor for HIV infection in many regions of the world. However,
      as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been rolled out in South and South East
      Asia, less than 2% of individuals initiated on HAART were drug users (DUs) or former DUs,
      despite the fact that approximately 20% of HIV infections in the region are ascribed to DU.
      India is home to about 2.4 million HIV-infected individuals. Though, injection drug users
      contribute to only about 3% of all HIV infections in India; it is estimated that there are
      between 168,000 and 1.1 million DUs in India with HIV prevalence about 30%. Novel approaches
      are needed to engage disenfranchised populations in HIV care in lower and middle income
      countries, where the burden of HIV disease is growing. Incentive-based strategies (or
      contingency management) have been shown to be effective in reducing illicit drug use, smoking
      cessation, and weight loss. Short-term pilot studies have also shown that incentive-based
      strategies can improve electronically-monitored rates of adherence to HAART in the US, and a
      recent study in Africa showed that a small incentive approximately doubled the rate that
      individuals returned to learn the results of their HIV test. However, to date there is no
      experience with the use of incentive-based interventions to improve engagement into care and
      risk-reduction among out-of-care HIV-infected DUs in developing world settings. The
      investigators propose to conduct pilot randomized trial comparing a voucher incentive
      strategy to a control condition to improve engagement in HIV care and HIV treatment outcomes
      among out-of-care, treatment-eligible, HIV-infected DUs in Chennai, India. Subjects in the
      incentive arm will be eligible to earn incentive vouchers for 1) initiating HAART at a
      government-sanctioned HIV treatment clinic, 2) adherence to scheduled follow-up visits at the
      HIV clinic, and 3) achieving suppression of HIV RNA. Subjects will be enrolled from a mature
      research venue in Chennai, YR Gaitonde Centre for Substance Abuse-related Research (YRGCSAR),
      which focuses the epidemiology and natural history of HIV in DUs. Preliminary data from this
      pilot study will be used to inform the design of a phase-III study.
