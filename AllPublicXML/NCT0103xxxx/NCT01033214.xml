      -  Subject is &gt; 18 years of age.

        -  Females subjects must be either documented post-menopausal, surgically incapable of
           bearing children, or for women of childbearing potential, using barrier contraceptive
           methods and must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening.

        -  Subject is a candidate for endovascular thoracic aortic repair.

        -  Subject has a TAA that meets one of the following criteria:

        -  Is diagnosed with a Fusiform Focal TAA &gt;5cm, or

        -  Is diagnosed with a Fusiform Focal TAA that has a diameter &lt; 5 cm and has exhibited
           rapid expansion, or

        -  Is diagnosed with a Fusiform Focal TAA that has a diameter ≥ 4.5 cm and is at least
           twice the size of the normal DTA, or

        -  Is diagnosed with a saccular TAA of any size.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is &gt; 18 years of age. Female subjects are either documented post-menopausal,
             surgically incapable of bearing children, or for women of childbearing potential,
             using barrier contraceptive methods and have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening.

        Subject is a candidate for endovascular thoracic aortic repair.

        Subject has a TAA that meets one of the following criteria:

          1. Is diagnosed with a Fusiform Focal TAA ≥5cm, or

          2. Is diagnosed with a Fusiform Focal TAA that has a diameter ≤ 5 cm and has exhibited
             rapid expansion, or

          3. Is diagnosed with a Fusiform Focal TAA that has a diameter ≥ 4.5 cm and is at least
             twice the size of the normal DTA, or

          4. Is diagnosed with a saccular TAA of any size (where potential for rupture is
             increased*).

               -  Tortuosity and angulation do not exceed 90 degrees.

               -  Subject has an arterial access site that allows for the introduction of the
                  stent-graft delivery system.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a life expectancy &lt; 2 years.

          -  Subject has a lesion that prevents safe delivery or expansion of the device.
