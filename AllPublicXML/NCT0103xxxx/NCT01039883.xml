  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether albaconazole tablets and albaconazole
      capsules (single 400mg dose) act in the body in the same way over a period of time.

      The aim of this study is to compare the bioavailability of the formulation used in earlier
      clinical studies (albaconazole capsules) with the formulation intended for use in further
      development (albaconazole tablets). The study is also designed to assess the safety and
      tolerability of a single oral dose of albaconazole tablets (400 mg), and assess the
      bioequivalence of albaconazole tablets with albaconazole capsules.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of understanding and willing to provide signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any
             protocol specific procedures are performed.

          -  Male or female aged from 18 to 45 years at time of consent and at time of first dose.

          -  A body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 30 kg/m2.

          -  Able to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.

          -  Free of clinically significant disease as determined by history, physical examination,
             and laboratory testing.

          -  The subject is a non-smoker or ex-smoker. If a subject is an ex smoker, he/she must
             not have used nicotine for at least 6 months before first dose.

          -  The screening and baseline laboratory parameters must be within normal ranges unless
             agreed as not clinically relevant by the principal investigator and the sponsor.
             Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline
             phosphatase, and total bilirubin values should be lower than 1.5 times the upper
             normal limit at screening.

          -  The subject will have negative results for the following tests at screening:

               -  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)

               -  Hepatitis B core antibodies (HBcAc)

               -  Anti-hepatitis C virus (Anti-HCV)

               -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody test

               -  Urine drug screen

          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential participating in the study must
             agree to use a medically acceptable method of contraception while receiving
             protocol-assigned product and until 30 days following the last dose of the study
             product. A woman of childbearing potential is defined as one who is biologically
             capable of becoming pregnant; including perimenopausal women who are less than 2 years
             from their last menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the following:

               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception should be added until the third continuous month of hormonal
                  contraception has been completed.

               -  Two forms of reliable nonhormonal contraception, to include the use of either an
                  intrauterine device plus a reliable barrier method or 2 reliable barrier methods.
                  Reliable barrier methods include condoms or diaphragms. A cervical cap is also a
                  reliable barrier method, provided that the female subject has never given birth
                  naturally. The combined use of a condom and spermicide constitute 2 forms of
                  acceptable nonhormonal contraception, provided that they are both used properly.
                  The use of spermicide alone and the improper use of condoms are inferior methods
                  of contraception. Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal
                  sterilization or partner's vasectomy, must use a form of nonhormonal
                  contraception. A barrier method or sterilization plus spermatocide are
                  acceptable.

          -  Women who are not currently sexually active must agree to use a medically accepted
             method of contraception should they become sexually active while participating in the
             study. Male subjects and/or their partners must use a medically acceptable form of
             contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female who is pregnant (positive pregnancy test), trying to become pregnant, or breast
             feeding.

          -  Received any investigational drug within 30 days of study day 1 or who are scheduled
             to receive an investigational drug other than the study product during the study.

          -  Used prescription drug therapy, over the counter (nonprescription) medications,
             recreational drugs, or herbal products within 30 days of dosing, unless agreed as not
             clinically relevant by the principal investigator and sponsor.

          -  Participated in a previous study of the same study product.

          -  Currently using any medication that, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             the evaluation of the study product or place the subject at undue risk.

          -  Currently suffering from any disease or condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may affect the evaluation of the study product or place the subject at
             undue risk.

          -  Has a history of anemia, iron deficiency, or iron depletion.

          -  Has a history of any condition possibly affecting absorption of drug (eg, peptic ulcer

             dosing or has donated plasma within 7 days before dosing.

          -  Has QT interval corrected for heart rate (Fridericia's correction formula) (QTcF) &gt;450
             ms or any ECG abnormality except for the following:

               -  Mild sinus bradycardia in younger, athletic subjects (heart rate down to 46 beats
                  per minute allowed).

               -  Mild sinus arrhythmia.

               -  Mild first degree atrioventricular (A-V) block (P-R interval &lt;0.23 sec).

          -  Considered unable or unlikely to attend the necessary visits.

          -  Employees of investigator/ clinical research organization or Stiefel involved in the
             study, or an immediate family member (partner, offspring, parents, siblings, or
