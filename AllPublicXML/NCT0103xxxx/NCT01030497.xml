  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using the PEMFlex Solo II, a
      high-resolution camera for PET scan imaging, on an area of the body that has, or is suspected
      to have cancer will give researchers the same or better information about the disease
      compared to the images taken with a routine PET/CT.

      Researchers will compare the images taken using the PEMFlex Solo II to the images taken
      during your scheduled routine PET/CT scan, as well as any additional routine CT scan(s),
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan(s), and/or ultrasound image(s) you may have had within
      the last 30 days or may have in the next 30 days.

      If you agree to take part in this study, right after your already scheduled routine PET/CT
      scan is complete, a study staff member will take you to a separate imaging room located in
      the same clinic area where your routine PET/CT scan was just performed.

      You will then sit in a chair as a study staff member positions the PEMFlex Solo II on either
      side of the part of the neck that has, or is suspected to have cancer. It will take about 20
      minutes to set up the PEMFlex Solo II and take the PET scan images.

      Length of Study:

      After the PET scan images have been taken using the PEMFlex Solo II, your participation in
      this study will be over.

      This is an investigational study. The PEMFlex Solo II is commercially available for PET scan
      imaging of the breast. Using the PEMFlex Solo II for imaging any other parts of the body is
      investigational.

      Up to 10 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Patients with known or suspected primary cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract or
        metastatic disease to cervical lymph nodes, over 18 years of age, and scheduled for routine
        clinical imaging at the PET/CT facility.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A signed informed consent.

          2. Known or suspected primary cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract, which may be
             determined by biopsy, physical examination- including upper endoscopy or noninvasive
             imaging studies including CT, MR, ultrasound, or prior PET.

          3. Known or suspected metastatic disease to cervical lymph nodes based on physical
             examination, imaging studies or biopsy.

          4. Scheduled for routine clinical imaging at the ACB PET/CT facility.

          5. Participant must be at least 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) for cancer of the upper aerodigestive
             tract.

          2. Prior biopsy procedures, including resection of the primary cancer, will not exclude
             the patient from participation.

          3. Uncontrolled blood glucose levels (&gt;200 mg/dl).

          4. Patient is unable to comprehend the requirements of the study.

          5. Patient is unable to undergo scanning of the neck with the PEM (PET) scanner (due to
             body habitus, inability to comply with positioning requirements, etc.).
