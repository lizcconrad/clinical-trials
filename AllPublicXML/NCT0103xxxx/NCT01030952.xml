      A 3-week, multi-center, open-label, randomized, active-control, parallel-group study to
      compare effects of Nateglinide and Acarbose on postprandial glucose fluctuation in Chinese
      drug-naive patients type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, participants in different
      groups took Nateglinide at a dose of 120 mg orally three times daily for up to 3 weeks or
      Acarbose at a dose of 50 mg three times daily for up to 3 weeks, respectively.

          <description>Blood samples were collected for measurement of HDL-C prior to (fasting) and 120 minutes following the start of a standardized meal test at Baseline and Week 3. Participants were fasting (no calorie intake for at least 8 hours prior to the meal test) and completed the standardized meal test between 7 and 10 AM. HDL-C was assessed at each study site using the same method and same reference value.</description>
