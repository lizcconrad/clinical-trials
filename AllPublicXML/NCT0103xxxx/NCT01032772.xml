  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choices Plus, a randomized controlled study, will determine the efficacy of the Project
      CHOICES intervention plus a referral to an evidence-based smoking cessation program in
      reducing the risk of alcohol- and tobacco-exposed pregnancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study will examine the effect of the ChoicesPlus intervention
      compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU) in: reducing alcohol use below established risk levels;
      increasing consistent use of effective contraception; increasing engagement in smoking
      cessation treatment and increasing smoking cessation. In addition, our examination of the
      incremental costs of the ChoicesPlus intervention (e.g., staff time, materials,
      administrative services, total medical charges pre- and post-intervention) will provide a
      basis for future cost/benefit analyses that will inform policymakers and healthcare
      organizations of the potential benefits of implementing ChoicesPlus. Results from this study
      will inform and advance future efforts in the service of promoting healthy prenatal behavior
      and reducing the prevalence of alcohol and tobacco-exposed pregnancies.

    <description>A two session intervention utilizing a motivational interviewing approach to encourage changes in alcohol use, contraceptive use, and smoking. The interventions will (a) provide norms-based-but personalized-feedback, (b) encourage attendance at a contraceptive counseling visit, (c) encourage participation in the smoking cessation program, (c) increase motivation to change each of the target behaviors, (d) decrease temptation to engage in risk behaviors, (e) increase confidence to avoid risk behaviors, and (f) develop a personalized, tailored change plan.</description>
