    <textblock>
      Primary trial objective in this three arm trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of
      EMD 521873, and to determine whether the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached with EMD
      521873 doses of up to 1.5 mg/kg given alone or in combination with fixed, low-dose
      cyclophosphamide (CPA) in patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumors or B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, overall and best
      clinical response, changes in tumor marker levels, survival and biological/immune responses
      to EMD 521873. A total of 78 patients are planned. Patients will remain on the dose
      throughout the trial. It is intended to administer 3 cycles (21 d each, or until progression
      or a xxx line therapy becomes necessary.
