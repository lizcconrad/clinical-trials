      This project aims to support adults in HIV-affected families in order to improve their
      well-being. UCLA's Center for Community Health (CCH), in collaboration with the Thai Ministry
      of Public Health, Bureau of Epidemiology, will implement the Family-to-Family (F2F)
      intervention in order to improve the social, behavioral and mental health outcomes for
      families affected by HIV.

      In Phase 1, the investigators pilot tested the current intervention contents and activities
      by collecting qualitative data from HIV+ families in the four district hospitals in Chiang
      Rai and Nakohn Ratchasima provinces selected for the proposed study. The findings from Phase
      was used to develop intervention content, as well as the format and style of the intervention
      for Phase 2. In addition, the findings from Phase 1 was used to finalize the assessment
      measures the investigators will use in Phase 2.

      In Phase 2, 410 families with HIV+ parents from 4 district hospitals in Chiang Rai &amp; Nakhon
      Ratchasima Provinces will be recruited to an intervention to benefit their school-aged
      children aged 6-17 years. At their clinical care site,the investigators randomly assigned
      families to either: 1) F2F, a psychoeducational intervention for HIV+ parents and family
      caregivers; or 2) a Standard Care condition. The impact of the F2F intervention will be
      monitored over 24 months.

      HIV has a negative intergenerational impact on families, particularly children with HIV+
      parents. In order to improve the social, behavioral and mental health outcomes for families
      affected by HIV, we have designed the Family-to-Family (F2F) intervention that includes the
      critical, universal, program components identified by the NIMH Intervention Workgroup. All
      efficacious intervention programs: frame the problem by providing information and shaping
      beliefs; enhance skills; establish supportive relationships; and remove environmental
      barriers to behavior change (e.g., HIV testing, ARV). We aim to evaluate a generic
      intervention approach including these components that is culturally-tailored to families
      affected by HIV in a specific country, Thailand.

      Families in Thailand need such an intervention: 1 in 4 elderly adults in Thailand will raise
      an AIDS orphan, even with a relatively low national seroprevalence rate (1.2%, I million
      adults). Thailand has a rising seroincidence. This research will design and evaluate an
      intervention for improving the long-term adjustment of families with HIV. We will intervene
      with HIV+ parents and family caregivers to improve the outcomes for families living with HIV.

      The Specific Aims for the proposed study are:

        1. To compare the outcomes over time of the school-age children of families in the
           intervention and SC conditions in each of the following domains: a) mental health
           symptoms; b) behavioral adjustment, and c) relationships with HIV+ parents, caregivers,
           and peers.

        2. As intermediate outcomes, to compare the outcomes over time of the HIV+ parent in the
           intervention and the SC condition in terms of: health status; HIV transmission acts;
           parenting behaviors and bonds with children; and mental health symptoms.

        3. As intermediate outcomes, to compare the outcomes over time of the partners and
           caregivers (about 80% grandparents) in the intervention and the SC condition in terms
           of: health status; mental health symptoms; caregiver burden; relationships with their
           HIV+ adult children, their school-age grandchildren, and bonds.

        4. To compare the intermediate outcomes among those in the intervention and SC condition on
           disclosure and stigma-related stress.

        5. To compare the influence of background factors on the impact of the intervention over
           time: age and gender of the HIV+ parent, the school-age child's age and gender, physical
           proximity in the living situation of the HIV+ parents and family caregivers, mode of
           initial transmission for acquisition of HIV (IDU, sexual acts), income and initial
           quality of relationships.
