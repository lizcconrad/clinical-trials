      Objective:

      A randomized clinical trial in order to evaluate the efficacy of structured eccentric
      exercises tutored by a physical therapist (PT) for patients with subacromial impingement.

      Hypothesis:

      H1 The exercises has a satisfactory effect and the need of an arthroscopic subacromial
      decompression can be reconsidered.

      H0 No difference between the two exercises (experimental and active control) and the patients
      still need surgery

      Further the study objective is to evaluate predictors for a positive or negative treatment
      response after three months of rehabilitation as well as after 12 months.

      Method:

      Patients referred to the orthopedic unit for an arthroscopic subacromial decompression, are
      offered a three month rehabilitation program during the waiting time for surgery which is
      approximately 4-6 months. All patients must have tried conservative treatments for at least 6
      months in primary care with unsatisfactory results. The patients will be randomized to either
      the structured eccentric exercises tutored by a physical therapist or control exercises with
      general movements for the neck and shoulders. All patients has an equal number of sessions
      with the PT to offer similar attention. After three months the following key-question has to
      be answered: due to your current experience of your shoulder problems do you still need this
      surgical intervention? A blinded orthopedic surgeon evaluates the following outcomes at
      baseline and after three and twelve months. Primary outcomes: Constant-Murley shoulder
      assessment, Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hans and different aspects of pain.
      Secondary outcomes; EQ-5D, sick-leave and return to work. All patients are evaluated with a
      diagnostic ultrasound in order to reveal the condition of the rotator cuff. Also long-term
      results in those who go thorough with the surgery and those who decline will be assessed
      after 12 months.

      Importance of the study results:

      Since there is no consensus about which intervention that should be preferred for patients
      with subacromial impingement the results of the current study is warranted. If this exercise
      program is successful it can be implemented into clinical practice. Further, clinical
      characteristics of patients that really need an arthroscopic subacromial decompression can be
      identified.
