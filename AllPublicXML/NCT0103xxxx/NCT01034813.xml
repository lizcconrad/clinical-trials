      The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between cutaneous functional
      unit(CFU)recruitment throughout the available active range of motion of a prescribed joint in
      normal subjects and patients with burn scars. Specifically, this study will determine if
      differences in CFU recruitment exist between normal subjects and individuals with burn scars
      at the dorsal hand, dorsal or volar forearm, or anterior or posterior arm during active range
      of motion of the MCP joint during flexion, or the wrist or elbow during flexion or extension,
      respectively.

      Specific Aim #1: To establish the relationship between joint position and skin recruitment,
      expressed as the percentage of CFU recruited during active ROM, in patients with burn scars
      and normal controls.

      Specific Aim #2: To establish the within-day and between-day reliability of percent CFU
      estimation and absolute skin recruitment, measured in millimeters from a fixed reference,
      during active ROM for a specified joint.

      Specific Aim #3: To establish the relationship between scar height, measured by diagnostic
      ultrasound, scar cross-sectional area, and percent CFU recruitment in individuals with burn
      scar.

      Specific Aim #4: To determine whether the amount of skin recruitment, expressed as the
      percent of the CFU recruited during active ROM, is differentially affected by burn scar.

      Ho: There is no difference in the percent CFU recruited at the completion of active range of
      motion at a specified joint between individuals with burn scars and normal controls.

      Ha: Individuals with burn scars recruit a greater percentage of the CFU in order to obtain
      maximal range of motion at a specified joint.

      Specific Aim #5: To determine whether the timing of skin recruitment, expressed as the
      initiation of skin movement within a CFU relative to joint position during active ROM, is
      differentially affected by burn scar.

      Ho: There is no difference in the initiation of skin movement within a CFU relative to joint
      position during active ROM at a specified joint between individuals with burn scars and
      normal controls.

      Ha: In individuals with burn scars in a given CFU, skin movement farther from the joint axis
      occurs earlier in the range of motion compared to controls.

      Specific Aim #6: To determine whether skin extensibility within a CFU during active ROM of a
      specified joint is differentially affected by burn scar.

      Ho: There is no difference skin extensibility within a CFU during active ROM of a specified
      joint between individuals with burn scars and normal controls.

      Ha: In individuals with burn scars in a given CFU, skin near the joint axis undergoes greater
      deformation (stretch) as range of motion at the joint increases compared to controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion Criteria include: 1) male or female burn survivors between the ages of 18
             and 60, 2) an area of scar covering at least fifty percent of the CFU of interest, 3)

             percent of the CFU of interest, 2) burn survivors with a history of orthopedic trauma
             to the upper extremity (i.e. sprain within the last 24 months, history of fracture, or
             history of joint dislocation), 3) control subjects with a history of upper extremity
             trauma or injury, 4) control subjects with the presence of scar tissue covering an
             area of more than one percent of the CFU of interest, 5) any potential subject with a
             history or rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis affecting the extremity of interest,
