  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that radiation damages lung tissue. New human studies at University of Iowa show
      that the radiation damage is not as expected. The purpose of this study is to document lung
      function using four-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and quantify changes three months
      after radiation therapy for malignant lung disease.

        Cancer patients with lung disease requiring radiation therapy. Lung tumor may be lung
        cancer or metastasis to the lung. Radiation simulation method must be four-dimensional
        computer tomography (4D-CT)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of small cell or non-small cell lung cancer or metastatic tumor
             to the lung being scheduled for localized radiation therapy (including radiosurgery)

          -  No prior or future planned surgery for the treatment of the lung cancer.

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years

          -  Karnofsky 60%

          -  Not pregnant.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Ability and willingness to participate in breathing training and compliance wiht
             breathing apparatus so that radiation doses are optimally linked to 4D-CT images

          -  Ability to tolerate CT contrast

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior thoracic radiotherapy will be permitted

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Severe COPD that requires chronic prednisone or multiple inhalers

          -  Underlying collagen vascular disease or intrinsic lung disease that could complicate
             expected sequelae of radiation (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Wegener's
             granulomatosis)

          -  Oxygen dependence at baseline

          -  Recent lung surgery or abdominal surgery (within 3 weeks) that would compromise
             respiratory pattern.
