    <textblock>
      The current study's primary aim is to investigate the association between neuroendocrine
      fluctuations and mood disorders by monitoring mood states over distinct hormonal phases
      during in-vitro-fertilization (IVF) treatment. The secondary goal of this study is to explore
      psychological profiles and coping mechanisms of women undergoing IVF, and to identify the
      ones that are associated with successful psychological adaptation to the process and a
      successful biological outcome.
