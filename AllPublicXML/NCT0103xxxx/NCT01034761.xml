      Introduction:

      The Beers list identifies medications that should be avoided in persons 65 years or older
      because they are ineffective, pose an unnecessarily high risk, or a safer alternative is
      available. In a recent study, we found a high rate of prescribing of Beers list medications
      to hospitalized patients. At Baystate, 41% of medical patients received at least one Beers
      list drug classified as &quot;high severity,&quot; meaning it carried a high risk for an adverse drug
      reaction, while 5% received 3 or more. Some Beers drugs have been associated with delirium
      and falls. When compared to Baystate patients who did not receive a high severity medication,
      those who did had an increased risk of mortality (7.8% vs. 5.2%), longer length of stay (5.5
      days vs. 3.9 days) and higher costs ($11,240 vs. 6243).

      Specific Aims:

        1. Quantify the impact of synchronous electronic alerts on physician prescribing of
           high-severity Beers' list drugs to hospitalized patients over the age of 65 years.

        2. Compare physician reactions to each drug-specific alert

      Project Description:

      We will develop a series of clinical alerts in CIS, Baystate's computerized provider order
      entry system, to reduce the use of potentially inappropriate medications among hospitalized
      elders. We will randomize providers to electronic alerts or usual care. Whenever a provider
      randomized to alerts attempts to place an order for a high-risk medication on the Beers list
      and the intended recipient is over 65 years of age, a synchronous alert (i.e. a &quot;pop-up&quot;)
      will inform the physician about the risks associated with the medication and will propose
      safer alternatives.

      We will collect data on physician ordering and patient outcomes comparing the number of Beers
      list prescriptions from providers receiving electronic alerts to those not receiving alerts.
      Our anticipated outcome is a decrease in inappropriate prescribing during the period when the
      electronic alerts are activated. Other potential outcomes include decrease in length of stay
      and a decrease in falls.
