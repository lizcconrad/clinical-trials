  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an increasing health problem with numerous metabolic complications. Vitamin D
      deficiency is common in obesity, and in epidemiological studies vitamin D deficiency has been
      linked to metabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and
      cardiovascular disease, as well as myopathy, osteoporosis and depression. In obesity, a low
      grade inflammation is present in the fat tissue, thereby releasing inflammatory molecules to
      the blood stream. In cell line studies as well as small clinical studies vitamin D has been
      shown to have the ability to reduce inflammation and cell growth.

      In the present study the investigators wish to investigate the effect of vitamin D on fat-,
      muscle and bone metabolism. 30 healthy obese subjects will be treated with cholecalciferol
      175 micrograms daily for 6 months and will be compared with 30 healthy obese subjects treated
      with placebo.

      The investigators hypothesize that restoring vitamin D levels in vitamin D deficient obese
      subject will reduce inflammation and thereby reduce obesity-related complications.

      The effect will be evaluated as follows:

        -  Levels of circulating inflammatory markers will be examined in blood samples collected
           prior to and after treatment.

        -  Effects on fat- and muscle metabolism will be evaluated in fat- and muscle samples taken
           before and after treatment.

        -  Effects on fat distribution will be evaluated by MRI scan before and after treatment.

        -  Effects on insulin sensitivity will be evaluated by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp
           performed on a subgroup of subjects with impaired fasting glucose.

        -  Effects on bone marrow density will be evaluated by DEXA scans before and after
           treatment.

        -  Effects on quality of life and depression score will be evaluated by questionnaires used
           before and after treatment.
