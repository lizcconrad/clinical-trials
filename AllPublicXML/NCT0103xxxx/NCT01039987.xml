  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Division of Kidney Urology and Hematology Disease (DKUHD) of the National Institute of
      Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) funded a cooperative agreement (UO1) for a
      consortium of participating clinical centers (PCCs) and a data coordinating and imaging
      analysis center (DCIAC) to develop and implement studies to test whether imaging techniques
      can provide accurate and reproducible markers of progression of renal disease in patients
      with polycystic kidney disease.

      The awarded participating clinical centers are Emory University, University of Kansas, and
      Mayo Foundation (with a subcontract to the University of Alabama). The awarded DCIAC is
      Washington University in St. Louis. Due to the relocation of the DCIAC P.I. from Washington
      University to the University of Pittsburgh, the DCIAC for CRISP II is located at the
      University of Pittsburgh.

      The goal of the CRISP Study is to conduct a prospective, longitudinal trial to evaluate the
      accuracy and validity of magnetic resonance imaging to determine disease progression in ADPKD
      defined as a change in both renal and renal cyst volumes and renal function over time.

        Participants who are diagnosed with ADPKD between the ages of 15 and 45 with risk factors
        (2/3 of the study population) or without risk factors (1/3 of the study population)for
        progression to ESRD with relatively normal renal function were be eligible for recruitment
        into the CRISP I study. The objective of the recruitment process was to identify ADPKD
        participants with the appropriate level of renal function who are either at high or low
        risk for progression to ESRD, who will be available for the entire follow-up period and who
        are likely to be compliant with the study protocols and visit schedules.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. CRISP I participants will be invited to participate in CRISP II. At entry into CRISP I
        participants met a number of inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current psychiatric or addiction or non-compliance disorder that in the discretion of
             the principal investigator indicates that the subject will not successfully complete
             the study;

          2. Current medical problem that in the discretion of the principal investigator would
             make unsafe the participation in the study;

          3. Inability to provide written informed consent
