  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following myocardial infarct, cellular therapy is a potential approach to repopulate the
      injured myocardium, to treat heart failure and restore cardiac function. The purpose of this
      study is to assess the safety, feasibility and efficacy of intramyocardial delivery of
      selected autologous CD133+ bone marrow stem cells at time of coronary artery bypass grafting
      in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD133+ are well-characterized distinct early progenitor group of stem cells that possess high
      engraftment, pluripotent and angiogenic capacity and proved to be valuable for cardiac repair
      by promoting neovascularization, inhibition of apoptosis and cardiomyogenesis.

      Our proposed research protocol involves patients with chronic ischemic heart disease and left
      ventricular dysfunction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In this phase II
      clinical trial, prospective, randomized, 2 arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we
      will assess the safety, feasibility and functional effect of intra-myocardial injection of
      highly selected autologous CD133+ bone marrow stem cells to placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years, and ≤75 years.

          -  Patients with severe chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy manifested by Canadian
             Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class II or greater angina, and/or New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) class II or greater, AND who have undergone diagnostic coronary
             angiography demonstrating ≥70% diameter narrowing of at least 2 major coronary
             arteries or branches or ≥50% diameter narrowing of the left main coronary artery.

          -  A significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction evaluated by echocardiography or
             LV angiography (LV ejection fraction ≤45% but ≥25%) due to prior myocardial
             infarction. This area of left ventricular dysfunction should be akinetic or severely
             hypokinetic, not dyskinetic or aneurismal, when assessed by echocardiography or LV
             angiogram. This territory should be irrigated by one or a branch of the three major
             vascular territories (i.e. right coronary artery, left circumflex, or left anterior
             descending artery distribution) that will be bypassed during the surgical procedure.

          -  No contraindications or exclusions (see below).

          -  Willingness to participate and ability to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging including presence of an implantable
             cardiac defibrillator (ICD) or permanent pacemaker (PPM), or cases in which it is
             anticipated that an ICD or PPM will be implanted prior to the 6 month follow-up (thus
             precluding performance of follow-up MR scans), claustrophobia.

          -  Lack of ischemic symptoms (angina) prior to referral for CABG (i.e., patients with
             only 'silent' ischemia will be excluded).

          -  Need for urgent or emergent revascularization.

          -  Need for concomitant surgical procedure at the time of CABG (e.g. valve repair or
             replacement, aneurysm resection, etc.).

          -  Hemodynamically unstable patients, as defined by heart rate ≤40/min or ≥100/min,
             and/or systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or ≥200 mmHg, and/or ongoing need for
             intravenous inotropic or vasopressor medications.

          -  Patients with confirmed myocardial infarction within 14 days, and/or rising cardiac
             biomarker proteins (i.e. troponin), and/or worsening ECG changes.

          -  Prior CABG surgery.

          -  Stroke within 3 months prior to planned CABG.

          -  Severe chronic renal insufficiency (serum creatinine ≥ 200 mmol/dl or need for
             dialysis), liver disease, (diagnosis of cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, or elevation of
             serum transaminases ≥3 times the upper limit of normal), cerebrovascular disease
             requiring concomitant carotid endarterectomy, peripheral arterial disease
             (claudication as the primary factor limiting activity), active non-dermatological
             malignancy requiring on-going treatment, or any other condition that would place the
             patient at increased risk for complications in the judgment of the attending
             cardiologist or cardiac surgeon

          -  Contra-indication for bone marrow aspiration (Thrombocytopenia &lt;50.000 mm3, INR &gt;2.0,
             use of antiplatelet agents other than aspirin).

          -  Any condition associated with a life expectancy of less than 6 months

          -  Patients known allergic reaction or contraindication to any of the component of the
             CD133+ enriched cells

          -  Participation in other studies
