      Primary Hypothesis: The therapy with Sunitinib represents better cost-effectiveness than
      IFN-α in first-line treatment for metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC) in Central America
      and Caribbean countries

      This study was terminated on 03Feb2011 due to the fact that the anticipated number of
      patients expected was not reached. The date of cessation of the drug was January 27, 2011.
      There was no intervention in the treatment or administration of the drug; the study only
      observed the treatment and collected data. As the study was dependent on the arrival of new
      patients with metastatic renal cancer, which was of a very low incidence, the study was
      terminated. Efficacy, adverse events or other safety issues were not factors in terminating
      the study. Lack of patients was the only reason.

        Adult men and women with mRCC will be evaluated for entering the study. The decision to use
        Sunitinib, IFN-α or Bevacizumab + IFN must be a joint decision made by the subject and the
        investigator. The investigator must discuss product information with the subject as per
        usual practice.
