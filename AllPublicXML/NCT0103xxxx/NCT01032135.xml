      1. Primary objective #1: Determine the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC in the
           full study sample with regard to treatment engagement over weeks 1-12 and
           cocaine/alcohol use over weeks 1-24.

             -  Hypothesis 1: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with
                the patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce higher rates
                of treatment engagement than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only
                (e.g., MI-IOP).

             -  Hypothesis 2: An intervention that explores several possible treatment options with
                the patient and provides the chosen option (e.g., MI-PC) will produce better
                cocaine/alcohol use outcomes than an intervention focused on engagement in IOP only
                (MI-IOP).

             -  Secondary analysis 1: Among the Non-engaged patients, determine rates of selection
                of each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and
                cocaine/alcohol use outcomes in each option.

             -  Secondary analysis 2: Among the Engaged patients, determine rates of selection of
                each of the three options in MI-PC, retention rates within each option, and
                cocaine/alcohol use outcomes in each option.

        2. Primary objective #2: Determine whether the relative effectiveness of MI-IOP and MI-PC
           varies as a function of engagement group, with regard to treatment engagement over weeks
           1-12 and cocaine/alcohol use outcomes over weeks 1-24.

             -  Hypothesis 1: The predicted main effect on retention favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP
                will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged group than among
                those in the Engaged group.

             -  Hypothesis 2: The predicted main effect on cocaine/alcohol use outcomes favoring
                MI-PC over MI-IOP will be significantly larger among patients in the Non-engaged
                group than among those in the Engaged group.

      3. Secondary objective #1: Examine outcomes on three secondary measures: percent days
      abstinent from all substances, negative consequences of drug use, and HIV high risk
      behaviors.

        -  Hypothesis 1: Outcomes on the secondary measures will be better in MI-PC than in MI-IOP.

           4. Secondary objective #2: Test hypotheses concerning potential mediators of the
           predicted main effect favoring MI-PC over MI-IOP.

        -  Hypothesis 1: The predicted advantage of MI-PC over MI-IOP will be mediated by greater
           increases in motivation, self-efficacy, commitment to abstinence, and self-help
           involvement in MI-PC.

           5. Secondary objective #3: Test hypotheses concerning effect of additional MI
           intervention after initial non-engagement persists through 12 weeks.

        -  Hypothesis 1: A second telephone MI intervention will produce higher rates of subsequent
           engagement and less cocaine use than no further MI.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. meet DSM-IV criteria for lifetime cocaine or alcohol dependence and have used cocaine
             or alcohol in the prior 6 months;

          2. be &gt; 18 years of age;

          3. be judged clinically appropriate for IOP (e.g., no current psychotic disorder or
             evidence of severe dementia, and no acute medical problem requiring inpatient
             treatment;

          4. have no regular IV heroin use during the past year;

          5. have access to a telephone;

          6. be willing to be randomized and participate in research; and

          7. no current participation in methadone or other forms of DA treatment, other than IOP.
             Finally, because of study follow-up requirements, subjects will

          8. be required to be metropolitan area residents, and

          9. be able to provide the name, verified telephone number, and address of at least two
             contacts who can provide locator information on the patient during follow-up. We will
             include patients with dependence on other substances, provided that they are cocaine
             dependent and meet other inclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. have a current psychotic disorder (as assessed with the psychotic screen from the
             MINI) or evidence of dementia severe enough to prevent participation in outpatient
             treatment;

          2. have acute medical problem requiring immediate inpatient treatment; or

          3. are currently participating in methadone or other forms of DA treatment, other than
             IOP.

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>All participants were enrolled when they entered IOP treatment. We collected baseline measures and monitored their treatment attendance. At 2 weeks, we determined whether they were engaged or nonengaged and randomized all participants at that time. Only those that were nonengaged at week 2 and still nonengaged at week 8 were rerandomized at week 8.</pre_assignment_details>
