      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the toxicity of lobaplatin,
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin in patients with esophageal carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal cancer have a particularly poor prognosis
      .The overall 5-year survival rate for patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer is
      under 10%. Metastatic esophageal carcinoma is an incurable disease and due to the lack of
      effective therapies to manage this disease,the median survival is only 6 to 8 months
      Chemotherapy which is one of the most effective treatment so far is used as part of combined
      modality therapy for locally advanced diseases or as a palliative treatment for metastatic
      diseases.Lobaplatin is the third generation of platinum.Phase Ⅱclinical trials indicate that
      lobaplatin is effective for esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer and small cell
      lung cancer.
