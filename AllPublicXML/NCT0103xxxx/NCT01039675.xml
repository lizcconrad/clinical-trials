      The study will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the
      combination of inhaled GSK573719 and GW64244 compared to placebo, in subjects with COPD.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of GSK573719 (500mcg) Inhalation
      Powder and GW642444 (25mcg) Inhalation Powder administered once-daily via a novel dry powder
      inhaler (Novel DPI) over 28 days in subjects with COPD

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Pulse Rate Over 0 to 6 Hours Post-dose at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse rate is defined as the number of heartbeats in a minute. The weighted mean pulse rate was derived by calculating the area under the pulse rate/time curve (AUC), and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The weighted mean pulse rate was calculated using the 0 to 6 hours post dose measurements at Day 28, which included pre-dose, and post-dose 15 minutes, 45 minutes, 1.5 hours, 3 hours and 6 hours. Baseline pulse rate is the most recent result taken on or before pre-dose Day 1. Change from Baseline is the weighted mean pulse rate at Day 28 minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of Baseline pulse rate, sex, age, smoking status, treatment and day and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Pulse Rate Over 0 to 6 Hours Post-dose at Day 1 and Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, and Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse rate is defined as the number of heartbeats in a minute. The weighted mean pulse rate was derived by calculating the area under the pulse rate/time curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule, and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The weighted mean pulse rate was calculated using the 0 to 6 hours post dose measurements on Day 1 and Day 14, which included pre-dose, and post-dose 15 minutes, 45 minutes, 1.5 hours, 3 hours and 6 hours. Baseline pulse rate is the most recent result taken on or before pre-dose Day 1. Change from Baseline is the weighted mean pulse rate at Day 1 or Day 14 minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of Baseline pulse rate, sex, age, smoking status, treatment and day and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Maximum and Minimum Pulse Rate 0 to 6 Hours Post-dose on Days 1, 14, and 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, Day 14 and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Pulse rate is defined as the number of heartbeats in a minute (m). A maximum post-Baseline pulse rate was derived as the maximum value recorded at Days 1, 14 and 28. A minimum post-Baseline pulse rate was derived as the minimum value recorded at Days 1, 14 and 28. The maximum and minimum pulse rates were calculated using the 0 to 6 hours (h) post dose measurements on Days 1, 14 and 28, which included pre-dose, and post-dose 15 m, 45 m, 1.5 h, 3 h and 6 h. Maximum and minimum post-Baseline rate were calculated using the nominal 0-6 h post-dose records, and only records collected during the actual 0-7 h post-dose interval were used. Baseline pulse rate is the most recent result taken on or before pre-dose Day 1. Change from Baseline is the maximum or minimum pulse rate minus the Baseline value. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of Baseline pulse rate, sex, age, smoking status, treatment and day and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Pulse Rate Over 0 to 6 Hours Post-dose at Day 28</title>
        <description>Pulse rate is defined as the number of heartbeats in a minute. The weighted mean pulse rate was derived by calculating the area under the pulse rate/time curve (AUC), and then dividing the value by the time interval over which the AUC was calculated. The weighted mean pulse rate was calculated using the 0 to 6 hours post dose measurements at Day 28, which included pre-dose, and post-dose 15 minutes, 45 minutes, 1.5 hours, 3 hours and 6 hours. Baseline pulse rate is the most recent result taken on or before pre-dose Day 1. Change from Baseline is the weighted mean pulse rate at Day 28 minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of Baseline pulse rate, sex, age, smoking status, treatment and day and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Maximum and Minimum Pulse Rate 0 to 6 Hours Post-dose on Days 1, 14, and 28</title>
        <description>Pulse rate is defined as the number of heartbeats in a minute (m). A maximum post-Baseline pulse rate was derived as the maximum value recorded at Days 1, 14 and 28. A minimum post-Baseline pulse rate was derived as the minimum value recorded at Days 1, 14 and 28. The maximum and minimum pulse rates were calculated using the 0 to 6 hours (h) post dose measurements on Days 1, 14 and 28, which included pre-dose, and post-dose 15 m, 45 m, 1.5 h, 3 h and 6 h. Maximum and minimum post-Baseline rate were calculated using the nominal 0-6 h post-dose records, and only records collected during the actual 0-7 h post-dose interval were used. Baseline pulse rate is the most recent result taken on or before pre-dose Day 1. Change from Baseline is the maximum or minimum pulse rate minus the Baseline value. Analysis performed using a repeated measures model with covariates of Baseline pulse rate, sex, age, smoking status, treatment and day and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions.</description>
