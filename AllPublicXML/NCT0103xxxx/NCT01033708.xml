      Definition of the efficacy of NET compared with &quot;treatment as usual&quot; in the treatment of
      patients with complex traumatic disease (borderline personality disorder (BPD) and
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) as assessed by structured clinical interviews.
      Furthermore, to evaluate the sleep, cortisol level and epigenetic differences in the process
      of the specific therapy compared to treatment as usual.

      Experimental intervention:

      Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), an evidence-based trauma-focussed treatment, suitable for
      survivors of prolonged and repeated exposure to traumatic stress and childhood adversity.

      Control intervention:

      Treatment as usual.

      Follow-up per patient:

      3 follow-up assessments- 4 weeks, 6 months,12 months and 24 months after end of experimental/
      control intervention

      Duration of intervention per patient:

      Both treatment types will be conducted for 10-14 sessions of 60-90 min in length.

      Additionally 5 sleep laboratory investigations (1 pre- and 4 post- intervention (4 weeks, 6
      months, 12 months, 24 months after treatment)) will be carried out. Additionally the cortisol
      level in the hair and epigenetic markers will be recorded. The estimated observation time is
      2 years.
