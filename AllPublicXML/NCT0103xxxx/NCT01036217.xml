  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) uses a standardized set of procedures to
      develop a pool of potential participants for research studies. Because some of the data
      collected during screening are used later for research, the screening itself is considered a
      study. An applicant to any NIDA study is considered a participant in NIDA screening.

      Objectives:

      - To identify, recruit, and screen participants for NIDA research protocols.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 years of age and older who are able to provide informed consent.

      Design:

        -  Individuals who are eligible for screening will undergo two interviews: a telephone
           interview and an in-person interview. The phone interview will determine eligibility for
           the in-person interview.

        -  The in-person interview may require up to five visits to NIDA. The in-person visit will
           involve any or all of the following procedures: (1) full physical examination and
           medical history; (2) psychiatric interview; (3) psychological testing; (4)
           electrocardiogram; (5) samples of blood, urine, and hair; and (6) other minimally
           invasive procedures as directed by the research staff.

        -  During screening, a photograph will be taken for confirmation of identity during
           subsequent visits for other studies.

        -  No clinical care will be provided as part of screening.

      Through its clinical research protocols, the NIDA IRP attempts to: elucidate the nature of
      drug abuse and addiction; determine the potential use of new therapies, both pharmacological
      and psychosocial; and decipher the long-term effects of drugs of abuse on the development,
      maturation, function, and structure of the brain and other organ systems. In support of the
      IRP's work, the scientific goal of this screening protocol is to assess potential research
      participants' eligibility for NIDA IRP research studies. Screening will include medical and
      psychological tests and procedures. The data collected during screening are a unique and
      valuable source of information that aids in NIDA's mission. Therefore, a secondary goal of
      this protocol is to obtain data that characterizes the population of subjects contacting NIDA
      about research participation and to analyze data so obtained, such as that on the prevalence
      and consequences of HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, and related diseases.
