    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (how drugs are absorbed in
      the body, how they are distributed within the body and how they are removed from the body
      over time) of ceftobiprole after a single 250-mg intravenous (IV) infusion (given directly
      into the vein) for 2 hours, before and after dialysis to patients with end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or healthy volunteers.

      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (how drugs are absorbed in
      the body, how they are distributed within the body and how they are removed from the body
      over time) of ceftobiprole after a single 250-mg intravenous (IV) infusion (given directly
      into the vein) for 2 hours, before and after dialysis to patients with end-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) requiring hemodialysis or healthy volunteers. This is a Phase 1, open label
      study (all patients involved know the identity of the drug). Healthy volunteers will be given
      a single 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole; patients with ESRD on hemodialysis will be
      given a 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole 3 hours either before dialysis or immediately
      after dialysis. Plasma and urine samples will be assayed for ceftobiprole. Samples will be
      collected over a 48 hour period of time. Safety evaluations will include monitoring of
      adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry in all
      patients/volunteers, and urinalysis in healthy volunteers subjects), pregnancy testing, vital
      signs, physical examination, and recording of concomitant medications. Healthy volunteers
      will be given a single 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole; patients with ESRD on
      hemodialysis will be given a 2-hour infusion of 250 mg ceftobiprole 3 hours either before
      dialysis or immediately after dialysis.
