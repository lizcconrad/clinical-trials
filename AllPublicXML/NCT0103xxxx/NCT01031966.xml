  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this explorative trial is to collect preliminary data on efficacy and safety
      of thymosin alpha 1 given at different doses as an adjuvant to egg-derived H1N1sw monovalent
      influenza vaccine in hemodialysis patients. The final aim is that of gathering information
      needed for planning a following confirmatory study on the efficacy and safety of Thymosin
      alpha 1 in the same indication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The emergence and spread of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus has been of great concern
      globally.

      Uremic patients are especially vulnerable to infections and it is generally recommended to
      vaccinate patients with chronic renal insufficiency yearly against influenza. In patients on
      haemodialysis (HD) the vaccination response has been considered suboptimal.

      Decreased antibody response to T-cell dependent antigens may be one factor that accounts for
      insufficient efficacy of certain vaccination programs (eg, influenza). Diminished antibody
      responses have also been reported in patients with end-stage renal disease. The evidence for
      impairment of cell-mediated immunity in hemodialysis patients has been attributed to
      incompetence in T-cell-mediated immune responses.

      Since Zadaxin can enhance T-cell-dependent specific antibody production, the addition of
      Zadaxin (Thymosin alpha 1)to vaccination programs for immunocompromised individuals should be
      effective.
