    <textblock>
      In this open-label, multi-center study, patients were treated with frovatriptan for a maximum
      of 12 perimenstrual periods (PMPs). For each PMP, dosing commenced 2 days before the
      anticipated onset of the menstrual migraine (MM) headache and continued for a total of 6
      days. Patients were to take a loading dose of frovatriptan 5 mg (two tablets) twice daily on
      Day 1, followed by frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice daily on Days 2-6. During the study, patients
      were to visit the study site a total of 6 times. Efficacy and/or safety assessments were
      performed at each visit.

      This Phase IIIb, open label, multi-centre study evaluated the safety and tolerability of
      frovatriptan taken by patients for up to 12 perimenstrual periods (PMPs) for the prevention
      of menstrual migraine (MM). The study required approximately 300 patients to treat 6 PMPs and
      100 patients to treat 12 PMPs. To achieve these numbers, 550 patients were to be enrolled
      into the study. Once enrolled, patients were requested to treat at least 6 PMPs in the first
      9 months and 12 PMPs overall. Patients were to remain in the study for a maximum of 15 months
      or until they had completed the treatment of 12 PMPs, whichever occurred sooner.Patients were
      to take a loading dose of frovatriptan 5 mg (two tablets) twice daily on Day 1, followed by
      frovatriptan 2.5 mg twice daily on Days 2-6.
