    <textblock>
      To assess whether a non-invasive cardiac output monitor can follow heart function in children
      during treatments in the hospital. To establish a normal reference for children who are well
      and awake.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the ability of a new FDA-approved non-invasive Electrical
      Velocimetry (EV) cardiac monitor called AESCULON (Cardiotronic Inc, La Jolla CA) to detect
      and trend hemodynamic changes in hospitalized ambulatory pediatric patients during recovery
      from acute illness. We postulate that if the cardiac monitor can trend hemodynamic changes in
      hypertensive patients whose mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreases to normal levels, or
      hypotensive patients whose MAP increases to normal levels over several days, it may improve
      our understanding of different disease processes and allow us to improve care. We also seek
      to establish normative data for different measures provided by the AESCULON monitor -
      specifically cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR), which are the prime
      determinants of MAP.
