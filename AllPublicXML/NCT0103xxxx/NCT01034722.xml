      The aims of this study is:

        1. To investigate the diet influence on size and composition of fat globules in breast milk
           under controlled diet.

        2. To study the changes in globules distribution along one session of lactation and during
           the day.

      Study design:

      Subjects:

      This will be a open label study. Each subject will serve as his own control. Study population
      will include 45 volunteer mothers, that will divide to 3 groups: 15 vegetarians, 15 western
      diet and 15 Bedouins.

      Each participant will be nursing a 2-5 months baby. Each participant will sign an informed
      consent. Each participant will be ask to collect 2 milk samples twice a day i.e.- once on the
      first nursing in the morning (in the beginning and at the end of the nursing session), and
      once in the evening on last nursing again, (in the beginning and at the end). Each sample
      will contain 5 ml of milk.

      Participants will be asked to repeat the procedure one month later.
