  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will document the efficacy and acceptability of administration of magnesium
      sulfate with the Springfusor pump for patients and staff at two sites where treatment or
      preeclampsia with magnesium sulfate is limited or not available. Currently, both sites refer
      patients to tertiary care facilities for further treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women diagnosed with preeclampsia that the clinic care team deem would benefit from treatment
      with magnesium sulfate will be given the option of participating in the study. Those who
      choose to take part in the study and meet study inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive
      full information about the study and be required to give their written or signed informed
      consent.

      Women agreeing to participate in the study will receive a loading dose and maintenance
      therapy using an IV infusion administered by the Springfusor® pump. Women will receive a 8 mL
      loading dose containing 4g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4*7H2O) 50% solution, which is
      approximately 2 mmoL magnesium/mL. The loading dose of 8mL with 4 g MgSO4 will be
      administered using the Springfusor® pump. The administration of the loading dose will be
      immediately followed by a maintenance infusion. The maintenance dose of 4 g (8 cc, 50% MgSO4)
      will be administered with the Springfusor® pump continuously over four hours. Clinical
      monitoring will occur once every hour during the treatment period. Clinical monitoring will
      occur throughout the treatment, with reflexes, urine output and respiration to be checked at
      least every hour (or, if more frequent, as per standard practice at the study site). The pump
      will be checked at each monitoring visit. Prior to discharge from the study, patients will be
      asked to assess their opinions about the acceptability and ease of use of the mode of
      administration. All requests or inquiries about termination of treatment will be recorded.

    <description>Women will receive a loading dose and maintenance therapy using an IV infusion administered by the Springfusor® pump. Women will receive a 8 mL loading dose containing 4g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4*7H2O) 50% solution, which is approximately 2 mmoL magnesium/mL. The loading dose of 8mL with 4 g MgSO4 will be administered using the Springfusor® pump. The administration of the loading dose will be immediately followed by a maintenance infusion. The maintenance dose of 4 g (8 cc, 50% MgSO4) will be administered with the Springfusor® pump continuously over four hours. The pump will be started immediately after the initial bolus and the 4g dose repeated (and syringe replaced) every four hours. Maintenance therapy will be administered for at least 24h. Treatment will be discontinued when clinically indicated. Drug administration will be initiated at the sites and, when necessary, the patient will be transferred, with the Springfusor pump in situ, to the local referral site.</description>
