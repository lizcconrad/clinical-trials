      The purpose of this study is to measure the amount of moxidectin in subjects' blood and to
      measure safety. This study will enroll 36 children aged 4 to 11 years (&gt;=12 kg) with or
      without Onchocerca volvulus (O volvulus) infection. O volvulus is the nematode, or roundworm,
      that causes Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness. Each subject will receive a single
      dose of 4 mg moxidectin (orally administered) and will be followed inpatient from screening
      through day 13 and as outpatients through month 6. The study will take place at a single
      research center.
