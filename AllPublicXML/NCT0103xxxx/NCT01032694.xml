    <description>Participant reported outcome questionnaire was the assessment of participant's convenience with drug treatment based on following categories: very convenient or somewhat convenient and not convenient or not at all convenient. Value of 1 was reported if participant answered 'very convenient' or 'somewhat convenient' and 0 if participant answered 'not convenient' or 'not at all convenient'.</description>

    <description>Percent compliance with the prescribed treatment regimen was calculated as 100 multiplied by (number of tablets taken by the participant divided by number of tablets prescribed). Value of 1 was reported if percent compliance equals to 100, and 0 if percent compliance was non-missing and less than 100.</description>
