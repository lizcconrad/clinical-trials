  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will compare the efficacy with regard
      to sustained remission and safety of tocilizumab and methotrexate, in combination or as
      monotherapy, in treatment-naïve patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. Patients will be
      randomized to receive either tocilizumab (8mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus weekly methotrexate
      (po in ascending doses), or tocilizumab (8mg/kg iv every 4 weeks) plus placebo, or
      methotrexate plus placebo. Anticipated time on study treatment is 2 years, and target sample
      size is 300.

    <textblock>
      Multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (double placebo) three-arm
      parallel group, comparative study. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the
      following treatments:

        -  TCZ 8 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) + MTX (Group I: TCZ+MTX)

        -  TCZ 8 mg/kg + placeboMTX (Group II: TCZ+placebo)

        -  MTX + placeboTCZ (Group III: MTX+placebo)

      Randomization was stratified by participating center and baseline Disease Activity Score,
      scoring 28 joints (DAS28) level (&lt;5.1 vs. ≥5.1). Patients were evaluated every 4 weeks and at
      each visit a decision on dosage changes was made based on efficacy parameters (DAS28) and
      occurrence of adverse events (AEs). Patients received MTX/placeboMTX in climbing dosages.
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was added when remission was not reached with the maximum tolerable
      dosage (MTD) of MTX/placeboMTX. If after 12 additional weeks remission was not reached, HCQ
      was stopped and replaced by standard of care therapy (in Group I) or placebo therapy was
      replaced by the corresponding verum resulting in TCZ+MTX combination therapy (in Groups II
      and III). In case remission was reached, MTX/placeboMTX and TCZ/placeboTCZ had to be
      decreased. Patients were followed for a maximum of 24 months

    <description>Sustained remission rate (SRR) is defined as Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) &lt;2.6 during ≥ 23 weeks and no more than 4 swollen joints (28 joint count) due to RA at Week 24 of remission, with the exception of up to 2 in-between DAS28 values which could be between 2.6 and 3.2. The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. The index includes swollen (range 0-28) and tender (range 0-28) joint counts, acute phase response (ESR in mm/hr), and general health status (participant global assessment of disease activity using VAS, range 1-100 mm). DAS28, which uses a 28-joint count, is derived from the original DAS, which includes a 44-swollen joint count. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate worsening. DAS28 &lt;2.6 equals (=) remission.</description>

The left-hand extreme of the line equals 0 and is described as &quot; not active at all &quot; and the right-hand extreme equals 10 as &quot; very active &quot; .The final VAS score will be derived by multiplying the original scores by 10.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Score of Quality of Life at Weeks 12, 24, 52, and 104</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Weeks 12, 24, 52 and 104</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participants response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participant's health status.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in The Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) Score of Quality of Life at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The IPQ-R includes 9 domains (identity, acute or chronic timeline, consequences, personal and treatment control, illness coherence, timeline cyclical, emotional representations, and cause). For first 8 domains it scores as: 1(strongly disagree), 2(disagree), 3(neither agree/disagree), 4(agree), and 5(strongly agree), except identity as 1(yes) and 0(no). The sum of scores for identity, timeline, consequences, and cyclical domains are ranged from 0-16. High score represent strongly held beliefs about the number of symptoms attributed to RA, the chronicity of the condition, the negative consequences of the illness and the cyclical nature of the condition. The sum of scores for personal and treatment control, coherence dimensions, and emotional representations are ranged from 0-15. High score represent positive beliefs about the number of controllability of RA and a personal understanding of the condition. The data for 'Cause' domain was not considered for analysis in this study.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events, Any Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 104</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. A serious adverse event is defined as any event which was fatal (resulted in death), lifethreatening (with immediate risk of death), resulted in a new or prolongation of a current hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, was a congenital anomaly or birth defect, considered medically significant by the investigator, required intervention to prevent one or more of the outcomes listed above.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Sustained Remission Rate At Week 104</title>
        <description>Sustained remission rate (SRR) is defined as Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) &lt;2.6 during ≥ 23 weeks and no more than 4 swollen joints (28 joint count) due to RA at Week 24 of remission, with the exception of up to 2 in-between DAS28 values which could be between 2.6 and 3.2. The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. The index includes swollen (range 0-28) and tender (range 0-28) joint counts, acute phase response (ESR in mm/hr), and general health status (participant global assessment of disease activity using VAS, range 1-100 mm). DAS28, which uses a 28-joint count, is derived from the original DAS, which includes a 44-swollen joint count. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate worsening. DAS28 &lt;2.6 equals (=) remission.</description>

          <title>Median Time to First Sustained Remission</title>
          <description>It is the time to event analysis for the first period of sustained remission. Sustained remission is defined as DAS28 &lt;2.6 during ≥23 weeks and no more than 4 swollen joints (28 joint count) due to RA at Week 24 of remission, with the exception of up to 2 in-between DAS28 values which could be between 2.6 and 3.2. The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA. The index includes swollen and tender joint counts (range 0-28), acute phase response (ESR in mm/hr), and general health status (participant global assessment of disease activity using VAS, range 1-100 mm). DAS28, which uses a 28-joint count, is derived from the original DAS, which includes a 44-swollen joint count. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate worsening. DAS28 &lt;2.6 equals (=) remission.</description>

        <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the participant’s disease activity. DAS28 total scores range from 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement. Participants with missing data at visits before early study termination or who stopped the study prematurely because of insufficient therapeutic response or safety reasons considered non-responders or who stopped the study for other reasons, response set to missing after early withdrawal.</description>

        <description>The clinical disease activity index (CDAI) are continuous measures of RA disease activity. The CDAI is the numerical sum of four outcome parameters: tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC) based on a 28-joint assessment; and patient's global assessment (PtGA) and physician's global assessment (PhGA) assessed on 0-10 cm visual analog scale (VAS). CDAI total score ranges from 0 to 76. CDAI &lt;= 2.8 indicates clinical remission, &gt;2.8 to 10 = low disease activity, &gt;10 to 22 = moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 = high (or severe) disease activity.</description>

        <title>Median Change From Baseline in Simplified Disease Activity Index Scores at Weeks 24, 52, and 104</title>
        <description>The simplified disease activity index (SDAI ) are continuous measures of RA disease activity.The SDAI is the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC (based on a 28-joint assessment), PtGA and PhGA (assessed on 0-10 cm VAS), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (mg/dL). SDAI total score ranges from 0-86. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt;3.4 to 11 = low disease activity, &gt;11 to 26 = moderate disease activity, and &gt;26 = high disease activity.</description>

        <description>European league against rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria classify each participant as a good, moderate or non-responder to treatment based on the degree of improvement from baseline and the level of disease activity at the endpoint. EULAR response is derived using the individual participant’s DAS28 as the measure of severity of disease. Good or moderate response is defined as follows: Good response : DAS28 at the time point =&lt;3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2. Moderate response : DAS28 at the time point &gt; 3.2 and improvement from baseline &gt; 1.2, or DAS28 at the time point ≤ 5.1 and improvement from baseline &gt; 0.6 and =&lt;1.2.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Modified Sharp/Van Der Heijde Score at Weeks 52 and 104</title>
        <description>The degree of joint damage was assessed using the van der Heijde modified total Sharp score (mTSS). The methodology quantifies the extent of bone erosions for 44 joints and joint space narrowing (JSN) for 42 joints, with higher scores representing greater damage. The independent read of X-ray images was performed by 2 primary readers. In case of discrepancy between the 2 primary readers, an adjudicator was involved. The mTSS can range from 0 to 448 with a higher score indicating more joint damage. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in The EuroQol Score of Quality of Life at Weeks 12, 24, 52 and 104</title>
        <description>&quot;EuroQol (EQ-5D) is a standard self-completed participant questionnaire that measures health outcome. The EQ-5D questionnaire consists of 2 parts: 1) EQ-5D with five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort, and anxiety / depression. Each dimension is rated on a 3-point response scale as 1 = no problems, 2 = some/moderate problems, 3 = extreme problems. The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, where ‘1’ indicating full health and ‘0’ representing dead. The positive values indicate that during the study the health status improved. 2) EQ-VAS on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 = worst possible health status and 100 = best possible health status.”</description>

        <description>The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a questionnaire used to assess physical functioning and is made up of eight domains: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional and Mental Health. Transforming and standardizing these domains leads to the calculation of the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) measures. Scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 0=worst score (or quality of life) and 100=best score. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Score of Quality of Life at Weeks 12, 24, 52, and 104</title>
        <description>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participants response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant’s response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflects an improvement in the participant’s health status.</description>

        <description>The IPQ-R includes 9 domains (identity, acute or chronic timeline, consequences, personal and treatment control, illness coherence, timeline cyclical, emotional representations, and cause). For first 8 domains it scores as: 1(strongly disagree), 2(disagree), 3(neither agree/disagree), 4(agree), and 5(strongly agree), except identity as 1(yes) and 0(no). The sum of scores for identity, timeline, consequences, and cyclical domains are ranged from 0-16. High score represent strongly held beliefs about the number of symptoms attributed to RA, the chronicity of the condition, the negative consequences of the illness and the cyclical nature of the condition. The sum of scores for personal and treatment control, coherence dimensions, and emotional representations are ranged from 0-15. High score represent positive beliefs about the number of controllability of RA and a personal understanding of the condition. The data for ‘Cause’ domain was not considered for analysis in this study.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in The IPQ-R Score of Quality of Life at Week 24</title>
        <description>The IPQ-R includes 9 domains (identity, acute or chronic timeline, consequences, personal and treatment control, illness coherence, timeline cyclical, emotional representations, and cause). For first 8 domains it scores as: 1(strongly disagree), 2(disagree), 3(neither agree/disagree), 4(agree), and 5(strongly agree), except identity as 1(yes) and 0(no). The sum of scores for identity, timeline, consequences, and cyclical domains are ranged from 0-16. High score represent strongly held beliefs about the number of symptoms attributed to RA, the chronicity of the condition, the negative consequences of the illness and the cyclical nature of the condition. The sum of scores for personal and treatment control, coherence dimensions, and emotional representations are ranged from 0-15. High score represent positive beliefs about the number of controllability of RA and a personal understanding of the condition. The data for ‘Cause’ domain was not considered for analysis in this study.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in The IPQ-R Score of Quality of Life at Week 104</title>
        <description>The IPQ-R includes 9 domains (identity, acute or chronic timeline, consequences, personal and treatment control, illness coherence, timeline cyclical, emotional representations, and cause). For first 8 domains it scores as: 1(strongly disagree), 2(disagree), 3(neither agree/disagree), 4(agree), and 5(strongly agree), except identity as 1(yes) and 0(no). The sum of scores for identity, timeline, consequences, and cyclical domains are ranged from 0-16. High score represent strongly held beliefs about the number of symptoms attributed to RA, the chronicity of the condition, the negative consequences of the illness and the cyclical nature of the condition. The sum of scores for personal and treatment control, coherence dimensions, and emotional representations are ranged from 0-15. High score represent positive beliefs about the number of controllability of RA and a personal understanding of the condition. The data for ‘Cause’ domain was not considered for analysis in this study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events, Any Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation</title>
        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. A serious adverse event is defined as any event which was fatal (resulted in death), lifethreatening (with immediate risk of death), resulted in a new or prolongation of a current hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, was a congenital anomaly or birth defect, considered medically significant by the investigator, required intervention to prevent one or more of the outcomes listed above.</description>
