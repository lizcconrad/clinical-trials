  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will be an exploratory investigation of the rate of occurrence of
      ADHD/S-ADHD in adolescent cancer survivors. The procedures that will be used for identifying
      attention problem symptoms, determining the frequency and severity of such symptoms, and
      characterizing the level of impairment resulting from the symptoms are novel to pediatric
      oncology research.This pilot study will draw from the approach used in traumatic brain injury
      research of post-injury effects to illuminate more clearly the nature of attentional late
      effects experienced by survivors of childhood cancer.

      1. This study will investigate the feasibility of assessing symptoms of developmental ADHD
           and &quot;secondary ADHD&quot; (S-ADHD) among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer using a
           structured diagnostic clinical interview procedure. (S-ADHD describes an acquired
           clinical presentation that is consistent with the diagnostic criteria of ADHD).

        2. This study will provide preliminary estimates of the rate of occurrence of ADHD/S-ADHD
           among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer as compared to the prevalence of
           developmental ADHD in the general population.

        3. The study will examine the relationship between ADHD/S-ADHD symptoms and laboratory
           measures traditionally used to assess specific components of attention (e.g., CPT) in
           survivors of childhood cancer.

        4. The study will examine the relationship between ADHD/S-ADHD symptoms and smoking
           (including intentions, behaviors, and motivators) among adolescent survivors of
           childhood cancer.

        Participants will be recruited through consecutive enrollment in the SJCRH Leukemia,
        Neuro-Oncology, Radiation Oncology, and After Completion of Therapy (ACT) clinics.
        Participants will be accrued using a broad stratification process for gender (female, male)
        and age (12-14 years, 15-17 years) for each diagnosis group (brain tumor, ALL).
