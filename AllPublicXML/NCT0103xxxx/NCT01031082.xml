  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and characterize the bacteria causing acute otitis
      media episode in HIV-positive and HIV-negative children (&gt;=3 months to &lt;5 years) in South
      Africa. Middle ear fluid sampling either by tympanocentesis or by careful sampling of
      spontaneous otorrhoea will be done; nasopharyngeal aspirate and urine sample will also be
      collected from the subjects.
