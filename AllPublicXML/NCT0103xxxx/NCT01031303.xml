  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide further immunogenicity and safety information of
      sanofi pasteur's DTacP-IPV combined vaccine (TETRAXIM™) as a booster dose during the 4th and
      6th year of life in children that previously received in Study E2I34 (NCT 00255021), sanofi
      pasteur DTacP-IPV// PRP~T vaccine (PENTAXIM™) as a three-dose primary and booster
      vaccinations.

      Primary Objective :

        -  To assess immunogenicity in terms of seroprotection rates (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio
           types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion/vaccine response rates to acellular Pertussis
           antigens (Pertussis toxoid [PT], Filamentous Haemagglutinin [FHA]) of sanofi pasteur's
           DTacP-IPV (Tetraxim™) vaccine, one month after the booster dose given at 4 to 6 years of
           age.

      Secondary Objectives :

        -  To describe the antibody persistence in terms of anti-pertussis antibody levels
           (anti-PT, and -FHA) and in terms of seroprotection rates and GMTs for Diphtheria,
           Tetanus, and Poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3, just before administration of the booster dose
           (at Visit 1) in all subjects at 4-6 years of age.

        -  To assess immunogenicity in terms of seroprotection rates (Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio
           types 1, 2 and 3) and seroconversion/ vaccine response rates to acellular Pertussis
           antigens (PT, FHA) of sanofi pasteur's DTacP-IPV (Tetraxim™) vaccine, one month after
           administration of the booster dose given at 4 to 6 years of age.

        -  To describe the safety after the booster dose of the study vaccine.

      All participants that previously completed the three-dose primary and the booster
      vaccinations in the study E2I34 (NCT 00255021) will be contacted to enroll in this study to
      receive sanofi pasteur's DTacP IPV combined vaccine (Tetraxim™) at 4 to 6 years of age.

      Participants will receive the study vaccine [sanofi pasteur's DTacP-IPV vaccine (TETRAXIM™)]
      at 4 to 6 years of age (at visit 1).
