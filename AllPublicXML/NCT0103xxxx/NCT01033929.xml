  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety of two doses of C-Tb (0.01 and 0.1 µg/0.1 mL)
      when administered intradermally by the Mantoux technique to patients in the acute phase of
      treatment against active TB. The secondary objectives are to assess the immune response of
      two doses (0.01 and 0.1 µg/0.1 mL) of C-Tb from the size of induration and to assess the
      safety of unpreserved C-Tb and C-Tb preserved with 0.5% phenol (local reactions).

      This clinical trial is a single centre phase Ib open dose adjustment study with respect to
      the dose of C-Tb combined with a double blind randomised, split-body comparison of
      unpreserved C-Tb and C-Tb preserved with 0.5% phenol (each patient receives the unpreserved
      version in one arm and the preserved version in the other arm).
