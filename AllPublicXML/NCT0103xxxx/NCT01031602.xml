      The instruments used in this study will be completed at one timepoint, by those women who
      choose to participate, anonymously. The questionnaires will be preceded with a statement
      informing the patient that by completing the study questionnaires she is consenting to study
      participation. No patient names or medical record numbers will be documented.

      When a patient checks in for her clinic appointment, she will receive a packet of study
      materials consisting of a cover letter describing the study objectives, the Female Sexual
      Function Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and a demographic questionnaire.
      The tools used in this study will be available in both English and Spanish.
