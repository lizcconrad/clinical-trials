  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will determine whether the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, teplizumab, can help to
      prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in relatives determined to be at very
      high risk for developing the disease. Teplizumab has been studied in new onset type 1
      diabetes for testing of efficacy and safety in previous studies; other studies are currently
      in progress. The results of previous studies indicate that teplizumab reduces the loss of
      insulin production during the first year after diagnosis in individuals with type 1 diabetes.
      The purpose of this study is to determine if teplizumab can interdict the immune process that
      causes the destruction of insulin secreting beta cells in the pancreas during the
      &quot;pre-diabetic&quot; state and thereby prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes.

      The study plans to enroll approximately 71 subjects between the ages of 8-45 years, over 2-3
      years. The study is projected to last between 4-6 years, depending upon rate of enrollment
      and number of subjects who develop diabetes.

      The main study objective is to determine whether intervention with teplizumab will prevent or
      delay the development of type 1 diabetes in high risk autoantibody positive non-diabetic
      relatives of individuals with T1D. Secondary outcomes are to include analyses of C-peptide
      and other measures from Oral Glucose Tolerance Testing (OGTT), safety, tolerability, and
      other mechanistic outcomes will be assessed during the study.
