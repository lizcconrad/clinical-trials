  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common diseases affecting the joints, usually those
      that are weight bearing such as the knees. OA is considered to be a disease of the cartilage
      in the joints even though it involves the whole joint, including the bone and synovium (thin
      lining of the joints which produces synovial fluid). With time, more and more of the
      cartilage is destroyed by the disease with inflammation commonly occurring.

      AS902330 is expected to increase the production and development of specific bone cells:
      chondrocytes and osteoblasts (cells that produce and maintain bone and cartilage). This is
      expected to lead to repair and generation of the cartilage, and a narrowing of the space
      width between the knee joints in a selected region of the knee cartilage. The purpose of this
      study is to see how safe treatment with AS902330 is, and to evaluate its effect on the knee
      cartilage. In addition, the study will also measure the effects of AS902330 in the blood,
      which reflect disease activity.
