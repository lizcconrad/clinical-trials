    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BSI-201 on the objective response rate
      in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer patients receiving gemcitabine and
      carboplatin.

      Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it is concluded that iniparib does not possess
      characteristics typical of the PARP inhibitor class. The exact mechanism has not yet been
      fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells performed in the laboratory,
      iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of
      DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in tumor cell
      lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging modalities in tumor cell lines.
      Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its metabolites are ongoing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Histological diagnosis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, fallopian tube cancer, or
             primary peritoneal carcinoma

          -  Completion of only one previous course of chemotherapy which contained a platinum
             therapy, with sensitivity to that regimen. &quot;Platinum-sensitivity&quot; is defined by a
             relapse greater than 6 months after termination of platinum-based chemotherapy

          -  Measurable disease, defined by at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in
             at least one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded), and is ≥ 20 mm when
             measured by conventional techniques (palpation, plain x-ray, computed tomography [CT],
             or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or ≥ 10 mm when measured by spiral CT

          -  Adequate organ function defined as: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3,
             platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, creatinine clearance &gt; 50mL/min, alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN; or &lt; 5
             x ULN in case of liver metastases); total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL

          -  For women of child bearing potential, documented negative pregnancy test within two
             weeks of study entry and agreement to acceptable birth control during the duration of
             the study therapy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2

          -  Signed, institutional review board (IRB) approved written informed consent

          -  Concurrent invasive malignancy, not including:

               1. Non-melanomatous skin cancer

               2. In situ malignancies

               3. Concurrent superficial endometrial carcinoma, if their endometrial carcinoma is
                  superficial or invades less than 50% the thickness of the myometrium)

               4. Low risk breast cancer (localized, non-inflammatory) treated with curative intent

          -  Lesions identifiable only by positron emission tomography (PET)

             cardiac failure or an electrocardiogram (ECG) suggesting significant conduction defect
             or myocardial ischemia

          -  Enrollment in another investigational device or drug study, or current treatment with
             other investigational agents

          -  Concurrent radiation therapy to treat primary disease throughout the course of the
             study
