      The purpose of this study was to:

        1. To investigate the feasibility of using infrared (IR) thermometer to grade the severity
           of oral mucositis in patients with multiple myeloma undergoing chemotherapy.

        2. To obtain preliminary data on the most optimal method of scoring the severity of oral
           mucositis by comparing the results obtained using the IR thermometer to the World Health
           Organization (WHO) mucositis grading system and the patient self-assessment
           questionnaire.

        3. To Investigate the correlation between the quantitative readings obtained from oral
           mucosa with the IR thermometer.

    <textblock>
      Several grading systems for oral mucositis are available including those of the World Health
      Organization (WHO), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), Western Consortium for Cancer
      Nursing Research WCCNR, and the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCICTC)
      and others However, all of these oral mucositis grading systems rely on visual examination
      and are therefore subjective and operator-dependent tools and suffer from significant
      interpersonal variability (6). With the current improvements in medicine and technology,
      there is definitely a need for a more objective, easy to perform, non-invasive, affordable,
      quantitative and reproducible tool that is operator-independent to assess the severity of
      oral mucositis. The introduction of such a tool would greatly improve our ability to compare
      the oral mucosal toxicity of antineoplastic therapies and the efficacy of various
      mucoprotective therapies. Furthermore, the use of such a tool can be extended to patients
      undergoing radiation treatment with or without chemotherapy for various malignancies
      including head and neck cancers.
