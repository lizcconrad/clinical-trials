  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that a focused Emergency Department (ED) intervention for uncontrolled
      hyperglycemia enables safe and effective glycemic management and reduces emergency room
      re-visits. We assessed hypoglycemia BG &lt; 60mg/dL; change in mean blood glucose and A1C, and
      ED revisits for hyperglycemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with BG &gt; 200mg/dL presenting to an urban tertiary care hospital ED were enrolled in
      a 4 week prospective intervention with historic self-controls. Subjects returned at 12-72
      hours, 2 and 4 weeks. Diabetes medications (including sulfonylureas, metformin and/or
      insulin) were initiated and/or adjusted at each visit using the intervention algorithm per
      presenting blood glucose and prior diabetes medications. Survival skills self-management
      education and navigation to outpatient services were provided.
