  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study's aim is to provide information about the clinical and business cases for
      comprehensive interactive cancer communication systems (ICCS) in the context of real world
      use for cancer care.

      This study will be conducted within the Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) healthcare system.
      Outcomes for this study include amount of ICCS use and women's ratings of cancer information
      competence, perceived social support, and emotional well being. Secondary outcomes will
      include healthcare utilization, cost-effectiveness, and clinician ratings of healthcare
      visits.

    <description>Half of the participating women will be randomly assigned to use an informative but static website (Basic ICCS), and half will be offered a fully interactive CHESS (Enhanced ICCS + the Basic ICCS). Study outcome data will be gathered from patients, clinicians, and the healthcare system (i.e., from the electronic medical record: EMR) for at least 8 months after study entry. We propose that the Enhanced ICCS relative to the Basic ICCS, will:
Improve patients' sense of cancer information competence (perceived ability to obtain and use relevant information)
Reduce patients' negative affect and increase their emotional well being
Improve patients' sense of social support
Improve patients' health self-efficacy
Improve patients' ratings of experience with cancer specialty care services
Improve patients' health related quality of life (HRQL)
Improve clinicians' ratings of quality of patient contacts
Reduce healthcare utilization and costs (obtained via the EMR)</description>
