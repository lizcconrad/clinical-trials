  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical trial is being conducted to test the effects of a potential new treatment in
      patients with ulcerative colitis. Study participants will be given capsules containing either
      ORE1001 or a matching placebo capsule and will take the medicine by mouth for six weeks.
      Study participants will be asked to visit clinic sites where they will be asked questions
      about their ulcerative colitis. Small samples of blood will be be drawn at study visits to
      monitor the participant's health and a tiny sample of tissue will be taken in an endoscopy at
      two times to determine whether the disease is getting better or worse.

      This is a Phase Ib/IIa prospective, multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo
      controlled, clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pilot therapeutic
      activity of ORE1001, administered as capsules by mouth, for 6 weeks in subjects with
      Ulcerative Colitis.

      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to either ORE1001 or placebo, respectively.
      Sigmoidoscopies with biopsies will be performed at the first treatment visit and week 6.

      Subjects will be instructed to self-administer the study drug on an outpatient basis and will
      be scheduled to return for clinical evaluation on weeks 2, 4, 6 and between Weeks 10-12.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has a documented diagnosis of mild to moderate Ulcerative Colitis, as
             demonstrated clinically and by endoscopy at Visit 2.
