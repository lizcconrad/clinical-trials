    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research project is to estimate the number of patients with
      sarcoma or melanoma attending an outpatients clinic that are in pain or have unmet pain
      needs.

    <measure>We will also seek to identify potential predictors of pain intensity in patients that do have pain. In addition to the risk factors already mentioned above, duration and cause of pain will also be tested in this case as potential pain predictors.</measure>
