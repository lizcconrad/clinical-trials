  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will assess the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and safety of
      intravenous (iv) Tamiflu (oseltamivir) in 3 cohorts of children, aged 6-12, 3-5 and 1-2
      years, with influenza infection. Patients will receive iv Tamiflu therapy for 5 days (10
      doses). For patients whose conditions no longer merit continued iv dosing, therapy may be
      switched to oral Tamiflu to complete their prescribed course of treatment. If medically
      necessary, iv or oral therapy with Tamiflu may be continued for up to 5 additional days.
      Anticipated time on study treatment is 5 to 10 days.

      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 2836 participants were prescreened, of which, 2828 failed evaluation. The most common reasons for screen failure included: negative influenza diagnosis, not meeting the age criterion, ability to tolerate/absorb oral medication, and an inability to comply with the study procedures.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants received oseltamivir (Tamiflu) twice daily (every 12 hours) intravenously (IV) over 5 or 6 days for a total of 10 doses. The oseltamivir doses were based on participantâ€™s body weight.

For participants who did not receive all 10 doses IV, treatment could be completed with oral oseltamivir suspension (twice daily). If medically necessary, participants were allowed to receive an additional 10 doses of IV or oral oseltamivir after the initial 10 doses.</description>
