  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have allowed
      researchers to map and study how the brain works when at rest and when engaged in specific
      tasks. MRI scans have provided more information about how drugs affect the brain, and about
      how drug addiction changes the brain and influences behavior, mood, and thinking processes.
      To better understand the underlying mechanism of drug addiction and to develop strategies for
      more effective treatment, researchers are interested in developing new MRI techniques to
      study the effects of addiction on the brain.

      Objectives:

      - To develop new functional and structural MRI techniques, and to evaluate their potential
      use in brain imaging studies related to addiction.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age.

        -  Participants may be smokers or nonsmokers, and may use drugs or not use drugs.

      Design:

        -  During the initial screening, participants will complete questionnaires about family and
           personal history, drug use, and other information as required by the researchers.
           Participants who will be asked to complete tasks during the MRI scan will be shown how
           to perform these tasks before the scanning session.

        -  Before each study session, participants may be asked to complete some or all of the
           following: questions about their drug use during the last week, a breathalyzer test, a
           urine drug-use assessment, a urine pregnancy test, or a measure of carbon monoxide.
           Participants will also provide blood samples before the start of the scan.

        -  For each scanning session, participants will have an MRI scan that will last
           approximately 2 hours.

        -  MRI scans may include injections with a contrast agent to study brain function, specific
           tasks to be performed during the scan, or an experiment that studies the brain's
           response to carbon dioxide....

      Objective:

      Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging techniques have proven essential for
      noninvasive mapping of brain physiology and pathology. The primary objective of this protocol
      is to develop advanced magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS) techniques
      for neuroimaging studies related to addiction. These neuroimaging techniques will be used in
      other studies to better understand the underlying mechanism of drug addiction and to
      potentially develop strategies for more effective treatment.

      Study population:

      Healthy controls and drug users will participate in the study. Technical developments of
      MRI/MRS will be performed on healthy controls, while the evaluation of the applicability of
      these techniques to addiction related neuroimaging studies will be performed using drug users
      and healthy controls.

      Design:

      Based on the fundamental principle of the biophysical transduction of physiological signals
      to magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopic signals, advanced techniques will be
      developed to measure the activity, metabolism, structure, and biochemistry of the brain. The
      development of these techniques typically includes the following steps: 1) proof-of-concept
      computer simulations, 2) implementation of the imaging concept with an MRI scanner and
      phantoms, 3) feasibility testing on control subjects, and 4) evaluation of the sensitivity
      and specificity of these techniques in detecting functional changes modulated by task
      performance, contrast agent injection, CO2 administration, CO2 administration, or
      transcranial magnetic stimulation evaluation of these techniques in detecting functional
      and/or structural alterations of the brain related to a specific disease.

      Outcome measures:

      Advanced neuroimaging techniques developed from this protocol will demonstrate the ability to
      distinguish between drug using and control populations. Successful techniques will then be
      incorporated into hypothesis driven studies in the Neuroimaging Research Branch at NIDA-IRP.
      These techniques will also be useful, through publications and technology transfer, to the
      entire neuroimaging society.

      <textblock>
        -  Subjects must be between the ages of 18-55, be generally healthy and male or
             non-pregnant female. Smokers, non-smokers, drug using and non-drug using populations
             will participate in this study.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        General:

          -  Male and non-pregnant female adults between the ages of 18-55.

          -  All subjects must be able to provide informed consent.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be excluded if they:

          -  Are pregnant. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed on all female volunteers of
             child-bearing potential before each experimental session.

          -  Are unable to undergo MRI scanning due to implanted metallic devices (cardiac
             pacemaker or neurostimulator, some artificial joints, metal pins, surgical clips or
             other implanted metal parts including Copper 7 IUD) or claustrophobia.

          -  Are unable to safely undergo TMS stimulation due to having epilepsy or being at high
             risk for a seizure, being sleep deprived, having a history of unexplained fainting,
             recurrent severe headaches, significant head injury, having undergone a neurosurgical
             procedure, having metal in the head, having hearing problems or ringing in the ears or
             implanted medical devices that could malfunction under TMS stimulation.

          -  Have major medical illnesses to include, but not limited to, hypertension,
             cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes, peripheral vascular diseases,
             coagulopathies, syncope, history of superficial or deep vein thrombosis, HIV, or other
             clinically significant infectious diseases that may alter the signal being measured.

          -  Have current major psychiatric disorders to include, but not limited to, mood,
             anxiety, psychotic disorders.

          -  Have neurological illnesses including, but not limited to, seizure disorders,
             migraine, multiple sclerosis, movement disorders, or history of head trauma, CVA, CNS
             tumor.

          -  Have cognitive impairment as assessed by screening WASI vocabulary subtest below 48,
             corresponding to full IQ of 85 (in that case on screening, a full WASI will be done to
             verify IQ of 85 or above). Justification: Cognitive impairment and learning
             disabilities are associated with alterations in brain regions used to accomplish
             tasks, and, therefore, may introduce significant variably into the data.

          -  Inability to comply with task demands.

        Additional exclusions for some experiments:

        Based on the scientific and medical requirements of the particular experiment, participants
        may also be excluded for:

          -  left-handedness (if using a cognitive or affective task),

          -  color-blindness (if using a task requiring color discrimination),

          -  drug use diagnosis (if a technique is being validated in a non-drug using population),

          -  renal insufficiency (if contrast agents are to be used), as determined by estimated
             glomerular filtration rate, which must be &gt; 60 ml/min, as renal insufficiency greatly
             increases the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis from gadolinium exposure. Renal
             insufficiency may also be associated with metabolic abnormalities that may interfere
             with MR imaging.

          -  Lactation (if contrast agents are to be used). The safety of gadolinium for nursing
             infants has not been established.
