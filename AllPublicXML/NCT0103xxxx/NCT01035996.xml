      Background:

      - Schizophrenia is associated with cognitive impairment in different parts of the brain,
      including those associated with learning and memory. The brain activity associated with these
      impairments, however, is poorly understood. Researchers are interested in studying how the
      brain chemical dopamine, which is involved in responding to incentives and rewards like money
      or food, works differently in the brains of people who have schizophrenia.

      Objectives:

      - To study reward processing in individuals with schizophrenia who are taking different types
      of medication, compared with healthy volunteers.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who (a) have been diagnosed with
      schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and are taking the antipsychotic medication clozapine,
      (b), have been diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and are taking a
      different second-generation antipsychotic, or (c) are healthy volunteers.

      Design:

        -  This study will involve one screening visit and one or more visits for testing and
           functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. During the screening visit,
           participants will complete questionnaires and provide information about their physical
           and psychological health.

        -  Participants will receive training in the tasks to be performed at the scanning sessions
           during the screening visit.

        -  During the fMRI scans, participants will complete one or two of four possible
           reward-based tasks:

        -  A task that enables participants to win money based on their response to a target item.

        -  A task that provides small amounts of juice over specific time intervals, followed by a
           procedure to be completed outside the scanner.

        -  A task that involves choosing figures or shapes and winning money based on responses.

        -  A game of chance involving predictions based on shapes shown on a screen.

        -  Participants will also provide blood samples for research and testing.

      Objective:

      Schizophrenia (SC) is associated with cognitive impairment in a variety of domains, including
      learning and memory. The neural underpinnings of these cognitive deficits, however, are
      poorly understood. Based on evidence that abnormal functioning of brain dopamine (DA) systems
      is implicated in both schizophrenia and mechanisms of reinforcement processing, we proposed
      to test theories of the functional role of dopamine in schizophrenia. Specifically, the
      studies described here test two main ideas about DA function and its possible contribution to
      SC: 1) its role in facilitating learning of cue-reward associations; and 2) its role in
      signaling mismatches between expected and experienced outcomes (called prediction errors).

      Study Population:

      In order to assess brain responses to outcomes, and cues predictive of outcomes, we will
      enroll 135 total participants (SC patients and controls), aged 18 - 55. For a first set of
      experiments, we enrolled 54 total subjects (37 SCs and 17 controls) to achieve 34 total
      completers (24 SCs and 10 controls). In a second set of experiments, our goal is to examine
      two types of SC patients (those taking clozapine and those taking a different
      second-generation antipsychotic). For these experiments, we will enroll 81 total subjects (27
      controls, 27 SCs taking clozapine, and 27 SCs taking a different second-generation
      antipsychotic) to achieve approximately 47 total completers (15 controls, 16 SCs taking
      clozapine, and 16 SCs taking a different second-generation antipsychotic).

      Design:

      We will measure brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in
      conjunction with the performance of reinforcement processing tasks from the literature. These
      paradigms involve either the passive observation of reinforcement contingencies, or the
      requirement to make an appropriate response within a time window in order to earn positive
      feedback. The ongoing study uses two specific paradigms: one examining the impact of brain
      responses to feedback on subsequent learning, and one investigating how brain responses to a
      monetary reinforcer are modulated by the unexpectedness of the event.

      Outcome Measures:

      In the current study, we will investigate differences in MRI responses to outcomes between SC
      patients and controls, and between subgroups of patients. In particular, we are interested in
      determining whether MRI responses in components of reward circuits, such as the midbrain,
      basal ganglia, and orbitofrontal cortex, are attenuated in SC patients, in the context of
      paradigms that require individuals to detect mismatches between expected and experienced
      outcomes, and to modify responses based on those mismatches. We hypothesize that learning
      deficits in SC stem primarily from impairments in the signaling of errors in reward
      prediction, and that abnormalities in the signaling of errors in reward prediction will be
      reflected in abnormal stimulus-evoked activation in the primarily in two brain areas in SC
      patients (both DA target areas): prefrontal cortex and the neostriatum. We predict that these
      signals will relate systematically to performance on a reinforcement-learning task.

        In addition, patient participants:

          1. Must meet DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder at the time of
             assessment, and

          2. Must have had 4 weeks of stable pharmacological treatment (same medications at same
             doses).

        Individuals will be eligible for participation in one of the proposed experimental groups
        on the condition that they are:

        EXCLUSION CRIERIA:

        Participants in MRI scanning experiements

        All participants in the MRI scanning experiements will undergo standard screening as in the
        clinical policies of the IRP:

        All Participants in the MRI scanning experiments

        Participants in both experimental groups will be excluded from participation if they:

          1. Are unable to undergo MRI scanning due to pregnancy (via pregnancy test), implanted or
             attached metallic devices (e.g. cardiac pacemaker or neurostimulator; some artificial
             joints metal pins; surgical clips; braces; or other implanted metal parts),
             claustrophobia, or syncope, by self-report;

          2. Show current evidence of severe hypertension, as indicated by a blood pressure
             measurement at or above 190 systolic or 110 diastolic on two separate occasions.
             Potential participants with evidence of chronic and/or poorly controlled hypertension
             may be excluded by the MRP even with measurements below those values;

          3. Show current evidence of diabetes, as indicated by a blood sugar measurement of over
             300 mg/dl. Potential participants with evidence of chronic and/or poorly controlled
             diabetes may be excluded by the MRP even with measurements below those values;

          4. Suffer from HIV infection, coagulopathies, or other major medical illness which, in
             the judgment of the MRP, would seriously compromise the quality of the data gathered;

          5. Have any neurological illnesses that would interfere with the quality of the
             neuroimaging data gathered, i.e. to include (but not limited to): seizure disorders;
             migraine; multiple sclerosis; movement disorders; or history of head trauma, CVA, or
             CNS tumor;

          6. Are notably cognitively impaired by history or observation;

          7. Have a DSM-IV diagnosis of past alcohol or substance dependence (with the exception of
             nicotine);

          8. Test positively for any of 7 common banned substances at the time of screening;

          9. Are lactating, as hormonal fluctuations associated with lactation may interact with
             dopamine system function.

        Normal, Healthy Control Participants

        In addition to those exclusion criteria already outlined above, control participants will
        also be excluded if they:

          1. Have any current, or previous, diagnosis of any major psychiatric disorder, i.e. to
             include (but not limited to) mood, anxiety, and psychiatric disorders, or any
             substance-induced psychiatric disorders.

          2. Have any first-degree relatives with history of psychosis likely related to
             schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, or schizoaffective disorder.

          3. Have previously been diagnosed with a DSM-IV Axis II spectrum disorder.

        Patient Participants

        Patient patients will be excluded if they meet any of the criteria already outlined, and
        also if they:

          1. Have experienced any changes in pharmacological treatment and dose in the 4 weeks
             preceding study enrollment.

          2. We will exclude patients whose paranoid ideation might prevent them from feeling
             comfortable in the task- or scanning-environment.
