      <pre_assignment_details>55 participants were randomized to study CA180-031; 1 participant with chronic myelogenous leukemia-chronic phase (CML-CP) was withdrawn prior to dosing due to thrombocytopenia. 54 subjects were treated; 44 subjects finished the study period of CA180-031 and transferred CA180-036. Analyses were done on the population enrolled into CA180-031 study.</pre_assignment_details>
