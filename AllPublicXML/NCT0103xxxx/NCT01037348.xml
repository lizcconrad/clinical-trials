    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide efficacy and safety data in patients with choroidal
      neovascularisation (CNV) secondary to myopia using an individualized as-needed (PRN) dosing
      schedule. Eligible patients who have provided written agreement to take part in the study
      will receive an intravitreal (into the study eye) injection of ranibizumab 0.5mg. Following
      eye examinations and tests at monthly clinic visits, the study doctor will repeat the
      injections on a monthly basis as required for an additional 11 months, in accordance with
      specified retreatment criteria.

      Patients will be in the study for approximately 12 months and will visit the hospital clinic
      14 times over that period. The main assessments will include visual acuity tests, eye
      examinations, optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess retinal thickness, fundus
      photography and fluorescein angiography (FA), measurement of intraocular pressure, blood
      pressure and pulse measurements and completion of health-related questionnaires'.

          -  Male or female outpatients of any race, aged 18 years or older

          -  Diagnosis of active primary or recurrent subfoveal or juxtafoveal CNV secondary to PM

          -  Diagnosis of high myopia of at least -6 dioptres in the study eye spherical
             equivalent. For subjects who have undergone prior refractive or cataract surgery in
             the study eye, the preoperative refractive error in the study eye must have been at
             least -6 dioptres

          -  Patients who have a BCVA score between 78 and 24 letters in the study eye using Early
             Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like grading charts (approximately 6/9 -
             6/96 Snellen equivalent)

          -  Patients must give fully informed consent and be willing and able to comply with all
             study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any surgical intervention in the study eye within two months preceding
             screening

          -  Previous macular laser photocoagulation, treatment with intravitreal steroids,
             verteporfin with photodynamic therapy (Visudyne®) or anti-VEGF agents ranibizumab,
             bevacizumab or pegaptanib sodium (Macugen®) in the study eye

          -  Previous treatment with intravenously administered bevacizumab (Avastin®)

          -  Prior treatment in the study eye with external-beam radiation therapy, vitrectomy, or
             transpupillary thermotherapy

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical
             classes

          -  History of allergic reaction to fluorescein

          -  Concurrent use of systemic anti-VEGF agents
