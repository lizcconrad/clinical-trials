  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, randomized, controlled, open label study with two vaccine regimens. The
      study will assess the relative safety and immunogenicity of vaccine regimens comparing
      adjuvanted versus non-adjuvanted formulations of A(H1N1) inactivated influenza virus vaccine
      in subjects with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Infection and to compare safety
      and immunogenicity data with a contemporaneously enrolled control group of age-comparable,
      healthy subjects.

      Because certain individuals may be hypo-responsive to influenza vaccination, additional
      studies with high-risk groups are warranted in order to determine the optimal vaccine
      formulation and dosing schedule for prevention of novel H1N1 virus infection.
