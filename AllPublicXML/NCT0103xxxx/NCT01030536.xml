      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or
      optimal biologic dose (OBD) and safety profile of CAT-8015 in participants with relapsed or
      refractory advanced B-cell NHL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL], follicular lymphoma
      [FL], mantle cell lymphoma [MCL]) or CLL.

      <recruitment_details>Study was started on 15 Feb 2010 and was terminated on 12 Sep 2012. The Product Development Team authorized early termination of this study due to prioritization of resources and the need to prioritize allocation of investigational product across the studies in the moxetumomab pasudotox clinical development program.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 30 participants were screened and enrolled, of them 7 were failed screening. Twenty three participants were enrolled and assigned to treatment at 6 sites in the United States.</pre_assignment_details>

            <description>Participants received 60 mcg/kg Moxetumomab pasudotox (CAT-8015) as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5 of every 28-day cycle. Dose escalation was to be continued to the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or Optimal biologic dose (OBD). Subsequent dose levels with a 10 mcg/kg increase from the previous dose level were possible if an MTD or OBD was not reached by 60 mcg/kg.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Laboratory Abnormalities Recorded as Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</title>
          <description>Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) were defined as events that occur following the first injection of study treatment, or that started prior to the first injection and worsened during treatment. An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as adverse events/serious adverse events that started or worsened after the study drug treatment.</description>
          <population>Safety Population included all participants who received moxetumomab pasudotox. The safety population was used to evaluate baseline characteristics as well as all endpoints for safety.</population>

        <description>Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) were defined as events that occur following the first injection of study treatment, or that started prior to the first injection and worsened during treatment. An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as adverse events/serious adverse events that started or worsened after the study drug treatment.</description>
