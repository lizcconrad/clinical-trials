      This study is designed to assess the safety of the approved and licensed HUMENZA (adjuvanted
      A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine) and PANENZA (non-adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza
      vaccine) to meet regulatory requirements for post-marketing safety monitoring.

      Primary objective:

      To describe the incidence of serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest
      (AESIs) after HUMENZA or PANENZA administration throughout the study in different age groups.

      Secondary objective:

      To describe the incidence of non-serious cutaneous allergic reactions after HUMENZA or
      PANENZA administration in different age groups up to 21 days after the last vaccination.This
      study is designed to assess the safety of the approved and licensed HUMENZA (adjuvanted
      A/H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine) and PANENZA (non-adjuvanted A/H1N1 pandemic influenza
      vaccine) to meet regulatory requirements for post-marketing safety monitoring.
