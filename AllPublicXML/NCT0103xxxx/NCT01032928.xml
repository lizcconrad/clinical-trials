  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancers of the head and neck require surgical, radiation, and chemotherapy treatments that
      are intended to cure the disease. These treatments have toxic effects on muscles and
      structures that are necessary to swallow safely and efficiently. The resulting swallowing
      problems (dysphagia) often remain chronic for Veterans and interfere with their ability to
      eat and drink. The cost burden to the VA health system is high. There is an urgent need to
      develop rehabilitative treatments that lessen these burdens. The proposed research is
      designed to test a novel swallowing therapy that includes the coordination of breathing with
      swallowing. Our study will train medically and surgically treated, chronically dysphagic
      Veterans with histories of oropharyngeal cancer in a novel therapy that involves both
      swallowing and respiratory systems. If the therapy is found to be effective, the long term
      goal of the project is to extend the study to a multi-site, clinical trial and test the
      longstanding effect of this treatment compared to other swallowing therapies on swallowing
      function, QOL and cost.

    <textblock>
      Swallowing impairments (dysphagia) represent the highest functional morbidity in veteran
      patients treated for oropharyngeal cancers with either surgical approaches followed by
      radiation or with more recent organ-preservation protocols. The nature of the impairments is
      often resistive to treatment and results in life-long health consequences and high cost
      burden on the VA health system. Recent preliminary data have linked alterations in the
      otherwise highly stable respiratory-swallowing phase pattern relationships to the swallowing
      impairment and penetration/aspiration and in this patient group. The immediate goal of this
      clinical trial is to test the effect of a novel respiratory-swallow intervention on
      swallowing impairment and penetration/aspiration in a cohort of chronically dysphagic
      veterans following treatment for oropharyngeal cancer. Patients presenting with a
      &quot;non-optimal&quot; respiratory-swallow phase pattern during liquid swallows and measurable
      swallowing impairment will learn an &quot;optimal&quot; physiologic pattern that facilitates both
      airway protective and mechanical advantages during swallowing. The broad goal of this
      research is to develop ideal respiratory-swallowing phase training methods and regimens that
      alone or combined with traditional swallowing treatments improve swallowing function in the
      acute phases of recovery and improve long term patient outcome. Our intention is to use these
      preliminary data to motivate a larger clinical trial to compare the effect of
      respiratory-swallow phase training with other evidenced based methods of swallowing treatment
      and expand the approach to other patient groups that have indications of respiratory-swallow
      phase impairments (e.g. pulmonary disease and stroke) contributing to impaired swallowing
      function

    <description>Respiratory swallow patterns were collected using nasal airflow and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) of each swallow during the modified barium swallow study. The movements of the ribcage and abdomen were recorded using RIP; data synchronized and recorded using the KayPentax Digital Swallow Workstation Signals Lab.

    <description>The penetration aspiration scale is a validated 8 point interval scale used to describe penetration and aspiration events. Scores are determined primarily by the depth to which material passes in the airway and by whether or not material entering the airway is expelled. Scores &lt; 3 are considered to be normal. For the purpose of our study scores were dichotimized to normal and impaired.</description>

        <description>Respiratory swallow patterns were collected using nasal airflow and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) of each swallow during the modified barium swallow study. The movements of the ribcage and abdomen were recorded using RIP; data synchronized and recorded using the KayPentax Digital Swallow Workstation Signals Lab. Subjects were categorized as optimal (expiratory-expiratory) versus non-optimal (non-expiratory-expiratory).</description>
        <time_frame>Patient were assessed pre-treatment, one week post treatment and one month post treatment. Treatment sessions were twice weekly for up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
