      RATIONALE: Antiemetic drugs, such as fosaprepitant dimeglumine, may help lessen or prevent
      nausea and vomiting in patients treated with chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of fosaprepitant dimeglumine and to
      see how well it works in treating patients with nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fosaprepitant dimeglumine in patients with
           breakthrough chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) after failing prophylactic
           antiemetic therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate toxicity and serious adverse events associated with this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  To evaluate the ability of patients to tolerate oral intake.

        -  To evaluate the health-related quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate specific side effects associated with this regimen, including pain sensation
           and/or soreness at the infusion site, headache, dizziness, and somnolence, in these
           patients .

        -  To refine the study design for future phase II and III studies of rescue therapy for
           breakthrough CINV using various secondary endpoints.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive chemotherapy in combination with a pre-defined standard
      5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) antagonist or corticosteroid regimen with or without a
      benzodiazepine on day 1. If breakthrough nausea or vomiting occurs, patients then receive
      fosaprepitant dimeglumine IV once per standard administration guidelines. Patients with
      treatment response may receive additional doses of oral aprepitant once on days 2 and 3.
      Patients with persistent nausea/vomiting after 2 hours and who desire further treatment may
      receive standard rescue therapy with prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, or haloperidol with or
      without additional lorazepam until relief, at the discretion of the provider.

      Patients complete a diary at baseline, and then at 2, 12, and 24 hours that includes a Visual
      Analogue Scale (VAS) for nausea; VAS for sedation; and questions about emesis and retching
      frequency, headache, dizziness, somnolence, and ability to take food and liquids orally.
      Patients also complete the Functional Living Index-Emesis Quality of Life survey at baseline
      and at 24 hours.

    <measure>Improvement in Nausea Score From Baseline to 2 Hours as Assessed by the Numerical Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 hours after study drug administered.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure is the number of participants that self report improvement in a nausea score from baseline, prior to fosaprepitant, to 2 hours post dose. This includes only participants who report breakthrough nausea or vomiting after chemotherapy and after receiving prophylactic anti-emetics. The primary outcome is measured using the visual analogue scale, a self report scale from &quot;No Nausea&quot; to &quot;Nausea as bad as it can be&quot;; a value can be indicated anywhere on this scale using a free hand mark by the participant and gauged with ruler by study staff. Any participant that reported a lower value on the scale 2 hours from baseline would be considered in this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>The recommended dose Fosaprepitant (MK-0517) is 115 mg administered intravenously 30 minutes before chemotherapy treatment. In this study, a 150 mg dose will be given to study patients as rescue therapy after chemotherapy only in the event of breakthrough nausea or vomiting. Those participants who did not report episodes of emesis or did not require additional rescue medications are measured in this outcome</description>

        <title>Improvement in Nausea Score From Baseline to 2 Hours as Assessed by the Numerical Visual Analogue Scale</title>
        <description>The outcome measure is the number of participants that self report improvement in a nausea score from baseline, prior to fosaprepitant, to 2 hours post dose. This includes only participants who report breakthrough nausea or vomiting after chemotherapy and after receiving prophylactic anti-emetics. The primary outcome is measured using the visual analogue scale, a self report scale from &quot;No Nausea&quot; to &quot;Nausea as bad as it can be&quot;; a value can be indicated anywhere on this scale using a free hand mark by the participant and gauged with ruler by study staff. Any participant that reported a lower value on the scale 2 hours from baseline would be considered in this outcome measure.</description>
