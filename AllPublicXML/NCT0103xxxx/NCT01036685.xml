      Background:

        -  Drugs of abuse have effects on mood, behavior, thinking, and decision making that may
           encourage people to continue using them and make it difficult for them to stop.
           Researchers who study these effects are interested in developing new tests to evaluate
           how drugs and drug use affect different areas of the brain.

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans allow researchers to study brain activity and
           changes to brain function. When specific psychological tests are performed during
           functional MRI (fMRI) scans, researchers can examine the effects of drug use on the
           brain. By developing and testing new procedures for fMRI studies, more information can
           be obtained on brain function and activity in drug-using and non-drug-using individuals,
           and this information can help develop new treatments and therapies for substance abuse.

      Objectives:

      - To evaluate the effects of newly developed psychological procedures to be performed during
      fMRI scans.

      Eligibility:

        -  Healthy volunteers between 13 and 55 years of age who are willing to undergo MRI
           scanning.

        -  Both drug-using and non-drug-using individuals will be selected for this study.

      Design:

        -  Before the start of the study, participants will complete questionnaires about medical
           and psychological history, and provide information about past or current drug use.
           Researchers will introduce the tasks to be performed during the scanning session(s), and
           will allow participants to practice the test either on a separate computer or on the
           computer used during the MRI scan.

        -  During the study, participants will be asked to do one or more tasks selected by the
           researchers. The tasks will be performed on a computer in an MRI machine, and may
           involve receiving rewards (such as money or sips of juice) for actions, memory and
           reaction-time tests, or other tests that involve responding to instructions on the
           screen.

        -  Participants will receive compensation for their participation in the study, including
           hourly compensation for individual visits and lump-sum compensation for each MRI
           scan....

      Objective: Drugs of abuse have cognitive and affective effects that may contribute to the
      inception and maintenance of their use. In order to measure these effects, psychological
      tests suitable for use both in and outside the fMRI scanner need to be developed and
      validated. Thus, the objective of this protocol is to allow for the development, assessment
      and refinement of cognitive and affective tasks and determination of their practical
      feasibility and efficacy for both MRI and non-MRI application.

      The design and piloting of psychological tests and fMRI tasks specifically designed for an
      adolescent population allows the investigators to determine if the tests/tasks measure
      theorized cognitive constructs and result in measurable and interpretable fMRI data in
      adolescents.

      Study Population: This minimal-risk protocol will employ volunteer participants aged 18-55,
      who must be generally healthy and male or non-pregnant female. In order to ensure
      applicability to relevant groups, both drug and non-drug using volunteers as well as those
      recruited from clinical populations will be used to validate task design and parameters.
      Specially designated tasks may be piloted in prisoner populations.

      Design: Participants may pilot tasks outside and/or inside the MRI scanner, depending on the
      aspects of task development requiring verification. Tasks developed de novo will undergo both
      steps. Modifications to previously published MRI tasks may require only one of the steps.
      Upon their successful verification, specific experimental manipulations will be performed
      under separate, hypothesis driven protocols.

      Outcome measures: Our goal is to determine if the tasks developed reliably and appropriately
      measure specific cognitive constructs and behaviors thought to be associated with specific
      brain systems and, also if they yield measurable and interpretable fMRI results.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Male or female between the ages of 18-55.

               2. All subjects must be able to provide informed consent/assent. Additional criteria
                  for specific populations:

                    1. 379-smoker- daily smoker of tobacco cigarettes for at least one year
                       (excluding quit attempts)

                    2. 379-user- DSM-V substance use disorder on a substance other than nicotine.

                    3. 379-other-psych-diagnosis- DSM-V disorder, stable and in treatment (i.e., no
                       medication changes in the previous four weeks and a clearly identified
                       treating psychiatrist).

               3. Additional criteria for MRI phase participants:

        Right-handed. Assessment tool: Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. Rationale: Left-handed
        individuals may have lateralization of many brain functions that differ from right-handed
        individuals who are the majority of the population. Therefore, inclusion of left-handed
        individuals may add unwanted noise to imaging data.

        C) Exclusion Criteria

        Bench Only Phase (Does not require MRI. Task requires gathering of accurate behavioral
        data).

          1. History of neurological illnesses including but not limited to CVA, CNS tumor, head
             trauma, MS or other demyelinating diseases, epilepsy, movement disorders, or migraine
             in treatment. Assessment tool: phone screen and history and physical (H&amp;P). Rationale:
             Neurological illnesses are likely to impair performance on the range of tasks to be
             piloted under this protocol and may impair ability to tolerate the procedures.

          2. Current use of psychoactive medications unless required for the psychiatric disorder
             for which participants in the 379-user and 379-other-psych-diagnosis subcategories are
             being treated. Assessment tool: phone screen, H&amp;P, Triage, comprehensive urine
             toxicology. Rationale: psychoactive medications are likely to alter performace on the
             range of tasks to be piloted under this protocol.

          3. Cognitive impairment. Assessment tool: self report of extended placement in special
             education classes for learning problems, history of specific learning disability or
             mental retardation. Rationale: Cognitive impairment is likely to impair performance on
             the range of tasks to be piloted under this protocol and may impair ability to
             tolerate the procedures.

          4. Current major mood, anxiety or psychotic disorder (unless task is being evaluated in a
             specific clinical population). Assessment tool: self report, H&amp;P. Rationale: Current
             major mood or psychotic disorders are likely to impair performance on the range of
             tasks to be piloted under this protocol and may impair ability to tolerate the
             procedures.

             Additional criteria for MRI Phase:

          5. Pregnancy. Assessment tool: Urine pregnancy test. Rationale: Since the hormonal
             changes of pregnancy have been shown to have an impact on cognitive functioning and
             the tasks we are developing may yield only subtle differences between control and drug
             abusing subjects, we need to minimize any extraneous variation in the pilot data.
             Additionally, fMRI is not accepted as a safe procedure purely for research purposes
             during pregnancy.

          6. Deep vein thrombosis: Assessment tool: self report during H&amp;P of thrombosis, or a
             medical condition that may lead to a hypercoagulable state Rationale: Lying still for
             &gt;2 hours may be a risk for the development of DVT in persons with certain medical
             conditions. As such, persons with will be excluded.

          7. HIV positive individuals. Assessment tool: oral HIV test with serum confirmation of
             positive results. Rationale: potential for cognitive and/or other CNS disease that
             makes performing cognitive tasks non-reliable and /or non generalizeable to the
             general population. Also, potential liver/metabolic/vascular disease can interfere
             with the physiological transduction mechanisms for fMRI (i.e. making the measurement
             unreliable).

          8. Unable to undergo MRI scanning due to possible pregnancy, metallic devices in the
             body, claustrophobia or body morphometry.

          9. Currently using respiratory, cardiovascular or anticonvulsant medications that may
             interfere with the BOLD MRI signal.
