      This study will examine whether a higher protein meal replacement diet (consisting of 1 gram
      of protein per pound lean body mass) is more effective in causing weight loss compared to a
      standard meal replacement protein diet (consisting of ½ gram of protein per pound of lean
      body mass). The study will assign approximately 100 subjects (50 each) to the following arms
      1) higher meal replacement diet program 2) standard meal replacement diet program. All
      participants will meet with a registered dietitian to provide nutrition education and
      behavior modification, including general exercise recommendations. As part of your
      participation, you must be willing to undergo a measurement of body fat, and blood tests, and
      be willing to use Herbalife Meal replacements as part of your diet for the duration of the
      study (one year).

      There is concern that excess protein intake may be damaging to liver, renal function, and
      bone health. This study was designed to compare the effects of a high protein (HP) and an
      isocaloric meal standard protein (SP) weight loss plan on liver function, renal function and
      bone metabolism.

             control measures. Other types of birth controls such as condom, diaphragm, or sponges
             may not be considered adequate forms of birth control measures in this study.

          3. BMI of 27 to 40 kg/m2 inclusive.

          4. Subjects must be in good health as determined by medical history, physical
             examination, and screening clinical laboratory including chemistry panel and CBC.

        screening and agree not to intend to change such habits during the course of the study.

             months prior to screening.

          3. Use of any other investigational drug (s) within 8 weeks prior to screening.

          4. Abnormal laboratory parameters: Serum creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dl, Liver function tests,
             ALT, AST, Bili results &gt; 2.0 times the upper limit of normal. Triglycerides &gt; 500
