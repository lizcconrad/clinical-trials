  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to see if it is safe to
      give ACHN-490 Injection for 5 consecutive days, to measure plasma pharmacokinetics, and to
      determine lung penetration of ACHN-490 (measured in ELF-epithelial lining fluid)after a
      single dose of ACHN-490 Injection in healthy volunteers.
