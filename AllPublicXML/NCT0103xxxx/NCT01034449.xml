  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This program offers the opportunity to receive an allogeneic transplant to try to control the
      malignant hematologic in the absence of acceptable conventional donor and with a risk-benefit
      ratio equivalent to that which would be expected with a transplant from a more conventional
      donor.

      An economy of means in that this method could serve as an alternative to 2 units of placental
      blood transplantation. The current cost of disposal of a unit of placental blood from a bank
      is approximately 22000 € (Source: Biomedicine Agency, 2007 rates). The amplification process
      as controlled by &quot;EFSAL&quot; is 12000 €. Therefore, buying a unit and ex-vivo amplification is
      more economical. Moreover, the availability of placental blood is not infinite, and the use
      of one unit per patient will also save resources that can be valuable for certain groups of
      patients.

      In the longer term, methods of amplification of specific immunocompetent cells (from the
      fraction of CD 34 neg cells) are already being evaluated in the laboratory. They allow to
      consider a faster recovery, better and more targeted, including cells against the disease for
      which transplantation is performed.

      This is a multicenter prospective non randomized phase 2 clinical trial.

      The primary objective is defined by getting a neutrophil count above 500/ml for 3 consecutive
      days at day 42 after transplantation, in association with complete or partial chimerism on T
      cells (10 % to 90%).

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  the feasibility of expansion,

        -  tolerance immediate injection of a graft amplified,

        -  the payback of a platelet count&gt; 20 000/microlitre without transfusion,

        -  Incidence of graft loss or rejection within 6 months following transplantation,

        -  the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD,

        -  the mortality rate associated with transplantation,

        -  the incidence of relapse of hematologic malignancies,

        -  Overall survival,

        -  Disease-free survival at 1 year post transplant.
