  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of success in treating substance abuse may be contributed to by a limited
      understanding of the clinical neurobiology of drug abuse. A better understanding of such
      deficits might aid in the development of more relevant pharmacological and psychosocial
      treatment approaches. Thus, the purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that
      repetitive illicit drug use may be associated with cortical and subcortical structural
      abnormalities, vascular abnormalities, as well as neuropsychological decrements.
      Additionally, a battery of psychological tests are administered to provide information about
      demographics, drug use, neurocognitive measures, and personality structures....
