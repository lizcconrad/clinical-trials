    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients had mid or lower thoracic esophageal cancers that were confirmed on
             histology to be a squamous cell carcinoma deemed to be resectable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators excluded those patients who had distant metastasis to solid visceral
             organs or local invasion into trachea, descending aorta, or recurrent laryngeal nerve.

          -  Those patients who were older than 75 years or who had a serious premorbid condition
             or a poor physical status that compromised a thoracotomy were also excluded.
