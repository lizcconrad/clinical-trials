  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) was an established
      biomarker useful for infection in non-neutropenic patients. In this study, we tested sTREM-1
      in the patients with neutropenic fever. Pro-calcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP)
      were also measured. We planned to investigate and explore the role of sTREM-1 in early
      diagnosis of infection in patients with neutropenic fever.

      Patients with hematological malignancies developed neutropenia after chemotherapy. We checked
      the serum level of sTREM-1 in patients with neutropenic fever. Those patients were classified
      to 2 groups: documented infection or low likelihood of infection. Their sTREM-1 level was
      measured and was compared with other biomarker such as CRP and procalcitonin. The value of
      sTREM-1 for diagnosis of infection in patients with neutropenic fever was thus evaluated.
