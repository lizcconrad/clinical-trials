  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single arm, open-label study of oral lenalidomide monotherapy
      administered to red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependent adult subjects with
      Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA).

      Primary Objective: To evaluate the erythroid response rate as measured by rate of red blood
      cell transfusion independence [MDS International Working Group (IWG) 2000 Criteria will be
      applied].

      Secondary Objective: 1)To evaluate the tolerability and safety profile of lenalidomide in
      patients with DBA and other inherited marrow failure syndromes 2) To correlate response to
      lenalidomide with biologic surrogates of DBA including ribosomal protein mutation status, ex
      vivo erythroid colony growth, and microarray gene expression

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will utilize an intra-patient dose escalation design. Cycles are 28 days in
      length. Subjects will receive lenalidomide 2.5 mg weekly during days 1 to 21 of cycle 1 (dose
      level 1). If patients do not experience any grade &gt; 3 hematologic or non-hematologic
      toxicity, the dose will be increased to 2.5 mg twice weekly on days 1 to 21 of cycle 2 (dose
      level 2). If patients do not experience any grade &gt; 3 hematologic or non-hematologic
      toxicity, the dose will be increased to 5 mg twice weekly on days 1 to 21 of cycle 3 (dose
      level 3). If patients do not experience any grade &gt;3 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity,
      the dose will be increased to 5 mg thrice weekly on days 1 to 21 of cycle 4 (dose level 4).
      Patients who experience grade &gt;3 hematologic or non-hematologic toxicity at dose level 1 will
      be discontinued from study. Patients who experience grade &gt; 3 hematologic or non-hematologic
      toxicity at dose level 2, 3, or 4 will have the lenalidomide held and dose reduced according
      to protocol dose interruption/modification algorithms (section 5.5.3). If at least a minor
      erythroid response is not achieved at the end of 8 cycles of treatment, patients will be
      discontinued from study. If a minor or major erythroid response is achieved after completion
      of 8 cycles of treatment, patients can continue study drug on a maintenance phase until loss
      of erythroid response (return to baseline hemoglobin or transfusion requirement) or
      unacceptable toxicity.
