  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to enable the study sponsor to assess the impact of a marketed or
      validated blood test has on physicians' clinical treatment decision making when treating RA
      patients who have been taking methotrexate.

      Ultimately, the blood test will allow treating physicians to modify current methotrexate
      therapy in partially responding Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients' therapy, on an
      individualized basis, as a means of improving clinical outcomes.

      The study requires a blood sample from RA patients who have been on methotrexate therapy for
      a minimum of 3 months and are having an inadequate response to therapy. Physicians will then
      be provided with the results of the test indicating the methotrexate polyglutamate (active
      metabolites of methotrexate) levels in the patient's red blood cells as a means to help
      determine whether a patient's exposure to methotrexate has been optimized.

      This study is currently enrolling individuals who have an established diagnosis of RA and are
      receiving methotrexate as part of their therapy. Patients are required to submit a blood
      sample. There is no cost to volunteers who participate.
