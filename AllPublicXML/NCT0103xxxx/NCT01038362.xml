  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vascular endothelium (inner lining of cells in blood vessels) normally prevents vasospasm
      and thrombosis by production of a variety of regulatory substances, including nitric oxide.
      In patients with atherosclerosis, these functions of the endothelium are impaired and these
      abnormalities may contribute to the development of heart attack and stroke.

      Observational studies have shown that frequent nut consumption decreases the risk of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the mechanisms of benefit have not been fully defined.
      Recent studies suggest that specific fatty acids and flavonoids in nuts may have favorable
      effects on cardiovascular disease. In addition, there is growing evidence that these
      compounds may improve the function of the endothelium.

      The present study is designed to test the hypothesis that an almond-enriched diet will
      improve the function of the endothelium in patients with coronary artery disease. Subjects
      will be enrolled into a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study that will compare a
      National Cholesterol Education Program Step 1 diet without nuts to a Step 1 diet that has the
      same number of total calories but includes 3 ounces of almonds daily. Participants will
      consume each diet for six weeks with a four-week rest period between diets. The order of
      diets will be randomized (almonds or no almonds). Dietary assessments via food recall
      questionnaires will be employed at the study entry, end of the four week washout period, and
      end of the second intervention. If subjects are drifting from the recommendations of the STEP
      1 diet, counseling will be given to urge compliance. The primary endpoint will be
      endothelium-dependent flow- mediated dilation assessed by ultrasound. Secondary study
      outcomes will include lipid profiles, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.
      Enrollment will continue until 40 subjects with complete data are available.

      Patients will be enrolled at Boston Medical Center and the Jean Mayer US Department of
      Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center at Tufts Medical Center. Dietary interventions
      will be performed at Tufts Medical Center or by telephone. Ultrasound studies and blood
      collection will be performed in the principal investigator's research unit at Boston Medical
      Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and Female subjects.

          2. Age range: 21-80 years old.

          3. Weight less than 115 kg.

          4. Clinically defined coronary artery disease that is clinical stable and compensated
             with appropriate treatment. Coronary disease (CVD) is defined by the presence of
             lesions on coronary angiography, history of myocardial infarction, or positive stress
             test.

          5. Willingness to give written informed consent and willingness and ability to
             understand, to participate to and to comply with the study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of nut allergy.

          2. Pregnant or lactating women. Pregnancy will be excluded by urine pregnancy test.

          3. Clinical history of other major illness including end-stage cancer, renal failure,
             hepatic failure, gastrointestinal disorders that may impair absorption, or other
             conditions that in the opinion of the principal investigator make a clinical study
             inappropriate.

          4. Treatment with an investigational new drug within the last 30 days.

          5. History of a psychological illness or condition such as to interfere with the
             subject's ability to understand the requirements of the study.

          6. Unwillingness to comply with the requirements of study including refraining from
             consumption of nuts and refraining from use of Vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta
             carotene, lipoic acid, and/or other dietary or herbal supplements during the study.
