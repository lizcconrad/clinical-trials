    <textblock>
      This study is examining a chemotherapy regimen and immune suppressive medications in the
      setting of an allogeneic stem cell transplant. A pilot clinical trial to characterize the
      incidence, prevalence and function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and immune
      checkpoint regulators (V-domain Ig Suppressor of T-cell Activation [VISTA], cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte- associated protein 4 [CTLA-4], programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) during early
      immune recovery following an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The site will use a
      myeloablative regimen of fludarabine with busulfan, adopted from CALGB 100801, to define
      clinical endpoints, including engraftment, 100 day survival and one year survival (Objective
      #1). The site will characterize the incidence, prevalence and function of MDSCs and immune
      checkpoint regulators in patients' blood and bone marrow following transplantation (Objective
      #2). The site will correlate these laboratory results with clinical outcomes and the
      incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). As an exploratory aim, in those patients
      experiencing GVHD and requiring treatment, the site will define the MDSCs frequency and
      checkpoint regulator expression and correlate these results with the patient's response to
      GVHD therapy.
