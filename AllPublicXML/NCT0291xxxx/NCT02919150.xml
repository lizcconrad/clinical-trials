      The aims of this study are:

        -  To examine the inter-rater reliability to assess myofascial trigger points using a
           myotonometer

        -  To determinate the strength of the correlation between myotonometric parameters and
           isokinetic parameters

        -  To evaluate the sensitivity of myotonometric measurements to detect the location of
           myofascial trigger points

      Previous researches have used complicated and expensive methods to measure mechanical
      properties of muscle tone like isokinetic dynamometer.

      The purpose of this investigation is to establish the reliability, validity and sensitivity
      of a myotonometer to assess myofascial trigger points. The results of this study will verify
      the inter-reliability of a myotonometer device in order to evaluate muscle tone, examine
      correlations and associations between myotonometric measurements and isokinetic measurements
      and provide a measurable understanding of the location of myofascial trigger points.

      Assessment:

      Myoton device is a simple and portable tool to obtain quantitative and objective assessments
      of mechanical properties of muscle tone.

      Isokinetic dynamometric technique is considered a valid biomechanics method to measure muscle
      tone in non-injured subjects but isokinetic machine is a heavy and expensive equipment.

      Outcome measures:

      Myotonometric measures will include muscle frequency, decrement (elasticity) and stiffness.

      Isokinetic measures will include passive resistive torque to ankle dorsiflexion and
      dorsiflexion passive range of motion (PROM)

      All outcome measures will be evaluated once.

    <description>Myotonometric assessment: into the site of the latent medial myofascial trigger point of the soleus muscle and distal to the lateral medial myofascial trigger point of the soleus muscle but into the same taut band.
Isokinetic assessment: triceps surae muscle tone will be quantified by measuring the passive range of motion for ankle dorsiflexion and the resistance to passive ankle dorsiflexion at slow and fast velocity.</description>
