    <textblock>
      Is HMGB1 (High Mobility Group Box 1) elevated in sepsis patients for weeks after recovery
      from severe sepsis/septic shock, similar to what has been observed in mice? Do patients
      recovering from severe sepsis/septic shock suffer from cognitive impairment and is such
      impairment associated with prolonged HMGB1 levels in plasma? Is there a difference from
      patients recovering from critical illness without prior sepsis?
