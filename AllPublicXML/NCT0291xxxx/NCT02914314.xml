  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of an oral suspension of
      perampanel given as an adjunctive therapy and to generate preliminary safety and efficacy
      data in pediatric participants, ranging from 1 month to less than 24 months of age, with
      epilepsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study comprised of pretreatment, treatment (core study),
      and extension phases that is designed to evaluate the PK of an oral suspension of perampanel
      (target dose of 12 milligrams per day [mg /day] for non-enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug
      [non-EIAED] or 16 mg/day for EIAED) when given as an adjunctive therapy in participants
      ranging from 1 month to less than 24 months (&lt;2 years) of age with epilepsy. The Pretreatment
      Phase will last up to 2 weeks, during which participants will be assessed for their
      eligibility to participate in the study. The Treatment Phase will consist of 3 periods:
      Titration (12 to 16 weeks), Maintenance (4 weeks), and Follow-Up (4 weeks; only for those
      participants who complete the Maintenance Period but do not continue into the Extension Phase
      and those participants who discontinue study participation). The Extension Phase will consist
      of 2 periods: Maintenance (32 to 36 weeks) and Follow-Up (4 weeks).

      The maximum total duration of treatment for each participant will be 52 weeks, and the
      maximum total duration of the study for each participant will be 58 weeks (52 weeks of
      treatment + 2 weeks of pretreatment + 4 weeks of follow-up).
