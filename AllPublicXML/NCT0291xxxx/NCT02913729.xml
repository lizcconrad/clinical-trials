  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of the local recurrences (LR) found after breast-conserving therapy are within or close
      to the tumor bed. This pattern of recurrence was confirmed by studies of breast conserving
      surgery without adjuvant irradiation and by the update of the NSABP B-06 trial. In the EORTC
      boost trial, however, 29% of all LR were found outside the area of the original tumor. Still,
      a recent review of Breast Conserving Therapy (BCT) trials showed that the site of local
      recurrences after BCT was mostly in the tumor bed, with less than 10% of LR elsewhere in the
      breast. This led to the concept of partial breast irradiation. With accelerated partial
      breast irradiation (APBI), a limited volume of breast tissue is irradiated, allowing for a
      higher dose per fraction compared to whole breast irradiation (WBI), which is favorable
      considering the low alpha/beta ratio, and thus higher sensitivity to high dose per fraction.

    <description>cosmetic effect will be measured by comparing the treated breast with the contralateral breast. Cosmetic effect will be scored in three different ways: by digital photographs, patient's questionnaires and specialist's questionnaires. These data will result in an overall cosmetic outcome, scored as excellent, good, fair or poor.</description>
