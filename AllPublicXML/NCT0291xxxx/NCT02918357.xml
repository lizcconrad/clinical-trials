  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are imaging patients with prostate cancer using a new PET imaging agent
      (Ga-68-PSMA-11) in order to evaluate it's ability to detection prostate cancer in patients
      with biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy and radiation therapy.

    <textblock>
      Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.
      Patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer will be imaged using Gallium-68 labeled
      PSMA-11 in order to demonstrate its utility. The investigators plan to utilize this data to
      obtain further approvals of the Ga-68-PSMA-11 compound, so that this agent will become
      available for clinical imaging in prostate cancer patients. In the biochemical recurrence
      population, the primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and positive predictive
      value (PPV) on a per-patient and per-region-basis of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET for detection of tumor
      location confirmed by histopathology/biopsy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathological proven prostate adenocarcinoma.

          -  Rising PSA after definitive therapy with prostatectomy or radiation therapy (external
             beam or brachytherapy).

               -  Post radical prostatectomy (RP) - AUA recommendation

                    -  PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured more than 6 weeks after RP and,

                    -  Confirmatory persistent PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL

               -  Post-radiation therapy -ASTRO-Phoenix consensus definition

                    -  Nadir + greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL rise in PSA

          -  Karnofsky performance status of greater than 50 (or ECOG/WHO equivalent).

          -  Age &gt; 18.

          -  Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign
             it.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigational therapy for prostate cancer.

          -  Unable to lie flat, still or tolerate a PET scan.

          -  Prior history of any other malignancy within the last 2 years, other than skin basal
             cell or cutaneous superficial squamous cell carcinoma that has not metastasized and
             superficial bladder cancer.

          -  Contraindication to furosemide administration including prior allergy or adverse
             reaction to furosemide or sulfa drugs. (Note: This exclusion criteria can be removed
             if Furosemide is omitted as part of the PET imaging protocol if a second-generation
             scatter correction is available for the used PET device).
