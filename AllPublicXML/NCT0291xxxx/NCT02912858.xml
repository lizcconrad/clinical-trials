  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic venous leg ulcers (VLU) are painful, debilitating wounds that place a significant
      burden on the patient, their family, and healthcare resources. Treating VLU can present a
      significant challenge to clinicians, who currently have a limited range of treatments at
      their disposal. The mainstay of treatment is compression bandaging, ambulation and elevation
      at rest. In addition to the aforementioned, intermittent pneumatic compression has also been
      utilised1. When applied to the leg or foot intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices
      intermittently inflate and deflate to increase venous return. These devices can be
      uncomfortable to wear, and compliance can be inhibited because of size, weight and external
      power source that limit the patient's mobility. In patients who cannot walk, or in those who
      are unable to tolerate compression bandaging, ulcers may deteriorate and never heal.
      Accordingly, there is a need for novel, alternative devices or strategies that can be used to
      complement or replace compression bandage therapy.

      This is a single-centre randomised intra-patient comparison of gekoTM plus R-2 R-2 and IPC.

      Blood flow will be measured after each device has been activated for 10 minutes with a 10
      minute rest between devices to allow blood flow to return to baseline. The order the devices
      will be fitted is determined randomly. Activation of the device for 10 minutes before
      measurement is deemed appropriate as previous studies have demonstrated significant increases
      in blood flow following as little as five minutes use of the devices.

      In this short study the standard of care (typically compression bandaging), will be suspended
      temporarily to allow the fitting of the gekoTM plus R-2 and IPC devices in order to measure
      blood flow. This is not seen as a risk to the patient as the device is only in operation for
      30 minutes plus 10 minutes rest within the care pathway.
