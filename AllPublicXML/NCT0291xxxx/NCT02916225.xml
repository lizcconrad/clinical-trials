  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether high intensity interval training (HIIT) is
      superior to moderate continuous training in increasing cardiopulmonary capacity in heart
      failure with preserved ejection fraction patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been proved to increase oxygen consumption,
      having superior cardiovascular effect when compared to moderate continuous training (MCT) in
      post-infarction patients (Wisloff et al.) Aerobic training also had shown positive effect on
      oxygen consumption and diastolic function in subjects with HFPEF when compared to usual care
      (Edelmann et al).

      However, the comparison of HIIT and MCT on improving functional capacity and diastolic
      function in HFPEF patients has not yet been study.

    <description>The HIIT group will warm up for 10 minutes at 60% to 70% of peak heart rate(50% to 60% of V̇O2peak) before walking four 4-minute intervals at 85% to 95% of peak heart rate. Each interval will be separated by 3-minute active pauses, walking at 60% to 70% of peak heart rate. The training session will be terminated by a 3-minute cool-down at 60% to 70% of peak heart rate. Total exercise time will be 38 minutes for the HIIT group. Patients will perform 3 training sessions per week for 12 consecutive weeks.</description>
