  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with
      Alzheimer's Disease and clinical outcomes?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autologous Adipose-derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (AD-SVF) will be infused intra-venous
      and Intra nasal. The therapy is composed of cells derived from a patients' own adipose tissue
      that are isolated within approximately 1 hour and immediately delivered back to the patient.
