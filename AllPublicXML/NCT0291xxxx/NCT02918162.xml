  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, multi-site, open-label trial of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in
      subjects with gastric or gastroesophageal (GE) junction adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this
      study is to determine and evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with immune checkpoint
      blockade and chemotherapy used in the perioperative period in eradicating micrometastatic
      disease; and to compare paired tissue and serum samples (pre-treatment and post-treatment)
      from individually treated patients to explore the immune effects of combination therapy and
      predictors of response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Surgical resection is the primary
      treatment for gastric cancer but most patients present with locally advanced disease and
      recurrence is common after surgery. Many patients (35%) will have early recurrence within 6-9
      months of surgery indicating the need for more aggressive upfront therapy in these subjects.
      In addition, the majority of patients will ultimately have recurrence and 5 year survival
      rates are 35-40% despite aggressive therapy.

      The ability to combine immunotherapy with pembrolizumab gives the potential to increase
      therapeutic options while continuing standard of care chemotherapy. The particular use of
      maintenance therapy may delay or eliminate the growth of residual micrometastatic disease and
      lead to durable disease control. Additionally, this study provides the foundation for
      substantial correlative work to define tumor and patient characteristics that may predict for
      response to pembrolizumab in gastric cancer.

             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         12. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         13. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

             allowing exception to this criterion for a specific subject.

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
