  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MRI-HIFU) has been proven to be a safe and
      effective method in treating uterine fibroids and also adenomyosis. However, systematic
      studies on the effect of this treatment on factors affecting fertility are still lacking.
      Also quite little is known about body's systemic response to MRI-HIFU. Thus the aim of this
      study is to obtain more information on the systemic response of the body to the
      HIFU-treatment when treating non-malignant disease as well as to study the effect of MRI-HIFU
      on factors affecting fertility. Women with symptomatic uterine fibroids or adenomyosis and
      with no wish for further pregnancies will be selected for this study and treated using
      MRI-HIFU. The severity of symptoms will be assessed with UFS-QoL and the same questionnaire
      will also be used in follow-up 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Blood, urine and
      endometrium samples will be collected pre- and postoperatively and during follow-up 3, 6 and
      12 months after the treatment. From these samples detailed analysis of the immunological,
      inflammatory and hormonal response will be performed. As this is the first study in Finland
      of treating uterine fibroids and adenomyosis using MRI-HIFU, also a report about the efficacy
      of the MRI-HIFU in treating the uterine disorders will be published, and a key tool in
      assessing the treatment outcome would be the UFS-QoL questionnaire.
