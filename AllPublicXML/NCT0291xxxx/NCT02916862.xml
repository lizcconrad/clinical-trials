  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this proposal is to determine the effects of soluble corn fiber (SCF)
      supplementation for 1 year on bone metabolism in growing adolescents compared to controls.
      For the proposed study, a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled clinical trial will be
      conducted in 168 healthy adolescents aged 11-14 years, equally randomly assigned to one of
      three intervention groups: SCF (12 g/d, administered twice a day), SCF + calcium (12 g/d of
      SCF + 600 mg/d of elemental calcium carbonate, twice a day), or placebo (0 g/d of SCF or
      calcium, administered twice a day). Bone metabolism and bone related biomarkers will be
      assessed at baseline and at 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The adolescent period is crucial for optimizing future bone health because bone accumulates
      rapidly during these years and accounts for up to half of adult peak bone mass. Calcium
      intake during this period is critical for adequate bone mineralization but this is the
      nutrient most deficient in the diets of adolescents. A strategy to maximize bone
      mineralization during this critical period is to increase the absorption of the calcium being
      consumed. This could be achieved by supplementing diets with certain non-digestible
      carbohydrates, such as soluble corn fiber (SCF).

      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of SCF supplementation for 1 year
      on bone metabolism in growing adolescents compared to controls. A randomized double-blinded
      placebo controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 168 healthy adolescents aged 11-14
      years, equally randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups: SCF (12 g/d,
      administered twice a day), SCF + calcium (12 g/d of SCF + 600 mg/d of elemental calcium
      carbonate, twice a day), or placebo (0 g/d of SCF or calcium, administered twice a day). The
      treatment and the placebo will be provided in the form of flavored drinks twice per day (this
      was previously used in a short-term study among adolescents with excellent acceptance). Both
      adolescents and parents will be blinded to the assigned intervention. Participants are
      required to come to the Puerto Rico Clinical and Translational Research Consortium for 2
      study visits (at baseline and after 12 months consuming the supplement). In these visits,
      participants will undergo a bone scan, provide a blood sample and a 24-h urine sample to
      measure bone related biomarkers, complete several general health, diet and activity
      questionnaires and undergo anthropometric measurements. In addition, the team will visit the
      participant in their homes at 3, 6 and 9 months to refill the treatment and assess compliance
      to the treatment.

      The primary outcome is change in bone mineral content (BMC) measured using Dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA)

      The secondary outcomes include biochemical markers reflecting vitamin D status and calcium
      homeostasis, such as serum calcium, phosphate, bone biomarkers, vitamin D (measured as serum
      levels of 25(OH)D), urinary calcium, phosphate, creatinine and N-telopeptide cross-links.
