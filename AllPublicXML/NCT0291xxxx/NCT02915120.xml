    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with chronic painful knee
      osteoarthritis experience meaningful and long-term improvement in pain, function, and
      analgesic use after ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency of the genicular nerves following
      a double diagnostic genicular nerve blocks.

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the knee (kOA) is one of the main causes of disability. Population-based
      studies revealed that symptomatic kOA is present in 20-30% of the elderly population aged &gt;65
      years, and its prevalence is increasing due in part to the aging of the population. The goals
      of management of patients with kOA are to control pain and to minimize disability.
      Evidence-based guidelines from National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
      and Osteoarthritis Research International (OARSI) suggest that the treatment should be
      multidisciplinary. Optimal management requires a combination of non-pharmacological (changes
      in lifestyle, pacing of activities, weight reduction, regular aerobic, acupuncture, muscle
      strengthening and range of motion exercises) and pharmacological modalities (paracetamol)
      when additional treatment is required. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) should be considered for
      patients with significant symptoms, and/or functional limitations associated with a reduced
      health-related quality of life, despite conservative therapy. However, there are some fragile
      patients who are at high risk during surgery and other patients who are not willing to
      undergo surgery. Because the number of patients will increase as the population ages,
      alternative approaches to alleviate their joint pain other than conventional treatments are
      necessary. Ultrasound-guided pulsed radiofrequency of the genicular has recently become a
      promising treatment option in the management of osteoarthritis related knee pain.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, parallel design. 142
      out-patients with kOA will be recruited from Mallorca, Spain. Participants will be randomly
      allocated into two groups: Ultrasound-Guided Sham Genicular Nerve Pulsed Radiofrequency
      without active treatment (Sham GENPRF) and Ultrasound-Guided Real Genicular Nerve Pulsed
      Radiofrequency (Real GENPRF). All patients will be examined before and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months
      after the treatment (sham or active).

    <description>The VAS is a continuous scale made up of a 100-mm, unmarked, horizontal line, upon which the subject makes a hash mark depending on the amount of pain felt; a mark on the far left of the line indicates &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0), and a mark to the far right qualifies as &quot;pain as bad as it could be&quot; or &quot;unbearable pain&quot; (score of 100).</description>

    <description>This consists of two subscales (of nine questions for each scale): an anxiety scale (1-9) and a depression scale (10-18). The first questions for each scale (1-4 and 10-13) are preconditioned questions to determine whether the patient should attempt to answer the rest of the questions of the two subscales. Effectively, at least two questions must be answered affirmatively in the first scale (1-4) for the patient to continue; in the second scale, one answer is sufficient for questions 10-13 for the patient to continue with the rest of the questions. This study will use the Spanish version validated by Montón et al.</description>

    <time_frame>at 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC scale is used to evaluate the condition of patients with OA of the knee and the hip and includes pain, stiffness, and physical functioning of the joints. This scale measures five items for pain (with a score range of 0-20), two for stiffness (score range of 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range of 0-68). The physical functioning questions cover everyday activities. These scales will be used separately and will not be summed. Patients will respond orally to the five levels with the following criteria: &quot;none&quot; = 0, &quot;a bit&quot; = 1, &quot;quite a bit&quot; = 2, &quot;a lot&quot; = 3, and &quot;very much&quot; = 4. If two or more questions are left unanswered, the scale will be declared invalid. If the patient does not respond to one question, a mean will be taken from the results of the other questions. The range will be 0-98.</description>

    <description>Before needle insertion, the patient's inferomedial (IM), superomedial (SM), and superolateral (SL) GN branches will be identified under ultrasound guidance. RF needles and probes will be advanced to each of the target nerves under ultrasound guidance. A 50 Hz-frequency sensorial stimulation will be applied with a threshold of &lt; 0.5 mA to identify the nerve position, the current intensity (mA) will be reduced at &lt; 0,2 mA. During the sensorial stimulation, the patients will be asked if they feel tingling, pain, or discomfort inside the knee. The RF probe will be maintained in place until one of those feelings is elicited. In order to avoid inactivating motor nerves, the nerve will be tested for the absence of fasciculation in the the lower extremity on stimulation of 0,5 mA at 2 Hz.</description>

    <description>Pulsed Radiofrequency uses radiofrequency current in short (20 ms), high-voltage bursts; the &quot;silent&quot; phase (480 ms) allows time for heat elimination, generally keeping the target tissue below 42° C.
