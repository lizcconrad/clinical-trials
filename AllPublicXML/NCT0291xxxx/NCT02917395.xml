      Population study- patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that are treated with
      disopyramide.

      Tow echo examination, few hours apart, that includes strain rate will be done to each
      patient. The first, after taking the regular medical treatment excluding disopyramide and the
      last one after taking the disopyramide.
