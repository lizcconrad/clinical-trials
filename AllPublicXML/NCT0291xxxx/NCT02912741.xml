    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the addition of new technology of resin modified
      glass-ionomer in comparison to resin infiltration in treating post-orthodontic white spot
      lesions; both applies into the same patient's mouth; to reveal which material will have more
      clinical satisfactory performance inside the oral cavity and to overcome the high expensive
      cost in treating such clinical cases
