        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Completion of Study GEN-003-002

          2. Receipt of at least 1 dose of GEN-003 (any dose combination) in Study GEN-003-002.

          3. Collection of at least 45 of 56 anogenital swabs during the Month 11 to 12 swab
             collection period in Study GEN-003-002.

          4. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          5. Willing to perform and comply with all study procedures, including attending clinic
             visits as scheduled.

          6. For each swab collection period, willing to not use HSV-2 antiviral therapy from 14
             days before the swab collection period through the end of the period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any important protocol deviation in Study GEN-003-002.

          2. Use of HSV-2 antiviral therapy within 14 days before the beginning of Swab Collection
             Period 1.

          3. Use of topical steroids or antiviral medication in the anogenital region within 14
             days before the beginning of Swab Collection Period 1.

          4. Use of tenofovir, lysine, or other medication or supplement known or purported to
             affect HSV outbreak frequency or intensity within 14 days before the beginning of Swab
             Collection Period 1.

          5. Immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressive doses of
             corticosteroids (more than 20 mg of prednisone given daily or on alternative days for
             2 weeks or more within 6 months before the Visit 1, any dose of corticosteroids within
             30 days before Visit 1, or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids [&gt;960 Âµg/day of
             beclomethasone diproprionate or equivalent]) or other immunosuppressive agents.

          6. Presence or history of autoimmune disease, regardless of current treatment.

          7. Receipt of a vaccine containing HSV-2 antigens other than GEN-003.

          8. Pregnant women.

          9. History of drug or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             interfere with the patient's ability to comply with the requirements of the study.

         10. Onset of an AESI since Month 12 in study GEN-003-002.

         11. Other active, uncontrolled comorbidities that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with the study
             requirements.
