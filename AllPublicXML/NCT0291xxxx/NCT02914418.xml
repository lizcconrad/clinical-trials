  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using
      intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) paradigm affects sensorimotor dysfunction such as
      pain, spasticity, motor weakness and sensory loss. TMS is technique which allows non-invasive
      stimulation of the cortex, and can modulate activity of neurons. The purpose of this study
      will be to assess the feasibility of using TMS with iTBS paradigm to treat sensorimotor
      dysfunction in people with incomplete spinal cord injury affecting the upper limbs.

    <description>iTBS will be delivered using the 50Hz, 600 pulses protocol for 10 sessions over a period of two weeks. The hand representation of the primary motor cortex will targeted using a circular coil held over the vertex of skull. Intensity will be set to 80% of Resting Motor Threshold (RMT), which will be determined visually by the lowest percentage of stimulator output which can cause upper limb motor twitch in at least 5 out of 10 attempts.</description>

    <description>Sham iTBS will be delivered using the 50Hz, 600 pulses protocol for 10 sessions over a period of two weeks. Intensity will be set at 80% RMT. Circular coil will be held over vertex of skull but angled away to ensure no neural stimulation.</description>
