  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open label, single arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone in Japanese patients with relapsed
      and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The patient population will consist of adult men and
      women who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM, who have received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy,
      and who meet other outlined eligibility criteria. Patients will receive study drug (ixazomib
      4.0 mg) on Days 1, 8, and 15 plus lenalidomide (25 mg) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone
      (40 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Patients may continue to receive
      treatment until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity, whichever comes first.
      Dose modifications may be made based on toxicities. Patients with a low creatinine clearance
      &lt; 60 mL/min will receive a reduced lenalidomide dose of 10 mg once daily on Days 1 through 21
      of a 28-day cycle. The lenalidomide dose may be escalated to 15 mg once daily after 2 cycles
      if the patient is not responding to treatment and is tolerating the treatment. If renal
      function normalizes (ie, creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min) and the patient continues to
      tolerate this treatment, lenalidomide may then be escalated to 25 mg once daily.

      Treatment periods will be defined as 28-day cycles. Patients will be seen at regular
      treatment cycle intervals while they are participating in the study: four times a treatment
      cycle for the first 2 cycles, twice a treatment cycle for the 3rd cycle, and then once a
      treatment cycle for the remainder of their participation in the active treatment and, if
      applicable, the PFS and OS follow-up phases of the study.

      Response will be assessed by investigator according to the International Myeloma Working
      Group criteria for all patients every 4 weeks until PD. Central laboratory data will be used
      for serum M-protein, urine M-protein and serum free light chain. All patients will be
      followed for survival after progression. Patients will be contacted every 12 weeks until
      death or termination of the study by the sponsor.

      The study will be closed at 24 months from the enrollment of the last patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female Japanese participants 20 years of age or older.

          2. Multiple myeloma diagnosed according to standard criteria either currently or at the
             time of initial diagnosis.

             The initial diagnosis must be symptomatic MM, although the relapsed disease does not
             need to be symptomatic.

          3. Participants must have measurable disease defined by at least 1 of the following 3
             measurements based on central laboratory data:

               -  Serum M-protein: &gt;=1 g/dL (&gt;= 10 g/L).

               -  Urine M-protein: &gt;=200 mg/24 hours.

               -  Serum free light chain assay: involved free light chain level &gt;=10 mg/dL (&gt;= 100
                  mg/L), provided that the serum free light chain ratio is abnormal.

          4. Participants with RRMM who have received 1 to 3 prior therapies.

             This participant population includes the following 3 categories of participants:

                  previous therapy.

               -  Participants who were refractory to all lines of previous therapy(s) (ie,
                  participants who have never responded to any therapies received).

               -  Participants who were relapsed from at least 1 line of therapy AND additionally
                  were refractory to at least 1 line of therapy. For the purposes of this study,
                  refractory MM is defined as PD on therapy or PD within 60 days after the last
                  dose of a given therapy.

             A line of therapy is defined as 1 or more cycles of a planned treatment program. This

             therapy, as well as a sequence of treatments administered in a planned manner. For
             example, a planned treatment approach of induction therapy followed by autologous stem
             cell transplantation, followed by maintenance is considered 1 line of therapy.
             Autologous and allogenic transplants are permitted.

          5. Participants must meet the following clinical laboratory criteria:
