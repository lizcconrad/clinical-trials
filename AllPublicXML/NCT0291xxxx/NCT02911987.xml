  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common disorder, occurring worldwide in both males and females in all age
      groups. The prevalence is higher in females and the incidence peaks between 30 and 65 years.
      It is currently the most frequent musculoskeletal cause of functional disability and it has a
      major socio-economic impact on today's society. Although a small percentage of persons with
      low back pain can be diagnosed with a specific underlying cause, almost 90% of persons with
      low back pain present with symptoms of nonspecific origin. A part of these symptoms are only
      of short duration, but 23% of all people will develop nonspecific chronic low back pain
      (NSCLBP).

      Exercise therapy (ET) is currently an important component in the treatment of NSCLBP.
      Previous studies analysed the effects of various modes of exercise therapy, such as motor
      control therapy, core stability training and aerobic conditioning training. However, therapy
      outcomes can be low, and guidelines in favour of using a specific program are contradictory.
      It thus still remains unclear which therapy modality is best suited. Furthermore, no
      recommendations are available about optimal training intensities during rehabilitation of
      persons with NSCLBP.

      Since as well aerobic as muscular deconditioning are apparent in persons with chronic low
      back pain and improvements in overall physical fitness can affect therapy outcomes in this
      population, ET specifically focussing on physical fitness can be advocated for NSCLBP
      rehabilitation. High Intensity Training (HIT), has been promoted as an effective and
      efficient training method for improving physical fitness and health related parameters in
      healthy persons. Also, HIT resulted in successful reconditioning and improvement of
      functional and disease related outcomes in persons with other chronic diseases such as
      multiple sclerosis, heart failure, COPD and cardiometabolic diseases. Although some studies
      showed promising results for the effect of HIT on low back pain such as high intensity
      isolated, evidence is still scarce and study results are unclear because of methodological
      shortcomings.

      The aim of this randomized clinical trial study is to evaluate the effects of a HIT program
      on disease related outcomes, physical fitness and muscle contractile characteristics compared
      to a conventional rehabilitation program in persons with NSCLBP.

    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a nominal scale on which the participant indicates the amount of pain he/she perceives at that current moment. It consists of a line indicating eleven successive scores (0-10), whereby score 0 means 'no pain' and score 10 means 'worst pain imaginable'. An improvement of 2 levels or more is accepted as clinically relevant.</description>

    <measure>Muscle Biopsy</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>muscle biopsies of the paravertebral muscles of the spine are obtained through a micro biopsy procedure (Biopsy gun, Bard Medical). This is done by a trained physician with extensive experience in taking muscle biopsies. The obtained muscle samples are divided into cryovials, per subject and per measurement (for the determination of muscle fiber CSA, muscle fiber characterization, distribution, angiogenesis, muscle fiber characteristics, etc.).
Safety Issue: Yes, taking a piece of muscle tissue, can be slightly painful, but there are no serious risks involved. There will be no permanent damage to the muscle. The risk of infection in the wound can never be excluded. However, the site of the biopsy is thoroughly decontaminated and sealed in order to achieve a good wound healing and prevent an infection. A local bleeding may occur in the muscle causing a bruise.</description>
