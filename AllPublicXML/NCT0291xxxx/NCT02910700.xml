  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if nivolumab and trametinib (with or
      without dabrafenib) can help to control metastatic melanoma in patients who have a BRAF,
      NRAS, or BRAF-wild-type mutation.

      This is an investigational study. Nivolumab, trametinib, and dabrafenib are each FDA approved
      and commercially available for the treatment of melanoma. However, it is considered
      investigational to use these drugs in combination with each other to treat melanoma. The
      study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2
      study groups based on the type of mutation you have.

        -  If you are in Group A, you will receive nivolumab, dabrafenib, and trametinib
           (BRAF-mutated patients).

        -  If you are in Group B, you will receive nivolumab and trametinib (BRAF-wild-type or
           NRAS-mutation patients).

      You and the study staff will know which group you have been assigned.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 4 weeks.

      All participants will receive nivolumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Days 1 and 15 of
      each cycle.

      If you are in Group A, you will take dabrafenib capsules 2 times each day and trametinib
      tablets 1 time every day. Dabrafenib and trametinib should be taken at the same time in the
      morning, and the second dose of dabrafenib should be taken about 12 hours after the first
      dose. You should take the dabrafenib and trametinib with a cup of water (about 8 ounces)
      every time, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.

      If you are in Group B, you will take trametinib tablets by mouth every day while you are on
      study. Each dose should be taken 1 time every day in the morning at about the same time with
      a cup of water (about 8 ounces), either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.

      If you vomit after your dose of study drugs, do not retake the dose. Wait until your next
      scheduled dose. If you are in Group A and you miss a dose of dabrafenib, you may take the
      dose as soon as you remember, as long as your next dose is more than 6 hours later. If you
      miss a dose of trametinib, you may take the dose as soon as you remember as long as the next
      dose is scheduled for at least 12 hours later.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for 3 years You will no longer be able to take the
      study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, if you are unable
      to follow study directions, or if the study doctor thinks it is in your interest.

      Your participation in this study will be over after about 3 years of follow-up (described
      below).

      Study Visits:

      During Week 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your autoimmune
           status.

      During Weeks 2 and 4 of Cycles 1-3 and Week 3 of Cycle 3, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be
      drawn for routine tests.

      During Week 3 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine, PD, and PBMC testing.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  You will have an eye exam.

        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      During Week 3 of Cycle 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      During Week 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a skin exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. During Cycle 3, this blood
           sample will also be used for PD and PBMC testing.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      During Week 3 of Cycle 3 and beyond, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      At Months 3, 6, 12, and if you stop taking the stuy drugs before Month 12, you will have an
      eye exam. Additional eye exams will be performed if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Every 12 weeks:

        -  You will have an MRI and/or CT scan.

        -  You will have an ECHO.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine, PD, and PBMC testing.

        -  You will have an MRI and/or CT scan.

        -  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an eye exam.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After you stop taking the study drugs, the study doctor or study staff will continue to check
      on your health every 3 months for up to 3 years. This information may be collected at your
      routine, standard of care clinic visits; it may be collected from your medical records; or
      you may be called by the study staff and asked. If you are called, it should take about 10
      minutes.

      Your participation will be over after you have completed long-term follow-up.

             imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for 4 weeks after treatment is complete and
             within 28 days of the first dose of nivolumab administration; or (b) if they are
             untreated but asymptomatic or c) if they are untreated and symptomatic but symptoms
             are controlled on stable or decreasing doses of steroids for 14 days prior to drug
             administration. Patients are excluded if they require high doses of systemic
             corticosteroids (&gt; 8 mg equivalent of dexamethasone) to control CNS symptoms.

          6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined by the normal
             laboratory ranges. Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and
             should be obtained within one week prior to registration a.) WBC &gt;/= 2000/µL b.)

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo
             five half-lives) after the last dose of investigational drug. WOCBP are those who have
             not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to the start of nivolumab.

         10. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually
             active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 31
             weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) and
             azoospermic men do not require contraception.

         11. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients that had grade 3/4 immune-related AEs on ipilimumab that required more than
             12 weeks of immune suppression with corticosteroids.

          2. History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis.

          3. History of known glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

          4. Active leptomeningeal metastases

          5. Active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects are permitted to enroll if
             they have vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism and/or
             hypophysitis due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis
             not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence
             of an external trigger.

          6. Require systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 8 mg daily prednisone
             equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug
             administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses are
             permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          7. Known history of a positive test for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating
             acute or chronic infection

          8. Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-positive patients on combination
             antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic
             interactions with dabrafenib and trametinib. In addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          9. History of allergy or adverse drug reaction to the study drug components (nivolumab,
             dabrafenib, or trametinib) or drugs of similar chemical or biologic composition.
             Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody
             should also be excluded.

         10. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

         11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness (requiring IV antibiotic treatment) including, but
             not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         12. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with nivolumab, dabrafenib, and trametinib, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab, dabrafenib, and
             trametinib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
