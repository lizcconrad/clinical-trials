  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of CGM alone and
      CGM combined with a family behavioral intervention with a control group using home blood
      glucose monitoring (BGM) alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although prior studies have not demonstrated that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use
      results in improved glycemic control in children &lt;8 years of age, many of the barriers to CGM
      efficacy in this age group may have been due to problems in the wearability and accuracy of
      prior generation devices, as well as to the setting of glycemic targets aimed primarily at
      preventing hypoglycemia at all costs. There may also be behavioral barriers to consistent and
      effective CGM use in this age range. The goal of this study is to assess the impact of CGM
      alone and CGM combined with a family behavioral intervention focused on supporting CGM use on
      glycemic control in very young children with T1D compared with usual care without CGM.

    <description>The primary outcome will be three 2 group comparisons of the change from baseline in the percentage of sensor values in the target range (70-180 mg/dL), in an ANCOVA model adjusted for the baseline value and factors used to stratify randomization with clinical site as a random effect. Seven days of sensor glucose values during the week prior to the 6, 13, 19 and 26 week clinic visits will be used in analysis for the CGM groups to match up with the blinded CGM placed at each visit in the control group. The CGM data will be pooled across each visit where CGM data are collected during follow up for the primary analysis.</description>

A home BGM will be used for calibration of the CGM sensor. Additional BGM glucose measurements may be performed by the participant at any time, particularly prior to making a real-time management decision based on the CGM glucose reading.

             pump in the last 3 months or at least 3 multiple daily injections of basal and bolus
             (meal time) analogue insulin in the last 3 months (e.g. no change from injections to
             pump or vice versa in the last 3 months), with no plans to switch the modality of
             insulin administration during the next 6 months (e.g., injection user switching to a
             pump, pump user switching to injections).

          8. Perform at least 3 blood glucose meter checks per day from self-report at screening
             and meter download during blinded CGM run in

             lowering during the course of the study

         10. Parent or guardian comprehend written and spoken English (This requirement is due to
             the fact that the questionnaires to be used as outcome measures do not have validated
             versions in other languages, and interventions will be delivered in English only for
             the RCT to ensure standardization/fidelity checks across sites).

         12. No expectation that participant/parent will be moving out of the area of the clinical
             center during the next 12 months, unless the move will be to an area served by another
             study center.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of unblinded personal CGM, outside of a research study, as part of real-time
             diabetes management in the last 30 days

          2. Unable to use CGM device for minimum number of hours during blinded run-in period or
             skin reaction from adhesive that would preclude participation in the randomized trial

          3. The presence of a significant medical disorder or use of a medication such as
             oral/inhaled glucocorticoids that in the judgment of the investigator will affect the
             wearing of the sensors or the completion of any aspect of the protocol.

          4. More than 1 episode of SH or DKA in the past 6 months (not including DKA at time of
             dx).

          5. The presence of any of the following diseases:

               -  Asthma if treated with systemic or daily inhaled corticosteroids in the last 6
                  months (Intermittent treatment with inhaled corticosteroids does not exclude
                  subjects from enrollment)

               -  Cystic fibrosis (Adequately treated thyroid disease and celiac disease do not
                  exclude subjects from enrollment)

          6. Inpatient psychiatric treatment in the past 6 months for either child participant or
             the primary care giver

          7. Need for use of acetaminophen or acetaminophen-containing products on a regular basis
             during the 6 months of the trial

          8. Participation of parent or child in a diabetes related intervention study in past 6
             weeks.

          9. Any medical, psychological or social situation where per investigator discretion it
             may be difficult for family or child to participate fully in the intervention

         10. Another member of the same household is participating in this study.
