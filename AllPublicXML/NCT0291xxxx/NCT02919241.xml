      Clinical trial of an application of cognitive behavioural one-session therapy method with
      patients who have severe or average dental fear/anxiety measured by Modified Dental Anxiety
      Scale (MDAS). The intervention consists of two different parts: a diagnostic interview and
      one-session treatment of dental care. The method is based on One-Session Therapy manual (Öst
      &amp; Skaret, 2013). 30 minimum 18 years old adults takes part to the study. They comes from

      Purpose is to compare diagnostic interview (n=20) to diagnostic interview and one-session
      treatment of dental care (n=10). Partners come from three different places, 10 from each:
      public and private dental care and dental school. Participants from dental school take part
      to one-session treatment. All participants have normal dental care before final interview.
      Hypotheses is that dental fear/anxiety will decrease one category (5 points) when measured by
      Modified dental anxiety scale (MDAS) before the intervention and after normal dental care.
      Visual Analogue Scale is used to measure the strength of unpleasant feeling before and after
      intervention in both groups.
