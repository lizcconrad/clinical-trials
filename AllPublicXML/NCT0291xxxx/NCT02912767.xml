  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in understanding how the patient has been doing since their
      surgery for endometrial cancer and if they are experiencing any symptoms related to
      lymphedema (swelling) in the your lower body. The investigators hope that information from
      the patient and others will help them improve care for women treated for endometrial cancer.

    <description>Data from respondents will be analyzed to determine prevalence of patient reported lymphedema overall; these will then be compared to the prevalence among those who underwent SLN mapping alone, or a comprehensive pelvic lymphadenectomy (+/- para-aortic LND and +/-SLN mapping in conjunction).</description>

    <description>A questionnaire that has been validated by investigators at the Mayo Clinic. The questionnaire has 13 items to assess the rate of patient-reported lymphedema. The questionnaire will be mailed and then followed up with a second mailing after month 1 and a phone call after month 2. Within 3 months of sending the questionnaire a patient will be either considered as a responder vs non-responder. The date of surgery and the date of when the questionnaire is filled out will be captured.</description>
