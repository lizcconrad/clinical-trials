      The intrinsic asthma (atopic or not) is a particular phenotype marked by an early later
      symptoms, increased severity, sensitivity associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs), a sinonasal polyposis and eosinophilia.

      Unlike allergic asthma, this form does not today demonstrated its genetic character. However,
      the existence of familial forms of asthma in this region Pays de La Loire led us to
      hypothesize the existence of genetic variations can explain some familial forms of non-atopic
      asthma. Corresponding genes may be relevant to understanding the pathophysiological pathways
      involved in the more common sporadic forms.

      The investigators propose a study combining genetic linkage analysis and complete sequencing
      exomes to identify one or more genetic abnormalities associated with non-atopic asthma. The
      clinical stage essential for mutation identification is to identify and recruit large
      families with members affected by non-atopic asthma and ensure accurate phenotyping of all
      individuals recruited over several generations.

      The aim of this study is to create a cohort of families who have more members within them
      non-atopic asthma. A high genetic combined exome sequencing throughput analysis in a family
      linkage study will then reveal the presence or absence of genetic variations associated with
      intrinsic asthma.

      Patients with non-atopic asthma will be identified in consultation pulmonology at Laennec
      Hospital (CHU Nantes) from the consultant population to severe asthma.

      These patients will be treated as index case.

      The investigator will conduct a family tree of the index case to identify families where the
      number of healthy individuals and those with non-atopic asthma makes relevant a family
      genetic study. Before initiating the family screening, it is necessary to have notion of at
      least two individuals carrying non-atopic asthma at least two generations in the family.

      Related agreeing to participate in this study will be included.
