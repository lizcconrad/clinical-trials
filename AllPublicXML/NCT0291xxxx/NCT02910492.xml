      A single-center prospective, open-label uncontrolled exploratory study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of an investigational version of the enlighten™ 670nm laser for
      photo-rejuvenation.

      Subjects will receive up to 7 laser treatments, spaced 1 to 8 weeks apart, and will be
      followed at 2 weeks (±1 week) post-first treatment and 12 weeks (±2 weeks) post-final
      treatment. In addition, after each treatment, subjects will complete a 3 day post treatment
      phone follow-up. At the Investigator's discretion, optional follow-up visits may also be
      conducted at 6 weeks post-final treatment (±2 weeks).
