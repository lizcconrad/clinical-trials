  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia repair with mesh has a high incidence of postoperative chronic pain.
      Transversus abdominis plane block is a current intervention to support postoperative
      analgesia, however it is recently in research area how to be applied in different surgical
      areas to be more effective than intravenous opioids. Subcostal transversus abdominis plane
      block is not advised but has not been studied to be effective for postoperative analgesia in
      inguinal herniography patients.

      This study aims to research the effect of subcostal transversus abdominis plane block in
      subacute postoperative pain after inguinal hernia repair

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients were divided into two groups, one is control and the second is subcostal transversus
      abdominis plane block (STAP) group. After standard general anesthesia application, control
      group ( Group I) had 1 gram of paracetamol and 100 mg of contramal just after starting
      surgical closure. Group II (STAP) had 1 gram of paracetamol and 100 mg of contramal, after
      surgical closure transversus abdominis plane block in subcostal area was applied to the
      patient.
