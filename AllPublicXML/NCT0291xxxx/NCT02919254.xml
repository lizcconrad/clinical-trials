    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of varying nitrate doses of beetroot juice
      supplementation on dynamic, multijoint resistance exercise performance in active, trained
      individuals. Performance will be assessed based on parameters including neuromuscular
      efficiency, anaerobic performance capability, oxygen consumption, plasma nitrate/nitrite
      levels, specific muscle tissue biomarkers including lactate, and anthropometric measurements
      of select muscle groups.
