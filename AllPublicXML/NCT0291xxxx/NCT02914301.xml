  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal care is defined as preventive healthcare characterized by regular check-ups by
      doctors or midwives to treat and prevent potential health problems throughout the course of
      the pregnancy. The investigators propose that a mobile app for prenatal care has the
      potential to provide patient-tailored, risk-appropriate prenatal educational content and may
      facilitate vital sign and weight checks between visits. The investigators describe the
      methods used to develop and test the effectiveness of a mobile app for prenatal care to
      safely reduce the number of in-person visits to the obstetrician (OB) compared to standard of
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a protocol for a multi-center quasi-randomized controlled trial to compare an
      intervention group receiving a prenatal care app, to a control group receiving usual care.
      The trial is being conducted at two diverse outpatient obstetric practices that are part of a
      single academic department of obstetrics in Washington, DC. Women who are between 18 and 40,
      who are visiting their OB for a first trimester routine visit, who have a confirmed desired
      pregnancy, who are not considered &quot;high-risk,&quot; and who have an IOS, Android or Windows-based
      smart phone that they use regularly will be eligible for enrollment. The Investigators will
      measure the effect of a mobile app for prenatal care on:

        1. the number of in-person OB visits during pregnancy;

        2. patient satisfaction with prenatal care;

        3. gestational weight gain;

        4. maternal and fetal outcomes; and

        5. clinician satisfaction.

      To capture these outcomes, the investigators will administer patient surveys via telephone
      every 4 weeks during gestation and the immediate post-partum period, review the electronic
      medical record, and conduct in-depth interviews with a representative subset of patients
      after delivery.

    <measure>Total Visit Number</measure>
    <time_frame>6-9 months</time_frame>
    <description>In discussions with OBs, it became clear that, patient safety notwithstanding, the advantages and disadvantages of a reduced visit schedule versus usual care were of greatest importance and so total visit number was selected as the primary outcome. We will measure total visit number by reviewing the EHR. All other outcomes will be secondary outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6-9 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure patient satisfaction in the way information was shared during the recent prenatal care visits by asking 22 questions using a five-point Likert scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gestational Weight Gain</measure>
    <time_frame>6-9 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess gestational weight gain following enrollment until delivery. These measures will be obtained by health record review and review of data collected in the app. Data collection will be performed with a standardized data collection sheet and a 10% check for interrater reliability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]</measure>
    <time_frame>6-9 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess patient and baby safety by comparing the outcomes and adverse events in each study arm. We will define adverse events as we did in the pilot study: cesarean section, preeclampsia / eclampsia, non-optimal weight gain, NICU admissions, intra-uterine death and perinatal mortality and other serious outcomes. Site investigators, blinded to allocation group, will verify outcomes by health record review. Study coordinators will contact patients by telephone starting at seven days after their delivery to ensure no outcomes are missed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinician Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6-9 months</time_frame>
    <description>As an additional secondary outcome, we will assess clinician satisfaction regarding the helpfulness of the app via a questionnaire following delivery on a five-point Likert scale (Additional file __). For the analysis, we will classify satisfaction into satisfied/very satisfied versus other responses. We will assess clinicians' preferred care style, app-assisted or usual care following delivery using the validated control preference scale.</description>

    <description>For patients allocated to the study group, they will be assisted in downloading the BRx app to their smartphone and set up the connected weight scale and blood pressure cuff. At time of enrollment, research assistant will also collect baseline demographic and clinical data. For patients who were allocated to the intervention arm, the clinician will told that they are in intervention group and therefore will be receiving regular app-based education and clinician will be receiving regular blood pressure and weight measurements. Following that communication, it will be the physicians' judgement to reduce in-person visits from usual care.</description>

    <description>For patients cared for by clinicians allocated to the usual care arm, the clinician will discuss the management options and scheduling procedures with the parent in that clinician's usual fashion. The patient will not be given access to the BRx app but will consent to the study data collection and survey administration. All potential study subjects will receive standard medical care per DoD/VA Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of the uncomplicated pregnancy (REF) and local preference by board-certified OB/GYN physicians.</description>
