      The purpose of this data registry is to prospectively collect data from patients referred to
      an interdisciplinary clinic for pelvic pain and endometriosis to investigate long-term
      patient outcomes, prognosis, predictors, causes, and treatment of pelvic pain and
      endometriosis.

      The BC Women's Centre for Pelvic Pain and Endometriosis is the tertiary referral centre for
      endometriosis/pelvic pain in British Columbia, Canada. The Centre offers a unique
      interdisciplinary approach including minimally invasive surgery, hormonal and other medical
      therapy, pain education, physiotherapy, and CBT/mindfulness.

      After informed consent, patients prospectively consent to data collection in the online
      registry. The registry consists of patient intake questionnaires (including validated
      measures), physical and ultrasound examination, review of medical records, surgical findings,
      and annual outcomes to 5 years.

      The online data registry is housed in the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform
      located at BC Children's Hospital.
