      This is a two-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-treatment, 3-period
      cross-over study using a standardised solid meal test in subjects with type 2 diabetes to
      investigate postprandial glucose control of BioChaperone® Combo compared with Humalog® Mix25
      and with simultaneous subcutaneous injections of Humalog® and Lantus® during three separate
      dosing visits.

      This is a two-centre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 3-treatment, 3-period
      cross-over study using a standardised solid meal test in subjects with type 2 diabetes to
      investigate postprandial glucose control of BioChaperone® Combo compared with Humalog® Mix25
      and with simultaneous subcutaneous injections of Humalog® and Lantus® during three separate
      dosing visits.

      Furthermore, this study aims to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of the three
      different study treatments.

      During each dosing visit, subjects will be given 3 doses of IMP on three consecutive days
      (Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3). Dosing on Day 2 and Day 3 will be followed by a standardised solid
      meal test.

          -  HbA1c level between 7.5% and 9.5% (both inclusive)

          -  Body mass index between 20.0 and 40.0 kg/m2 (both inclusive)

          -  Treated with once daily injections with insulin glargine U-100 for ≥ 3 months prior to
             screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the IMPs or related products

          -  Previous participation in this trial. Participation is defined as randomised.

          -  Receipt of any medicinal product in clinical development within 60 days prior to this
             trial.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis or coagulation
             screening tests, as judged by the Investigator considering the underlying disease

          -  Supine blood pressure at screening outside the range of 90-160 mmHg for systolic or
             50-95 mmHg for diastolic and/or resting supine heart rate outside the range 50-90
             beats per minute. This exclusion criterion also pertains to subjects being on
             antihypertensives.

          -  Current treatment with premixed or intermediate insulin products, or with long acting
             insulins other than insulin glargine U-100. The use of short or rapid acting prandial
             insulin products will be allowed provided their use has been stable for ≥ 3 months
             prior to screening.

          -  Use of GLP-1 receptor agonists or oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) other than stable
             intake of metformin alone or metformin in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor within 4
             weeks prior to screening

          -  Women of child bearing potential not willing to use contraceptive methods.
