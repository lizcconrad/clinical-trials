  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immune response to the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine used in
      combination with one of two protein vaccines (Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 or Bivalent
      Subtype C gp120/AS01B) in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response of the
      DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine when used in combination with one of two protein vaccines: Bivalent
      Subtype C gp120/MF59 (Protein/MF59) or Bivalent Subtype C gp120/AS01B (Protein/AS01B). These
      protein vaccines may boost the immune response to the DNA vaccine.

      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of eight groups, and each group will receive a different sequence of vaccines during
      the study. Groups 1 and 4 will receive the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine, the Protein/MF59 vaccine,
      and placebo. Groups 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 will receive the DNA-HIV-PT123 vaccine, the
      Protein/AS01B vaccine, and placebo. Group 8 will only receive placebo.

      All participants will receive their assigned vaccines at Months 0, 1, 3, and 6. Each of these
      visits will include three injections. Follow-up visits will occur at Week 2 and Months 1.5,
      3.5, 6.25, 6.5, 9, and 12.

      Study visits will include a physical examination, an interview and/or questionnaire, HIV
      testing and HIV risk reduction counseling, and urine and blood collection. Participants may
      optionally choose to provide stool, rectal fluid, cervical fluid, or semen samples.
      Participants will be contacted 6 months after the last scheduled visit by phone, text
      message, or e-mail for information about their health.

             trial. Exceptions may be made for vaccines that have subsequently undergone licensure.
             For volunteers who have received control/placebo in an experimental vaccine trial, the
             HVTN 108 PSRT will determine eligibility on a case-by-case basis. For volunteers who
             have received an experimental vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for
             enrollment will be determined by the HVTN 108 PSRT on a case-by-case basis.

             exclusionary: [1] corticosteroid nasal spray; [2] inhaled corticosteroids; [3] topical
             corticosteroids for mild, uncomplicated dermatitis; or [4] a single course of
             oral/parenteral corticosteroids at doses less than 2 mg/kg/day and length of therapy
             less than 11 days with completion at least 30 days prior to enrollment.)

          -  Serious adverse reactions to vaccines or to vaccine components including history of
             anaphylaxis and related symptoms such as hives, respiratory difficulty, angioedema,
             and/or abdominal pain. (Not excluded from participation: a volunteer who had a

             significant implications for current health. A clinically significant condition or
             process includes but is not limited to:

               -  A process that would affect the immune response,

               -  A process that would require medication that affects the immune response,

               -  Any contraindication to repeated injections or blood draws,

               -  A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert
                  grave danger to the volunteer's health or well-being during the study period,

               -  A condition or process for which signs or symptoms could be confused with
                  reactions to vaccine, or

               -  Any condition specifically listed among the exclusion criteria below.

          -  Any medical, psychiatric, occupational, or other condition that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to, protocol
             adherence, assessment of safety or reactogenicity, or a volunteer's ability to give
             informed consent

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
             excluded are persons with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide,

          -  Asthma other than mild, well-controlled asthma. (Symptoms of asthma severity as
             defined in the most recent US National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)
             Expert Panel report). Exclude a volunteer who:

               -  Uses a short-acting rescue inhaler (typically a beta 2 agonist) daily, or

               -  Uses moderate/high dose inhaled corticosteroids, or

               -  In the past year has either of the following:

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
