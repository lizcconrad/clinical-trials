      To study central blood pressure changes caused by commonly used high blood pressure
      medications in pregnancy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central blood pressures in addition to pulse wave velocity will be attained prior to
      medication, and then every 30 minutes for 4 hours (total of 9 readings). Sphygmomanometer
      readings will be completed at the same time (total readings 9). These readings are all
      related to the study.

      Nursing will have the opportunity to to record the routine sphygmomanometer readings for
      their routine vitals if they chose to do so.

      Their participation will be complete after the 4 hour assessment is complete.
