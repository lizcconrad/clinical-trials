      This study aimed to verify if combination of a low calorie diet and orange juice consumption
      results in weight loss and ameliorates metabolic obesity-related biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      Seventy-eight obese subjects aged 36 ± 1 years and BMI of 33 ± 3 kg were randomly divided
      into two parallel groups: (1) orange juice (n = 39), composed of individuals subjected to a
      diet low caloric diet and plus intake of 500 ml orange juice; (2) control (n = 39) composed
      of individuals subjected to a diet low in calories. The recruitment process began in
      September 2015, the intervention was carried out from October 2015 to January 2016, and the
      data analysis started in February 2016. The sample number took into account variances on body
      weight with a type I error α = 0.05 and a type II error β = 0.2 (80% power). The minimum
      sample size should have 36 individuals per group (n = 72), considering an approximately 15%
      dropout rate. Thus, the final sample size of study was constituted by 39 individuals per
      group (n = 78). Primary and secondary endpoints were the reduction of weight and modification
      of the levels of obesity-related metabolic biomarkers, respectively. Normality and
      homogeneity of data were tested. T-test was conducted to identify possible differences
      between OJ and control groups at baseline. A linear mixed-effects model was apply to
      determine the time effect within and between groups (post hoc), and P significance was set up
      ≤ 0.05. The assessment of body composition, metabolic biomarkers and food intake were
      analyzed over a 12-week intervention.

    <description>Nutritionists prescribed a low-calorie diet that was estimated from total energy expenditure (TEE) for each individual minus 500 kcal per day (30% TEE). Both groups had the same diet plan based on individual weight. The dietary plan was composed of six meals/day: breakfast (fat-free milk and coffee; whole-grain bread with margarine, and an apple); snack 1 (250 mL OJ / banana and free-fat yogurt); lunch (brown rice, beans, grilled lean meat, salad, cooked vegetables); snack 2 (250 mL OJ / free-fat yogurt with oatmeal); dinner (brown rice, beans, grilled lean meat, cooked vegetables and salad); and snack 3 (salty crackers or oat cookies, tea without sugar). Body composition measurements were collected (monthly); blood samples and dietary questionnaires (every two weeks).</description>
