    <textblock>
      For many people living with type 1 diabetes it is a challenge to achieve good glucose
      control. Barely 20% reaches the goal level and many people experience self-care as complex,
      demanding and stressful. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a
      stress-management program on glucose control, self-care and psychosocial factors. The program
      is based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a specific form of Cognitive behavior
      therapy (CBT). A total of 70 adult patients with type 1 diabetes from Ersta hospital will be
      recruited. Half of them will receive the intervention and the other half will continue with
      their regular diabetes care. A licensed psychologist specialised in CBT and a diabetes
      specialist nurse will be leading the intervention that is given in a group format. The
      program consists of seven 2-hour sessions given over 14 weeks. Glucose control, self care and
      stress will be measured at inclusion, after session four and seven, at six , 12 and 24 months
      and finally after 5 years
