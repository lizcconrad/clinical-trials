  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) and deep TMS (dTMS) for treatment of different psychiatric and neurological
      disorders. Subjects will be randomized into two groups: experimental (treated with
      pharmacotherapy and TMS) and control group (treated only with pharmacotherapy). They and
      their clinicians will complete a battery of instruments that measure relevant symptoms,
      global functioning and quality of life. The first measurement will be done after the
      inclusion and before treatment. The second measurement will be made immediately after the end
      of treatment (after 4 weeks). The other measurements (follow-up) will be made after 3 and 6
      months.
