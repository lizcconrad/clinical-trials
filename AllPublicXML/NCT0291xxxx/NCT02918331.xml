    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of daratumumab when combined with
      lenalidomide and dexamethasone in Japanese participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
      who are not candidates for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation
      (ASCT).
