  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly (i.e.&gt;75 yrs) represent about 40% of incident dialysis patients in the French REIN
      Registry and are growing population in high income countries. Those elderly patients with CKD
      have a high risk of dying within the first months of dialysis start or could have a good
      long-term prognosis suggesting kidney transplantation access. Elderly patients with CKD also
      have a higher risk of dying than reaching ESRD. Therefore, outcomes of elderly patients with
      advanced CKD need to be better described and understood to be able to give accurate
      information to the patients and their relatives and help decision making concerning the
      treatment strategy including several options (i.e preemptive kidney transplantation, in
      center or home dialysis and conservative care). In France we have information about patients
      who started dialysis with French dialysis registry (REIN) but not about elderly patient
      treated with conservative care. Then we don't have information about description of the
      therapeutic project in this population and their evolution in a prospective cohort design.
      Finally we need to identify patients with high risk of early mortality to help shared
      decision making for better care organisation.

      The project of the study is the development of a French multicenter prospective cohort
      including elderly patients more than 75 years old reaching ESRD. Objectives are as follow:

      Description of the characteristics of the population such as, clinical and social conditions,
      medicine treatment, therapeutic project declared by nephrologist and laboratory value at
      inclusion.

      Description of the evolution of therapeuic project, kidney function and the outcomes defined
      as death or dialysis or kidney transplantation.

      Development of a mortality prognosis tools to help decision making in this population.

      At inclusion for each patient data were collected on demographic and clinical conditions
      (comorbidities and disabilities), mobility (walk without help, need assistance and totally
      dependent for transfers), way of living (home living or institutionalized), biological data
      (blood and urine), therapeutic projects about the option for dialysis and the medicals reason
      to start dialysis. As it is an observational study of current practices, no additional tests
      or additional visits were mandatory either at inclusion or during the follow-up.

      Data on dialysis start and outcomes were extracted from the French National ESRD registry
      REIN. This linkage was approved by the French Advisory Committee on Information Processing in
      Material Research in the Field of Health (CCTIRS), the National Commission for Information
      Technology and Privacy (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes) and ethic
      committee. The starting dialysis condition included patient's clinical characteristics, the
      use of a central vascular catheter (CVC), the unplanned condition of dialysis start and the
      first modality of dialysis (peritoneal or hemodialysis). After dialysis start, patient
      survival and information about dialysis withdrawal before death was collected.

      The number of patients to include was fixed to more than 500 to study at least 15 prognosis
      factors with estimation of more than 30% of death during follow-up.
