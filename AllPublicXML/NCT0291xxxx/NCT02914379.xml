      The purpose of this study is to measure how much LY3337641 gets into the bloodstream and how
      long it takes the body to get rid of it. In addition, the safety and tolerability of the
      study drug will be evaluated.

      Participants will be admitted to a clinical research unit (CRU) the day before dosing.
      Participants remain confined to the CRU for at least 7 days. Participants may be discharged
      from the CRU any time after 7 days post-dose (Day 8), and up to a maximum of 21 days
      post-dose (Day 22).

      This study will last approximately 30 days for each participant, not including screening.
      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Overtly healthy males, as determined by medical history and physical examination

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 32.0 kilograms per meter squared (kg/m²)

          -  Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the population
             or investigative site, or results with acceptable deviations that are judged to be not
             clinically significant by the investigator

          -  Have venous access sufficient to allow for blood sampling as per the protocol

          -  Are able and willing to give signed informed consent

          -  Generally have a minimum of 1 bowel movement per day

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have participated, within the last 30 days, in a clinical trial involving an
             investigational product. If the previous investigational product has a long half-life,
             3 months or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer, if known) should have passed

          -  Have a significant history of or current cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal (GI) (cholecystectomy not acceptable), endocrine, hematological,
             dermatologic, or neurological disorders capable of significantly altering the
             absorption, metabolism, or elimination of drugs; of constituting a risk when taking
             the investigational product; or of interfering with the interpretation of data

          -  Have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units per week, and are
             unwilling to stop alcohol consumption for 48 hours prior to admission, and while
             resident in the clinical research unit (CRU)

          -  In the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, are unsuitable for inclusion in the
             study

          -  Have had exposure to significant diagnostic, therapeutic, or employment related
             radiation within 12 months prior to dosing (serial x-ray or computed tomography scans,
             barium meal, current employment in a job requiring radiation exposure monitoring)

          -  Have participated in a [¹⁴C] study within the last 6 months prior to admission for
             this study. The total 12-month exposure from this study and a maximum of one other
             previous [¹⁴C]-study within 6 to 12 months of this study must be within the Code of
             Federal Regulations (CFR) recommended levels considered safe (per 21 CFR 361.1): less
             than 5000 Milli-rem (mrem) /year whole body annual exposure
