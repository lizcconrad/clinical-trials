  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Foley catheter is one component in a catheter insertion procedure that could contribute
      to a catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Improvements in the catheter
      insertion procedure using the ERASE CAUTI Tray system may help to lower these infection
      rates.

    <measure>Urinary tract infection rates</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days on average or until hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Infection rate/1000 catheter days based on days of use. As the number of days a catheter is used varies, the minimum expected time frame on average is 2 days. However, infections will be monitored during catheter use.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Catheter use</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days on average or until hospital discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The average number of days a catheter is used is typically 2 days. However during the hospital stay, the time a catheter remains varies on medical need. The total daily use of each catheter will be tabulated after removal..</description>
