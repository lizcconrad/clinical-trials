  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if there is a difference between your
      expectations of how well you will perform daily living activities after short-term inpatient
      rehabilitation and the doctor's expectations of how well you will perform daily living
      activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete questionnaires before your
      inpatient rehabilitation and after you complete inpatient rehabilitation. The questionnaires
      will ask about how well you currently perform daily living activities, your expectation of
      how well you will perform daily living activities after you complete inpatient
      rehabilitation, your symptoms in the past 24 hours, and your physical, functional, social,
      and emotional well-being. These questionnaires should take about 15 minutes total to
      complete.

      Information from your medical record (such as your age, gender, religion, cancer diagnosis,
      stage of cancer, and so on) will be collected.

      Length of Study:

      You participation on this study will be over after you complete the questionnaires.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 111 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
