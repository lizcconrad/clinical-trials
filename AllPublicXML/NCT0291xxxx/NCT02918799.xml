  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will adapt and pilot a multi-level, community-based intervention to promote HIV
      prevention and sexual health among young men who have sex with men in Beirut.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mpowerment (MP) is an evidence-based community-level, structural, social and behavioral
      intervention for HIV prevention developed for YMSM that targets individual and community
      empowerment and mobilization, self-affirmation, sexual self-knowledge, and creation of a
      supportive social environment. MP has been widely used in the U.S., but not in a mostly
      Muslim setting. This project will adapt and pilot MP for the sociocultural issues facing YMSM
      (age 18-29) in Beirut. There will be a 2-year pilot implementation of MP, with longitudinal
      cohorts of YMSM in Beirut and Jounieh, the latter being the control community. Primary
      outcomes will be unprotected anal sex and HIV testing, with secondary outcomes being
      engagement in peer outreach, and perceived peer norms related to condom use and HIV testing.

    <description>MP is a multi-level intervention that reaches out to all YMSM in a community by mobilizing men to encourage their friends to reduce risk behavior and join the program (informal outreach), along with holding social activities that promote safe sex (formal outreach). MP provides YMSM with skills, support and confidence to find solutions within themselves for sexual health, and seeks to affirm the validity and rights of same-sex behavior and identities.</description>
