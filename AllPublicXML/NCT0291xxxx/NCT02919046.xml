  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm, multicenter clinical study will treat the patient who have relapsed or
      refractory neuroblastoma with an infusion of the patient's own T cells that have been
      genetically modified to express a chimeric antigen receptor(CAR)that will bind to tumour
      cells modified to express the GD2 protein on the cell surface. The study will determine if
      these modified T cells help the body's immune system eliminate tumour cells .The trial will
      also study the safety of treatment for CAR-T, how long CAR-T cells stay in the patient's body
      and the impact on this treatment for survival.

      This is a single-arm, multicenter clinical study to evaluate efficacy and safety of chimeric
      antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) in the treatment of relapsed or refractory
      neuroblastoma in children. The study will be conducted using a phaseⅠ/Ⅱdesign the study will
      have the following sequential phases: part A (screening, leukapheresis,cell product
      preparation and cytoreductive chemotherapy) and part B (treatment and follow-up). the
      follow-up period for each participant is approximately 35 months after the final CAR-T
      infusion. The total duration of the study are expected to be approximately 3 years. A total
      of 22 patients may be enrolled over a period of 3 years.
