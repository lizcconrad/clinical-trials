  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are very few studies on emotion management in chronically ill patients. They usually
      include small sample size (less than 30 persons) and are not randomized controlled trials.
      However, emotion management is an essential coping skill in mental well-being and quality of
      life and is the subject of numerous studies in psychology.The investigators hypothesized that
      a creative and physical activities combination in chronically ill will promote the
      strengthening of emotion management skill. The investigators will conduct an innovating study
      combining quantitative and qualitative variables in a randomized controlled trial to confirm
      our hypothesis.

      1. Surveyors will conduct a first interview with patients (within an association &quot;La
           Fabrique Créative de Santé&quot; that provides free activities to chronically ill) , in order
           to collect data on emotion management and quality of life perception and to assess
           expectations regarding the activities. At the end of the interview, patients will be
           randomized in two groups.

        2. In arm 1, patients choose one creative activity (evolutive art-therapy, writing
           workshop, theatre, singing) and one physical activity (pilates, mindfulness meditation,
           shiatsu, ayurvedic massage) that they will practice during the following six months.

        3. In arm 2, patients will follow the same pattern but will start activities 6 months
           later.

        4. After 6 months data on patients emotion management and quality of life perception will
           be collected again and interviews will be conducted regarding their overall satisfaction
           of the activities.

        5. Every six months during one year, data will be collected by mail or e-mail.
