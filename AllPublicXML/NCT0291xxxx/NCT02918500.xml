  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether or not patients who use a Nicotine Replacement Therapy
      (NRT) patch prior to their by-pass surgery are more likely to be smoke-free 6 months after
      their surgery and have fewer post-operative complications

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to

        1. To determine if pre-operative, (short-term) NRT, 1 to 3 weeks before surgery, improves
           the long-term quit rates among smokers undergoing elective CABG surgery.

        2. To determine the effect of pre-operative NRT on perceived stress and symptoms of
           nicotine withdrawal at the time of surgery.

        3. To assess, retroactively, the impact of pre-operative cessation on peri-operative
           complications such as infection rates, respiratory failure, myocardial infarction,
           stroke, sepsis, shock and prolonged hospital stay.

      We therefore hypothesize that if NRT is given to smokers during the pre-admission period (1-3
      weeks prior to surgery), they are more likely to be biochemically abstinent from cigarette
      smoking 6 months after hospitalization and will experience fewer peri-operative complications

      To assess these measures, we have designed a single site, double-blinded randomized
      controlled trial at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI). Patients who are
      identified as a smoker at their initial visit to the PAU will undergo a baseline assessment
      and be randomly assigned (1:1) to either active or placebo 21mg NRT patch. They will wear the
      patch from that baseline visit until the day of their surgery at UOHI. Following their
      surgery, they will receive a follow up phone call at 1 and 6 months post-discharge. They will
      complete a series of short questionnaires to assess their smoking status, stress levels and
      nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Those who identify themselves as being smoke-free will be asked
      to complete a carbon monoxide breathing test to chemically validate their smoking status. The
      study protocol will be reviewed by the Research Ethics board at UOHI and all participants
      will provide written informed consent prior to undertaking any study activities.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is currently smoking &gt;5 cigarettes/day for the past 30 days; there is no
             evidence that NRT is useful in those who smoke &lt;5cpd.

          2. Patient is able to participate and willing to provide informed consent; participants
             will need to follow directions and adhere to the medication usage instructions as
             outlined in the informed consent document.

          3. Patients is willing to be contacted by phone for follow up at 1 month and 6 months
             post-discharge; these time points will assess our final outcome of cessation at 6
             months post-discharge.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is scheduled for surgery in &lt; 7 days; most patients need to be using NRT
             consistently for 2 weeks for it to be fully effective.

          2. Patient is currently using a smoking cessation product (i.e. nicotine containing
             patch, gum, inhaler, lozenge, spray or nicotine containing electronic cigarette,
             varenicline, buproprion) or has used a smoking cessation aid consistently for more
             than 72 consecutive hours with the intent to reduce cigarette consumption or quit
             smoking within 30 days of the baseline Pre-admission Unit (PAU) visit; this will
             ensure the effects of the study patches will be assessed without any contamination
             from other cessation products.

          3. Patient is willing to refrain from using any other cessation products (nicotine
             containing patch, gum, inhaler, lozenge, spray, nicotine containing electronic
             cigarette, varenicline, buproprion) prior to surgery; this will allow us to track the
             usage and side effects with the study patches.

          4. Patient is allergic to the adhesive on the nicotine replacement therapy patch.

          5. Patient is unable to read and understand English or French; study materials will only
             be supplied in these two languages.
