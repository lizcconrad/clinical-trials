  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a result of sustained operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, there are an increasing number
      of U.S. military Veterans with substance use disorders and comorbid posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). If left untreated, individuals with substance use disorders and PTSD are at
      increased risk for developing other mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety),
      suicidal ideation and attempts, medical problems, reduced resiliency and military readiness,
      vocational problems, and family/social impairment. This study will determine the benefits of
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in treating alcohol use disorder and comorbid post-traumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) among military Veterans.

      As a result of sustained operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, there are an increasing number
      of U.S. military Veterans with substance use disorders and comorbid posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD). While mental health services are in place for U.S. service members,
      substantial gaps in the treatment of co-occurring substance use disorders and PTSD exist and
      there is little scientific evidence available to guide the provision of care. Treatment for
      comorbid substance use disorders and PTSD, especially pharmacologic treatment, is largely
      ineffective and short-lived. While there have been numerous studies focused largely on
      dopaminergic mechanisms of reward, they have not led to the development of adequate
      treatments for comorbid substance use disorders and PTSD. Animal models demonstrate that (a)
      acute stress and chronic use of addictive substances reduce the capacity of glia to remove
      the neurotransmitter glutamate, and (b) this impairment as well as relapse can be prevented
      or reversed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Further, human studies indicate that NAC is associated
      with reduced craving and substance use. Based on this, the investigators conducted a Proof of
      Principle (PoP) study which was the first to examine the use of NAC for the treatment of
      PTSD, with or without comorbid addiction. In this randomized, controlled double-blind pilot
      study the investigators showed that Veterans with substance use disorders (81.5% alcohol use
      disorder) and PTSD who were treated with 2400mg NAC for 8 weeks demonstrated significant
      reduction in PTSD severity and craving. Moreover, reductions in PTSD and substance-related
      symptomatology were sustained at 1-month follow-up. However, to extend and confirm its
      clinical utility in the military/Veteran context, it is important to know whether NAC reduces
      severity of alcohol use disorder (AUD), the most common addiction among Veterans and military
      service members, and the mechanisms underlying therapeutic response. Based on promising data
      from the PoP project, the proposed Extend-and-Confirm (EC) study will determine the efficacy
      of NAC in reducing AUD and comorbid PTSD in Veterans (N=90). Further, new aims include the
      application of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and proton magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to investigate the pathophysiology of AUD/PTSD, as well as prognostic
      indicators of treatment outcome. These aims extend the Future Plans proposed in the original
      PoP study and provide an opportunity for collaboration among clinical and preclinical
      investigators at the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center and the Medical
      University of South Carolina (MUSC) to solve this critical health problem in the military
      context. In the proposed EC study, the investigators will (1) employ a randomized,
      double-blind, between-groups experimental design that will consist of 8 weeks of treatment
      with NAC (2400mg) or placebo medication, and follow-up assessment at 1-, 3-, and 6-months
      post treatment; (2) use standardized, repeated dependent measures to rigorously assess AUD
      severity and PTSD symptomatology during treatment and follow-up; (3) collect biologic
      measures of alcohol use; (4) measure impairment in associated areas of functioning (e.g.,
      depression, sleep, suicidality, risky sexual behaviors, family/social functioning); and (5)
      employ advanced neuroimaging techniques before and after treatment among a subset of enrolled
      subjects. This proposal is directly responsive to the missions of the Institute for
      Translational Neuroscience (ITN), and the US Army/Department of Defense (DoD) in that it
      seeks to accelerate the development of new, medication-based treatments to mitigate the
      impact of AUD and comorbid psychological conditions, such as PTSD, in the military/Veteran
      context. The findings of this study will provide critically needed empirical evidence to help
      inform practice guidelines and better serve the needs of U.S. service members, Veterans and
      their families.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, any race or ethnicity, age 21 to 70 years old.

          -  U.S. military Veteran, including National Guard and Reservists.

          -  Able to comprehend English.

          -  Meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) criteria for current alcohol use
             disorder (AUD) and/or substance use disorder (SUD).

          -  Meet DSM-5 criteria for current PTSD or subthreshold PTSD. Subjects may also meet
             criteria for a mood disorder (except bipolar affective disorder, see Exclusion
             Criteria) or other anxiety disorders (e.g., panic disorder, agoraphobia, social
             phobia, generalized anxiety disorder). The inclusion of subjects with affective and
             other anxiety disorders is essential because of the marked frequency of the
             co-existence of mood and other anxiety disorders among patients with PTSD (Brady et
             al., 2000; Kessler et al., 2005).

          -  Subjects taking psychotropic medications will be required to be maintained on a stable
             dose for at least four weeks before treatment initiation. This is because initiation
             or change of medications during the course of the trial may interfere with
             interpretation of results.

          -  Must consent to random assignment to N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or placebo.

          -  Must consent to complete all treatment and follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for a history of or current psychotic or bipolar
             affective disorders, as the study protocol may be therapeutically insufficient.

          -  Subjects with a current eating disorder (bulimia, anorexia nervosa) or with
             dissociative identity disorder, as they are likely to require specific time-intensive
             psychotherapy.

          -  Subjects experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, as evidence by a score of 10 or
             above on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol (CIWA).These subjects
             will be referred for clinical detoxification and may be re-assessed for study
             eligibility after medically supervised detoxification has been completed.

          -  Individuals considered an immediate suicide risk based on the Columbia Suicide
             Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) or who are likely to require hospitalization during the
             course of the study.

          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing or not practicing an effective form of birth control.

          -  Asthma or any clinically significant medical condition that in the opinion of the
             investigators would adversely affect safety or study participation.

          -  Use of carbamazepine, phenytoin, nitrous oxide, methotrexate, 6 azauridine triacetate,
             or nitroglycerin within the last 14 days or any other medication felt to have a
             hazardous interaction if taken with NAC.

          -  History of childhood or adult seizures of any cause.

          -  MRI exclusions: Claustrophobia; tattoos above the shoulders; permanent eyeliner or
             permanent artificial eyebrows; cardiac pacemaker; metal fragments in eye, skin, or
             body, including shrapnel; heart valve replacement; brain clips; venous umbrella; being
             a sheet-metal worker or welder; lifetime history of aneurysm surgery; intracranial
             bypass, renal, or aortic clips; prosthetic devices such as middle ear, eye, joint, or
             penile implants; joint replacements; non-removable hearing aid, neurostimulator, or
             insulin pump; shunts/stents; metal mesh/coil implants; metal plate/pin/screws/wires;
             or any other metal implants. Note that individuals who meet inclusion/exclusion
             criteria for the medication component of the study but not the MRI portion (e.g.,
             excluded due to metal implants) will still be eligible to enroll in and complete the
             medication/treatment phase.

          -  Subjects on maintenance anxiolytic, antidepressant, or mood stabilizing medications
             which have been initiated during the past four weeks. If it is determined, based on
             clinical criteria, that a subject needs to be started on maintenance medications for
             anxiety, mood or psychotic symptoms during the course of the study, they will be
             discontinued from the treatment trial.
