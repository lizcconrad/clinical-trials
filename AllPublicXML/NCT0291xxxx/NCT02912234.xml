        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed Informed Consent

          2. Target population: Healthy subjects as determined by medical history, surgical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical
             laboratory tests including coagulation parameters.

          3. Subjects with body mass index of 18 to 30 kg/m2, inclusive

          4. Women must not be breast feeding, have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test and
             must agree to follow instructions for method(s) of contraception for the duration of
             treatment with study treatments apixaban and clarithromycin plus 5 half-lives of study
             treatments apixaban and clarithromycin plus 30 days (duration of ovulatory cycle) for
             a total of 33 days post-treatment completion.

          5. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to follow instructions for method(s)
             of contraception for the duration of treatment with study treatments apixaban and
             clarithromycin plus 5 half-lives of the study treatment plus 30 days for a total of 33
             days post-treatment completion. In addition, male participants must be willing to
             refrain from sperm donation during this time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any significant medical illness, drug allergy including allergy to
             apixaban, FXa inhibitors (and/or their excipients), clarithromycin, macrolides, and/or
             related compounds. History of substance abuse and use of nicotine containing products
             and/or alcohol abuse.

          2. History of coagulopathy, prolonged or unexplained clinically significant bleeding, or
             frequent unexplained bruising or thrombus formation, including hypermenorrhea,
             intra-cranial hemorrhage, family history of bleeding disorders in first degree
             relatives, and/or any adverse reaction to anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents that
             resulted in excessive bleeding.

          3. History of recurrent neurological or gastrointestinal disorders, including insomnia,
             chronic headaches, dizziness, gastroesophageal reflux disease, cholecystectomy,
             gastric ulcers and/or Gilbert's syndrome.

          4. History of antibiotic induced secondary infections, including candidiasis.

          5. Evidence of organ dysfunction or any clinically significant deviation from normal in
             physical examination, vital signs, ECG, or clinical laboratory tests beyond what is
             consistent with the target population.
