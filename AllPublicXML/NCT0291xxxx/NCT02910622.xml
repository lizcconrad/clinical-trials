  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The choice of treatments for cancers by systemic way - chemotherapy, hormone therapy and
      targeted therapies - is currently defined by criteria for population groups and not to an
      individual. These expensive treatments - in financial terms and quality of life - will be
      effective for some and administered unnecessarily for other because there is no predictive
      test of response for a given individual.

      For breast cancer, the usual treatment includes the first surgery and adjuvant therapies
      (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy ...) whose effectiveness will be assessed after many years as
      the occurrence or not of a recurrence or metastases.

      These systemic treatments can also be administered before surgery to reduce the tumor volume
      and secondarily allow less mutilating surgery: it is the principle of treatment neo adjuvant.
      In this case, the efficiency will be evaluated more quickly.

      In practice, a patient with breast cancer suspicion has a biopsy which confirms the diagnosis
      and defined the parameters (hormone receptors, cytological grade, receptor monoclonal
      antibodies ...) that guide to the most appropriate type of treatment.

      Tumor size is evaluated in neo adjuvant pre-treatment by imaging: mammography, ultrasound and
      MRI.

      At the end of this medication, the evaluation of the response is achieved by radiology and
      surgery.

      Pathological examination evaluates and precise response by the criteria of Chevallier and /
      or Sataloff. An ex vivo test for predicting the response of cells to different chemotherapy
      regimens, the oncogramme, was developed by Oncomedics, a young company whose technology is
      derived from the University of Limoges.

      Clinical response and / or histopathological could be compared in a reasonable time (2-6
      months), the results of the oncogramme proposed by Oncomedics whether the efficiency obtained
      in vivo is that predicted by the ex vivo test.

      It is the same in the metastatic setting when there is an available target for biopsy and
      assessment of response.

      The management of ovarian cancer in advanced stages can also benefit from a radiological and
      histopathological evaluation strategy before and after systemic treatment to compare the in
      vivo results with those predicted by ex vivo by Oncomedics.

      A fragment of Breast/Ovarian tumors will be taken from a specimen or a cold biopsy, tissue
      from patients diagnosed with breast cancer or ovarian cancer before starting an induction
      treatment stage IIIc and IV pleural IFGO operable.

        -  Culturing the cells obtained from the tumor fragment by Oncomedics in a defined medium
           and provided for enriching tumor cells compared to stromal cells.

        -  Maintaining the cells in culture for 7 days.

        -  Effects of conventional chemotherapy (corresponding to protocols) on these cells for 72
           hours (growth chambers) by Oncomedics (chimio-oncogramme).

        -  For each chemotherapy tested, measuring the proportion of dead cells / total cells.

        -  Retained by Oncomedics results, not given to the nursing team. The patient will be
           treated and followed up in the usual way.

        -  At the end of the study, comparing the in vitro results (chimio-oncogramme) to the
           patient response to the same chemotherapy.
