  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to compare how often arm swelling develops after
      4 weeks of radiation treatment to how often arm swelling develops after 6 weeks of radiation
      treatment in patients who receive radiation therapy delivered to the lymph nodes near the
      breast. Researchers also want to know about other side effects that can develop during or
      after radiation treatment.

      Shorter radiation, delivered over 3 to 4 weeks, is standard treatment for women receiving
      radiation to just the breast. Clinical research studies with 10 years of follow up show that
      shorter radiation, delivered over 3 to 4 weeks, provides similar cancer control as longer
      radiation, delivered over 5 to 6 weeks, for women receiving radiation therapy to the breast.
      Additionally women receiving shorter radiation were less likely to develop radiation side
      effects.

      Shorter radiation has not been as well studied for women receiving radiation therapy
      delivered to the lymph nodes near the breast lymph. However, shorter radiation may also
      reduce side effects from radiation to the lymph nodes near the breast.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete questionnaires about your general
      health, your arm function, your and your family's history of cardiac risks and blood
      pressure, and how your breast or chest currently looks and feels. This should take about 15
      minutes to complete. The size and volume of your arms will be measured with a perometer. The
      arm is inserted into a vertical or horizontal frame and the size and volume of the arm is
      measured using light beams. You will also have a physical exam and your medical history will
      be recorded.

      Study Groups:

      You will then be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups. You will have
      an equal chance of being assigned to each group. Group 1 will receive shorter radiation.
      Group 2 will receive standard radiation.

      If you are in Group 1, you will receive about 3 weeks of radiation (15 treatments) to the
      entire breast or chest wall and the lymph nodes in that area.

      If you are in Group 2, you will receive about 5 weeks of radiation (25 treatments) to the
      entire breast or chest wall and the lymph nodes in that area.

      Participants in both groups will also have 5-8 additional treatments of radiation as a
      &quot;boost&quot;. The boost will be delivered to the part of the breast where the disease first
      started if you had a lumpectomy and will be delivered to the chest wall if you had a
      mastectomy.

      You will receive separate consent forms for the radiation therapy.

      Study Visits:

      You will have blood drawn (about 1 teaspoon) for routine tests within 3 months prior to
      receiving radiation or within the first week before starting radiation treatment. While you
      are receiving radiation, during your routine visits, you will be asked about any side effects
      you may be having each week.

      Follow-up Visits:

      You will return to the clinic for follow-up visits about 6 and 18 months after radiation. You
      will then have visits every year until 10 ½ years after completion of radiation.

      At Months 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 66, and 126 months after radiation therapy, you will complete the
      questionnaires about your general health and arm function and will have your arm volume
      measured.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over after the 126 month (10 ½ year) visit.

      This is an investigational study. Both the standard and the shorter radiation courses are
      delivered using FDA-approved and commercially available methods. The goal of this study is to
      compare the 2 treatments.

      Up to 290 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

          3. Treatment with mastectomy or segmental mastectomy and axillary evaluation (sentinel
             node evaluation, axillary sampling, or axillary lymph node dissection). If the patient
             has T0 disease, breast surgery is not required.

          4. Age 18 years or older.

          5. Documentation of arm volume measurement by perometer prior to axillary surgery.

             cancer must have been completed prior to study registration, and the patient must have
             no evidence of disease for this prior non-breast cancer.

          7. Patients must be enrolled on the trial within 12 weeks of the later of two dates: the
             final breast cancer surgical procedure or administration of the last cycle of
             cytotoxic chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pathologic or clinical evidence for a stage T4 breast cancer.

          2. Pathologic or clinical evidence for a stage N2b, N3b, or N3c breast cancer
             (supraclavicular, or internal mammary lymph node involvement).

          3. Clinical or pathologic evidence for distant metastases.

          4. Any prior diagnosis of invasive or ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer in either
             breast.

          5. Current diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer.

          6. History of therapeutic irradiation to the breast, lower neck, mediastinum or other
             area in which there could potentially be overlap with the affected breast.

          7. Patient is pregnant.
