    <textblock>
      Clinicians are often unable to successfully do a spinal tap. Ultrasound has been proposed as
      a method to improve success but it is not known if it helps. This study is designed to see if
      ultrasound improves the success rate.

      Obtaining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar puncture (LP) is an essential procedure
      in the neonatal/infant intensive care unit (N/IICU) for establishing diagnosis and
      determining treatment. The traditional technique for performing an LP involves palpation of
      anatomic landmarks followed by a &quot;blind&quot; stick of the appropriate inter-spinous process
      space. This technique has a failure rate (defined as the inability to obtain cerebrospinal
      fluid or obtaining a traumatic puncture) of 15-50%.

      Bedside ultrasonography possesses the ability to visualize the anatomic landmarks, including
      the subarachnoid space. In the adult literature, ultrasound has been shown to reduce the LP
      failure rate. Its utility has also been shown to significantly improve success rates and
      accuracy in epidural needle placement in neonates and children undergoing regional
      anesthesia. Increasing the proportion of successful LPs in the N/IICU could significantly
      reduce patient/family discomfort, sedation exposure, off unit travel, additional
      interventional procedures and antibiotic use. However, research on the utility of bedside
      ultrasound assisted LPs by clinicians working in an N/IICU is lacking.

      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Eligible subjects will be randomized to
      undergo LP (performed as part of their standard of care) with ultrasound assisted method or
      traditional landmark method.

      Primary Objective:

      -To determine if bedside ultrasound-assisted LP, performed by N/IICU clinicians on neonates
      and infants aged ≤6 months, increases the proportion of successful first attempt
      non-traumatic LPs when compared to a traditional landmark palpation technique.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine if bedside-ultrasound assisted LPs increases the proportion of overall
           successful non-traumatic LPs within 2 attempts.

        -  To determine if bedside-ultrasound assisted LPs is associated with a decrease in the
           length of antibiotic exposure in patients undergoing LPs.

Providers will have 2 attempts to complete the LP. If CSF cannot be obtained within 2 attempts, any subsequent attempt will be at the discretion of the attending neonatologist and will be performed outside this study by the care team.</description>

    <description>Clinician will use an ultrasound-assisted technique to perform the LP. The Phillips CX50 ultrasound machine is an FDA approved device and will be used in accordance with its approved labeling. Spinal ultrasound will be performed using a linear high-frequency transducer to locate and mark the termination of the conus medullaris, the narrowing of the spinal canal, and the midline to delineate a &quot;safe zone&quot;. The study team member will have 2 attempts to complete the LP. A &quot;successful&quot; attempt is obtaining cerebrospinal fluid.</description>
