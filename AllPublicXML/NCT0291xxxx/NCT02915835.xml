    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to provide preliminary data on the efficacy (digital
      ulcer net burden) and safety of riociguat administered 3 times daily (TID) in comparison to
      placebo in patients with scleroderma-associated digital ulcers
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a US, multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled,
      parallel- group study with a total of 20 participants planned to be randomized (approximately
      10 participants to the riociguat group and 10 to the placebo group). In addition, a
      standardized wound care protocol will be followed by the investigators and digital
      photography will be taken of the cardinal ulcer.

      The study will allow standard of care medications for the management of DU as background
      therapy. These may include calcium channel blockers, low dose aspirin, angiotensin enzyme
      inhibitors, etc. and will be determined by the participant's local physician.

      The study design consists of three phases:

        -  Screening phase: up to 2 weeks

        -  Double-blind Treatment phase: 16 weeks of double-blind treatment, consisting of:

        -  Dose titration period of up to 8 weeks, and

        -  Stable dosing period of up to 8 weeks

        -  Open-label Extension phase for participants with active DU at the end of the double-
           blind treatment phase or development of an active DU within a month of completing
           double-blind phase, consisting of:

        -  Dose titration phase of up to 8 weeks

        -  Stable dosing period for 8 weeks

    <description>Digital ulcer net burden is defined as the total number of &quot;new&quot; or &quot;active&quot; digital ulcers at an assessment, plus the number of &quot;indeterminate&quot; ulcers that had previously been classified as either &quot;active&quot; or &quot;new&quot; at any earlier assessment during the study</description>

    <measure>Healing of cardinal DU</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant, one digital ulcer must be identified and designated by the investigator as the cardinal ulcer at Baseline. The cardinal ulcer must have met the qualifications for designation as an active ulcer. If only one ulcer was determined at entry to be active, it will be designated as the cardinal ulcer. If several digital ulcers qualified, the cardinal ulcer could be either the largest or the most painful ulcer, or the ulcer that disturbed the patient the most. The cardinal ulcer will be selected by the investigator based on the clinical judgment that it was amenable to and evaluable for healing.</description>
