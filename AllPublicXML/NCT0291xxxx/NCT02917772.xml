      TITAN RCC (0216-ASG) is a Phase 2, open-label study of nivolumab monotherapy with additional
      nivolumab/ipilimumab &quot;boost&quot; cycles in previously untreated and pretreated (2nd line),
      advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) subjects with intermediate and high risk
      disease according to IMDC.

      The primary object is to estimate the Objective response rate (ORR) based on investigator
      assessment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 of the TITAN
      regimen in untreated (1st line) and pretreated (2nd line) subjects with International
      Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) intermediate and high risk, advanced Renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC) with clear cell component

    <time_frame>until 30 weeks after last patient first treatment, LPFT</time_frame>
    <description>(RECIST 1.1) by CT or MRI measured at week 8 (+/- 1 week) and week 16 (+/- 1 week), 28 (+/- 1 week) and then every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week).
The primary objective will be measured by the primary endpoint of ORR (based on investigator assessments) among all treated subjects, first line subjects and second line subjects. It is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response of CR or PR divided by the number of all treated subjects, first line subjects or second line subjects. Best overall response is defined as the best response designation, as determined by investigator, recorded between the date of first dose and the date of objectively documented immunotherapy resistance per RECIST v1.1 or the date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first. For subjects without documented immunotherapy refractory disease or subsequent therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the ORR determination.</description>

    <measure>Remission Rates during TITAN treatment: RR1, RR2, RR2SD, RR3</measure>

    <description>RR1: Number of patients with CR/PR during nivolumab monotherapy (induction and maintenance, the latter only including protocol defined pseudoprogressors) divided by all treated patients.
RR2: Remission rate after progression during nivolumab monotherapy. It is defined as the number of patients with CR/PR after receiving nivolumab/ipilimumab &quot;boost&quot; cycles for initial progression during nivolumab monotherapy divided by all patients receiving &quot;boosts&quot; for this situation.
RR2SD: Remission rate after stable disease during nivolumab monotherapy. It is defined as the number of patients with CR/PR after receiving nivolumab/ipilimumab &quot;boost&quot; cycles for initial stable disease during nivolumab monotherapy divided by all patients receiving &quot;boosts&quot; for this situation.
RR3 is the subsequent remission event to RR2 for patients undergoing repeated nivolumab/ipiliumumab &quot;boost&quot; according to the algorithm described above.</description>
