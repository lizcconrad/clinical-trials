    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, single-site trial to evaluate the in vivo release
      characteristics in the gastrointestinal tract of metronidazole benzoate capsules designed to
      disintegrate in the large intestine. This will be examined by means of metronidazole plasma
      levels and scintigraphic images in healthy subjects. Overall, nine subjects will be evaluated
      for each formulation prototype. Two formulation prototypes will be investigated. Each subject
      will receive one radio-labelled capsule only.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy subjects, male or non-pregnant, non-lactating females, between 18 and 55 years
             old. Females of child bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             prior to the intake of study drug, and must use a hormonal (oral, implantable or
             injectable) or a double barrier method of birth control throughout the study. Females
             unable to bear children must have documentation of such in the source records (i.e.,
             tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or post-menopausal with as a minimum of one year since
             the last menstrual period).

          2. Ability of subject to participate fully in all aspects of this clinical trial.

          3. Voluntary signed informed consent must be obtained and documented.

          4. Accept not to use any kind of tobacco, including cigarettes nor E-Cigarettes or pipe
             smoking, nicotine replacements nor oral tobacco and not to consume any alcohol or
             drugs during screening, treatment and following two days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participating in a clinical study involving investigational drugs or dosage forms
             within the previous 30 days.

          2. Radiation exposure from clinical trials, including that from the present study and
             from diagnostic X-ray but excluding background radiation, exceeds 5 mSv in the last
             five years. No subject whose occupational exposure is monitored will participate in
             the study.

          3. Any nuclear medicine procedure prior to study day 1 that might interfere with the
             scintigraphic images that are acquired.

          4. Clinically significant deviation of biochemistry or haematology parameters from the
             normal range

          5. History of gastrointestinal surgery, with the exception of appendectomy unless it was
             performed within the previous 12 months.

          6. Clinically relevant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, metabolic, autoimmune, pulmonary

             faeces and/or a stool frequency of greater than three times per day. Constipation will
             be defined as a failure to defecate more frequently than every three days.

          8. History of adverse reaction or allergy to metronidazole or any study drug or
             formulation components/ingredients.

          9. Hypersensitivity to imidazole derivatives

         10. History of any malignancy removed or adequately treated.

         11. History of alcohol or drug abuse.

         12. Donation of blood (or plasma) within the previous three months and donation of Plasma
             the last 14 days.

         13. Over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medication (including laxatives, vitamins and
             natural herbal remedies including St. John's Wort) between screening visit (visit 1)
             and completion of the study. Occasional paracetamol or acetyl-salicylic acid is
             permitted.

         14. Ingestion of grapefruit juice, coffee, caffeine containing beverages on treatment day.

         15. Failure to satisfy the Investigator to participate for any other reason.

         16. Known allergy to crustaceans (due to Chitosan)
