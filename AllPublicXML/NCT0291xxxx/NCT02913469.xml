  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) has become the first choice for STEMI
      patients.According to the current guidelines,dual antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 receptor
      inhibitor and aspirin ,and intravenous injection of morphine therapy for chest pain relief in
      necessity play a pivotal role in the treatment of patients with ST elevation myocardial
      infarction before primary percutaneous coronary intervention.And ticagrelor is recommended in
      patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing PCI, with class IB
      indication.Therefore coadministration of morphine and ticagrelor are commonplace.Currently,
      some studies have found that morphine delayed and attenuated exposure to ticagrelor,but it is
      not clear of the pathogenesis of it.Some researchers say that morphine results in a weaker
      and retarded antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor in STEMI patients before PCI by inhibition of
      gastrointestinal peristalsis and causing vomiting.The study is aimed at exploring whether
      morphine delay and attenuate exposure to ticagrelor and its antiplatelet effect.In addition,
      the trial will explore the possible mechanism which morphne delay and attenuate exposure to
      ticagrelor in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction before PCI.

      The study is a single center, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial.From September 1st,
      2014 to February 10, 2016，patients with STEMI who prepared to accept PCI were screened
      according to the inclusion criteria. All patients for eligibility for the study received
      orally a 300 mg loading dose (LD) of plain aspirin and a 180mg loading dose (LD) of plain
      ticagrelor and then signed a written informed consent to participate in the study.Then,the
      patients were randomly assigned to four treatment groups.The patients in group A would be
      administrated intravenous morphine 5mg and metoclopramide 10mg,the patients in group B would
      be administrated intravenous morphine 5mg and 0.9%normal saline 2ml,the patients in group C
      would be administrated intravenous metoclopramide 10mg and 0.9%normal saline 2ml, the
      patients in group D would be administrated intravenous 0.9%normal saline 2mland 0.9%normal
      saline 2ml. Subsequently，all patients would received orally plain aspirin 100mg once a day
      and plain ticagrelor 90mg twice a day and 1 month of follow-up.The investigators would
      calculate the platelet response index before LD and 0.5h,2h,8h after LD by platelet
      vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay with flow cytometry instrument(BD
      FACS Calibur). The primary study end-point was platelet response index by PRI VASP 2 hours
      after LD. Secondary end-points were (1) The platelet response index by PRI VASP half an hour
      and 8 hours after LD.(2)Record the electrocardiogram changes(the incidence of a 70% reduction
      after PCI ,TIMI flow of crime vessels(TIMI flow frames),the incidence of acute/subacute
      thrombotic events,the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
      events,the incidence of primary and secondary bleeding.
