  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia has very significant economic consequences. Costs fall on many different parts
      of society, especially on individuals with schizophrenia and their families. The first five
      years after onset appears to be a critical period in which the symptoms are more responsive
      to treatment. In addition, if left untreated for a long time, psychosis can impact many areas
      of a person's life. The evidence base regarding the effectiveness of specialist early
      intervention services for psychosis has grown steadily and evidence from randomized
      controlled trials in Denmark, the United Kingdom and Spain has demonstrated the superiority
      of specialized early intervention programs over standard care on a broad range of outcomes
      including symptomatic and vocational, social functioning, and reduced inpatient care and
      treatment dropout, as measured over follow-up intervals of 2-3 years. Information about the
      cost-effectiveness of early intervention programs for first-episode psychosis is limited. The
      provision of such services requires investment by health departments and services, and the
      question of whether such services represent value for money has to date received little
      research attention. Only a few international studies, and none conducted in Spain, have
      investigated the cost effectiveness of early intervention in psychotic disorders at medium (3
      years) and long-term (up to 10 years). In this study, the investigators aimed to analyse the
      cost-effectiveness of an intensive early-intervention programme, using data from First
      Episode Psychosis Clinical Program (PAFIP), the largest trial treating first episode
      non-affective psychosis in Spain to date.
