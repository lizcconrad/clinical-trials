    <textblock>
      This type of study is called a radiolabeled study. For this study, LY3039478 (study drug) has
      been specially prepared to contain radiolabeled carbon [¹⁴C]. [¹⁴C] is a naturally occurring
      radioactive form of the element carbon. This study will help determine how the drug appears
      in the blood, urine, and stool after it is administered by mouth to healthy people.
      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected. This study will
      last about 10 weeks for each participant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Have a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 32 kilogram per meter square (kg/m²), inclusive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study
             investigating LY3039478, and have previously received the investigational product

          -  Have known allergies to LY3039478, related compounds or any components of the
             formulation, or history of significant atopy

          -  Have had exposure to significant diagnostic, therapeutic, or employment-related
             radiation within 12 months prior to dosing (eg, serial x-ray or computed tomography
             scans, barium meal, current employment in a job requiring radiation exposure
             monitoring)

          -  Have participated in a [¹⁴C] study within the last 6 months prior to admission for
             this study. The total 12-month exposure from this study and a maximum of one other
             previous [¹⁴C]-study within 6 to 12 months of this study must be within the Code of
             Federal Regulations (CFR) recommended levels considered safe: less than 5000 millirem
             (mrem)/year whole body annual exposure
