  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the effects of the mGluR2/3 partial agonist LY2140023 (Pomaglumetad
      Methionil, &quot;POMA&quot;) at selected doses on ketamine-stimulated glutamate release in prefrontal
      cortex as measured by pharmacoBOLD fMRI (also termed resting BOLD fMRI).

    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of POMA at selected doses on ketamine-stimulated glutamate
      increase in the prefrontal cortex hypothesized to simulate the synaptic dysregulation that
      occurs endogenously in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The purpose of this is: 1) to
      determine whether the low dose (40 mg BID) utilized in recent (failed) clinical trials is
      sufficient to engage the primary target and 2) whether a higher (160 mg BID) dose,
      representing the maximum tolerated dose of POMA, engages the target to a greater degree. This
      study will further validate pharmacoBOLD as biomarker of mGluR2/3 target engagement,
      permitting its future use in other glutamatergic drug development.

          -  Capable of understanding the study procedures and able to provide informed consent

          -  Men and women must agree to use a reliable method of birth control during the study.

             eligible

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or past Axis I psychiatric history

          -  Positive urine toxicology

          -  History of recreational ketamine use, recreational PCP use, or an adverse reaction to
             ketamine. Subjects who have participated in prior research ketamine studies will be
             eligible. Subjects can have infusions not more frequently than biweekly, and not more
             than 1/month on average, therefore subjects entering the study will need to wait one
             month if they had a single infusion and 6 weeks if they have had two closely spaced
             infusions.

             disease/procedure/accident/intervention association with significant injury to or
             malfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) or history of significant head injury

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  Metal implants, pacemaker, other metal or paramagnetic objects contained within the
             body
