  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outside the setting of well-designed prospective clinical studies, the current standard
      preoperative RT should be a conventionally 1.8-2 Gy fractionated regimen to a total dose of
      50 Gy in 5-6 weeks. However, given the vast diversity of sarcoma subtypes, it is also
      unlikely to assume a uniform therapeutic management to be optimal for all sarcomas alike.
      Other than 2 Gy fraction sizes and/or 50 Gy total dose series have been investigated in the
      past and should be further exploited in the future, but the practical implementation in
      humans is hampered by the rarity of the disease.

      The current systemic treatment of sarcomas consists of both the older cytotoxic
      chemotherapies and the newer targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors. But it is
      hard to predict which patients will respond to which specific systemic treatment. This leads
      to worse prognoses and unnecessary toxicity for sarcoma patients. Despite the fact that the
      number of sarcoma patients in current studies is too small with a mix of different subtypes,
      some subtypes show a better response than other subtypes. This platform may form the basis
      for preclinical translational investigations with radiotherapy and various systemic
      treatments.
