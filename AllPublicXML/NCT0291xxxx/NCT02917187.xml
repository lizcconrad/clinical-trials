    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of repeat oral dosing of
      BIIB074 on paroxysmal pain in participants with Primary Inherited Erythromelalgia (EM). The
      secondary objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of repeat oral dosing of
      BIIB074 on varying additional aspects of pain in participants with EM; and to investigate the
      safety and tolerability of repeat oral dosing of BIIB074 in participants with EM.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly average severity of paroxysms</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>11-point Pain Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (PI-NRS) is used to assess EM paroxysmal pain. PI-NRS is an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale, where 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain.
Weekly average is defined as the total of severity scores during a week divided by the total number of paroxysms during that week.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly maximum severity of paroxysms</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly maximum severity is the maximum paroxysm severity recorded by a participant in a given week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly average and weekly maximum of daily background pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant provides a daily background pain score via a diary that records background daily pain intensity using a numerical rating scale from 0-10 with higher scores indicating worse pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC is a 7-point self-report scale depicting a participant's rating of overall improvement. Participants rate their change as &quot;very much improved,&quot; &quot;much improved,&quot; &quot;minimally improved,&quot; &quot;no change,&quot; &quot;minimally worse,&quot; &quot;much worse,&quot; or &quot;very much worse.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly average and weekly maximum number of pain-mitigating activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participant diary is used to record pain mitigating cooling activities that include but are not limited to use of cold water or fan.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly average and weekly maximum duration of pain-mitigating activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participant diary is used to record pain mitigating activities that include but are not limited to use of cooling, and breathing/relaxation and mental imagery techniques.</description>

    <measure>Weekly average and weekly maximum of the daily sleep interference scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Daily Sleep Interference Scale (DSIS) describes how much EM pain interfered with the participant's sleep with 0 indicating &quot;pain did not interfere with sleep&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;pain completely interfered with sleep&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Weekly average and weekly maximum number of awakenings at night due to EM pain</measure>

    <measure>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>C-SSRS is a suicidal ideation rating used to evaluate suicidality. It rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from &quot;wish to be dead&quot; to &quot;active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent.&quot;</description>
