  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An online decision support tool will be field tested that provides patients facing a decision
      about contralateral prophylactic breast cancer (CPM) with evidence-based information about
      the expected incidence of contralateral breast cancer and the life expectancy benefit of CPM.
      The tool will be designed for use in clinical settings and viewed jointly by the patient and
      physician as part of a shared decision making process around CPM.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential participants will be recruited at their initial surgeon's appointment at
      MDACC/HALs. We will assess eligible patients' surgical treatment preferences prior to meeting
      with the surgeon including level of interest in having CPM (i.e., no interest in CPM to
      definitely interested in having CPM). If the patient selects 3 or higher for interest in CPM
      (where 1 indicates no interest in CPM and 5 indicates definite interest in CPM), we will
      proceed to invite the patient to participate on the study. Ten breast cancer surgeons will be
      invited to participate in the study and each will be asked to field test the decision tool on
      5 eligible patients who are considering CPM.

      Fielding testing is necessary to demonstrate that the tool is acceptable to physicians and
      patients, in real world settings, and is part of the systematic development process for
      patient decision aids from the IPDAS collaboration. After completing the tool with 5
      patients, each physician will complete a survey to determine whether the tool was useful, how
      the information was used, how patients reacted to the information provided, what impact the
      tool had on the patients' decision, and identify any problems in using the tool that can be
      addressed before it is made available to clinicians on a broader scale. Fielding testing with
      clinicians who will ultimately use the tool in clinical practice is an often neglected step
      in producing decision support tools. It provides important information about the
      acceptability of the tool, greatly increasing the likelihood that it will be used beyond the
      current project.

      The patients' acceptability and the effectiveness of the decision support tool will be
      assessing using questionnaires before and after the patient participates in the consultation
      with her breast cancer surgeon. Patients' rating of the acceptability of the decision support
      tool will be assessed using questions from the Ottawa Acceptability Measures, including the
      clarity, amount, and balance of the information provided by the tool (2). The effectiveness
      of the decision support tool will be assessed by the following measures administered before
      and after the consultation: 1) changes in patient's knowledge of CPM and 2) reductions in
      decisional conflict about CPM using the Decisional Conflict Scale (3) Patients will also be
      asked their preferences for CPM after the consultation.
