      This is a prospective, single-arm, unblinded, case observation study evaluating a
      commercially released 'Conformité Européenne' (CE)-mark co-registration software system
      along-side of a commercially- released CE-mark coronary physiology and X-ray system during
      routine clinical workflow. The purpose of this study is to collect Professional user feedback
      regarding clinical utility of the SyncVision 4.X system.

      The PREPARE II study will enroll a maximum of 200 patients in up to 5 sites. No follow-up
      will be performed. The PREPARE II study will only collect data during diagnostic angiogram or
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure, when performed as per standard hospital
      care.

    <measure>Professional user feedback regarding clinical utility of the SyncVision 4.X system</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Post-Procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>After the procedure the physician will be asked to rate and comment on the clinical utility and features of the SyncVision 4.X system in the post-study user evaluation questionnaire. This will include questions on the potential of the system to facilitate clinical decision-making, utility of co-registration workflow and functionality, quality of the co-registration and user interface functions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference between assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (Post-Procedure)</time_frame>
    <description>Differences between the clinical assessment based on the existing time-based pullback graph and clinical assessment based on the automated co-registration of pullback graph with the angio image are performed by using a rating system 1 - 5 (1=Unacceptable, …., 5=Excellent).
The co-registration and functionality points assessed are:
Workflow associated with achieving Physiology values co-registration
Physiology values co-registration results display clear and functionality convenient for use
Angiogram &amp; Roadmap selection
Auto roadmap generation
Pathway indication and correction
Co-Registration sequence: Roadmap-navigation and calibrated graph navigation
Length measurements</description>

    <description>Ability to distinguish tandem, diffuse and mixed disease based on the physiological pullback profile display and the co-registered physiological pullback profile display are performed by the use of a rating system 1 - 5 (1=Unacceptable, …., 5=Excellent). The points assessed and compared are:
Distinguish tandem lesions
Distinguish diffuse diseased lesions
Distinguish mixed diseased lesions</description>
