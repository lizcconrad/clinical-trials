  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study was to compare the effectiveness of passive ultrasonic
      irrigation with that of traditional syringe irrigation on the removal of bacteria and
      endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) from root canals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty teeth with apical periodontitis were randomly allocated into two groups according to
      the irrigation protocol, passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI, n = 20) and syringe and needle
      irrigation (NI, n = 20). Microbiological sampling was performed before (S1) and after the
      root canal preparation (S2), after the tested irrigation protocols (S3). Total bacteria
      counts were determined by a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay; and the endotoxin levels by the
      LAL assay.
