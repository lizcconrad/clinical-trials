        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Patient provides signed written informed consent before any study-specific procedure.

          -  Patients suffer from coronary artery disease (CAD) including at least one
             angiographically significant (&gt;70% visual estimation) stenosis present in a native
             coronary artery with planned PCI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with emergent PCI or in cardiogenic shock.

          -  Subjects with target left main (LM) lesion, with restenosis or stent thrombosis in the
             target vessel or with aorto-ostial lesion location within 3 mm of the aorta junction
             (both right and left).

          -  Extreme angulation (&gt; 90°) or excessive tortuosity (&gt; two 45° angles) proximal to or
             within the target lesion.

          -  Known renal insufficiency (examples being but not limited to estimated glomerular
             Filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 50 ml/kg/m2, serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dL or on dialysis).

          -  Any other medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator will interfere
             with patients safety or study results.

          -  Currently participating in another clinical study that interferes with study results.

          -  Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 1 year
             following index procedure.

          -  Any condition that precludes the subject from undergoing PCI, for example subjects
             with heparin induced thrombocytopenia, or contrast allergy
