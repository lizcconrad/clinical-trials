    <textblock>
      The Will Erwin Headache Research Center Study of Cluster Headache and Trigeminal Neuralgia is
      a prospective, multicenter, observational research network for subjects with Cluster Headache
      and/or Trigeminal Neuralgia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Will Erwin Headache Research Center will assemble a national registry of Cluster Headache
      patients and will sub-categorize and organize this cohort based on individuating
      characteristics including but not limited to type and severity of condition, associated
      symptoms, and medical/psychological issues (e.g., depression, disability, sleep). Detailed
      evaluations and classification will be completed for each enrolled subject. This will
      encompass genomic and epigenomic studies, past medical history, imaging reports, and specific
      physical exam results for each patient. It will also enable the study investigators to match
      patients with suitable interventional clinical trials.

      Similar diseases, such as other paroxysmal hemicrania, SUNCT, SUNA, hemicrania continua, and
      trigeminal neuralgia may also be investigated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia according to the International
             Headache Classification including episodic cluster headache, chronic cluster headache,
             episodic paroxysmal hemicrania, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, episodic short-lasting
             unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing
             (SUNCT), chronic SUNCT, episodic short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache
             attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA), chronic SUNA, and hemicrania continua.
