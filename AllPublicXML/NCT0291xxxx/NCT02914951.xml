  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to the core symptoms, children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder
      (ASD) often exhibit disruptive behavior problems including irritability, tantrums,
      noncompliance, and aggression. The purpose of this study is to investigate
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for disruptive behavior in children with autism spectrum
      disorders and intellectual disability. This pilot study will include children with ASD and IQ
      between 55 and 85 in an open study of CBT. CBT is modified in this study to reduce complexity
      of activities during therapy sessions but retains all key elements and principles of CBT.
      Assessments of irritability and disruptive behavior will include clinical interviews, parent
      ratings and child self-report measures. Study participants will be asked to complete
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate biomarkers of social perception and
      emotion regulation before and after CBT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children with ASD share common symptoms in the core domains of social reciprocity,
      communication, and repetitive behaviors. In addition to the core symptoms, 50 to 70 percent
      of children with ASD often exhibit disruptive behavior problems including irritability,
      tantrums, noncompliance, aggression and self-injury.

      In this open pilot study expands clinical research on CBT for irritability to children with
      autism and mild cognitive impairment. CBT consists of individual weekly sessions dedicated to
      teaching children to recognize situations that may lead to frustration and to build coping
      skills for dealing with frustration in socially appropriate ways. Recent research as well as
      clinical reports suggest that children with mild intellectual disabilities (IQ between 55 and
      85) can also benefit from CBT. The intervention is modified to reduce complexity of
      activities during therapy sessions but retains key elements and principles of CBT. Thus, the
      modified version of CBT is referred to as &quot;Principles-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy for
      Irritability in Autism&quot; or PB-CBT for short. Subjects in this study will receive a
      comprehensive evaluation of ASD and associated psychopathology. Irritability and related
      disruptive behaviors will be rated on weekly basis to utilize a single-subject approach to
      data analysis. Children will be asked to participate in functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) with tasks of social perception and emotion regulation before and after CBT. The
      purpose of the fMRI portion of the study is to evaluate feasibility of fMRI as an outcome
      measure in studies of behavioral interventions for children with ASD and intellectual
      disability.

    <description>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). There will be two fMRI visits, 60 to 90 minute each, one before and the other after CBT. fMRI is a technique that uses magnetism to measure activity of the brain as participants perform simple tasks such as pressing the button in response to pictures. During this study, children will be asked to look at pictures of objects and press or not press the button in response to specific instruction. Participants will also look at pictures of faces and light-point displays depicted biological motion. fMRI is used as an outcome measure to explore if change in irritability is associated with change in brain responses to these tasks during fMRI.</description>
