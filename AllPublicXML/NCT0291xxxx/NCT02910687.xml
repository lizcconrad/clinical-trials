  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the FINE 75+ study, 307 Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) patients, 75 years
      old or older, were included between September 2009 and June 2010. The purpose of this
      observational study (FINE75+5) is to describe these patients, especially regarding the
      following variables: cardiovascular risk, co-morbidity and frailty, and to assess the
      prognostic value of frailty on 5-year outcomes. We hypothesize that frailty is independently
      associated with 5-year mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term frailty denotes a multi-dimensional syndrome characterized by increased
      vulnerability and decreased physiologic reserves. Frailty stratification predicts a patient's
      risk of death and need for institutional care. The construct is well validated, but there is
      not one single accepted operational definition. The CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) is a
      7-point scale relying on clinical judgement. It is a global clinical measure of biological
      age, and it mixes co-morbidity, disability and cognitive impairment.Though frailty
      instruments so far mainly have been used in a geriatric context, it has been pointed out as
      relevant for cardiologic patients as well, e.g. regarding risk stratification for elderly
      patients with NSTEMI.

      In the FINE 75+ study, 307 Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) patients, 75 years
      old or older, were included between September 2009 and June 2010. We reported importance of
      frailty for short-term (1 month) and medium-term outcome (1 year) in a NSTEMI population
      (Ekerstad et al. 2011, Ekerstad et al. 2013). However, there are no published data on the
      importance of frailty on longer-term outcome. Information on long-term prognosis may
      substantially improve informed decision making in elderly patients with NSTEMI, with acute
      potentially harmful treatments aiming at improved long-term prognosis.

      The purpose of this study is to describe patients, 75 years old or older, with NSTEMI
      especially regarding the following variables: cardiovascular risk, co-morbidity and frailty,
      and to assess the prognostic value of frailty on 5-year outcomes.For the purpose of the
      current analysis all patients included in the final FINE 75+ study will be followed over 5
      years from hospital admission. We hypothesize that frailty is independently associated with
      5-year mortality.
