    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a game-based sexual violence prevention program that uses a
      bystander intervention approach. This program is called Bystander and was designed for use
      with high school students in grades 9-12. The goal of this research is to evaluate the
      efficacy and feasibility of Bystander when implemented in a school setting. The research will
      capture data on knowledge about sexual violence and harassment, as well as attitudes,
      self-efficacy, perceived social norms and behavioral intentions around bystander behaviors.
      This research will consist of a baseline survey, program participation, a immediate
      post-program survey, and a 3-month follow up survey with youth participants. It will also
      involve qualitative in-depth interviews with school staff and administration about the
      program.

      Using the investigators' experience in game-based learning, digital media, behavior theory,
      and adolescent sexual and reproductive health, the investigators have developed a digital
      game-based sexual violence prevention program—Bystander—to be used with high school students
      to teach them about prosocial bystander behaviors and decrease acceptance of common rape
      myths. The goal of this research is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of Bystander
      when implemented in a school setting.

      This study will evaluate Bystander, a four-module intervention program. Each module is
      designed to last one school class period. It includes 20 minutes of individual gameplay
      through an interactive narrative featuring prosocial bystander behaviors and discussions
      dispelling rape myths. Each module also includes facilitated class discussion about the
      topics covered that day.

      The research team will conduct a pre/post efficacy and feasibility study that will capture
      data through a pre-, immediate post-, and 3-month follow up survey on knowledge about sexual
      violence and harassment, as well as attitudes, self-efficacy, perceived social norms and
      behavioral intentions around bystander behaviors (all measured at pre-, immediate post- and
      follow-up time points). It will also capture demographic information and previous bystander
      behaviors at baseline. It will finally involve qualitative in-depth interviews with school
      staff and administration about the program.

    <description>Two schools (all students grades 9-12) will serve as the intervention group.Participants will complete a baseline survey that will take no longer than 30 minutes. Afterwards, a trained facilitator will delivery a game-based bystander intervention program aimed at teaching students the knowledge and skills to prevent or intervene in instances in sexual harassment and violence among peers. This will last for 4 class periods (approximately 45 minutes each period, 180 minutes total). Afterwards, participants will complete an immediate post-program survey lasting no more than 30 minutes. Three months later, students will fill out an a follow up survey lasting no more than 30 minutes. School staff and administrators will be interviewed to gather their insights on the program's feasibility and acceptability.</description>

    <description>One school (all students grades 9-12) will serve as a delayed control group. Participants will complete a baseline survey that will take no longer than 30 minutes. Afterwards, a trained facilitator will delivery a game-based health program unrelated to sexual health, sexual violence, sexual harassment, and bystander behaviors. This will last for 4 class periods (approximately 45 minutes each period, 180 minutes total). Afterwards, participants will complete an immediate post-program survey lasting no more than 30 minutes. Three months later, students will fill out an a follow up survey lasting no more than 30 minutes.
After completing the follow-up survey, this group will follow the same procedures to deliver the bystander program and capture data outlined for the intervention group.</description>
