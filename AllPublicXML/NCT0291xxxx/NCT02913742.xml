  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common cause of medication-resistant
      epilepsy in adults, and MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy is a new approach to
      its surgical management; however, while LITT demonstrates fewer complications than
      traditional surgical techniques, it generates lower rates of seizure freedom. During
      traditional temporal lobectomy for MTLE, neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring (NIOM)
      can be used to better identify epileptogenic tissue and guide resection. Our study proposes
      to investigate the utility of NIOM during LITT for MTLE. Subjects will be drawn from
      refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients determined to be candidates for LITT.
      During their LITT surgery, in addition to the placement of the stereotactic LITT probe,
      subjects will receive a second smaller stereotactic electrode for intraoperative monitoring
      of epileptic discharges before and after surgery. After surgery, at regularly scheduled
      follow-ups, patients will receive the Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire (QOLIE-31-P),
      in addition to standard post-operative care. Endpoints will be surgical complications,
      fractional decrement in epileptiform discharges from pre- to post-ablation recordings, and
      surgical outcome at 6 months and one year. Analysis of severe complications will be expressed
      as a simple complication rate, for overall complications, severe complications, and
      hemorrhagic complications in specific. The relationship between fractional discharge
      decrement and outcome will be assessed by regression analysis. Risks of the study will stem
      from the placement of the stereotactic electrode for intraoperative monitoring, which
      represents a small incremental risk beyond typical LITT for MTLE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is the most common cause of medication-resistant
      epilepsy in adults. The standard treatment for refractory MTLE is surgical resection by
      craniotomy. Stereotactic laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a new surgical
      technique being used to treat MTLE. Under MRI-guidance, a laser probe is inserted into the
      seizure focus and heat is used to destroy the tissue. Compared to temporal lobectomy, LITT
      results in shorter hospital stays, low complication rates, and possibly less cognitive
      decline; however, seizure freedom rates are potentially lower.

      During temporal lobectomy, neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring (NIOM) can be used to
      better identify epileptogenic tissue and guide resection. This tool has been unavailable
      during LITT procedures. Recently, the investigators demonstrated in two cases that NIOM with
      a depth electrode is technically feasible during LITT and can identify epileptiform activity
      intra-operatively.

      This is a prospective trial of NIOM during LITT for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The
      investigators will assess the safety of performing NIOM during LITT and whether data from
      NIOM (frequency and characteristics of epileptiform discharges recorded before and after
      ablation) are associated with seizure outcomes. If there is an association, NIOM could be
      used for prognostication and could potentially even be used to guide surgery.

      Hypotheses:

        1. NIOM performed by MRI-guided stereotactic depth electrode placed in the parahippocampal
           gyrus adjacent to the LITT catheter is safe, as compared to institutional LITT controls
           without NIOM and published LITT complication rates.

        2. Greater magnitude fractional decrements in discharge frequency from pre-ablation to
           post-ablation recordings will be significantly associated with better seizure outcomes,
           as measured by International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) surgical outcome scores.

      Objectives:

      The primary project goals are to assess if NIOM by parahippocampal depth electrode is safe
      during LITT of MTLE and to assess if the fractional decrement of interictal discharges (ID)
      on NIOM can be significantly correlated with outcome. The study will be powered to address
      these questions a priori. Post hoc analyses consisting of a multivariate analysis of other
      patient demographic data, NIOM findings, operative parameters, quality of life scores, and
      neuropsychiatric outcomes will also be assessed.

    <description>Analysis of NIOM ID recordings will focus on fractional decrement of discharge counts from pre- to post-operative recordings. Fractional decrement was chosen, as opposed to absolute discharge counts, which are expected to vary widely among patients. Fractional discharge decrement will be assessed for its association with surgical outcome.</description>

    <description>Analysis of safety will occur in an ongoing fashion, and at completion of the trial. Major complications will be reviewed immediately per institutional review board (IRB) approved protocols, and will trigger a project safety evaluation. Moderate and minor complications will be recorded, with results reviewed quarterly, to assess project safety. Final safety results will be compared to registry data of institutional MTLE LITT procedures and to published LITT results for MTLE.</description>

    <description>During laser interstitial thermal ablation (LITT) for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, the study patients will receive invasive neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring. In addition to the typical placement of LITT stereotactic laser ablation probe via occipital burr hole, the study patients will receive an 8-contact depth recording electrode placed through an adjacent burr hole. The recording electrode will be placed into the parahippocampal gyrus in parallel to the LITT device. The patient will be monitored for epileptic discharges for 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after the ablation process to record the change in discharges during the surgery. The monitoring will not be used to guide surgery. The probe will be removed with the LITT device at the end of the procedure.</description>
