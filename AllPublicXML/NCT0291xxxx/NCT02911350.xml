    <description>Hormone Suppressors: Patients may take any of the following combinations for a period of 6 months:
Lupron / Flutamide
Zoladex/ Flutamide
Lupron/ Casodex
Zoladex/ Casodex
Paclitaxel: 30 mg/m2 twice a week administered as a one hour infusion either Monday &amp; Wednesday or Tuesday &amp; Thursday for eight consecutive weeks will be started within the first week of radiation therapy. Following the first 3 dose levels, the dose of Paclitaxel will be escalated to 35 mg/m2 (dose level IV), 40 mg/m2 (dose level V) &amp; 45 mg/m2 (dose level VI).
Radiation Therapy: 5 days a week for 8 weeks to a total dose of 66.6 to 73.8 Gray depending on when patient enter the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic staging TXN1 (on MRI or CT)

          -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &gt; 10 ng/ml done within a month prior to study entry
             (the day of first hormonal ablation) and &gt; 10 days after prostate biopsy.

          -  Received hormone therapy with any of the following combination for less than 3 months

          -  Lupron / Flutamide

          -  Zoladex/ Flutamide

          -  Lupron/ Casodex

          -  Previous surgery for prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy).

          -  Current treatment with ketoconazole, cimetidine or hormone therapy for more than 3
             months prior to inclusion in the protocol for prostate cancer

          -  Major medical or psychiatric illness, which in the investigator's opinion may prevent
