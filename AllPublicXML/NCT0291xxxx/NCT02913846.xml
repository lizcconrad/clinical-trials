  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Denutrition is defined as a measurable decrease in functions and/or as change in the body
      composition, associated with a worsening of the prognosis of the underlying medico-surgical
      pathology. It is induced by a deficiency in energy, proteins or any other micro or
      macronutrient and is the result of malnutrition, itself caused by a poor diet or a metabolic
      disorder.

      According to the National Nutrition and Health Plan for Belgium, denutrition is an
      independent risk factor for the increase of complications, morbidity and mortality rates,
      average length of hospitalisation and global medical care cost. It is necessary to invest in
      the prevention of denutrition as the costs of preventive measures are lower than the cost of
      treating a denutrished patient.

      The Belgian financing system of hospitalisation days is based on the structure of the treated
      pathologies, the age of the patient and the geriatric features of the patient. It encourages
      all hospitals to lower the length of hospitalisation to the national average for all these
      criteria. As a consequence, there is a mounting tendency to shorten the average length of
      stay within the hospital.

      The so-called 'Sp' hospital departments occupy a specific place within the organisation of
      Health Services in Belgium. They are specialized in the treatment and rehabilitation of
      patients with cardiopulmonary, neurological, locomotor, psycho-geriatric and chronic
      diseases. These services act as an extension of acute services (continuity of acute
      hospitalisation) but also as a first entry point for the medical care of patients with
      various specific diseases (multiple sclerosis, psycho-geriatric disorders, chronic pulmonary
      disorders...).

      The financing of the Sp departments is, as opposed to the financing of other departments, not
      linked to the patient length of stay. However, an increase in hospitalization duration
      decreases the rate of admissions and the possibility to accept patients coming from acute
      hospital units.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the influence of denutrition of patients hospitalized in
      an Sp department on the length of revalidation stay, the associated costs and the patient's
      functional autonomy.
