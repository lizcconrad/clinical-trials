  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed protocol is a double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient and outpatient
      study,looking at the clinical treatment of cannabis use disorder.

      The treatment study is a total of 12 weeks. There will be two options offered to participants
      for week 1 of the treatment study. 1) Patient will go inpatient for 5 nights and after
      discharge from the inpatient phase will complete the 11-weeks of outpatient treatment or 2)
      patients who cannot complete the inpatient phase due to work or other obligations will
      complete the treatment 12-week study outpatient. 80 patients seeking treatment for cannabis
      use disorder will be enrolled into either the inpatient/outpatient or only outpatient study.
      This combined design will provide a comprehensive understanding of clonazepam's effects on
      individuals with cannabis use disorder across a range of outcome measures while also testing
      the medication's ability to prevent relapse in cannabis-abstinent patients.

      Patients seeking treatment for Cannabis Use Disorder (CUD) will be enrolled into an inpatient
      laboratory for 5 nights, where they will be initiated on medication and be assessed for the
      influence of clonazepam (or placebo) on (1) cannabis withdrawal (mood, sleep, cannabis
      craving, food intake), ratings associated with medication abuse liability, cognitive
      performance, and (2) relapse to cannabis use after patients (now abstinent from cannabis)
      leave the inpatient setting maintained on clonazepam (or placebo) for 8 weeks (with a 4-week,
      medication-free follow up). This combined design will provide a comprehensive understanding
      of clonazepam's effects on individuals with cannabis use disorder across a range of outcome
      measures (safety, abuse liability, withdrawal symptoms) while also testing the medication's
      ability to prevent relapse in cannabis-abstinent patients. Patient's who are unable to
      complete the inpatient approach will complete the 12 week trial as an outpatient only.
