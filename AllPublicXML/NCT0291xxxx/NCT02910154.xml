  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angina is the most common symptom of coronary heart disease among women but unlike men most
      women do not have stenosis of the coronary arteries. In a large proportion of these women,
      coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is thought to be the cause of angina. However, CMD
      is also demonstrable in the asymptomatic population, and may merely be an innocent bystander
      related to the presence of cardiovascular risk factors rather than a cause of angina
      symptoms.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether comprehensive intervention is feasible and
      results in improvement in both angina and microvascular function in these patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary microvascular dysfunction is found to be associated with a significant adverse
      prognosis. The condition is strongly associated with increased future risk of major
      cardiovascular events, frequent hospital readmission, continued angina and loss of quality of
      life compared to the general population.

      Pathophysiology of microvessel disease:

      In the heart 95% of the blood flow is controlled by the microcirculation. When oxygen demand
      is increased the normal response of the microvessels is to reduce resistance in order to
      increase flow. When microvessels are dysfunctional the blood flow in the larger coronary
      vessels does not increase sufficiently to meet oxygen demand, thus leading to ischemia and
      pain. The main causes are thought to be dysfunction of endothelium and structural changes
      such as perivascular fibrosis and changes in vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition to
      vasodilation the endothelium plays a central role in the atherosclerotic process by
      generating vasoactive and anticoagulant factors that are important mediators of thrombosis.
      Coronary microvessel dysfunction (CMD) has been shown to be a strong predictor of poor
      cardiovascular prognosis in a wide group of cardiac patients.

      Rationale for intervention:

      In women with angina and no obstructive stenosis of the coronary vessels cardiovascular risk
      factors are common. Among 3000 Danish women with angina and open arteries, 12% had diabetes,
      48% hypertension, 20% were smokers and the mean body mass index was 27 kg/m2. In a randomized
      trial among overweight patients with coronary artery disease both a large weight loss and
      intensive exercise training have shown to significantly improve coronary flow velocity
      reserve (CFVR). Small studies addressing risk factors individually suggest an effect on
      peripheral vascular function of exercise training, statin therapy, and weight loss.
      Pre-diabetes is found in eighty percent of these patients and is strongly associated to
      microvessel disease. Lifestyle intervention significantly reduces risk of developing
      diabetes. Medical treatment targeting microvessel dysfunction in patients with angina has not
      been systematically tested but small studies indicate an effect of beta-blockers and
      Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE)-inhibition on coronary microvessel function. Small
      studies indicate effect of individual interventions but mainly on the function of peripheral
      vessels. A comprehensive intervention simultaneously targeting CMD and angina has not
      previously been attempted.

      The rationale for this present intervention is to test this concept in women with angina and
      CMD.The study is a pilot study which, if successful, will be expanded to a multicentre,
      intervention trial with prognostic outcome. A large study showing improved prognosis is of
      crucial importance for treatment of this patient group to become part of guidelines.

    <measure>Changes in coronary microvascular function</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Coronary microvascular function will be assessed by transthoracic Doppler stress echocardiography (TTDSE) and measured as Coronary Flow Velocity Reserve (CFVR). CFVR is a measure of microvascular dysfunction in the absence of upstream coronary stenosis. CFVR is the ratio of flow during stress and flow during rest and will be measured with TTDSE of the left anterior descending artery before and during infusion of high dose adenosine (0.14 mg/kg/min).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in symptom burden assessed by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SAQ is a reliable, predictive tool that has been validated in 175 women with a confirmed diagnosis of stable coronary artery disease and angina pectoris. It is a 19-item health-related quality-of-life measure for patients with coronary artery disease. The answers given by the patients in the SAQ's questions are used to calculate scores in five scales: 1. Anginal Stability, 2. Anginal Frequency, 3. Physical Limitation, 4. Treatment Satisfaction and 5) Quality of Life.
Scale scores are transformed to a 0-100 range by subtracting the lowest possible scale score, dividing by the range of the scale and multiplying by 100. Higher scores indicate less symptom burden. Because each scale monitors a unique dimension of coronary artery disease, no summary score is generated. A score change of 10 points is clinically perceptible to patients and is considered a clinically relevant difference, while a substantial change is considered to be a change of 20 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in peripheral endothelial function assessed by brachial flow mediated (vaso)dilation (FMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The method is based upon measurement of the change in diameter of the brachial artery following short term occlusion of blood supply that causes a hyperemic flow response that stimulates dilation of the artery via nitric oxide (NO) released as a response to shear stress on the endothelium. Brachial artery 2-dimensional and pulsed Doppler flow velocity signals will be obtained above the antecubital crease with a linear array transducer, using a cardiovascular ultrasound system (GE healthcare vivid E9). Hyperemia is induced by inflating a blood pressure cuff on the proximal portion of the arm to 300 mmHg occluding arterial flow for 5 minutes. Pulsed Doppler recordings and 2-dimensional images will be obtained 60 seconds after cuff deflation (endothelial dependent dilation). After 15 minutes of rest to allow restoration of baseline conditions, non-endothelium-dependent brachial artery dilation will be assessed before and after administration of 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerine.</description>

    <measure>Changes in biomarkers including inflammatory markers and markers of metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Several components in the inflammatory system may be associated with cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. A meta-analysis comprising 29 prospective studies associated interleukin-6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF-alfa) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to increased cardiovascular risk independent of traditional risk factors in the healthy population.51
Fasting blood samples will be collected at baseline and follow-up for assessment of:
Lipids (total-, low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, cholesterol and triglycerides), endocrine function (Hba1c, glucose, insulin, thyroid stimulating hormone), kidney function (creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)), haematology and inflammatory disease (high sensitive CRP, high sensitive troponin-T, orosomucoid, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-alfa), adiponectin)</description>

    <measure>Changes in exercise capacity (VO2peak)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) is performed using a bicycle ergometer with breath-by-breath gas exchange measurements (Jaeger, Vyntus CPX, Germany. Participants will be encouraged to continue until exhaustion. Criteria for VO2 peak are levelling off of VO2 despite increasing workload and peak respiratory exchange ratio (peak RER) &gt; 1.10.38 VO2 peak and peak RER are determined at peak effort with 15-second average measurements. VO2 peak is expressed as: VO2 peak (mL/min), VO2 peak (mL/kg body weight/min) and VCO2 peak (mL/min). Predicted VO2 peak is calculated using the equation for sedentary, overweight individuals presented by Wassermann and Hansen. Measured VO2peak in percent of predicted is determined.</description>

    <measure>Changes in body weight and fat distribution (DEXA scan)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To estimate body composition (body fat mass and fat free mass ) a whole body dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan will be performed.
Body composition will be measured in the morning after a 10-hour fast.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in level of anxiety and depression (HADS questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 14 items (each scored 0-3), seven of which concern depression and seven anxiety symptoms. One of the main purposes of this instrument was to identify affective symptoms among somatically ill patients.Therefore, the items focuses on the non-somatic aspects of depression and anxiety, to avoid that symptoms from the somatic disease, such as fatigue, affected the measurements.Depression and anxiety items are summarized separately in two scales ranging from 0 to 21, where a higher score indicates more symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in systolic and diastolic heart function at rest and during stress including advanced imaging (eg. Strain-Echocardiography)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Diastolic heart function tends to be impaired in obesity and in diabetes, but whether this is also the case in microvessel dysfunction is unclear. Improvement in cardiac function following intervention may be subtle and is more likely measurable during stress. By using global longitudinal and radial 2D strain at rest and during dipyridamole or adenosine stress, we expect that we will be able to detect a smaller difference in myocardial function than by using change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessed by the Simpsons method.</description>

    <measure>changes in hip- and waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>hip and waist circumference will be measured in the morning after a 10-hour fast. Waist circumference is measured halfway between the lower rib and the iliac crest and hip circumference at the maximal gluteal protuberance and calculated as an average of two consecutive measurements.</description>
