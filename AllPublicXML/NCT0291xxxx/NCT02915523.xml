  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the biologically active dose of entinostat, when
      given in combination with avelumab, that is safe and warrants further investigation.
      Additionally, this study will evaluate the effectiveness of entinostat in combination with
      avelumab at the determined dose in terms of progression free survival compared to avelumab
      plus placebo in patients with refractory or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is comprised of 2 phases: an open-label Safety Lead-in (Phase 1b) followed by an
      Expansion Phase (Phase 2). The Expansion Phase will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      entinostat with avelumab when administered at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) versus
      avelumab alone in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer in a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled setting. In Phase 2, patients will be randomized in a 2:1
      ratio to receive avelumab plus entinostat or avelumab plus placebo, respectively.

      All patients will be assessed at Screening and at specified times during the conduct of the
      study using standard clinical and laboratory assessments. Patients will be assessed for
      response through radiological assessments. Patients will continue receiving their appropriate
      cycles of study treatment until tumor progression or adverse events (AEs) occur which
      necessitate discontinuing therapy as determined by the Investigator.
