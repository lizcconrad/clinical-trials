  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to compare the amount of root coverage resulting from
      subepithelial connective tissue graft and acellular dermal matrix associated with tunnel
      technique among patients suffering from multiple gingival recession.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acellular dermal matrix with Tunnel technique will offers great advantages for patients with
      multiple gingival recession as regards decrease surgical time, Post-Operative pain and root
      coverage, clinical attachment level, width of Keratinized gingiva, gingival biotype compared
      to subepithelial connective tissue graft with Tunnel technique.
