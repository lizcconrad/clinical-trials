      To observe early safety and performance of the Shockwave Medical Lithoplasty® System
      (specifically, Lithoplasty® Catheters: 2.5 x 60mm, 2.75 x 60mm, 3.0 x 60mm, 3.25 x 60mm, and
      3.5 x 60mm) in subjects to demonstrate that the Shockwave device can safely and effectively
      deliver localized pulsatile mechanical energy for balloon dilation of calcified, stenotic,
      infrapopliteal arteries.

      Shockwave Medical, Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, clinical
      study designed to evaluate the early safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty®
      System in subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 2.5mm to 3.5mm
      reference vessel diameter at the target site. The Shockwave Lithoplasty® System is indicated
      for lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilation of calcified, stenotic peripheral
      arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy. Up to twenty subjects will
      be enrolled and treated with Lithoplasty® System.

    <description>The Shockwave Lithoplasty® System is a proprietary lithotripsy-enhanced balloon catheter that is designed to be delivered through the peripheral arterial system of the lower extremities to the site of calcified stenosis. Activating the lithotripsy within the device will generate pulsatile mechanical energy within the target treatment site, disrupt calcium within the lesion and allow subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low balloon pressure. The system consists of a balloon catheter with multiple integrated lithotripsy electrodes, and a generator.</description>
