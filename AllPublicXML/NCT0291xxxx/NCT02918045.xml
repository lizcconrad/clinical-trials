  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two hemostatic agents in patients under dual
      antiplatelet therapy using the intraoral bleeding time after dental extractions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative hemostasis is a fundamental patient management issue in the oral and
      maxillofacial surgery setting. The risk of excessive bleeding prompts physicians to stop
      multiple antiplatelet agents before minor surgery, which puts coronary stenting patients at
      risk for adverse thrombotic events. Adequate hemostasis must be achieved in order to make
      oral surgeries possible for these patients without discontinuation of the antiplatelet
      regimen. The HemCon Dental Dressing (HemCon Medical Technologies, Inc, Beaverton, OR) is a
      novel chitosan-based hemostatic agent which may greatly improve upon the efficacy of wound
      healing and hemostasis both in extent and time for minor oral surgeries. Dental extractions
      will be performed in patients under dual antiplatelet therapy without altering their
      medication regimen. All patients will require to have two or more surgical sites so they will
      have internal surgical control sites. Cutaneous bleeding time and platelet aggregation tests
      will be obtained prior to extractions. The primary hemostasis will be evaluated by measuring
      the intraoral bleeding time after each extraction and further bleeding and healing outcomes
      will be ascertain by phone questionaires and clinical evaluations. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the effectiveness of HemCon Dental Dressing in controlling post extraction
      bleeding and to ascertain its role in healing of extraction wounds compared to a standard
      haemostasis method.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>Intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Primary bleeding will be evaluated by recording the intra-oral bleeding time. The extraction site will be observed for 2 min without gauze in place. At the end of 2 min, gauze is placed over the extraction site to remove blood extending beyond the tooth socket. After blotting the extraction site, any bleeding that extends beyond the crest of the socket will be recorded as a positive test result (i.e., onto surrounding gingival tissues) during an observation period of 1 min. This same procedure was performed at 5, 8, 11, 14, and 20 min after the extraction. Intra-oral bleeding time is defined as the length of time for bleeding to cease to extend beyond the tooth socket.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Point-of-care platelet function test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day before dental extraction</time_frame>
    <description>Blood platelet function plays a pivotal role in hemostasis during surgery and following traumatic injuries. The ability to assess platelet function before the intervention is desirable in patients undergoing dental extraction procedures. A point-of-care platelet function test (Multiplate - Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) will be performed the morning before dental extraction to assess platelet function inhibition due to dual antiplatelet therapy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary bleeding (T1)</measure>
    <time_frame>10-15 hours after dental extraction</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary bleeding (T1) will be evaluated by telephone with standardized questionnaire including the following: whether bleeding occurred after the individual left the dental clinic (y/n); whether gauze was needed to be placed due to bleeding (y/n); and whether an emergency service or dental clinic was visited due to bleeding (y/n).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary bleeding (T2)</measure>
    <time_frame>45-50 hours after dental extraction</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary bleeding (T2) will be evaluated by telephone with standardized questionnaire including the following: whether bleeding occurred after the individual left the dental clinic (y/n); whether gauze was needed to be placed due to bleeding (y/n); and whether an emergency service or dental clinic was visited due to bleeding (y/n).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Intra patient healing comparison</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Healing will be compared between the study and control sites and assessed on a scale of 1-3 with 1 representing the healing of the study site being significantly worse than the control; 2 representing the healing of the study site being the same as the control, and 3 meaning the healing of the study site was significantly better than the control.</description>

    <description>The HemCon® Bandage is an FDA-cleared chitosan-based flat bandage that controls severe arterial bleeding from traumatic injuries. In comparison to traditional bandages, the HemCon® Bandage provides superior control of bleeding, wound site adhesiveness, multiple injury site usage, biocompatibility and provides a barrier to infective agents.</description>
