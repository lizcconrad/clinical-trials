    <textblock>
      Aim: To explore

        -  the frequency of use of objective neuromuscular monitoring for assessment of depth of
           neuromuscular blockade in general anaesthesia

        -  the incidence of residual neuromuscular blockade, and

        -  the timing of reversal of the neuromuscular blockade at the end of anaesthesia.

      We will collect data from 7 Danish anaesthesia departments, using data from the Anaesthesia
      Information Management System (AIMS).
