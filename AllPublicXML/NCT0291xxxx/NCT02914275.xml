      This is a study to assess the immune (antibody) response and safety of a Seqirus split
      virion, inactivated Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (Seqirus QIV), in comparison with a US
      licensed 2016/2017 Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (comparator QIV) in a healthy pediatric

    <description>Noninferiority of Seqirus QIV compared to comparator QIV will be assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody geometric mean titer (GMT) for each viral strain included in the vaccines. The GMT ratio is defined as the geometric mean of the postvaccination HI titer for the US-licensed comparator QIV over the geometric mean of the postvaccination HI titer for Seqirus QIV.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days after last vaccination.</time_frame>
    <description>Noninferiority of Seqirus QIV compared to comparator QIV will be assessed by seroconversion rate (SCR) for each viral strain. SCR is defined as the percentage of subjects with either a prevaccination HI titer &lt; 1:10 and a postvaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40, or a prevaccination HI titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4-fold increase in postvaccination HI titer. For the SCR comparison, the difference between the SCR for each virus strain will be determined.</description>

    <description>The Seqirus study vaccine is a sterile, thimerosal-free suspension containing 60 mcg total hemagglutinin antigen per 0.5 mL (15 mcg each of the four recommended influenza strains for the Northern Hemisphere 2016/2017 influenza season). Subjects will receive one or two doses according to the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for the United States 2016-17 Influenza Season. Preferred sites for intramuscular injection are the anterolateral aspect of the thigh in infants 6 months through 11 months of age, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh (or the deltoid muscle of the arm if muscle mass is adequate) in children 12 months through 35 months of age, or the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm in children 36 months through 59 months of age.</description>
