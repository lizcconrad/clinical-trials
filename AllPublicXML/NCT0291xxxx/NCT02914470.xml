  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, 3+3, dose finding, open label, phase 1b clinical study of
      carboplatin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with atezolizumab.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The starting dose is carboplatin AUC 5mg/ml*min, cyclophosphamide 600mg/m2 and atezolizumab
      840 mg, all administered intravenously. One cycle is 28 days. On day 1 carboplatin,
      cyclophosphamide and atezolizumab will be administered. On day 15 atezolizumab only will be
      administered. Patients will be treated until loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable
      toxicities, or withdrawal of consent. It is expected that 6-12 patients will be enrolled,
      depending on safety issues observed.
