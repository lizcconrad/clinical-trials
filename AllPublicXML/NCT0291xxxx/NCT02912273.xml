    <description>measures the level of concern about falling during social and physical activities inside and outside the home whether or not the person actually does the activity. The level of concern is measured on a four point Likert scale (1=not at all concerned to 4=very concerned)</description>

    <description>-Participants will complete baseline primarily self-administered cancer-specific geriatric assessments and measures of neuropathy and pain, an abbreviated geriatric assessment with each follow-up clinic visit (generally every 3-4 weeks in patients receiving systemic therapy) for 6-months of follow-up and a final end-of-study assessment.</description>

    <intervention_name>Baseline Participant Assessment</intervention_name>
    <description>Section 1 contains demographic questions
Section 2 contains daily activity questions with multiple choice answers, multiple physical function questions, and if the participants has fallen and how many falls have occurred in the last 6 months
Section 3 has the participant list all medication
Section 4 contains several questions about participant health (lists of illnesses and indicate if illness interferes with their activities)
Section 5 contains several questions about participant fall concerns with answers ranging from 1=Not at all to 4=Very
Section 6 contains multiple questions asking about emotional distress/depression, fatigue, pain interference, pain intensity, and numbness and tingling</description>

    <description>Cognition: Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test which contains 6 questions that the provider will ask the participant. Form items 1-3, the response is either correct (score 0) or incorrect (score 1). For items 4-6, subtract one point for each error. Total score of 11 or greater indicates cognitive impairment (maximum score =28)
Trail Making Test Part B - consists of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. The circles include both numbers and letters; the participants draws lines to connect the circles in an ascending pattern, but with the added task of alternating between the numbers and letter. The test is timed.
Timed &quot;Up and &quot;Go - the provider measures the time in seconds it takes for the participant to stand up from a standard arm chair, walk a distance of 3 meters, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down again.</description>
