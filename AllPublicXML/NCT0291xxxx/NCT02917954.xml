  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canadian and international health care systems require solutions on how to address the needs
      of a relatively small population that take up a large portion of health care resources. In
      Ontario, 10% of the population accounts for 79% of total system costs, with similar trends
      found in other parts of Canada and internationally. Most high-cost users are seniors, older
      adults, with multiple chronic conditions and complex care needs who are living in the
      community. Beyond the cost issues, older adults experiencing multi-morbidity are at
      higher-risk of poor health outcomes and experience lower quality of life as compared to
      individuals experiencing single illness only.

      Since April 2013 the electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO) mobile application and
      portal, has undergone a multi-phased, user-centred design evaluation approach to develop a
      tool designed to meet the needs of older adults with complex care needs and their primary
      care providers. The ePRO tool is designed to collect person-centred, person-reported
      indicators to improve care by supporting primary care delivery and enhancing patient
      self-management.

      The ePRO tool includes two features: 1) My Goal Tracker and 2) Health Journal. My Goal
      Tracker allows patients and providers to collaboratively create goal-oriented patient
      care-plans, and helps patients to track outcomes related to their goals using a mobile
      device. The Health Journal allows patients, their caregivers and primary care providers to
      monitor patients' symptoms and outcomes. The ePRO tool was re-evaluated and modified
      following each previous study phase (I-IV). This project marks the final phase of the study
      in which the investigators will conduct a pragmatic trial of the ePRO tool in 8-16 Family
      Health Teams in Ontario through a stepped-wedge randomized trial with an embedded case study.
      In this evaluation of the tool the investigators will assess outcome, process and context
      measures to identify how the tool affects patients, providers and the system at
      point-of-care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pragmatic trial will take place at 8 Family Health Teams (FHTs) to a maximum of 16 FHTs
      in Ontario utilizing a stepped-wedge randomized method with an embedded case study of
      implementation at four sites. One of the case study sites will be an academic FHT, thus
      allowing the research team an opportunity to observe provider-patient interaction with the
      ePRO tool, without infringing upon the appointment itself. The research team will observe a
      maximum of 10 provider-patient goal-setting visits. Academic FHTs participate in the
      education of residents, and as such are equipped with a training room (video surveillance)
      that allows the opportunity to watch and listen to provider-patient encounters. The room will
      be used when the provider and patient discuss the ePRO tool. When patients become members of
      academic FHTs they are made aware their interactions may be observed. In the event that the
      participating FHT does not have a training room, a member of the research team will sit in on
      the provider-patient visit to observe their eRPO tool conversation. Additional consent will
      be obtained from the patient and provider prior to initiating the observational visit. In
      addition, the research team will attend FHT rounds at the identified case study sites (when
      appropriate) to observe and document how providers discuss and set goals in an
      interdisciplinary team environment. Using a stepped-wedge design, each FHT will receive the
      ePRO tool (intervention) but will be randomized on when in the stepped-wedge design they will
      receive the intervention. The stepped-wedge randomization will assign (through number
      generator or coin flip) each of the FHTs to either a: 1) 3 month control period and a 12
      month intervention period, or 2) 6 month control period and a 9 month intervention period;
      and their respective participants will be assigned accordingly.

      Providers and patients recruited at all sites will receive training on how to use the ePRO
      tool prior to the start of the trial. During the intervention period, patients will receive
      one-on-one training with a research assistant; and provider training will occur in a group
      setting. Training will be led by a member of the research team and will take between 30-60
      minutes. Patients and providers will also be provided with a manual and training video on how
      to use the tool and portal, and the patients will be offered refresher sessions (individual
      or group) every 3 months over the duration of the study.

      Following consent, all patients will complete pre and post surveys every 3 months (through
      control and intervention periods). Patients will also complete an additional survey at study
      closeout to capture tool usability feedback. We anticipate survey completion to take 20-35
      minutes.

      Additionally, patients are requested to attend a minimum of two schedule appointments with
      their provider during the study. The first (on-boarding) visit will have the patient and
      provider collaboratively discuss and set monitoring protocols for tracking. The second
      (off-boarding) visit, following the monitoring period, will allow patients and providers to
      privately discuss their experience with the ePRO tool, before participating in their
      respective focus group or interview. As was the case in our usability pilot and exploratory
      trial, we anticipate that patients will have additional appointments with their providers
      during the study at which point they can use the tool to discuss patient progress towards
      goals. All patients are requested to attend 4-5 scheduled appointments with their provider
      during the study. In accordance to earlier study phases on-boarding and off-boarding visits
      typically take 30 minutes. Other scheduled visits take between 10-30 minutes depending on the
      type of visit and provider they are seeing.

      Embedded within the pragmatic trial will be case studies of 4 intervention sites. Provider
      and patient participants at case sites will participate in post-intervention period
      semi-structured interviews to capture implementation enables and barriers. To adequately
      capture organizational level barriers and enablers we will additionally conduct
      semi-structured interviews with organizational leaders (executive directors and/or clinical
      leads). We will also collect relevant documents from all sites (i.e. organizational policies
      regarding the use of mobile applications or provider trainings and manuals in using
      technology as part of usual care).
