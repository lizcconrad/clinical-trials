  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia are risk factors for Alzheimer's
      disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Importantly, these risk factors are modifiable with
      lifestyle changes, pharmacological treatment, or both. The rrAD study will determine effects
      of aerobic exercise training and intensive vascular risk reduction on cognitive performance
      in older adults who have high risk for AD.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous lines of evidence suggest that interventions that confer therapeutic benefits for
      cardiovascular health are also associated with improvements in, or preservation of, cognitive
      function. Many believe &quot;What's good for the heart is good for the brain.&quot; However, stronge
      scientific evidence is needed to prove this hypothesis. The rrAD study is a 4-arm,
      multicenter, randomized trial to assess the effects of aerobic exercise training and
      intensive pharmacological reduction of vascular risk factors on cognitive performance in
      older adults who have high risk for AD, that is, those who have high blood pressure, family
      history of dementia or subjective memory complaints. Furthermore, rrAD will examine effects
      of exercise and vascular risk reduction on brain volume, perfusion, and neural network
      connectivity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
