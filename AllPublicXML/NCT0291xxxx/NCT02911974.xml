      This is a randomized prospective clinical study comparing a fine needle biopsy device and an
      aspiration needle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At EUS, once the pancreatic mass is identified, patients will be randomized to undergo
      sampling using the 22G FNA or FNB needle. All patients will undergo sampling of pancreatic
      masses using both needles but the needle to be used first will be based on randomization.
      Subsequent passes will be performed by alternate needles and once onsite diagnosis is
      established using either needle type, more passes will not be performed for onsite diagnostic
      adequacy. However, a minimum of at least one pass and a maximum of 8 passes will be performed
      using both needle types. The number of passes needed to achieve diagnostic adequacy using
      both needles will documented.

      Four dedicated passes will then be performed using the initial randomization sequence for
      cell block. Two passes will be performed using each needle type and the specimen will be
      preserved in formalin and sent for cell block processing.

      If the doctor cannot obtain enough tissue with the study needles, another needle with a
      different gauge (19 or 25) will be used. This will also be a maximum of 8 passes. Information
      about the number of needles used, how many passes were performed, any problems with the
      needles will be collected. If there is not enough tissue available from these passes to
      establish a diagnosis, the subject will be asked to come back at another time for a repeat
      procedure.

    <measure>The total area of procured tissue between the FNA and FNB needles</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study is to compare the total area of procured tissue between the FNA and FNB needles in patients undergoing EUS-guided sampling of pancreatic masses.
Pancreatic masses sampled using the FNB needle should have a tissue area greater than the FNA needle because of the serrated design of the FNB needle tip. This will be measured using a specialized digital image analysis software.
This hypothesis will be tested by comparing the total tissue area, tumor area within the tissue, stroma area within the tissue, tumor vs. stroma ratio and the macroscopic length of the procured tissue measured in millimeters. The total of these measurements will provide information about the area of procured tissue.</description>

    <measure>Diagnostic adequacy between the FNA and FNB needles</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective of this study is to compare the diagnostic adequacy between the FNA and FNB needles in patients undergoing EUS-guided sampling of pancreatic masses.
Pancreatic masses sampled using the FNB needle should yield diagnostic adequacy with fewer passes as they are expected to procure a greater area tissue than the FNA needle.
This hypothesis will be tested by comparing the number of passes required to establish a onsite diagnosis using both needle types in individual patients.</description>
