  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approx. 65% of resuscitated patients at the intensive care unit for internal medicine are due
      to myocardial infarction. Almost all patients are initially diagnosed and treated in the cath
      lab. Therapy usually consists of one or more stent implantations. After implantation of a
      coronary stent, dual platelet inhibition is necessary for 12 months. Insufficient platelet
      inhibition causes an pronounced increase in risk of stent thrombosis. Therefore, knowledge of
      the individual platelet function is valuable.

      Several factors potentially promote a delayed or reduced mode of action of platelet function
      inhibitors in resuscitated patients:

        1. oral administration is impossible and medication needs to be administered via a gastric
           line.

        2. gastric absorption is delayed after resuscitation

        3. according to current guidelines patients are treated with therapeutic hypothermia.
           Including the time of rewarming cooling period is ~48h

      Patients after successful resuscitation associated to a myocardial infarction will be
      included into the study the morning after the index event. Patients get dual platelet
      inhibition at the discretion of the interventionist. Patients are treated with therapeutic
      hypothermia according to the local Standard operating procedure for 24h and rewarming is
      performed within an additional 20h. Platelet function is measured every morning and Aspirin
      mediated as well as P2Y12 (purinergic G protein-coupled receptors-12)-inhibition mediated
      platelet function inhibition is recorded. All relevant clinical data including APACHE (Acute
      Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) and SOFA ( Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
      score) scores are collected.

      The degree of platelet inhibition over time (7 days) and differences between the three drugs
      tested will be evaluated by optical aggregometry and by using the commercial VerifyNow test
      system.
