    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial comparing conservative with surgical treatment (with open
      reduction and locking plate fixation) for proximal humeral fractures in patients aged more
      than 60 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different methods have been used in the treatment of proximal humeral fractures. Usually,
      treatment choice depends on fracture displacement, patient age, osteoporosis, and other
      characteristics. Locking plate fixation has become the most widely used method among surgical
      techniques, while partial arthroplasty is reserved for older patients and comminuted
      articular fractures. Generally, nonsurgical treatment involves a brief period with sling
      immobilization and physiotherapy rehabilitation.

      A recent multicenter study showed no difference between conservative and surgical treatments,
      including internal fixation with locking plates. Two other randomized studies showed mixed
      results, with no relevant clinical differences between the methods. No previous trial has
      evaluated the quality of reduction in surgically treated fractures and its relation to
      outcomes. Our study aims to compare both techniques with a detailed radiographic and
      tomographic evaluation, in elderly patients. We also aim to evaluate the influence of
      reduction and plate positioning on clinical outcomes. This is a single center trial, in which
      surgeries will be performed by only two experienced surgeons.
