    <textblock>
      Low serum bicarbonate levels, even within the normal laboratory range, are strongly
      associated with increased risks of hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular
      disease and death. The current proposal will investigate whether bicarbonate administration
      in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will improve the health and function of
      arteries and reduce the size of the left ventricle of the heart. Overall, the proposed
      research will provide important new scientific evidence upon which physicians can base
      recommendations to patients with CKD to decrease the risk of developing cardiovascular
      diseases.

    <description>Participants assigned to oral sodium bicarbonate will receive 0.5 mEq/kg-lean body weight (LBW)/day for the entire 12 months. Participants will take ½ the daily dose in the morning and the other ½ in the evening. The number of capsules will be rounded to the nearest whole capsule. To reduce pill burden and increase compliance the maximum number of pills per day will be six.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomly assigned to placebo will take the same number of capsules as if they were assigned to receive 0.5 mEq/kg-LBW/day of sodium bicarbonate. Participants will take ½ the daily dose in the morning and the other ½ in the evening. The number of capsules will be rounded to the nearest whole capsule. To reduce pill burden and increase compliance the maximum number of pills per day will be six.</description>
