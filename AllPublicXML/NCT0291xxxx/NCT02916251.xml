    <textblock>
      The trial is a single-centre, randomised, sequential, cross-over trial assessing
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses after micro-doses of ZP4207 (dasiglucagon*)
      administered subcutaneously to patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus under euglycaemic and
      hypoglycaemic conditions and compared to marketed glucagon.

      *dasiglucagon is the proposed International Nonproprietary Name (pINN) for ZP4207

      Seventeen (17) adult patients with T1DM treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
      (insulin pumps, CSII) will be randomized and take part at four dosing visits. The dosing
      visits are separated by 3-7 days. For the three lowest dose levels (0.03 mg, 0.08 mg, and 0.2
      mg) the patients will receive two doses of ZP4207(dasiglucagon) (the first at euglycaemic and
      the second at hypoglycaemic conditions) and one dose of glucagon at euglycaemic conditions at
      visit 2-4. The first two dose administrations (Day 1, visit 2-4) will be separated by at
      least five hours. The third dose, which is ZP4207(dasiglucagon) during hypoglycemia, will for
      all dosing visits be administered the next morning after a standardized carbohydrate-rich
      meal in the evening before. The patients will stay at the clinical site over night between
      Day 1 and Day 2. The dose of 0.6 mg will only be administered for ZP4207(dasiglucagon). The
      order of the micro-dose levels as well as the order of the treatment, ZP4207(dasiglucagon)
      vs. glucagon, will be randomized. For all patients the 0.6 mg dose of ZP4207(dasiglucagon)
      will be administered at visit 5.

      For each dose level there will be 2 sets of PK/PD profiles for ZP4207(dasiglucagon), one
      initiated during euglycaemia and another during hypoglycaemia. Each patient enrolled will
      therefore provide a total of 11 PK/PD profiles covering four different dose levels; 8
      profiles from ZP4207(dasiglucagon) and 3 profiles from glucagon

          2. Male and female patients with T1DM for at least 1 year, as defined by the American
             Diabetes Association1.

          3. Age between 18 and 64 years, both inclusive.

             screening.

          7. Weight between 60 kg and 90 kg, both inclusive.

          8. Patients in good health according to age (medical history, physical examination, vital
             signs, 12-lead ECGs, lab assessments), as judged by the Investigator.-

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria during screening evaluations will be
        excluded from trial participation:

          1. Unable to provide informed consent (e.g., impaired cognition or judgement).

          2. Patients with mental incapacity or language barriers which preclude adequate
             understanding or cooperation, who are unwilling to participate in the trial, or who in
             the opinion of the Investigator should not participate in the trial.

          3. Receipt of any medicinal product in clinical development within 3 months prior
             screening.

          4. Previous exposure to ZP4207(dasiglucagon) or previously randomized to this trial.

          5. Known or suspected allergy to trial product(s) or related products.

          6. History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea and

             by the Investigator.

          9. History of liver disease that is expected to interfere with the anti-hypoglycemia
             action of glucagon (e.g., liver failure or cirrhosis). Other liver disease (i.e.,
             active hepatitis, steatosis, active biliary disease, any tumor of the liver,
             hemochromatosis, glycogen storage disease) may exclude the patient if it causes
             significant compromise to liver function or may do so in an unpredictable fashion.

         10. Any history or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular, pulmonary, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal, metabolic, endocrinological (with the exception of conditions
             associated with diabetes mellitus), haematological, dermatological, neurological,
             osteomuscular, articular, psychiatric, systemic, ocular, gynaecologic (if female), or
             infectious disease, or signs of acute illness as judged by the Investigator.

         11. Clinically significant abnormal haematology, biochemistry or urinalysis screening
             tests, as judged by the Investigator. In particular, elevated liver enzymes (AST or

             normal).

         12. Hypertension with systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90
             mmHg (excluding white-coat hypertension; therefore, if a repeated measurement shows
             values within the range, the patient can be included in the trial); a heart rate at
             rest outside the range of 50-90 beats per minute.

         13. Clinically significant abnormal standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) after 5
             minutes resting in supine position at screening, as judged by the Investigator.

         14. Proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy and/or severe neuropathy, in particular
             autonomic neuropathy, as judged by the Investigator.

         15. Inadequate venous access as determined by trial nurse or physician at time of
             screening

         16. Any factors that, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator, would interfere with
             trial endpoints or the safe completion of the trial procedures.

         17. Severe hypoglycaemic events within one year prior to screening, as judged by the
             Investigator.

         18. Increased risk of thrombosis, e.g. patients with a history of deep leg vein thrombosis
             or family history of deep leg vein thrombosis, as judged by the Investigator.

         19. Significant history of alcoholism or drug abuse as judged by the Investigator or
             consuming more than 24 g alcohol per day for men, or more than 12 g alcohol per day
             for women.

         20. A positive result in the alcohol and/or urine drug screen at the screening visit.

         21. Habitual smoking, i.e., daily smoking or more than 7 cigarettes/week within the last 3
             months prior to screening. Patients have to accept refraining from smoking while at

             and occasional use of acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol within 2 weeks prior to
             randomization (and if female with the exception of hormonal contraception or
             menopausal hormone replacement therapy).

         27. Donation of blood or plasma in the past month, or in excess of 500 mL within 12 weeks
             prior to screening.

         28. Male who is sexually active and not surgically sterilized who or whose partner(s) is
             not using highly effective contraceptive methods (highly effective contraceptive
             measures include surgical sterilisation, hormonal intrauterine devices [coil], oral
             hormonal contraceptives, each in combination with spermicide-coated condoms), or who
             is not willing to refrain from sexual intercourse from the first dosing until the end
             of the trial (Visit 6).

         29. Females of childbearing potential who are pregnant (positive urine human chorionic
             gonadotropin [HCG]), breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant or are not using
             highly effective contraceptive methods (highly effective contraceptive methods are
             considered those with a failure rate less than 1% undesired pregnancies per year
             including surgical sterilisation, hormonal intrauterine devices (coil), oral hormonal
             contraceptives, sexual abstinence or a surgically sterilised partner). Females who are
             postmenopausal can participate in the study without using adequate contraceptive
             methods. Postmenopausal is defined as women aged &lt; 52 years and being amenorrheic for
             more than one year with serum FSH level &gt; 40 IU/L or aged &gt;= 52 years and being
             amenorrheic for less than one year and with serum FSH level &gt; 40 IU/L or aged &gt;= 52
             years being amenorrheic for more than one year.
