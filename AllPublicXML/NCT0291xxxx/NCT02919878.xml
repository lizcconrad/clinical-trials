      Phase II Study of Neo-adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy using infusional Gemcitabine followed by
      Surgery for Locally Advanced (T3 and T4 or Node positive) Rectal Adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Results of neo-adjuvant chemo-radiation for advanced rectal cancer have plateaued with
      pathological complete response rates of 10-20% in spite of the addition of new cytotoxic
      agents and/ or molecular targeted therapies. The combination of 5-fluorouracil and radiation
      produces effective sensitization but further improvements require assessment of other
      sensitizers to increase the pathological complete response rates. Gemcitabine has been used
      in combination with radiation for several GI cancers but few studies have examined its role
      in rectal cancer. This study will examine a combination of Gemcitabine and radiation as
      neo-adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal cancer to increase the pathological complete response
      (pCR) rate from the investigators traditional 6% to &gt; 40 %.

    <description>Pre-op chemo: Gemcitabine will be administered as continuous infusion IV over 24 hrs (100 mg/m2) weekly for 6 wks starting on day 1 of Radiotherapy (XRT).
XRT/ Intensity modulated radiotherapy(IMRT): 1.8 Gy/fx, 5 fractions/wk will be delivered. Pelvis will receive 45 Gy/25 fractions/5 wks with a boost dose of 5.4 Gy for T3 and 9 Gy for T4 to a cone down volume. The total tumor dose= 50.4 -54 Gy.
Post-op chemo: Standard 6 cycles of adjuvant Capecitabine (1250 mg/m2) PO twice per day on days 1-14 each cycle, (every 21 days) in patients who have a complete resection of rectal cancer and negative surgical margins.</description>
