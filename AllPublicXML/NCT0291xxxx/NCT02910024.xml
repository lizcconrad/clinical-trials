  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial investigates the
      effects of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) during the early rehabilitation after
      stroke. Patients with hemipresis will receive either sham or real iTBS over their affected
      hemispheres before occupational therapy for 8 days. Motor recovery is assessed one day after
      the intervention phase and three months after enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, rehabilitation of stroke with hemiparesis mainly includes physiotherapy and
      occupational therapy. Yet, the majority of patients retain movement impairment relevant for
      activities of daily living. One explanation for this deficit is the insufficient recovery of
      connectivity between brain regions after stroke. It is possible to modulate this process by
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using the protocol of intermittent
      theta-burst stimulation (iTBS). Previous data indicate that modulation of the motor cortex
      with iTBS enhances the effects of subsequent motor training. The present study aims at
      investigating whether daily repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over 8 days combined
      with subsequent physiotherapy leads to better motor recovery, compared with physiotherapy
      after sham stimulation. In the first weeks and after three months, motor function, degree of
      disability and quality of life are examined in order to evaluate the effects of iTBS in the
      rehabilitation of stroke patients.

      Amendment (approved by the Ethics-Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of
      Cologne, 20.12.2016): Specification of exclusion criteria.
