      Will meet the inclusion criteria of patients with unresectable esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma, divided into 2 groups randomly:

      Experimental group: radiotherapy combined with S-1 chemotherapy;

      control group: radiotherapy combined with S-1 chemotherapy for first to 14 days and 29 ~ 42
      days, plus cisplatin first 1~ 4 days and 29 ~ 33 days. Using IMRT radiotherapy.

      Two weeks after radiotherapy finish, two cycle adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 70 mg/m2 1~ 14
      days, or S-1 70 mg/m2 1~ 14 days, plus cisplatin 25mg/m2 1~ 4 days, 21 days for a cycle.

      Primary Outcome Measure is complete remission rate.

      Secondary Outcome Measures are overall survival (OS) and Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) and
      toxicity.
