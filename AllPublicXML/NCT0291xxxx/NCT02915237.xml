  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a multi-symptom disorder that is characterized by complex traits
      such as fatigue, headaches, joint pain, insomnia, and memory problems. With no treatment for
      GWI currently available, there is an urgent need to develop novel interventions to alleviate
      major GWI clinical complications. Recent evidence highlights the potential value of
      flavonoids, a subclass of organic chemical called polyphenols abundantly found in some plants
      and common dietary preparations, in helping relieve clinical complications in Veterans with
      GWI. The overall goal is to test whether daily consumption of commercially available Concord
      grape juice, which is very Flavonoid-rich, is effective for treating cognitive deficits and
      chronic fatigue in Veterans with GWI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a multi-symptom disorder that is characterized by complex traits.
      Clinical complications of GWI typically persist over long-term, cause significant pain and
      suffering, and interfere with the ability of affected Veterans to successfully integrate back
      into civilian society. There is no treatment for GWI and there is an urgent need to develop
      novel interventions either to resolve underlying GWI mechanisms, or to alleviate major GWI
      clinical complications.

      Recent Evidence highlights the potential value of flavonoids, a subclass of organic chemical
      called polyphenols that are abundantly found in some plants and common dietary preparations
      may help alleviate chronic fatigue and preserve cognitive functions. Based on this, the
      overall goal is to test whether the potential efficacy of dietary supplementation with a
      commercially available flavonoid-rich product, alleviates clinical complications in Veterans
      with GWI. In particular, the researchers propose a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled Phase I/IIA study to test the feasibility and potential efficacy of
      Concord grape juice dietary supplementation to treat cognitive deficits and chronic fatigue
      in Veterans with GWI.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Gulf War Veterans deployed to the Persian Gulf theatre between August 1990 and August
             1991. GWI will be defined according to the Kansas Case Definition. The Kansas Case
             Definition identifies 6 symptom domains and requires endorsement of moderately severe
             and/or multiple symptoms in at least 3 of those domains. To meet the case definition,
             the Veterans must also indicate that each symptom first became problematic during or
             within one year of the Gulf War.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals not meeting the inclusion criteria for Gulf War deployment and definition
             of GWI, or with conditions that might interfere with their ability to report their
             symptoms (e.g., drug use) are excluded.

          -  Additional exclusion criteria are current medical conditions that may explain the
             symptoms (diabetes, heart disease, among others) or significant current (in the past
             six months) unstable (requiring significant medication adjustments or hospitalization)
             psychiatric conditions, including suicidal or homicidal ideation, schizophrenia or
             bipolar disorder according to subject responses to the interview and review by the
             principal investigator.

          -  Subjects who usually consume abnormally high contents of dietary polyphenol based on a
             self-reported diet diary will be excluded.
