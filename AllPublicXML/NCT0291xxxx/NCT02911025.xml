      The purpose of this study is to monitor the effect of Clobazam on sleep and daytime alertness
      in people with Epilepsy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies show that patients with epilepsy frequently have disrupted sleep, as well as a
      high level of daytime sleepiness. This may be due to a sleep disorder, nighttime seizures
      that lead to disrupted sleep, and other abnormalities. Sleep complaints are widely reported
      among patients with various epilepsy syndromes.

      Anti-seizure treatments may affect sleep. Effects vary by type of medication and other health
      issues. Generally, with improvement of seizure control, the sleep cycle improves and becomes
      more regular. However, some anti-seizure medications have been associated with insomnia.
      There have been studies that looked at sleep in relation to some anti-seizure medications.
      However, there are no currently available published reports on the effect of Clobazam (Onfi)
      on sleep.
