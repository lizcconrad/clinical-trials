  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachytherapy as a monotherapy treatment is highly effective for localized prostate cancer,
      traditionally being delivered to the whole prostate gland. Lately, low dose rate (LDR)
      brachytherapy has been increasingly replaced by high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment
      schemes. While brachytherapy's oncologic outcomes are excellent, it is not without incidence
      adverse effects including urinary, rectal, and sexual toxicities that affect the patient's
      quality of life.

      This study will incorporate HDR monotherapy treatment option for early stages and favourable
      risk prostate cancer.

      Additionally, we aim to evaluate the role of focal HDR brachytherapy for well-defined disease
      based on multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). This approach may offer an option of reducing the
      treatment toxicities while maintaining oncologic outcomes when compared with whole-gland
      therapy. Advantages in quality of life could be exhibited in the form of reduced urinary
      discomfort and incontinence, rectal symptoms, and improved erectile and prostatic gland
      function. This study would be particularly relevant in the current era of earlier localized
      prostate cancer detection, where newer imaging modalities (e.g. mpMRI) become a routine
      component of patient care.
