    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the method of choice in breast cancer to perform the
      loco-regional staging and direct the treatment.

      European Guidelines (EUSOMA) currently recommend MRI for initial evaluation and assessement
      of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response, for breast cancer. The standard of care
      consists of realizing a MRI before the start of the NAC and another one after it's ended, six
      months later.

      There is currently no consensus on the realization of an interval MRI for early assessment of
      the chemosensitivity of the tumor. It would allow though alterations in the therapeutic
      regimen in the event of a non response. Similarly, there is no consensus on when this
      interval MRI should be performed.

      Some recent studies suggest that Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging is interesting
      for the evaluation of the early response. However, these are preliminary studies with
      quantitative measures realized by the region of interest (ROI) method. A response to
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in elevated values of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC).

      There is'nt any published data on the potential interest of breast MRI after a radiotherapy
      treatment and before the surgical treatment.

      Therefore, the expected benefits of this study are:

        -  to monitor the early modifications of the perfusion and diffusion parameters at the
           level of the tumor after radiotherapy, and correlate them to the histology of the
           surgical monster.

        -  to assess if MRI is able to objectivate the early signs of response after a radiotherapy
           neo-adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.

      This record is linked to the NCT02858934 record and will share the same cohort of patients
