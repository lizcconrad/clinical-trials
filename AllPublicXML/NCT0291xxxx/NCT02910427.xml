  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular disease is the second leading cause of death in Taiwan. Although stroke
      incidence and mortality decline steadily in Taiwan, its impact on medical cost, quality of
      life and neurological deficits remains extraordinary. Stroke incidence and mortality are also
      rising in the developed countries presumably due to a world-wide increase in prevalence of
      obesity and metabolic syndrome. Negative associations have been observed between high blood
      pressure, hyperglycemia and two major dietary cations in vegetables and dairy products:
      potassium and magnesium. Mean levels of dietary potassium and magnesium intake in Taiwan are
      much lower than those of dietary reference intake. Short term supplementation studies have
      demonstrated their effects in reducing blood pressure and degree of insulin resistance.
      However, long-term studies on cardiovascular events are lacking. Our previous long-term
      intervention trial in elderly veteran home showed a 41% reduction in cardiovascular mortality
      by simply switching regular cooking salt to potassium-enriched salt in kitchens. The
      investigators have previously observed an annual reduction of medical cost around $ 15,000 NT
      in the aforementioned veteran home trial. A multi-centered randomized controlled trial was
      carried out with three arms: (1) regular salt (Na salt), (2) potassium-enriched salt (K
      salt), and (3) potassium and magnesium-enriched salt (K/Mg salt). The objectives of this
      study was to investigate whether potassium and magnesium-enriched salt would improve the
      neurological performance of the stroke patients.The investigators anticipate to observe
      beneficial effect from consuming potassium and magnesium enriched salt for neurological
      improvement in stroke patients.
