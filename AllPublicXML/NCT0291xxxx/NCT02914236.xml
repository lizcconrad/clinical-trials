      Evaluation of the Aerin Medical Device used for the treatment of nasal obstruction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-significant risk, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of the Aerin Medical device (Vivaer Stylus) when used to deliver
      radiofrequency (RF) energy to the nasal valve area to improve symptoms in those diagnosed
      with nasal airway obstruction.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in NOSE Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score from baseline to 26 weeks post-study procedure. Improvement (baseline score - 26-week score) is signified by a positive value.
The Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale is a validated disease-specific health status outcomes instrument, used to assess severity of nasal obstruction symptoms. Score ranges from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate increased symptoms/symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>NOSE Responder Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percent subjects who are responders to therapy; responder is defined as a treated subject who experiences at least a 15-point improvement in NOSE score from baseline to 26 weeks post treatment.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events (Safety)</measure>

    <description>Characterization of the type and frequency of treatment-related adverse events reported during or following the study procedure, throughout the follow-up period.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject-reported Pain Related to the Study Procedure, as Reported on 100mm Visual Analog Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after study procedure, 4-weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Procedure-related pain as reported by the subject using a 100mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS), immediately post-procedure and at the 4-week follow-up visit. Higher scores indicate more severe pain.
The Pain VAS is presented to the subject as a 100mm line anchored on each end by verbal descriptors: 0 = no pain and 100 = worse pain imaginable. The distance between 0 and the vertical mark made by the subject is measured and the result is expressed in millimeters.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Study-specific survey to assess patient satisfaction with the discomfort of the procedure and recovery period, as well as their perceived results. The survey included 5 questions related to tolerability of the procedure, ease of recovery, change in breathing, satisfaction with treatment, and willingness to recommend treatment. Each question was scored on a 10-point scale, with 1 indicating the most negative response to the question (e.g., &quot;very bad&quot;, &quot;much worse&quot;, or &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;) and 10 indicating the most favorable rating (e.g., &quot;hardly noticeable&quot;, &quot;much better&quot;, or &quot;very satisfied&quot;). Each question was individually scored and reported.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Seeking treatment for nasal obstruction and willing to undergo an office-based
             procedure

          -  Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score of â‰¥ 60 at Baseline

          -  Nasal valve is a primary or significant contributor to the subject's nasal obstruction
             as determined by the study investigator (based on clinical presentation, physical
             examination, nasal endoscopy, etc.) and the subject has a positive response to any of
             the following temporary measures (based on patient history or office exam):

          -  Use of external nasal dilator strips (e.g., Breathe Right Strips)

          -  Q-Tip test (manual intranasal lateralization)

          -  Use of nasal stents

          -  Cottle Maneuver (manual lateral retraction of the cheek)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior surgical treatment of the nasal valve

          -  Rhinoplasty, septoplasty, inferior turbinate reduction or other surgical nasal
             procedures within the past twelve (12) months

          -  Chronic sinusitis, recurrent sinusitis, or allergies leading to nasal obstruction

          -  Septal deviation, turbinate hypertrophy, polyps, or ptotic nose tip believed to be a
             significant contributor to the subject's nasal obstruction symptoms

          -  Known or suspected allergies or contraindications for any general or local anesthetic
             agents and / or any antibiotic medications

          -  Known or suspected to be pregnant, or is lactating

          -  Other medical conditions which in the opinion of the investigator could predispose the
             subject to poor wound healing or increased surgical risk

        <description>Study-specific survey to assess patient satisfaction with the discomfort of the procedure and recovery period, as well as their perceived results. The survey included 5 questions related to tolerability of the procedure, ease of recovery, change in breathing, satisfaction with treatment, and willingness to recommend treatment. Each question was scored on a 10-point scale, with 1 indicating the most negative response to the question (e.g., &quot;very bad&quot;, &quot;much worse&quot;, or &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;) and 10 indicating the most favorable rating (e.g., &quot;hardly noticeable&quot;, &quot;much better&quot;, or &quot;very satisfied&quot;). Each question was individually scored and reported.</description>

      <desc>All subjects were queried for adverse events after the procedure and at each follow-up visit. Details of events were documented on a standardized case report form. Anticipated observations in the treatment area (such as swelling, redness, or crusting related to the treatment of tissue with radiofrequency energy) were not considered adverse events unless they required mitigation or were greater in severity, duration or degree of incidence than expected.</desc>
