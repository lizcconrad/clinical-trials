  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchial asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by chronic airway inflammation,
      which is a common and frequently occurring disease in the world, and has resulted in a
      sustained increase of social and economic burden. However, several studies suggest, lots of
      asthma patients did not get their asthma controlled. The investigators study showed that in
      China only 28.7% of asthma patients achieve asthma controlled during 2007-2008. In recent
      years, application softwares of mobile-phones for asthma have gradually increased, studies
      suggested that application of these application softwares can make treatment more standard,
      reduce asthma attacks, help patients to control their asthma, improve adherence and these
      application softwares also show many other advantages. This study is a prospective, multi
      center, randomized, controlled study, aims to evaluate the efficacy of application softwares
      in asthma patients, provide a new tool to asthma management.
