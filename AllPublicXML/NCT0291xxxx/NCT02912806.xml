    <textblock>
      Evolving reimbursement policies are driving health systems to improve quality and efficiency.
      Transitioning to an electronic health record (EHR) provided Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical
      Center (DHMC) an opportunity to redesign staff roles and care path for Total Knee Replacement
      (TKR). The organization implemented a coordinated team-based care delivery model that
      integrated real-time measurement of: (1) compliance with trusted guidelines, (2) process of
      Shared Decision-Making (SdM), and (3) use of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs). The
      investigators present the implementation protocol and data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient-reported outcome measures were completed 1 month preceding TKR and also at 1 and 12
      months following surgery. The primary outcome was change in physical function from baseline
      to 1-year following surgery in the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the Veterans-Rand
      (VR-12) Survey. Preoperative measures were: (1) general demographics (patient age, sex,
      height, weight, body mass index (BMI); (2) treatments tried before surgery; (3) health habits
      (tobacco use, alcohol use); (4) pre-existing medical conditions (Charlson score); (5)
      physical exam findings (knee range of motion, knee laxity); (7) lab tests (hemoglobin); and
      (7) radiographic measures (severity of osteoarthritis on standing x-rays). Secondary outcomes
      included Physical Score (PS) of the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System
      Global Survey (PROMIS-10), knee function (Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, KOOS), safety
      (reoperations, readmissions, emergency visits, and infection) and measures of patient
      experience (Clinician Group and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and
      Systems).

      <doc_comment>The Center for Surgical Innovation at Dartmouth (CSI) website (http://dartmouth-hitchcock.org/csi) will provide de-identified study data to any researchers interested in evaluating new hypotheses or confirming hypotheses within this study, or professors wishing to use the database for classroom purposes. The website provides the data dictionary for the study cohort, an accompanying document that describes the data structure, and general guidelines regarding how to request the data. The Methodology Core for the Dartmouth/NIH NIAMS Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center for Musculoskeletal Diseases (MCRC) will evaluate submitted applications and, when necessary, work with the applicants to clarify the project aims. Upon approval, the MCRC will provide the applicant with a secure data set that includes all of the variables the researchers and the MCRC evaluation committee determine are necessary and data in the statistical format (SAS, STATA, SPSS, or R) selected by users.</doc_comment>
