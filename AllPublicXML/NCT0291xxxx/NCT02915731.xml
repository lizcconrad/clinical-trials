      This study will assess total body vitamin A pool size, as well as liver vitamin A stores, by
      means of stable isotope dilution in preschool children from a South African community where
      liver, an exceptionally rich source of vitamin A, is frequently eaten, and the children
      exposed to vitamin A fortified staple foods, as well as a vitamin A supplementation
      programme.

    <textblock>
      Serum retinol, the most commonly used indicator to assess vitamin A status, is
      homeostatically controlled and, although it is able to detect deficiency, it does not
      necessarily reflect liver stores or measure excessive vitamin A intake. The stable isotope
      dilution method is able to measure total vitamin A body pool size over the vitamin A status
      continuum, including the sub-toxic range,and would add valuable information about the vitamin
      A status in a community where liver (an exceptionally rich source of vitamin A) is frequently
      eaten, and children also exposed to other vitamin A interventions. Total body vitamin A will
      be assessed before and 4 weeks after a high dose vitamin A supplement given to the children
      as part of the national vitamin A supplementation program. The confounding effect of
      infection/inflammation on the biomarkers of vitamin A status will also be examined, as well
      as how serum retinol and retinol binding protein relate to each other, and to vitamin A pool
      size.
