      Summary of Proposed Research:

      This project will involve four controlled 4 wk feeding periods in individuals with metabolic
      syndrome (currently 1/3 of US adults). After a 2 wk run-in period, 20 subjects will be fed
      one of three diets in a randomized and balanced order: a typical American High-Carb diet high
      in cheese (6 oz/day), a High-Carb diet low in cheese (0 oz/day), or a Moderate-Carb,
      high-cheese diet (6 oz/day), Low-Carb, high cheese where cheese displaces an isocaloric
      amount of carbohydrate. There will be a 2 wk washout period separating trials during which
      subjects consume their normal diet. Specific menus will be designed for each feeding phase
      and all food will be prepared for subjects. Testing will occur at baseline and after each
      feeding period. Measures of cholesterol beyond standard LDL- and HDL-cholesterol will be done
      by examining lipoprotein particle size, apolipoproteins, and fatty acid composition [i.e.,
      accumulation of saturated fat in blood and tissues, palmitoleic acid (highly linked to
      cardiovascular disease), and detection of phytanic acid (a uniquely bioactive fatty acid in
      dairy fat)]. Changes in whole body and regional fat, including measures of visceral fat and
      liver fat, will be examined non-invasively by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
