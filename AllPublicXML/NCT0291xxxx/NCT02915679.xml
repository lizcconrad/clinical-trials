  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, almost 1 death on 50 is a suicide. The suicide occurs in unbearable psychic pain
      where mental trouble has a major influence. It is classified as preventable mortality.
      According to interpersonal psychological theory of suicide, the repeated exposition to
      stressful and painful events (as physical abuse) would facilitate suicide attempt through the
      increased pain tolerance. The social pain (or psychical pain on the broader sense) and
      physical pain are closely linked.

      The investigators hypothesize that the measure of painful perception will be significantly
      superior on suicidals attempters compared to non-attempters. It will be the case for recent
      suicide attempters and former suicide attempters, suggesting a suicidal vulnerability trait.
      Moreover, the investigators expect that social distress induced by a social exclusion
      paradigm will be significantly superior on suicide attempters compared to non-attempters.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the physical and psychic pain on depressed subjects
      with or without history of suicide attempts.

      After a clinical evaluation (psychiatric symptomatology, personality trait, suicidal
      dimension), subjects will be submitted to a painful thermic stimulation and will participate
      at a computer test of social exclusion (named Cyberball).
