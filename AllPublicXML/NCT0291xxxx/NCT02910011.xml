  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and clinical efficacy of a novel doxycycline topical
      formulation in subjects with Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The investigators hypothesize that daily
      application of the study drug in AD subjects will reduce severity of the disease, by reducing
      skin driven inflammation and restoring skin barrier function. The investigators will also
      monitor the anti-microbial activity of this product on AD skin, as colonization with Staph
      aureus is typically associated with disease severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease, affecting about 17% of
      children and 6% adults in the USA , . AD is characterized by skin barrier disruption, an
      aberrant adaptive immune response (i.e., Th2 polarized) to environmental allergens,
      susceptibility to cutaneous bacterial infections and intractable itch , . The intense
      pruritus and cutaneous infections contribute to the morbidity of AD and are major drivers of
      the reduced quality-of-life associated with this disease , . In the World Health Organization
      2010 Global Burden of Disease survey, AD has ranked first among common skin diseases . So
      far, AD treatments have targeted inflammation with the widespread use of topical and more
      intermittent use of systemic corticosteroids. In summary, despite its high prevalence,
      effects on quality-of-life and economic burden - there are few effective treatments for AD.

      Doxycycline are tetracycline antibiotics broadly used systemically to treat
      inflammatory-dermatologic conditions. Several studies in human and animal models have shown
      doxycycline have anti-inflammatory and pro-healing properties, mainly by blocking tissue
      proteolytic activity. Doxycycline have been reported to nonselectively inhibit members of the
      metalloproteinases (MMP) superfamily [reviewed in , ]. In addition to this direct inhibitory
      activity, doxycycline indirectly prevents tryptic kallikreins activation by MMPs . Growing
      body of evidence suggests that the tetracycline might also directly downregulate Protease
      Activator receptor (PAR)-2 expression and function, which was also found to play a role in
      induction of local inflammatory mediators . Importantly, the doxycycline antimicrobial
      activity could lead to reduced Staphylococcus infection/colonization in AD skin, a known
      trigger of AD flares
