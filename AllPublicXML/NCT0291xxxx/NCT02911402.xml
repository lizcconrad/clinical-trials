  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sea sickness syndrome is present for 80% of persons on board when the boat rotation missions
      Astrolabe, sometimes there is a risk of very significant dehydration. A special unit
      specialized in the fundamental study of the vestibular system (inner ear), sensory organ at
      the base of visual-vestibular conflict inducing this syndrome, also provides medical support
      for parabolic flights (flight reproducing weightlessness) where this syndrome is strongly
      present. The goal of the study is to assess the frequency of occurrence of this sea sickness
      syndrome on the Astrolabe, to understand the triggers (type of boat movements, personality
      traits, anxiety / stress) without changing habits on board for those on board taking a
      antinaupathique treatment given by the ship's doctor. This study will be done in
      collaboration between INSERM U 1075 (France) and the Laboratory of military research VIPER
      specialized in extreme environments (Belgium). The ultimate goal will be to provide the best
      recommendations and the best treatment regimen to alleviate as best as possible the symptoms
      of people on board of the Astrolabe so scientists on board can perform their work.
