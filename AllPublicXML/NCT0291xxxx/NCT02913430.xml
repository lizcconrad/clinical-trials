      To study progression free survival for treatment with Fulvestrant compared to treatment with
      tamoxifen in Metastatic Breast Cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to compare progression-free survival (PFS) in fulvestrant and
      tamoxifen arms in patients unselected by ESR1 mutation, and in the subset of patients with
      ESR1-mt tumors assessed primarily from ctDNA at enrollment.

      Patients with ER+ breast cancer who had 1 to 3 prior lines of endocrine therapy and up to one
      line of chemotherapy for MBC, excluding fulvestrant and tamoxifen, will be randomized in a
      1:1 ratio to receive fulvestrant 500mg IM Q28 days with one extra dose on D15 of the first
      cycle (as a loading dose) or tamoxifen 20mg PO daily.

    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from time of randomization to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first. PFS for a subject without an event will be censored on the date of last tumor assessment. If an interval of 6 months passes without a tumor assessment, PFS will be censored at the time of the earlier tumor assessment, even if an event (progressive disease or death) is later observed.</description>
