    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of FAB117-HC
      (a medicinal product containing human allogeneic adipose derived adult mesenchymal stem cells
      expanded and pulsed with H2O2, HC016 cells) administered at a single-time point to patients
      with acute thoracic traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). The study will also include initial
      exploration of potential clinical efficacy. Dose levels of 20 million and 40 million cells
      will be administered.

    <textblock>
      FAB117-HC is an investigational medicinal product whose active substance is HC016, allogeneic
      adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells expanded and pulsed with H2O2.

      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single
      administration of FAB117-HC using: a) two sequential escalating doses administered between 72
      and 120 hours post-injury, to patients with acute traumatic SCI with AIS grade A; and b) the
      determined maximum tolerated dose administered between 48 and 72 h post-injury to patients
      with ASIA Impairment Scale (AIS) grading of A or B. The study includes also initial
      exploration of efficacy.

      Treatment is administered by intramedullary injection into the injured spinal cord, during
      the decompression and stabilization surgery (DSS) of the fracture. DSS is routinely performed
      on almost all SCI patients.

      The study has been divided into two phases:

      Phase 1 (open label): 6 AIS A patients with lesion located between D5 and D10 will be
      included in 2 sequential cohorts.

      Phase 2 (randomized, controlled, double-blind): 40 AIS A or B patients with lesion located
      between D1 and D12, will be randomly divided into two groups (control and treated) that will
      be balanced in AIS grade.
