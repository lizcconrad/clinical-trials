  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this research program is to develop and examine the impact of a Cancer
      virtual peer-to-peer (VP2P) Support Program on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in
      adolescents with cancer (AWC). In the current proposal, the feasibility of trialing the
      Skype-based VP2P program providing peer-support from mentors and the magnitude of program
      effect estimates will be evaluated in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT). This pilot RCT
      will enable us to refine the program and determine the appropriate sample size for a future
      large-scale RCT, which will compare the effectiveness of VP2P to a waitlist control group at
      a major Children's Oncology Group- affiliated centers in Canada and the United States.

      The aim of this project is to develop and examine the impact of a virtual peer support
      program on health outcomes and quality of life of adolescents with cancer using a waitlist
      randomized controlled trial. In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in the
      experimental group will receive a manualized peer mentorship program that will provide
      modelling and reinforcement by trained young adults aged 18-25 years who have learned to
      function successfully with their pain. Mentoring sessions consist of 10 sessions of 30-45
      minute Skype calls over 8 weeks. Feasibility of the program will be measured in addition to
      quality of life, physical and emotional symptoms, pain coping, self-efficacy, social support,
      and self-management skills.

    <description>The mentorship program will encourage mentored participants to develop and engage in self-management and transition skills and support their practice of these skills. The mentors will present information to mentored participants in a monitored virtual interaction using Skype for 8 weeks (10 total Skype sessions of 45 minutes each) to encourage participation in skill building tailored to their needs. All mentors will complete a paid 1.5 day training course and will be supported throughout the duration of the study (consultations with research staff to deal with unforeseen concerns). Mentored participants will complete online outcome measures prior to randomization (T1) and upon study completion (T2).</description>
