  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute otitis media (AOM), defined as acute inflammation in the middle ear, is a leading cause
      of health encounters and antimicrobial prescriptions in children worldwide. Diagnosis of AOM
      is often dependent on a brief view of the tympanic membrane in an uncooperative child's ear
      canal. As a consequence, AOM may be inappropriately diagnosed when visualization of the
      tympanic membrane (ear drum) is not optimal. Improved methods for visualizing the tympanic
      membrane including capturing still images and recording video of the ear exam would be
      beneficial in the diagnosis and management of otic complaints, including acute and chronic
      otitis media. Use of a smartphone otoscope has the potential to optimize clinician ability to
      manage otic complaints, visualize the tympanic membrane, and support antimicrobial
      stewardship. This study will be conducted as a randomized control study in two affiliated
      children's hospital emergency departments. Twenty volunteer clinicians will be randomly
      assigned to use either a smartphone otoscope or a conventional otoscope for all otic
      examinations for a 6-month period.

      A smartphone otoscope (CellScope-Oto) is a pocket size attachment that employs the technology
      and light source of a smartphone to capture reproducible images of the ear canal and tympanic
      membrane. Previous studies with this device demonstrated that images taken with both the
      smartphone otoscope and a camera-fitted conventional analogue otoscope were equivalent with
      respect to image quality and that the smartphone otoscope was acceptable as an educational
      and diagnostic tool to health professional students. A pilot study with a similar design to
      this study conducted in two offices of an ambulatory pediatric clinic demonstrated a trend
      toward decreased antimicrobial prescription filling among families whose children were
      examined with the smartphone otoscope compared to those who were examined with a conventional
      otoscope. To further assess this trend, this study proposes an evaluation of the impact of
      device use on antimicrobial prescribing for children with an otic complaint in a pediatric
      emergency department (PED) setting. This study will enroll 20 clinicians for the 6-month
      study period; 10 who will be randomly assigned to use a smartphone otoscope for the 6-month
      study period and 10 who will be assigned to use a conventional otoscope for all otoscopic
      exams. Data will be abstracted via retrospective review of the electronic medical record of
      encounters in with an otoscopic exam was performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation.

    <description>Clinicians randomized to use the smartphone otoscopic device will complete a survey to assess the acceptability of this device compared to the conventional otoscope. The survey, developed specifically for this study, asks clinicians to report how often they anticipate choosing to use the smartphone otoscope in the future, whether the recorded images were shared with patients and colleagues or added to the medical record, the ease of use, the usefulness of the device to aid in providing accurate diagnoses, and the perceived impact on antimicrobial prescribing.</description>
