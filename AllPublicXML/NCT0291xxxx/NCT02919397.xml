  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this feasibility trial is to assess the effectiveness of a wearable
      technology and an e-diabetes prevention programme delivered via a smartphone application,
      including motivational messaging, in reducing weight and increasing physical activity in
      people at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      The study will examine whether a wearable technology, combined with biofeedback, motivational
      messaging and an e-diabetes prevention programme, is effective in reducing weight and
      increasing physical activity after 12 months.

      The intervention will consist of a wearable technology and a smartphone application made
      available for a 12 month period. 22 online multimedia sessions targeting diet, physical
      activity and mental resilience delivered via the smartphone application. Motivational
      messaging based on the diabetes prevention module content and biofeedback will be sent to
      participants via the application.

      The control group will receive the wearable technology and will have access to a smartphone
      application detailing their activity. Participants will be directed to the same educational
      material as is made available via the multimedia sessions, but will not receive motivational
      messages.
