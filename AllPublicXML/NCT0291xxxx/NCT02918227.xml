    <textblock>
      Every year in France, more than 60 000 people are operated for benign prostatic hyperplasia
      (BPH). This surgery is accompanied by a change or even a loss of ejaculations externalized
      what constitutes the main constraint for patients. Empirically, the investigators talk to the
      patient &quot;retrograde ejaculation&quot; to explain a possible loss of ejaculation. Yet the
      underlying mechanism of this modification or loss of ejaculation remains completely unknown.
      Yet the underlying mechanism of this modification or loss of ejaculation remains completely
      unknown. No study could not determine whether the predominant mechanism was a real retrograde
      ejaculation or aspermia. Moreover, technical changes are sometimes tempted to preserve
      antegrade ejaculation but no scientific rationale can not validate.
