  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Only a few clinical trials evaluating the potential benefits of exercise have been conducted
      in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer and, no prior studies have evaluated the
      potential effects of 'cybercycling' (exergaming on a stationary bike) in AYA cancer
      survivors. Therefore, the study aims to conduct a pilot trial to determine feasibility
      (adherence, user acceptance) and to explore potential effects of a 'cybercycling' exercise
      program on fitness, body composition, quality of life, sleep and cognition.

      Objectives Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility (adherence; user acceptance: exercise
      tolerance, enjoyment and motivation) of performing an adaptive, moderate intensity, aerobic
      exercise program on a 'cybercycle' compared to control (stretching/resistance bands) in
      adolescent and young adults (AYA) with cancer.

      (Exploratory) Aim 2: To explore the effects of an adaptive, moderate intensity aerobic
      exercise program using a 'cybercycle' compared to control (stretching/resistance bands) on
      changes in fitness, body composition, quality of life (QoL), fatigue, sleep and cognition.

      Study Design/Overview:

      This study is a randomized trial in 20 adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors
      (15-30 years old) which will comparing two intervention arms: 1) aerobic exercise on a
      'cybercycle' (stationary cycling with exergaming/videogaming); and, 2) a
      stretching/resistance band 'control' condition.

    <description>All exercise training will be performed under the supervision of a qualified exercise trainer certified in Advanced Cardiac Life Support. Patients in the exercise groups will be asked to perform aerobic exercise on a stationary bike ('cybercycle') 3 days per week for 12 weeks. Exercise intensity and duration will be based on a progressive program and adapted, as needed, based on the patient's tolerability. Heart rate will be monitored throughout the exercise session and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) monitored at least every 10 minutes. The target heart rate (THR) zone will be determined using the Karvonen formula.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the control condition will receive a progressive resistance training program with TheraBands™ and a stretching program to complete at home 2 days/week for 12 weeks. The resistance band program will include upper body and lower body exercises. Patients will be provided with two different colored resistance bands (one lighter colored for easier resistance; one darker colored for a harder resistance). Patients will be instructed to start by completing 1-2 sets, 2 days/week with the easier/lighter band for the first 4 weeks, progress to 2-3 sets, 2 days/week with the easier band for the next 4 weeks; and, then, progress to 1-2 sets with the darker/harder band for the last 4 weeks. In addition, all patients in the 'control' condition will be advised to conduct upper body and lower body stretches 2 days/week. All resistance band exercises and stretches will be demonstrated to the patient by the exercise physiologist before the 12 week program begins.</description>
