  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is sub-study to a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, and
      single-centre trial investigating the effect of liraglutide on body weight and pain in
      overweight or obese patients with knee osteoarthritis (NCT02905864).

      In the parent trial patients will be subjected to a run-in diet intervention phase (week -8
      to 0) including a low-calorie diet and dietetic counselling. At week 0 patients will be
      randomised to receive either liraglutide 3 mg or liraglutide 3 mg placebo as an add-on to
      dietetic guidance on re-introducing regular foods and a focus on continued motivation to
      engage in a healthy lifestyle.

      This sub-study of the parent trial only involves an additional assessment of skin auto
      fluorescence (AGE concentration) in the preallocation phase and in the main trial phase, i.e.
      from enrollment (defined as signature of informed consent) to treatment allocation (visits
      -Tx and T0 in the parent trial visit schedule) and from allocation to end of trial (visits T0
      and T15 in the parent trial visit schedule).
