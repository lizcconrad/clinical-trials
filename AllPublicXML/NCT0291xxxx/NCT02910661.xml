      The overall goal of the Teen Adherence in KidnEy transplant Improving Tracking TO Optimize
      Outcomes (TAKE-IT TOO) study is to adapt the successful TAKE-IT intervention, aimed at
      improving medication adherence in adolescent kidney transplant, for use in 'real world'
      clinical care. The specific aims of Stage 1 of this study are: (1) To understand the needs
      and preferences of stakeholders (kidney transplant recipients, parents, and healthcare
      professionals (HCP)) in order to optimize the TAKE-IT intervention for 'real world' use.

    <textblock>
      TAKE-IT TOO is a prospective, 3-stage, sequential study using user-centered design techniques
      throughout. This entry describes Stage 1of TAKE-IT TOO. In Stage 1 we will conduct focus
      groups (FG) to gather data about the needs and preferences of stakeholders to inform
      adaptation of the Teen Adherence in Kidney transplant Effectiveness of Intervention Trial
      (TAKE-IT) intervention and features of a novel e-pillbox and adherence-tracking website. The
      protocols for Stages 2 and 3 will be submitted separately.

    <description>Focus groups (n=6-8/group) will be conducted at 4 sites selected to maximize racial diversity and to ensure availability of adequate numbers in each age group (Montreal (incl. the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC), Centre Hospitalier Universitaire-Ste. Justine &amp; CHUM ), Pittsburgh, Seattle, and St. Louis). Separate focus groups will be conducted with patients clustered by patient age to maximize homogeneity in developmental stage. Purposive sampling will be employed to ensure that each focus group includes patients with combinations of characteristics that are likely to account for variation in perspectives, including the major racial and ethnic groups, both sexes, time since transplant, and level of adherence.</description>

    <description>One focus group of healthcare professionals (HCP) representing the variety of multidisciplinary transplant team members at each center will be convened. We will aim for 4-8 HCP per group; however, the number will be dictated by the composition and size of the transplant team at each site. We expect variability in the organization of care across the 7 sites, which represent 2 countries and small to large program sizes; including all sites will capture this variability.</description>

    <description>Concurrently at each site, an experienced facilitator, having no direct affiliation with the clinical team, will use standardized stakeholder-specific, semi-structured scripts (designed with patient and parent collaborators) to conduct the patient, parent, and HCP focus groups. The TAKE-IT intervention will be described, and Simplemed e-pillbox shown, to all focus groups. Questions posed to the patient and parent focus groups will focus on 2 themes: the intervention and electronic monitoring. Example stakeholder-specific scripts to guide the discussions are appended. Each focus group will last ~90 min. and be audio-recorded. An observer will take field notes.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data generated will be available for use to other investigators in the research community. Data may be used for hypothesis testing, and to generate preliminary data in support of future research projects. A Data Sharing Committee, composed site investigators will review requests submitted for use of the data. If the request is approved, the appropriate data analysis will be performed and the results sent to the requesting investigator. Alternatively, depending on the request, it may be more appropriate to provide the requesting investigator with certain segments of the data. If this is the case, a file of the requested data (de-identified) will be provided to the investigator.</ipd_description>
