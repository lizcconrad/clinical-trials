  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has been the only treatment for PBC approved by US and European
      drug administrations. Long-term use of UDCA (13â€”15 mg/kg/day) in patients with PBC improves
      serum liver biochemistries and survival free of liver transplantation.

      However, about 40% of patients do not respond to UDCA optimally as assessed by known criteria
      for biochemical response. Those patients represent the group in need for additional
      therapies, having increased risk of disease progression and decreased survival free of liver
      transplantation. And UDCA has less effect on PBC patients whose pathology stage 3-4. Liver
      fibrosis might jeopardize the UDCA effect. Fuzhenghuayu is a Chinese traditional medicine for
      liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Both lab research and some clinical studies suggest that
      Fuzhenghuayu could significantly reverse liver fibrosis and cirrhosis due to different kind
      of etiology. Here the investigators start a random, open and parallel clinical research to
      explore the effect of Fuzhenghuayu combined with UDCA in the PBC treatment.
