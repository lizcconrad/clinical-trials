  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the investigators study is to evaluate the efficacy of infographics in
      presenting information, in terms of understanding and remembering research results, compared
      to standard PLS formats and scientific summary formats (SciSum).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) with three different formats
      of the same systematic review summary (infographics, PLS and scientific summary). The content
      of these three formats is based on the same systematic review, but the ways of data
      presentation will differ: visual presentation, plain language, and scientific language. The
      trial will be performed at the beginning of the 2016/2017 academic year, with first year
      university students as participants. The trial will be voluntary and anonymous. The survey
      will consist of 4 parts: 1) demographic data, 2) one format of the summary (randomly
      assigned), 3) comprehension test of the information given in the summary, 4) accessibility of
      information and overall satisfaction with the given summary assessed by survey and 5) health
      numeracy test. All materials will be in Croatian. The materials used in this research will be
      assessed by experts in order to confirm face validity of developed questions.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is the score on a understanding test with ten questions about information contained in all three forms of presentation, titled as &quot;Understanding information about external cephalic version for breech presentation before term&quot; (Hutton et al, 2015). The questions will focus on understanding the benefits and risks of the intervention and the quality of evidence described in the systematic review. Each correctly answered question will be awarded one point, with a maximum of 10 points. The scale was specifically designed for this research, they ask about the information contained in all three abstract format and all questions are open-ended.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reading experience</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This section of the survey will include 5 questions about the experience of participants about the text they read, measured on a 10-point Likert type scale, where 1 means do not agree at all and 10 means fully agree. The total score is the sum of scores on all five answers (maximum 50).</description>

    <measure>Accessibility of relevant information</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This section of the survey will have 5 questions concerning how easy it was for the participant to find relevant information, measured by a10-point Likert type scale where the answer 1 means I do not agree at all and 10 means I fully agree. The total score is the sum of scores on all the answers (maximum 50).</description>

    <measure>Health numeracy score</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This section will use 6-item General health numeracy test (Osborne et al., 2013) in order to determine how much our participants understand the basic health instructions regarding numeracy dimension. For each correct answer, the participants receive one point and the total score is the sum of all correct answers.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants will be first-year university students without experience with
             Cochrane review summaries, because prior familiarization with Cochrane summaries could
             make information uptake easier by those participants.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Participants who give the positive answer to the survey question about familiarity
             with the Cochrane will be excluded from the study analysis.
