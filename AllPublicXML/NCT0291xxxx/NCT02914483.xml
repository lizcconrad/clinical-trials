  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Women's HARP study is a multi-center study focusing on women with clinical presentation
      of myocardial infarction (MI). Women will complete stress questionnaires following
      presentation to the medical center with elevated cardiac enzymes and abnormal
      electrocardiograms (ECGs). 2 months following MI, participants will be screened for the
      Stress Ancillary Study and enrolled if an elevated level of perceived stress is reported.
      After completing baseline assessments, participants will be randomized to Enhanced Usual Care
      (EUC) or stress management for 8 weeks. Participants will be followed for 6 months.

      Women's HARP is a multi-center, observational study which enrolls women with MI who are
      referred for cardiac catheterization. During the MI hospitalization, questionnaires will be
      administered to assess psychosocial stress leading up to the event (MI). Participants will
      also have the option to enroll in the HARP-Stress Ancillary Study and HARP-Platelet
      Sub-Study. Two months following MI, participants may be screened for the Stress Ancillary
      Study. Women with elevated perceived stress at screening will be enrolled. Patients will
      complete baseline assessments (self-report questionnaires and 7 days of wrist actigraphy) and
      then will be randomized to group-based stress management or to enhanced usual care (EUC).
      Both study arms involve 8 weekly phone sessions delivered by trained facilitators. Following
      intervention, participants in both study arms will repeat self-report questionnaires and 7
      days of wrist actigraphy. Anticipate enrollment of approximately 200 women to meet target of
      144 qualified women.
