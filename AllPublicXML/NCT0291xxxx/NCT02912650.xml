  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, single-center study
      in approximately 560 subjects to determine the overall analgesic efficacy and safety of a
      fixed-dose ibuprofen 250 mg / acetaminophen 500 mg formulation compared to ibuprofen 250 mg
      alone, acetaminophen 650 mg alone, and to placebo. Subjects will be healthy males and females
      aged 18-40 years, inclusive, who are experiencing post-operative pain following surgical
      extraction of 3 or more third molar teeth. Following extraction, subjects must experience,
      within 5 hours, post-surgical pain of at least moderate severity (on a 4-point categorical
      scale), confirmed by a Visual Analog Pain Severity Rating Scale (VAS PSR) of at least 50 mm
      on a 100 mm VAS PSR scale. Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive a single oral dose
      of study medication under double-blind conditions and then evaluated on site for 12 hours
      following administration of study medication. Subjects will provide self-ratings of pain
      severity and pain relief at various time points using categorical and numerical scales.
      Additionally, subjects will also evaluate the time to first perceptible relief and time to
      meaningful relief using a double stopwatch method. Finally, at 12 hours, subjects will
      complete a categorical Global Evaluation of the study medication. A review of any reported
      adverse events will also be completed.

      This is a 12-hour, 4-arm, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      single-center study in approximately 560 subjects to determine the overall analgesic efficacy
      and safety of a fixed-dose ibuprofen 250 mg / acetaminophen 500 mg formulation (administered
      as two caplets of 125 mg/250 mg IBU/APAP) compared to ibuprofen 250 mg alone, acetaminophen
      650 mg alone, and to placebo. Subjects will be healthy males and females aged 18-40 years,
      inclusive, otherwise healthy, who are experiencing post-operative pain following surgical
      extraction of 3 or more third molar teeth. Following extraction, subjects must experience,
      within 5 hours, post-surgical pain of at least moderate severity (on a 4-point categorical
      scale), confirmed by a Visual Analog Pain Severity Rating Scale (VAS PSR) of at least 50 mm
      on a 100 mm VAS PSR scale. Upon completion of the baseline scales, eligible subjects will be
      randomized to receive a single oral dose of study medication under double-blind conditions
      and then evaluated on site for 12 hours following administration of study medication. At
      0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 hours post dose time points,
      subjects will provide: self-ratings of pain severity using the numerical and categorical
      PSRs; and self-ratings of pain relief at each time point using a categorical pain relief
      rating scale. At 12 hours, subjects will also complete a 6-point categorical Global
      Evaluation of the study medication. Additionally, subjects will also evaluate the time to
      first perceptible relief and time to meaningful relief using a double stopwatch method up to
      12 hours post-dose or until the time of first rescue medication use, whichever is sooner. A
      review of any reported adverse events will also be completed.

        <title>Time-weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference Scores on 11-Point Numerical Scale From 0 to 8 Hours Post-dose (SPID11 [0-8])</title>
        <description>Pain intensity was assessed on an 11-point numerical pain severity rating scale. SPID11 (0-8): Time-weighted sum of pain intensity difference (PID) scores over 8 hours. SPID11 score range was -40 (worst score) to 80 (best score) for SPID 0-8. PID was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points (pain severity score range: 0 =no pain to 10 =worst possible pain) from the baseline pain intensity scores (score range: 5 =moderate pain to 10 =worst possible pain; as participants with baseline pain score of at least moderate were included in study). Total possible score range for PID: -5 (worst score) to 10 (best score).</description>

        <title>Time-weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference Scores on 11-Point Numerical Scale From 6 to 8 Hours Post-dose (SPID11 [6-8])</title>
        <description>Pain intensity was assessed on an 11-point numerical pain severity rating scale. SPID11 (6-8): Time-weighted sum of PID scores over 6 to 8 hours. SPID11 score range was -15 (worst score) to 30 (best score) for SPID 6-8. PID was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points (pain severity score range: 0 =no pain to 10 =worst possible pain) from the baseline pain intensity scores (score range: 5 =moderate pain to 10 =worst possible pain; as participants with baseline pain score of at least moderate were included in study). Total possible score range for PID: -5 (worst score) to 10 (best score).</description>

        <title>Time to Confirmed Onset of First Perceptible Relief</title>
        <description>Participants evaluated the time to first perceptible relief (confirmed by meaningful relief) by stopping the first stopwatch labeled 'first perceptible relief' at the moment they first began to experience any pain relief, if the participant also achieved meaningful relief by the end of the study. Stopwatch was active up to 12 hours after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or until the participant dropped out due to treatment failure prior to depressing the first stopwatch or until the time of withdrawal (discontinuation). Treatment failure was defined as participant taking rescue medication, or discontinuing due to lack of efficacy.</description>

        <description>PID11: baseline pain severity score minus pain severity score at a given time point. Pain intensity was assessed on an 11-point numerical pain severity rating scale. PID11 was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points (pain severity score range: 0 =no pain to 10 =worst possible pain) from the baseline pain intensity scores (score range: 5 =moderate pain to 10 =worst possible pain; as participants with baseline pain score of at least moderate were included in study). Total possible score range for PID11: -5 (worst score) to 10 (best score).</description>

        <title>Pain Intensity Difference on 4-Point Categorical Scale (PID4)</title>
        <description>PID4: baseline pain severity score minus pain severity score at a given time point. Pain intensity was assessed on a 4-point categorical pain severity rating scale. PID4 was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points (pain severity score range: 0 [no pain] to 3 [worst possible pain]) from the baseline pain intensity scores (score range: 2 =moderate pain to 3 =worst possible pain; as participants with baseline pain score of at least moderate were included in study). Total possible score range for PID4: -1 (worst score) to 3 (best score).</description>

          <title>Pain Intensity Difference on 4-Point Categorical Scale (PID4)</title>
          <description>PID4: baseline pain severity score minus pain severity score at a given time point. Pain intensity was assessed on a 4-point categorical pain severity rating scale. PID4 was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points (pain severity score range: 0 [no pain] to 3 [worst possible pain]) from the baseline pain intensity scores (score range: 2 =moderate pain to 3 =worst possible pain; as participants with baseline pain score of at least moderate were included in study). Total possible score range for PID4: -1 (worst score) to 3 (best score).</description>
          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who were dosed with the study medication and provided a baseline assessment.</population>

        <title>Sum of Pain Relief Rating and Pain Intensity Difference on 4-Point Categorical Scale (PRID4)</title>
        <description>PRID4: sum of PID and PRR at each post-dose time points up to 12 hours. Score range for PRID: -1(worst score) to 7(best score). PID was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points (pain severity score range: 0 [no pain] to 3 [worst possible pain]) from the baseline pain intensity scores (score range: 2 =moderate pain to 3 =worst possible pain; as participants with baseline pain score of at least moderate were included in study). Total possible score range for PID4: -1 (worst score) to 3 (best score). PRR was assessed on a 5-point categorical pain relief rating scale which ranges from 0 =no relief to 4 =complete relief.</description>

        <description>Pain intensity was assessed on an 11-point numerical pain severity rating scale. SPID11: Time-weighted sum of PID scores over 12 hours. SPID11 score range was -10 (worst score) to 20 (best score) for SPID 0-2, -30 (worst score) to 60 (best score) for SPID 0-6, -60 (worst score) to 120 (best score) for SPID 0-12. PID was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points (pain severity score range: 0 =no pain to 10 =worst possible pain) from the baseline pain intensity scores (score range: 5 =moderate pain to 10 =worst possible pain; as participants with baseline pain score of at least moderate were included in study). Total possible score range for PID: -5 (worst) to 10 (best).</description>

        <description>Pain intensity was assessed on a 4-point categorical pain severity rating scale. SPID4: Time-weighted sum of PID over post-dose time points. SPID4 score range was -2 (worst score) to 6 (best score) for SPID 0-2, -6 (worst score) to 18 (best score) for SPID 0-6, -8 (worst score) to 24 (best score) for SPID 0-8, -12 (worst score) to 36 (best score) for SPID 0-12 and -3 (worst score) to 9 (best score) for SPID 6-8. PID was calculated by subtracting the pain intensity score at given post-dose time points (pain severity score range: 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) from the baseline pain intensity scores (score range: 2 =moderate pain to 3 = severe pain; as participants with baseline pain score of at least moderate were included in study). Total possible score range for PID: -1 (worst score) to 3 (best score).</description>

        <description>SPRID4: Time-weighted sum of PRR and PID based on 4 point categorical pain severity rating scale (PRID) with score range: -2(worst score) to 14 (best score) for SPRID 0-2, -6 (worst score) to 42 (best score) for SPRID 0-6, -8 (worst score) to 56 (best score) for SPRID 0-8, -12 (worst score) to 84 (best score) for SPRID 0-12 and -3 (worst score) to 21 (best score) for SPRID 6-8 hours. PRID: sum of PID and PRR at post-dose time point with score range: -1 (worst score) to 7 (best score). PID calculated by subtracting pain intensity score at post-dose time points (score range: 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) from baseline pain intensity scores (score range: 2 =moderate pain to 3 = severe pain; as participants with baseline score of at least moderate were included). PID total possible score range: -1 (worst score) to 3(best score). PRR assessed on 5-point categorical scale with range: 0 =no relief to 4 =complete relief.</description>

        <title>Cumulative Percentage of Participants With Confirmed First Perceptible Relief</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with confirmed first perceptible relief was reported. Participants evaluated the time to first perceptible relief (confirmed by meaningful relief) by stopping the first stopwatch labelled 'first perceptible relief' at the moment they first began to experience any pain relief, if the participant also achieved meaningful relief by the end of the study. Stopwatch was active up to 12 hours after dosing or until stopped by the participant, or until the participant dropped out due to treatment failure prior to depressing the first stopwatch or until the time of withdrawal (discontinuation). Treatment failure was defined as participant taking rescue medication, or discontinuing due to lack of efficacy.</description>

        <description>Percentage of participants with meaningful relief was reported. Participants evaluated time to meaningful relief by stopping a second stopwatch labeled &quot;meaningful relief&quot; at the moment they first began to experience meaningful relief. Stopwatch was active up to 12 hours after dosing or until stopped by participant, or participant became treatment failure prior to depressing the second stopwatch. Treatment failure was defined as participant taking rescue medication, or discontinuing due to lack of efficacy.</description>
