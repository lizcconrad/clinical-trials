      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the application of Kinesio Taping on a
      myofascial trigger point in the trapezius muscle able to cause a decrease of the trigger
      point pain and an increase of the cervical range of motion in asymptomatic subjects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of Kinesio Taping has become very popular for the treatment of many musculoskeletal
      disorders in recent decades. Of the six variants of application that has the Kinesio Taping,
      the space correction technique is suggested for pain management. The increased space achieved
      with this variant decreases the pressure Kinesio Taping by raising the skin directly over the
      treatment area, reducing chemical irritation receptors and therefore pain. The aim of this
      study is to demonstrate that the application of this variant of Kinesio Taping on a
      myofascial trigger point in the trapezius muscle able to cause a decrease of the pain and an
      increase of the cervical range of motion in asymptomatic subjects. For this, the pressure
      pain threshold will be measured with a algometer on the trigger point and the range of motion
      with a cervical goniometer.
