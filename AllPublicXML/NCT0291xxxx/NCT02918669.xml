      Examine the long-term survivorship via CT Scan of the coflex in patients who presented with
      spinous process fracture(s) at 24 months in the Paradigm Spine coflex IDE Study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, radiographic evaluation of all coflex IDE
      patients who presented with a spinous process fracture at 24 months as identified by
      independent radiographic review (using X-ray or CT). All patients were enrolled and followed
      through 60 months under the IDE and extended follow-up protocol.

      The specific objective of this CT Study is to perform a sub-analysis of the patients with 24
      month spinous process fracture(s) via a CT scan at post-60 months. A CT Scan will be
      performed and analyzed by an independent radiographic review lab for evidence of fracture or
      healing at the long term timepoint.
