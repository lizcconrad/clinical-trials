  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study the investigators evaluated the apparent efficacy and safety of
      intravenous fentanyl administered by ambulance personnel and found that 58.4% (CI 56.4-60.4)
      out of 2348 prehospital patients treated with fentanyl still experienced moderate to severe
      pain [numeric rating scale (NRS, 0-10) &gt; 3] at hospital arrival. The number of patients with
      possible fentanyl-related side effects was low.

      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to explore the efficacy and safety of a
      liberalized pain treatment protocol for ambulance personnel (a total of 3 μg/kg per
      transport) compared with existing restrictive protocol (a total of 2 μg/kg per transport).
      The investigators hypothesize that:

        -  A higher proportion of patients will experience sufficient pain relief at hospital
           admission (NRS &lt; 4) using the liberalized protocol and

        -  There will be no differences in the proportion of potential fentanyl related
           side-effects are observed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cluster-randomized trial observing proportional differences in sufficient pain
      relief at hospital admission (NRS &lt; 4) and potential fentanyl related side-effects between
      patients treated by ambulance personnel applying either:

        -  a more liberal treatment approach (a total of 3 μg/kg per transport) or

        -  existing treatment approach (a total of 2 μg/kg per transport).

      The Ambulance stations and their affiliated ambulance personnel are stratified into 5
      clusters according to size/average transports per month and randomized to either liberal or
      existing treatment approach within each cluster. As patients are not randomized on an
      individual level baseline differences between the two groups and its patients are adjusted
      statistically with relevant confounders on 3 overall levels:

        1. Patients: Charlson Comorbidity Index Score, main overall diagnose category, inhospital
           surrogate measures of disease severity (intensive care unit admission and 30-day
           mortality).

        2. Ambulance personnel: Years of experience and preinterventional cumulative fentanyl
           administration and

        3. Ambulance stations and geographical factors: prehospital time measures and geographical
           distance from site of emergency to hospital.

      These covariates are obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry, the Danish Civil
      Registration System and the electronic prehospital patient journal.
