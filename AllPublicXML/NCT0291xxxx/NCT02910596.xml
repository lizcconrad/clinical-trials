    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer in women worldwide, after breast and
      colorectal cancer. Molecular biology has firmly established a causal relationship between
      persistent infection with high risk human papilloma virus (HPV) genotypes and cervical
      cancer.

      Cervical cancer stage IB1 and selected IIA 1 lesions without extensive vaginal involvement
      can be treated with either RH and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLD) or primary
      chemoradiation.

      Bladder dysfunction is the most common complication after radical hysterectomy. The incidence
      is approximate 10-80 %. Management of bladder dysfunction is continuous urethral
      catheterization or clean intermittent self-catheterization. Prolonged urethral
      catheterization may increase the risk of urinary tract infection.

      Early postoperative bladder training that consist of a scheduled clamping trans-urethral
      catheter every 3 h and unclamping trans-urethral catheter 15 min during the entire day.

      Bethanechol chloride is a cholinergic drug and may enhance the detrusor muscle contraction,
      resulting in higher maximum flow rate, and lower postvoid residual urine.

      This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of bethanechol chloride and early
      bladder training for prevention of bladder dysfunction after radical hysterectomy in cervical
      cancer stage IB - IIA.

Remove urethral catheter on 5thpostoperative day. Void volume and postvoid residual urine were record. Intermittent urethral catheterization was used to measure postvoid residual urine. If postvoid residual urine was more than 100 cc in two consecutive measurement, the urethral catheter was reinserted, and medication would be continue until the catheter cloud be removed but medication were not given for more than 1 month. Postvoid residual urine, urinalysis were evaluated at 1 month postoperative</description>
