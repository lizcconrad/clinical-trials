    <description>The four obstacles in the sizes of 4cm wide, 8cm wide, 4cm high, and 8cm high are randomly placed along a 10-meter walkway in 2-meter intervals. Subjects are instructed to walk continuously over obstacles at their comfortable speed, as good as they can without contact the obstacles by their leg or device. During walk over obstacles, subjects asked to perform simultaneously with a color word stroop task which requires subjects to see and answer the color of the name of a color words in the monitor (ignore the meaning) as quickly as possible, and loudly.</description>
