      Are the KypDisT and conventional C7WD are practical, valid, reliable, and effectiveness of
      the tools to discriminate the functional ability impairments relating to kyphosis when
      compare with gold standard (Cobb's method), and compare among physical therapy, VHS and
      caregiver?

      1. To further develop an innovation to measure kyphosis using distance from the wall, a
           Kyphosis wall distance tool (KypDisT).

        2. investigate validity of the measurements in terms of 2.1 Concurrent validity of
           conventional C7WD and KypDisT as compared to a gold standard (Cobb's method).

           2.2 Discriminative ability of conventional C7WD and KypDisT on functional abilities in
           elderly with different severity of kyphosis.

        3. To investigate the reliability of the measurements in terms of 3.1 Test-retest
           reliability of conventional C7WD and KypDisT. 3.2 Reliability of conventional C7WD and
           KypDisT comparing among physical therapy, VHS and caregiver.

        4. To explore the distance to indicate risk of spinal fracture to indicate a risk of spinal
           fracture.

        Elderly who live community-dwelling with different degrees of kyphosis, aged at least 60
        years with a body mass index between 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 and OWD &gt;0 cm. (Wongsa et al., 2012).
        However, elderly are excluded if they present signs and symptoms that may affect
        participation in the study, i.e. unstable medical condition, pain or inflammation in the
        joints of the lower extremity (pain scale &gt; 5), having sequelae of neurological deficits,
        and unable to understand and follow a simple command used in the study.
