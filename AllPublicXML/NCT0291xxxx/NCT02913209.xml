  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is consistently rated as the top symptomatic complaint for individuals with multiple
      sclerosis (MS). Currently, the MS Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), a subsection of the Multiple
      Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQoL), is the clinical standard used by neurologists for
      monitoring and tracking fatigue in individuals with MS. However, fatigue is multidimensional
      phenomenon and subjective measures have had poor or limited relationships with functional
      status. While previous study has focused on contributing factors to fatigue such as sleep
      disorders and diminished cortical excitability, this line of inquiry has neglected the role
      of muscle structure and function on fatigue in every day functional tasks. An alternative
      approach is to assess quantitative fatigue using anaerobic testing methods. However, more
      knowledge is needed to understand the role that quantitative fatigue plays in self-reported
      fatigue measures and function of daily activities. Our purpose is to determine the
      association between quantitative fatigue tests with performance-based measures of mobility
      and self-reported health-related quality of life. Our secondary goal is to understand how the
      intrinsic properties of muscle tissue influence muscle performance in Veterans with MS.

      Participants will complete study assessments at the DC VAMC. Disease severity will be
      assessed by medical staff completing the EDSS. Peak torque assessment for the knee flexors
      and extensors will be performed on an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 4). Muscle
      morphology measures of the rectus femoris will be obtained using diagnostic musculoskeletal
      B-mode ultrasound (Phillips EPIQ 7 180 Plus) with a 10 Mhz linear transducer. The sonographic
      measures will include muscle thickness and echogenicity. The mode of exercise testing and the
      type of muscle action will influence the assessment of fatigue. Therefore, isokinetic fatigue
      measures for the knee extensors will be assessed on separate visits (at least 48 hours
      apart). Performance-based measures of function will include an assessment of patient mobility
      and the 25-foot walk test. Muscle power will be estimated by the timed sit to stand test.
      Subjective measures of fatigue and quality of life include the MSQoL, MFIS, and Neurology
      Quality of Life Adult Fatigue Bank (AFB).

    <description>Participants will complete study assessments over 4 visits to the DC VAMC. Disease severity will be assessed by the EDSS, and a cognitive battery will be completed. Peak torque assessment for the knee flexors and extensors will be performed on an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 4). Muscle morphology measures of the rectus femoris will be obtained using diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound. The sonographic measures will include muscle thickness and echogenicity. Isokinetic and isoinertial mode fatigue measures for the knee extensors will be assessed on separate visits (at least 48 hours apart). Performance-based measures of function will include an assessment of patient mobility and the 25-foot walk test. Muscle power will be estimated by the timed sit to stand test. Subjective measures of fatigue and quality of life include the MSQoL, MFIS, and Neurology Quality of Life Adult Fatigue Bank (AFB).</description>
