    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that have nasopharyngeal carcinoma or breast cancer. As epithelial
      cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a well characterized molecule that is closely with poor
      prognosis and tumor metastasis and invasion. Many therapies targeting EpCAM have shown
      benefits for cancer patients. This study is to determine the safety of the engineered T cells
      armed with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) recognizing EpCAM. At the same time, efficacy is
      to be evaluated by the criteria of RECIST. The EpCAM CAR-T were produced by lentiviral
      transduction of the 3rd generation of CAR genes. Different cohorts of patients receive EpCAM
      CAR-T with a dose-escalating manner. This study is to find the largest dose of EpCAM CAR-T,
      to learn what the adverse effects are and to find out whether this experimental intervention
      might help patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma or breast cancer.

      In this study, the original tumor tissue specimen should be stained to determine the
      expression levels of EpCAM. Only the patients having tumor with high expression levels will
      be included.

      50-100ml blood with be drawn to get enough CD3 T cells at least 2x10^7. After separation,
      PBMC will be activated via antibodies of CD3 and CD28 and then transduced by lentivirus
      bearing the EpCAM CAR gene. Then the EpCAM CAR-T cells will proliferate up to 10-100 folds
      for infusion. The produced cells will be frozen or infused if available.

      Included patients will be preconditioned by cyclophosphamide for lymphodepletion if the
      levels of white blood cells and lymphocytes are normal. Infusion of T cells, at least 1 day
      after lymphodepletion, is dose escalating and beginning at the lowest level. If the first
      level is proven to be safe, the next level will be proceeded. Once severe side effects were
      observed, the dose will be lowered or the dose will be stopped.

      During infusion, patients will be taken care of by cardiogram monitor. Blood drawing will be
      taken before infusion, at 4h after infusion and on day 4, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 to
      determine the presence of CAR-T cells. At the same time, cytokines including IL-6, TNF-alpha
      and IFN-gamma and C-reactive protein levels will be determined. Routine imaging studies will
      be proceeded.

      To see whether there are long-term side effects of this therapy, patients received CAR-T
      cells will be followed up to at least 15 years.
