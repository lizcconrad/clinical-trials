  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will focus on two cohorts of brain tumor patients aged, 4-18 years, to
      answer two critical questions: 1) Can the investigators acquire high quality data relevant to
      cognitive function during the peri-diagnostic period and, 2) can the investigators develop
      predictive models for cognitive outcomes using serial examination of functional imaging and
      cognitive function. Any patient with a newly diagnosed brain tumor aged 4-18 will be eligible
      for enrollment in cohort 1. Only patients with previously diagnosed tumors of the posterior
      fossa will be eligible for cohort 2. The rationale for of the focus on these patients is that
      first, the posterior fossa is the most common location for pediatric brain tumors and
      therefore this focus will impact the largest segment of this patient population. Second,
      three tumors commonly occur here, medulloblastoma, ependymoma and pilocytic astrocytoma.
      These are treated with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy (medulloblastoma), surgery and
      radiation therapy (ependymoma) or surgery only (pilocytic astrocytoma). Thus, this focus will
      provide a platform to analyze the impact that different tumor types and different standard
      treatments have on cognitive dysfunction. Finally, the fact that all subjects will have
      tumors of the same brain region will control for the effect that tumor location will have on
      cognitive testing and rsfcMRI. Here, repeated evaluations on and off therapy will provide the
      necessary data points to establish trajectories of cognitive development and recovery in this
      population.

    <description>Prior to surgery, subjects will have a complete standard of care history and physical exam by the neurosurgeon and then undergo peri-diagnostic neurocognitive testing utilizing the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery computer testing software for iPad (will take 45 minutes). The peri-diagnostic period will be defined as the period from first presentation to 2 weeks post-diagnosis or two weeks post-op, whichever is later.
Participants will also undergo a rsfcMRI during their standard of care MRI imaging which will add 15 minutes to their scan time</description>

    <description>Patients with diagnosis of a posterior tumor will undergo neurocognitive testing utilizing the NIH Toolbox. Testing will be every 6 months for children currently receiving therapy and annually for those that have completed all therapy for a total of 2 sessions. During standard of care MRI images, rsfcMRI imaging will be performed which will add 15 minutes of time. rsfcMRI will be obtained every 6 months for children currently receiving therapy and annually for those that have completed therapy for a total of 3 rsfcMRIs for each patient.
Patients in Cohort 1 with posterior fossa tumors will also be eligible to continue with the longitudinal assessment as just described. These participants will then undergo repeat neurocognitive testing using the NIH toolbox 6-9 months for an additional 2 testing sessions. rsfcMRI will be obtained during their follow-up imaging at 6-9 month intervals for a total of 3 additional rsfcMRIs (4 total scans).</description>

    <description>The imaging protocols will be a combined version of a standard of care (SOC) protocol with a research portion. The SOC portion of the pre-surgical scans includes a 3D T2-weighted (T2w) scans and 3D pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted (T1w) images, both at high resolution (1.0 mm3) for use in the intraoperative navigation system. This scan also includes a DTI portion for definition of fiber bundles of interest. The SOC portion of the post-surgical scans includes transverse FLAIR and post-contrast T1w images in all 3 planes. The research portion of the scan will be identical at all 3 time points and include 15 min of rsfcMRI during which the non-sedated subjects will be asked to stay still and awake while looking at a fixation cross</description>
