  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a promising non-invasive imaging tool that may aid in
      the early detection of kidney transplant complications, such as delayed graft function (DGF)
      and acute allograft rejection. The technique uses an intravenous contrast agent to improve
      organ visualization with standard duplex ultrasound equipment. A number of FDA-approved
      agents, including Optison, Definity and Lumason are widely used to improve visualization in
      technically limited echocardiograms, and Lumason was recently approved for contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound of the liver. The specific aims of this study are to: develop, implement and
      refine a contrast-enhanced ultrasound protocol using Lumason to safely maximize kidney
      allograft visualization; determine associations between contrast-enhanced ultrasound and
      patterns of allograft injury consistent with delayed graft function; and to compare
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound with duplex ultrasound for differentiating acute rejection from
      other causes of dysfunction.

    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) given
      improved quality of life, longer survival and lower costs compared with chronic dialysis.
      Despite these long-term benefits, the first year post-transplant is a critical period that
      influences health care costs for transplantation and long-term patient and allograft
      survival. The two most common complications in the first year are delayed graft function
      (DGF), which affects nearly 25% of deceased-donor transplants, and acute allograft rejection,
      which affects nearly 10% of all transplants (deceased and living donor). DGF is most commonly
      caused by severe ischemia-reperfusion injury at transplantation and is a known risk factor
      for acute rejection and premature failure. Driven by an ever-growing transplant waiting list
      and limited organs, efforts to utilize higher-risk kidneys for increasingly higher-risk
      recipients may further increase these complication rates. While treatments exist for DGF and
      acute rejection, the current diagnostic paradigm is to obtain a duplex ultrasound (DUS) of
      the allograft, based on serial changes in serum creatinine, and then proceed to biopsy if
      there is clinical concern for rejection. Biopsy is the gold standard to differentiate between
      causes of allograft dysfunction, but the procedure is invasive and typically takes 24 hours
      or longer for an interpretation. Thus, early detection of these complications using
      non-invasive diagnostic methods (a major transplant research goal) could reduce our reliance
      on biopsies and help improve long-term patient and allograft survival.

      Researchers in the United States have safely performed contrast-enhanced ultrasounds of the
      kidney in healthy participants, and radiologists have used ultrasound contrast agents
      off-label to better visualize organs other than the heart when clinically indicated. In terms
      of kidney transplants, European data suggest CEUS of the allograft on post-operative day
      (POD) 7 is superior to DUS for predicting 12-month allograft function, but there are no
      published studies using CEUS on POD 1 to diagnose DGF or acute rejection.

      The pathophysiology of both DGF and acute rejection involve interactions between the
      microvasculature, parenchymal cells and inflammatory cells, though with differences in timing
      and within different zones of the kidney itself. A very important feature of CEUS is its
      capacity to measure microvascular perfusion, whereas DUS can only estimate flow within larger
      vessels. This potential innovation for assessing the renal macro- and microvasculature may
      allow for earlier non-invasive detection of DGF and acute rejection. With additional
      research, it may ultimately be shown that non-invasive CEUS will revolutionize early DGF and
      acute rejection diagnosis to enable improvement in long-term patient and allograft survival.

    <description>A meta-analysis of 19 studies found urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) &gt;150 ng/mL (within hours of the inciting event) had an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.815 for identifying acute kidney injury (defined as an ensuing rise in serum creatinine by â‰¥50%). We noted an AUC of 0.82 for predicting the need for dialysis in the first week (i.e., dialysis-defined delayed graft function) with an optimal urine NGAL cutoff of &gt;350 ng/mL. For this study outcome, we will determine the Spearman correlation between CEUS-assessed allograft perfusion and degree of allograft injury based on post-operative day 1 urine NGAL concentration.</description>

    <description>The Banff (2013) classification of acute kidney allograft rejection requires histologic evidence of acute tissue injury, evidence of recent antibody interaction with renal vascular endothelium, and serologic evidence of donor-specific antibodies in order to diagnose acute antibody-mediate rejection. Acute T-cell mediated rejection is histologically graded by the extent of interstitial inflammation and vascular involvement.</description>
