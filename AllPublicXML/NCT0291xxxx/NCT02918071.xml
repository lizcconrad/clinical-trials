      The purpose of the study is to assess functionality, performance, and reliability of an
      single-use auto-injector (AI) with benralizumab administered subcutaneously (SC) in an
      at-home setting reported by the patient or caregiver, and to confirm the safety and clinical
      benefit of benralizumab administration in asthma patients with severe asthma

        Inclusion criteria

          -  Written informed consent for study participation must be obtained prior to any study
             related procedures being performed and according to international guidelines and/or
             applicable European Union (EU) guidelines

          -  Male and female patients aged 18 to 75 years of age at the time of Visit 1

          -  Patient or caregiver must be willing and able to self-administer the Investigational
             product (IP). Caregiver must be age of consent or older at the time of Visit 1, if
             applicable

          -  Weight of ≥40 kg

          -  Evidence of asthma as documented by airway reversibility (FEV1 ≥12% and 200 ml)
             demonstrated at Visit 1 or 1A or Visit 2

          -  Documented history of current treatment with Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and
             Long-acting β2 agonists (LABA). The ICS and LABA can be parts of a combination product
             or given by separate inhalers. The ICS dose must be greater than or equal to 500
             μg/day fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation or equivalent daily. For ICS/LABA
             combination preparations, both the mid- and high-strength maintenance doses approved
             in the local country will meet this ICS criterion. Additional asthma controller
             medications (e.g., Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), tiotropium, theophylline,
             oral corticosteroids) are allowed

          -  Pre-bronchodilator (pre-BD) FEV1 of &gt;50% predicted normal at Visit 1 or 1A or Visit 2

          -  Not well controlled asthma as documented by either: An Asthma Control Questionnaire 6

             cystic fibrosis, hypoventilation syndrome associated with obesity, lung cancer, alpha
             1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and primary ciliary dyskinesia) or ever been diagnosed with
             pulmonary or systemic disease, other than asthma, that are associated with elevated
             peripheral eosinophil counts (eg, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis,
             Churg-Strauss syndrome, hypereosinophilic syndrome)

          -  Any disorder, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,
             hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic,
             hematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the
             opinion of the Investigator and could: Affect the safety of the patient throughout the
             study; Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations; Impede the
             patient's ability to complete the entire duration of study

          -  Known history of allergy or reaction to the IP formulation

          -  History of anaphylaxis to any biologic therapy

             standard of care therapy

          -  Acute upper or lower respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or antiviral
             medication within 30 days prior to the date informed consent is obtained or during the
             screening

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs,
             hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during screening period, which in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of his/her
             participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the
             patient's ability to complete entire duration of the study
