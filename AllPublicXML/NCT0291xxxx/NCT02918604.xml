      AIM OF THE STUDY The primary objective of this study is to determine the success rate at
      first attempt of peripheral veins cannulation in small children (&lt;5yrs) and infants (&lt;1yr) of
      Veinsite compared with traditional palpation method performed by skilled operators.

      The secondary objective of this study is to determine the time to cannulation using the two
      techniques, the difference in visualized veins using the Veinsite or the direct visualization
      and palpation of the patients' skin, cannula indwelling time and complications related to the
      procedure.

      DESIGN Prospective randomized controlled study

      Population

      It is expected to recruit 60 pediatric patients undergoing peripheral vein cannulation with
      known difficulties according the difficult venous access score (DIVA) (6) in the following
      centers:

        1. Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico &quot;C.Besta&quot; , Milano

        2. Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Ges첫, IRCCS, Roma

      Duration of study Patient will be followed from the day of peripheral vein cannulation till
      the peripheral cannula will be removed (max 3 days) in order to assess any cause of venous
      extravasation. The recruitment phase is supposed to be 6 months after achieving the
      ethical-administrative authorization.
