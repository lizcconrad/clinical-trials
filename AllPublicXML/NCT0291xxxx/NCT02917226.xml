      The purpose of the study is to develop a user-friendly, comprehensive, fully integrated web
      and mobile-based Clinical Decision Support and Monitoring System (CDSMS) for DM diseases
      screening, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring for the use of physicians and patients in
      primary care and to determine the effectiveness of the system. For validating the CDSMS for
      diabetes patients, randomized controlled trial will be conducted.A parallel single blind
      randomized controlled trial will be implemented. 10 physicians and their 439 patients are
      involved in the study. According to the results of screening which is done using developed
      CDSMS, DM diagnosed patients will be recruited for trial from the primary care centers by the
      physicians. The recruited patients will register to the CDSMS with their accounts given by
      their physicians. Eligible participants will be assigned to intervention and control groups
      with simple randomization. The significance level will be accepted as p&lt;0,05. In the
      intervention group, the system recommendations on diagnosis, treatment and monitoring will be
      carried out as the final decision given by the physician. In the control group, physicians
      will treat DM patients as the general routine. Patients in both groups will be monitored for
      6 months. Patient data on 0th and 6th month will be compared. Clinical and laboratory
      outcomes will be face-to-face assessed, others will be online self-assessed.
