    <textblock>
      Open-label, multi-center clinical study is to assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of RO7034067 in infants with Type 1
      spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The study consists of two parts, an exploratory dose finding
      part (Part 1) and a confirmatory part (Part 2) which will investigate RO7034067 for 24-months
      at the dose selected in Part 1.
