  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of men with prostate cancer are overdiagnosed and overtreated mainly due
      to PSA testing. Active surveillance (AS) aims to reduce these harms by recommending curative
      treatment only when and if signs of tumor progression occur. There are however a number of
      uncertainties in AS, the most important being when to initiate treatment. The investigators
      are therefore starting a large randomized multicenter trial testing the safety of a
      standardized active surveillance protocol with specified triggers for repeat biopsies and
      initiation of curative treatment. The standardized protocol is compared with current practice
      for active surveillance. The primary aim of the study is to reduce overtreatment and
      subsequent side effects, without increasing the risk of disease progression or prostate
      cancer mortality.

      STUDY HYPOTHESIS

      The study hypothesis is that standardized triggers for initiation of curative treatment of
      men who are in active surveillance will reduce over-treatment without increasing disease
      progression and prostate cancer mortality.

      STUDY DESIGN

      Randomized multi-centre open-label clinical trial

      INTERVENTIONS

      Computerized randomisation (1:1) within 12 months from diagnosis of prostate cancer, either
      to active surveillance according to current practice at the trial centre (reference arm), or
      to a standardised active surveillance protocol applying specific criteria for repeat biopsies
      and the initiation of curative treatment (experimental arm). Patients are stratified by
      centre and Gleason score.

      Follow-up both groups: PSA every 6 months, clinical examination (with PSA test) annually, and
      multiparametric MRI every second year.

      Repeat biopsies (reference arm): Current practice

      Repeat biopsies (experimental arm), standardised triggers:

        1. A systematic repeat biopsy if PSA density increases to &gt; 0.2 ng/ml/cc, and then at every
           0.1 ng/ml/cc increase

        2. MRI progression in men with previously only Gleason grade 3+3: 5 mm or more increase in
           size in any dimension of a measurable lesion, increase in PI-RADS score to 3-5, a new
           lesion with PI-RADS score 3-5, or new suspicion of extra-capsular extension or seminal
           vesicle invasion

        3. MRI progression in men with Gleason grade 3+4: 5 mm or more increase in size in any
           dimension of a measurable lesion, or a new lesion with PI-RADS score 3-5

      Curative treatment (reference arm): Current practice

      Curative treatment (experimental arm), standardised triggers:

        1. MRI progression in lesions with confirmed Gleason grade 4: increase in PI-RADS score to
           4 or 5, or new suspicion of extra-capsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion

        2. Pathological progression: Gleason pattern 5, primary Gleason pattern 4 in any core with
           5 mm or more cancer, Gleason 3+4 in 3 or more cores or 30% if more than 10 cores are
           taken, or Gleason 3+4 in 10 mm or more cancer

      Patients will be followed continuously until initiation of treatment, the event of
      metastasis, to a break point where active surveillance is considered terminated and watchful
      waiting starts, or to death of any cause. After the initiation of curative treatment,
      watchful waiting, or palliative treatment for cancer progression, the patient is followed
      according to the standard protocol of the participating centre.
