  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, simultaneous, parallel phase II study with one arm receiving
      unrelated cord blood transplantation and the other arm receiving haploidentical
      transplantation for Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) patients. The primary objective is to assess
      overall survival (OS) separately in the 2 arms at 1 year post-hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired SAA is a rare bone marrow failure disorder with an estimated annual incidence of 2
      cases per million and with over 600 new cases in the United States each year. A major
      challenge in treating acquired SAA is the management of patients who are refractory to
      immunosuppressant therapy (IST) or have relapsed after IST. HSCT is the only curative option
      for these patients but many are ineligible because they lack a suitable donor. The Blood and
      Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) seeks to increase options for these
      patients by using novel therapeutic strategies (optimized preparative regimens and targeted
      antithymocyte globulin (ATG) pharmacokinetics (PK)) to expand the donor pool utilizing UCB
      for transplantation. The goal of this protocol is to test whether optimized approaches using
      two alternative donor sources will achieve acceptable outcomes in SAA patients. Ideally, a
      direct comparison of the two approaches would allow us to determine a best approach. However,
      given 1) the rarity of the disease, 2) the fact that different centers often prefer different
      stem cell sources, and 3) the fact that most comparisons of alternative donor stem cell
      sources have shown very similar outcomes, this protocol allows both approaches to be
      performed, but there are no planned comparisons of outcomes between the two cohorts.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is &lt; 75 years of age at time of enrollment.

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of SAA, either from initial diagnosis or follow-up assessments,
             defined as:

               1. Bone marrow cellularity &lt; 25% or marrow cellularity &lt; 50% but with &lt; 30% residual
                  hematopoietic cells.

               2. Two out of three of the following (in peripheral blood): Neutrophils &lt; 0.5
                  x10^9/L, Platelets &lt; 20 x10^9/L, or Reticulocyte count &lt; 20 x10^9/L

          3. No suitable fully matched related (6/6 match for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and B
             at intermediate or high resolution and DRB1 at high resolution using DNA-based typing)
             or unrelated donor (8/8 match for HLA-A, B, C, and DRB1 at high resolution using
             DNA-based typing) available. Search for an unrelated donor and enrollment on this
             protocol may be abandoned if the clinical situation dictates an urgent transplant in
             the best medical judgment of the treating provider. The definition of clinical urgency
             may include a low likelihood of identifying a suitable matched unrelated donor within
             6-8 weeks from referral and the medical need to choose a donor without further delay
             beyond that time.

          4. Failed at least one trial of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) by being refractory or
             having relapsed. IST could have included ATG based regimens, calcineurin inhibitors
             and/or other higher dose therapy directed at the treatment of primary SAA.

          5. Available alternative donor:

               1. Cord blood unit(s) must be matched at a minimum of 4/6 to the recipient at HLA-A
                  and B at low resolution using DNA-based typing and HLA-DRB1 at high resolution
                  using DNA-based typing. Based on a published report from Eurocord, for single
                  unit transplantation, the single unit pre-cryopreserved total nucleated cell
                  (TNC) dose must be a minimum of 4.0 x10^7/kg recipient weight. For double cord
                  transplants, each unit must have a minimum of 1.5 x10^7/kg pre-cryopreserved TNC
                  and a minimum total of 4.0 x10^7/kg (sum of unit 1 and unit 2). For non-red blood
                  cell depleted units, the minimum pre-cryopreserved TNC dose is 2.0 x10^7/kg
                  recipient weight.

                  or

               2. HLA haplo first degree relatives of the patient including biological parents,
                  siblings or half siblings, or children with 2, 3, or 4 mismatches using DNA-based
                  typing. A unidirectional mismatch in either the graft versus host or host versus
                  graft direction is considered a mismatch. The donor and recipient must be
                  identical at a minimum of one allele (at high resolution DNA-based typing) at the
                  following genetic loci: HLA-A, -B, -C, and DRB1.

          6. Patient and/or legal guardian must sign informed consent for HSCT.

          7. In the haplo cohort, the donor and/or legal guardian must be able to sign informed
             consent documents.

          8. In the haplo cohort, the potential donor must be willing to donate bone marrow.

          9. In the haplo cohort, the weight of the haplo donor must be ≥ 20 kg.

         10. Adequate organ function defined as:

               1. Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at rest ≥ 40%. For patients
                  aged &lt; 13 years, shortening fraction (SF) ≥ 26% by echocardiogram or Multi Gated
                  Acquisition Scan (MUGA) may be substituted for LVEF.

               2. Hepatic: Total bilirubin &lt; 3.0 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age
                  (patients who have been diagnosed with Gilbert's Disease are allowed to exceed
                  this limit) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase
                  (AST) &lt; 5.0 x ULN for age.

               3. Renal: For patients &gt; 13.0 years of age at the time of enrollment: estimated
                  creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/minute (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula and actual
                  body weight). For patients &lt; 13.0 years of age at enrollment: Glomerular
                  Filtration Rate (GFR) estimated by the updated Schwartz formula ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73
                  m2. If the estimated GFR is &lt; 90 mL/min/1.73 m^2, then renal function must be
                  measured by 24-hour creatinine clearance or nuclear GFR, and must be &gt; 50
                  mL/min/1.73 m^2.

               4. Pulmonary: For patients &gt; 13.0 years of age: Diffusing capacity of the lung for
                  carbon monoxide (DLCO) (corrected/adjusted for hemoglobin) &gt; 40% and forced
                  expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &gt; 50% predicted (without administration of
                  bronchodilator) and forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt; 50% predicted. For patients &lt;
                  13.0 years of age unable to perform pulmonary function tests (PFT) due to age or
                  developmental ability: (1) no evidence of dyspnea at rest and (2) no need for
                  supplemental oxygen and (3) O2 saturation &gt; 92% on room air at sea level (with
                  lower levels allowed at higher elevations per established center standard of care
                  (e.g., Utah, 4,200 feet above sea level, does not give supplemental oxygen unless
                  below 90%)).

         11. Karnofsky or Lansky performance status ≥ 60%.

         12. Females and males of childbearing potential must agree to practice 2 effective methods
             of contraception at the same time or agree to abstinence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes. At minimum, the diagnosis of Fanconi anemia
             must be excluded by diepoxybutane (DEB) or equivalent testing on peripheral blood or
             marrow.

          2. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities consistent with pre-myelodysplastic syndrome
             (pre-MDS) or MDS on marrow examination (e.g. Monosomy 7).

          3. Presence of anti-donor HLA antibodies (positive anti-donor HLA antibody is defined as
             a positive cross-match test of any titer by complement-dependent cytotoxicity or flow
             cytometric testing or the presence of anti-donor HLA antibody to the high expression
             loci HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, or DPB1 with mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) &gt; 1000 by solid
             phase immunoassay).

          4. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          5. Prior solid organ transplant.

          6. Known life-threatening reaction (i.e., anaphylaxis) to Thymoglobulin® that would
             prohibit use for the patient as this study requires use of the Thymoglobulin®
             preparation of ATG.

          7. Uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection at the time of enrollment.
             Uncontrolled is defined as currently taking medication and with progression or no
