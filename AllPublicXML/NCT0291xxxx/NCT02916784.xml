      1. Were there differences in functional ability between ambulatory individuals with SCI who
           passed and failed the independent sit-to-stand (iSTS) task?

        2. Did the ability of iSTS relate to ability of walking as determined using a type of AAD
           used?

        3. What were factors associated with the ability of iSTS?

      -  To evaluate the proportion and compare functional abilities between subjects who passed
           and failed the independent sit-to-stand (iSTS) task.

        -  To assess the relationship between ability of iSTS and types of AAD used.

        -  To investigate factors associated with the ability of iSTS.

The ability was recorded as 'pass' if the subjects could safely rise from the chair without using their arms and with no more than contact guarding assist.</description>

        The study is conducted in subjects with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) who are able
        to walk independently with or without an ambulatory assistive device (AAD) from the
        Srinagarind hospital, KhonKaen University, Thailand.
