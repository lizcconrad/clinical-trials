      This study examines the outcomes of Let's Go, a standardized community mobility program which
      employs group and individual sessions of education, peer interaction, engagement in
      meaningful occupations, and self-reflections to help individuals understand the importance of
      community participation and its relationship to well-being. Program outcomes explored include
      increased confidence in community mobility, increased autonomy outdoors, social life and
      relationships, frequency of community trips, and decreased social isolation.

    <measure>Change in Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire-Autonomy Outdoors Sub scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks (program end), 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The IPAQ measures an individual's perception of the impact of chronic disability on participation, has good responsiveness and its content, construct, and discriminant validity as well as internal consistency are deemed adequate and verified by Rasch analysis (Magasi &amp; Post, 2010). The content validity of the autonomy outdoors subscale (α = .81) and social life and relationships scale (α = .86) are strong. Internal reliability of the IPAQ on all subscales is high (all Cronbach's alphas &gt;0.8). The individual items on the AO subscale have a test-retest reliability ranging from .69 to .84 and those on the SL subscale ranged from Kw = .71 to .77 (Cardol et al., 1999, Sibley et al., 2006).</description>
