    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2/3 open label, multicenter trial testing blinatumomab monotherapy for the
      treatment of subjects with Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) aggressive B-NHL not achieving CMR after
      2 cycles of standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1. This study
      incorporates multiple interim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded sample-size
      re-estimation. In the phase 3 part of the study, blinatumomab will be compared to
      Investigator's Choice chemotherapy.

      This is a phase 2/3 open label, multicenter trial testing blinatumomab monotherapy for the
      treatment of subjects with R/R aggressive B-NHL not achieving CMR after standard
      platinum-based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1. This study incorporates multiple
      interim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded sample-size re-estimation. In the
      phase 3 part of the study, blinatumomab will be compared to IC chemotherapy.The phase 2
      component of the study will consist of up to a 28-day screening period, approximately 70 to
      112 days of study treatment, a 30-day (+/- 3days) safety follow up, and long-term follow up
      that will conclude with the final analysis of the phase 3 component, estimated at 30 months
      after initiation of the phase 3 component. For the phase 3 component, the study will consist
      of up to a 28-day screening period, a treatment period of up to approximately 168 days, a
      30-day safety follow-up visit, and long-term follow up. Long-term follow up will conclude
      with the final analysis.In the phase 2 component, enrolled subjects will receive blinatumomab
      monotherapy. In the phase 3 component, enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      blinatumomab or IC chemotherapy.

    <measure>Phase 2 Duration of Response</measure>

    <description>Duration of response (DOR): calculated only for subjects who achieve an objective response rate (ORR.) The duration will be calculated from the date a response, complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR), is first achieved until the earliest date of a disease assessment indicating a relapse event or death, whichever occurs first. Subjects who do not 2 Years have a relapse event will be censored on their last disease assessment date. If the last disease assessment date is after the date that triggers the analysis, the subject will be censored at the analysis trigger date. A sensitivity analysis will censor subjects who receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at the time of HSCT unless there is no assessment after the HSCT, in which case the last assessment prior to the HSCT will be used as the censoring time.</description>
