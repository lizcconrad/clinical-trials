  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm phase II trial assessing the potential activity of combination PEGPH20
      plus Gemcitabine with radiotherapy in ten patients with localized, unresectable pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot trial evaluating the safety and potential efficacy of PEGylated Recombinant
      Human Hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) plus concurrent Gemcitabine and radiotherapy. Recognizing that
      PEGPH20 has not been previously delivered with radiotherapy but is unlikely to contribute to
      increased toxicities, this trial will have an abbreviated sequential dose escalation schema
      for the first three patients. PEGPH20 will be given twice per week for the first 28 days and
      then weekly for another 2 weeks during radiotherapy. Gemcitabine will be delivered weekly at
      the first day of radiotherapy and continued weekly, per published literature. Patients will
      remain on study for three months. The duration of active treatment with PEGPH20 and
      Gemcitabine plus radiotherapy will continue for 5-6 weeks. Efficacy outcome will occur 6-8
      weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.

    <description>Adverse events will be assessed weekly, from Day1 Treatment through up to 8 weeks after the end of treatment. Safety will be assessed during the study by evaluation of AEs, clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry (including C-reactive protein [CRP]), coagulation, urinalysis, and PEGPH20 immunogenicity), vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and physical examinations.
The severity of AEs will be graded by Investigators using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03</description>

             systemic therapy;

         10. Patient has known infection with HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;

         11. Patient has a history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the agents they are
             supposed to receive (or to any of the excipients for those agents);

         12. Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems such
             that the investigator considers it unsafe for the patient to receive an experimental
             research drug, these can include New York Heart Association Functional Class ≥ 3,
             myocardial infarction within the past 12 months before screening, pre-existing atrial
             fibrillation, symptomatic COPD.
