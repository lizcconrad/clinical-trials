  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) can be experienced by individuals with Prostate Cancer (PC),
      which can have profound effects on their well-being. Although physical activity has been
      shown to improve CRF, the recommended levels are generally not met. Step count and distance
      traveled information can help individuals to increase their physical activity. Wearable
      technology (WEAR) provides the user with feedback of their physical activity which can
      motivate behaviour change. Similarly, education workshops (EDU) on the effects of sedentary
      behaviour and physical activity may also reduce sedentary behaviour.

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of WEAR and EDU on sedentary
      behaviour and CRF, and to explore the feasibility of WEAR in this population. Participants in
      this study will be randomly assigned into WEAR, EDU, WEAR+EDU, or control over a three-month
      intervention. Assessments at baseline, post-intervention and a 3-month follow up will
      evaluate CRF, quality of life and level of sedentary behaviour, and use of WEAR devices.

      The results from this study will provide evidence-based knowledge on the impact of WEAR and
      EDU on sedentary behaviour and CRF, and an understanding on the use of technology within the
      PC population. These results can shape the development of programming for CRF and the use of
      scale-able technology-based interventions/approaches in this population.

    <description>Participants will be allowed to choose one of three wearable devices (FitBit, Garmi or Polar), for the wearable technology intervention. Once the participant has chosen their wearable device they will be oriented to their chosen device, platform to obtain information from the device, as well as a guide with ideas for reducing sedentary behaviour. Participants will be asked to wear the devices every day during waking hours.</description>

    <description>The Online Educational Group will be asked to participate in 6 online workshops that will occur during the 12-week intervention. Adobe connect software will be used to implement these workshops which allows for interaction between participants and leader. Workshops will focus on specific aspects related to reducing sedentary behaviours and increasing PA time. Each workshop will be developed by study coordinator/author (MO) and constructed using Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), ensuring the themes such as self-efficacy, self-control and reinforcements are within each topic. EDU topics will include motivation, goal setting, and activities and ways to reduce sedentary behaviour.</description>
