      This research study is studying nivolumab, an investigational drug, in combination with
      ipilimumab, also an investigational drug, as a possible treatment for Squamous Cell Carcinoma
      of the oral cavity.

      The following drugs are involved in this study:

        -  Nivolumab (Opdivo™)

        -  Ipilimumab (Yervoy™)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate effectiveness (how well the drug/s work) of
      Nivolumab or Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab prior to standard of care surgery.

      Nivolumab and Ipilimumab are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the
      body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. Both nivolumab and Ipilimumab have been
      demonstrated to activate the immune system to attack cancer cells in laboratory studies and
      in patients with different types of cancers.

      Nivolumab (Opdivo ™) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
      treatment of metastatic melanoma (a type of skin cancer), and specific types of previously
      treated advanced lung and kidney cancers. Ipilimumab (Yervoy™) is approved by the FDA for the
      treatment of metastatic melanoma.

      Because Nivolumab and Ipilimumab help the immune system work in different ways, the
      combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab was tested in laboratory studies. The data from these
      studies suggested that giving the two drugs together could be of benefit to patients, and
      this was indeed found to be the case in patients with melanoma. The combination of Nivolumab
      and Ipilimumab is now FDA approved as treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma.
      However, the use of Nivolumab as well as Ipilimumab alone or in combination for the treatment
      of patients with head and neck cancer is not approved. Results from clinical trials
      investigating the safety and efficacy of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in patients with head and
      neck cancer are not available at this time.

      In the proposed study, either Nivolumab or the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab is
      being tested is being tested prior to surgery to remove cancers of the oral cavity. By
      stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells, these drugs may cause the cancer to
      decrease in size prior to surgery and prevent the cancer from coming back.

             after the last dose of investigational drug. WOCBP is defined as any woman or
             adolescent who has begun menstruation and is not post- menopausal. A post-menopausal
             woman is defined as a woman who is over the age of 45 and has not had a menstrual
             period for at least 12 months

          -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must agree to use any contraceptive method (see
             Appendix B) with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Men receiving nivolumab and
             who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a
             period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational product Women who are not of
             childbearing potential (ie, who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as
             azoospermic men do not require contraception)

        (≤ 4 × ULN for subjects with Gilbert's disease); Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 × ULN;
        Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances: if they have been disease-free for at least 2 years and are
             deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; or if
             diagnosed and treated within the past 2 years for cervical cancer in situ or basal
