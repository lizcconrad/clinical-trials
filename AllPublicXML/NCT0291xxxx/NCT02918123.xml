      Phase I clinical trial to evaluate safety of FURESTEM-CD Inj. in patients with moderate to
      severe in plaque-type psoriasis injection for 4weeks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, single center, randomized, open label, study of safety of FURESTEM-CD Inj.
      in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

      Approximately 9~18 subjects will be administrated FURESTEM-CD Inj.

      FURESTEM-CD Inj. is composed of allogeneic hUCB-MSC(human Umbilical Cord Blood
      derived-Mesenchymal Stem cell). hUCB-MSCs are mesenchymal stem cells from umbilical cord
      blood. Mesenchymal stem cells are well-known for immunosuppression, anti-inflammatory ability
      and capable of differentiating into a wide range of cell types. Therefore, FURSTEM-CD Inj.
      has huge possibility as cell therapy products for plaque-type Psoriasis patients.
