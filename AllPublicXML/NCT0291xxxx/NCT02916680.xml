      The overall objective is to establish that transplantation of allogeneic pancreatic islet
      cells into the anterior chamber of a severely visual impaired diabetic human eye is safe and
      does not cause ophthalmic or systemic complications. Furthermore, the change in insulin
      production, glucose control and hypoglycaemia awareness will be assessed.

      Investigators intend to transplant 4 Type 1 Diabetes mellitus patients with compromised
      vision in one or both eyes due to diabetic or other complications, and who have already
      received kidney transplantation (i.e., already on immunosuppression). Transplantation of
      allogeneic pancreatic human islets will be performed into the anterior chamber of a single
      eye with compromised vision. Since the recipients are already immunosuppressed due to
      maintenance therapy for the kidney graft, investigators will only use non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

      Only in case of uncontrolled reaction, steroid should be used under guidance of the
      ophthalmologists. Investigators will neither inject local immunosuppressive drugs nor change
      ongoing immunosuppressive medication in the pilot study.

      The overall objective is to establish that transplantation of allogeneic pancreatic islet
      cells into the anterior chamber of a severely visual impaired diabetic human eye is safe and
      does not cause ophthalmic or systemic complications. Furthermore, the change in insulin
      production, glucose control and hypoglycaemia awareness will be assessed.

      In this pilot study investigators aim to gain experience in the technique, to obtain
      preliminary data on the amount of insulin that can be expected per transplanted islet
      equivalent (IEQ) and observe possible local reactions. These data will help to design a
      future larger study in patients without visual impairment.
