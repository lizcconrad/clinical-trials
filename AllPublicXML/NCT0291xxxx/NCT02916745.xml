    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to assess the safety and feasibility of using a new
      developed bronchoscopic technology called electronavigational bronchoscopy to treat subjects
      with solid tumor in peripheral lung, who are inoperable or refused surgery. It will involve
      10 sites in USA and Canada. Participation will last 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer accounts for almost one-third of cancer deaths. Cancer screening strategies have
      the potential to achieve a 20% reduction in death rates. Newly developed bronchoscopic
      technologies (such as navigational bronchoscopy) have shown to enable physicians to safely
      reach lesions in peripheral regions of the lung and obtain diagnosis. This new technology may
      now potentially offer bronchoscopic therapeutic interventions, such as photodynamic therapy,
      to tumors that were previously unreachable due to their peripheral anatomic location.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a photosensitizing drug (a drug that is
      activated by light), called porfimer sodium (Photofrin®), and a light from a laser that emits
      no heat. This technique works to allow the medical doctor to specifically target and destroy
      abnormal or cancer cells while limiting damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation
      of the drug is done by lighting the abnormal area using a fiber optic device (very fine fiber
      [like a fishing line] that permits light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube called
      bronchoscope. The light activates the porfimer sodium, which is concentrated in the abnormal
      tissue, leading to its destruction.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if physicians can reach the tumors in the periphery
      of the lung via electronavigational bronchoscopy and deliver the photodynamic therapy by
      placing the optical fiber into the tumor.
