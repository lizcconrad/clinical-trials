    <textblock>
      This study compares the efficacy of two dental interventions in the treatment of cervical
      dentine sensitivity. The participants will be selected from adult dental patients registered
      at a general dental practice in West Sussex, UK. The participants will be split into 2
      groups. One group will receive the intervention of topical fluoride varnish application while
      the other group will receive a topical application of self-etching dentine bonding agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical Fluoride Varnish(TFV) and Self-Etching Dentine Bonding Agent (SEDBA) are both
      routinely used in dentistry in the management of cervical dentine sensitivity(CDS). Both
      interventions are topically applied and well tolerated by patients. The interventions differ
      in mechanism of action. TFV releases fluoride which is incorporated into the organic matrix
      of dentine making the dentine tubules less conductive. Dentinal tubules form the key conduit
      between stimulus and pain perception in the tooth. SEDBA differs in that it penetrates and
      occludes the tubules. It is light cured for an almost instant set time.
