    <textblock>
      This study consists of Part I and Part II. The purpose of Part I is to compare the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of verubecestat (MK-8931) following administration of a single oral dose of
      40 mg MK-8931 to participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency (HI) to that of healthy
      matched controls. A safety and pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed in order to support
      the decision to continue with part II. If a decision to continue with part II is made,
      participants with mild HI will be enrolled to receive a single oral dose of MK-8931 40mg. If
      any healthy participants from Part I do not meet the matching criteria for Part II additional
      healthy participants will be enrolled.
