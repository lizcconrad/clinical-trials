  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of DCL-101 to GoLYTELY in
      preparing the large bowel for colonoscopy. Additional secondary objectives will compare the
      safety of DCL-101 to GoLYTELY in preparing the large bowel for colonoscopy and compare the
      tolerability of DCL-101 to GoLYTELY in preparing the large bowel for colonoscopy.

             within 21 days prior to randomization

         15. Known to have an impaired gag reflex, or prone to regurgitation or aspiration

         16. Serious underlying disease that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with
             the subject's ability to participate fully in the study

         17. History of alcohol or drug abuse that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere
             with the subject's ability to comply with the study procedures
