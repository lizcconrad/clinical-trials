  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to provide preliminary data to describe serum
      acetaminophen-cysteine protein adduct (APAP-CYS) concentrations following therapeutic doses
      of acetaminophen in the setting of non-acetaminophen induced liver injury. This study will
      utilize hepatic embolization as a model of hepatic injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acetaminophen-cysteine protein adducts (APAP-CYS) are formed when acetaminophen is oxidized
      by CYP 2E-1. When hepatocytes die, these proteins are released into the serum and can be
      detected. APAP-CYS can therefore be an experimental biomarker of acetaminophen exposure. It
      is possible that massive necrosis of hepatocytes that contain APAP-CYS from therapeutic doses
      of acetaminophen can be misinterpreted as acetaminophen overdose as the cause of liver
      injury. This study aims to describe serum APAP-CYS concentrations in patients taking a
      therapeutic dose of acetaminophen who develop a liver injury from a cause other than
      acetaminophen. This study will seek to enroll subjects undergoing a hepatic embolization
      procedure to treat a secondary liver tumor. This procedure is a reproducible model of
      non-acetaminophen induced hepatic injury. A small number of subjects who are otherwise
      eligible to participate but are unwilling to take acetaminophen will be offered participation
      in the observational arm of the study. They will undergo the same assessments with the
      exception of acetaminophen dosing. Subjects willing to take acetaminophen will be asked to
      take extra strength acetaminophen (4g/day) for the 3 days prior to their embolization
      procedure. All subjects will be asked to keep a detailed medication diary for the three days
      prior and up to their embolization procedure. Blood samples for the measurement of APAP-CYS
      concentrations and markers of liver function will be collected prior to acetaminophen dosing,
      prior to the embolization procedure, and at several time points after the procedure.
