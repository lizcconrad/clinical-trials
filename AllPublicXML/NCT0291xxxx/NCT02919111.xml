  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are imaging patients with prostate cancer using a new PET imaging agent
      (Ga-68-PSMA-11) in order to evaluate it's ability to detection prostate cancer in patients
      with high risk disease prior to prostatectomy.

      Imaging and staging of prostate cancer is critical for surgical and treatment planning.
      Patients with suspected metastatic prostate cancer will be imaged using Gallium-68 labeled
      PSMA-11 in order to demonstrate its utility. The investigators plan to utilize this data to
      obtain further approvals of the Ga-68-PSMA-11 compound, so that this agent will become
      available for clinical imaging in prostate cancer patients. In the pre-prostatectomy
      population, the primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity for
      detection on nodal metastasis.

      This compound has been shown to be superior to choline based PET agents for the staging of
      prostate cancer, both Carbon-11 and Fluorine-18 compounds. But this compound was not patented
      and therefore no company or private entity will make the investment required to bring
      Ga-68-PSMA-11 to market. In the vacuum of availability, academic groups must take the lead in
      order to collect the necessary data for future FDA approval.

    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>Patients who have a positive node on imaging and on pathology will be considered a true-positive. Patients who have no nodes on imaging and pathology will be considered true- negatives. Patients with positive nodes on imaging and negative on pathology will be considered false positives and those with positive nodes on pathology but negative on imaging will be considered false negatives. Point estimate of the sensitivity will be calculated with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.</description>
