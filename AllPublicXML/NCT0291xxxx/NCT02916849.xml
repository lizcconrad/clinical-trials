  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This five arm feasibility study aims to promote self-management in strength and balance
      exercises among community-living older people. The research process, implementation
      strategies and procedures, acceptability of the exercise programs, perceived benefits of the
      programs, and the ecological validity, acceptability and ability to detect change of possible
      outcome measurements will be evaluated before a future randomized controlled trial. A
      comparison of two exercise programs will be performed; a) Safe Step, a mobile technology
      based exercise program with motivational strategies, developed by researchers in
      collaboration with older adults, and b) Otago Exercise Program (OEP), home exercises
      presented in a booklet. The older participants will be free to select either of the
      intervention programs and the selection process and outcome will be studied as part of the
      process evaluation.

      The participants in three of the arms (OEP, Safe Step, and Safe Step with mentors) will be
      recruited through advertisements in local papers and through posters and meetings at senior
      citizens organisations. In the fourth and fifth arms (OEP and Safe Step) the participants
      will be recruited from health care centres and their registered professionals with experience
      of greens prescriptions (Fysisk aktivitet på recept). All five groups, with at least 10
      participants in each, will be exercising for four months and will undergo testing at
      baseline, after two and four months and they will be asked to keep an exercise diary (digital
      or paper format) during the intervention.

    <description>Participants will be recruited informed and asked for participation in the study by health care professionals. If included in the study, and choosing the Safe Step exercise program as intervention, participants will be given a green prescription for exercise using the application Safe Step. After an introduction meeting in small groups and pre-assessments the participants will create an individual exercise programme containing ten balance and leg strengthening exercises in the application. During the four month intervention the participants will create weekly exercise plan, keep a digital exercise diary, and receive motivational feed-back within the system. The participants will be recommended to exercise at least three times per week and for at least 30 minutes at a time.</description>

    <description>Participants will be recruited informed and asked for participation in the study by health care professionals. If included in the study, and choosing the Otago Exercise Program as intervention in the study participants will be given a green prescription for exercise with the Otago Home Exercise Programme-booklet. After an introduction meeting in small groups and pre-assessments the participants will create an individual exercise programme containing ten balance and leg strengthening exercises using the booklet for guidance. During the four month intervention the participants will keep a paper-based exercise diary that will be sent to the researchers on a monthly basis. The participants will be recommended to exercise at least three times per week and for at least 30 minutes at a time.</description>

    <description>This arm is exactly the same as the Safe Step Advertising group except the participants will be invited to attend group meetings with peer mentors, once a month during the intervention. The peer mentors are older adults earlier involved in the research project . They will act as role models and encourage the participants throughout the four months of exercise.</description>
