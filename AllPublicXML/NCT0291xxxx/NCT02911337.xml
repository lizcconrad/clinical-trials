      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of an intensive, supervised, lifestyle
      modification program on symptoms and signs of heart failure as well as laboratory and
      echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function. This will be a 6 month trial in
      50 patients with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
      (HFpEF). Patients will be enrolled in the Medical University of South Carolina weight
      management 15 week lifestyle change program which will involve weekly visits that rotate
      among the clinical specialities (dietary, exercise and behavioral) and scheduled visits with
      the research Registered Nurse. Each patients baseline data will be used as the control and
      compared with the same measurements at the 6 month end point.
