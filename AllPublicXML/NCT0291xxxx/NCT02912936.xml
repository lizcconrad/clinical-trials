  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics/dynamics
      of a ketogenic dietary supplement containing medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) in patients
      with Alzheimer disease (AD). Novel imaging and laboratory biomarkers in response to this
      intervention will also be explored.
