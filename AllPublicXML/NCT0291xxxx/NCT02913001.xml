  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will examine changes in some hormonal markers associated
      with acne among adults with moderate/severe acne randomized to a low glycemic index and
      glycemic load diet or usual eating plan for two weeks.

      The objectives of this randomized controlled trial are to investigate the impact of a low
      glycemic index/load eating plan on endocrine aspects of acne. Specifically, this study will
      examine changes in blood biochemical markers of acne among adults with acne following a
      modified carbohydrate (low glycemic index/load) eating plan or their usual eating plan for
      two weeks. An external sponsor, Nutrisystem®, will provide some low glycemic index/load foods
      to the study participants randomized to the intervention group for two weeks. Study outcomes
      include changes in glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, insulin-like growth factor-1, and
      insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 concentrations.
