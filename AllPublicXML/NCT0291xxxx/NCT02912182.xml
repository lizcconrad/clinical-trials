    <textblock>
      Randomized placebo controlled trial on patients suffering from acute unilateral
      vestibulopathy. Patients will be randomized into 3 arms; 1) Placebo only, 2) Short
      corticosteroid treatment (3days) 3) Longer corticosteroid treatment (11 days).

      Vestibular function as well as subjective symptoms will be estimated in the acute stage and
      regularly up to one year after the debut.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized controlled trial in 3 arms to see if a short or a even shorter period of steroid
      treatment on patients diagnosed with vestibular neuritis can be as effective as the only
      comparable study thus far (Strupp et al, NEJM 22, 351(4) 354-61). If a shorter treatment with
      a lower dose has the same outcome, then more patients might be eligible for the treatment as
      many are excluded due to risk for adverse effects.

      Corticosteroid treatment in acute unilateral vestibulopathy has recently been the subject for
      a Cochrane review with the conclusion of insufficient evidence for treatment effect and
      recommend studies with subjective symptom based evaluation together with functional testing.

      Patients with acute unilateral vestibulopathy diagnosed within 48hrs after debut. The
      patients (after acceptance) will be randomized into either of 3 arms and will receive
      placebo/short treatment (3days)/standard treatment (in Sweden 11 days).

      Patients will record subjective symptoms according to Liknert scale during the acute stage
      and fill out enquiries after 3 and 12 months.

      Vestibular function will be assessed with caloric irrigation and video-Head-Impulse-Test
      (vHIT) as soon as possible after the debut and again after 1, 3 and 12 months.
