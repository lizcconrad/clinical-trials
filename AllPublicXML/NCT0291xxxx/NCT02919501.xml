    <description>The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a depression rating scale consisting of 10 items, each rated 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The 10 items represent the core symptoms of depressive illness. The rating should be based on a clinical interview with the patient, moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms to more detailed ones, which allow a precise rating of severity, covering the last 7 days. Total score from 0 to 60. The higher the score, the more severe, thus, a negative change (or decrease) from baseline indicates a reduction (or improvement) in symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a patient-rated scale designed to screen for anxiety and depressive states in medical patients. It consists of two sub-scales: the D-scale measures depression and the A-scale measures anxiety. Each sub-scale contains 7 items, and each item is rated from 0 (absent) to 3 (maximum severity). The score of each sub-scale ranges from 0 to 21.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - global improvement CGI-I provides the clinician's impression of the patient's improvement (or worsening). The clinician assesses the patient's condition relative to a baseline on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression severity of illness (CGI-S) provides the clinician's impression of the patient's current state of mental illness. The clinician uses his or her clinical experience of this patient population to rate the severity of the patient's current mental illness on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal - not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients</description>
