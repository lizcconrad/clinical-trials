    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized into
      two groups of 15, &quot;Routine Care&quot; group, which will serve as the control group, and
      &quot;Octreotide&quot; group. The amount of bronchial secretions is routinely measured in all
      mechanically ventilated patients. Once the Primary Team identifies a patient as a candidate
      for the study (based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria) and an informed consent has
      been obtained, the baseline volume of bronchial secretions per 12-hour period will be
      recorded and a security envelope containing group assignment will be opened by the ICU
      attending. Both groups will continue to receive treatments that have already been initiated
      to manage bronchial secretions. In addition, &quot;Octreotide&quot; group will receive parenteral
      octreotide, while &quot;Routine Care&quot; group will receive care as deemed necessary by the Primary
      Team. The rate of bronchial secretions will be measured and recorded daily; the changes,
      relative to the baseline measurements, will be compared between the groups. These
      interventions will be continued for 72 hours or until extubation or withdrawal from the
      study, whichever occurs earlier. Subsequently, the standard of care management, as determined
      by the Primary Team, will be resumed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are being weaned from mechanical ventilation

          -  Excessive bronchial secretions (over 200 ml/24 hours) is deemed by the Primary Team to
             be a major barrier to extubation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to octreotide

          -  Persistent bradycardia (HR &lt; 60)

          -  Mobitz type II or 3rd degree heart block in patients without a pacemaker

          -  Patients being treated with intravenous agents for hypertensive urgency or emergency

          -  Surgical patients

          -  Initiation of therapy with systemic or inhaled steroids within 72 hours prior to the
             enrollment into the study, as these may further change the rate of secretions*

          -  Initiation of therapy with systemic or inhaled anticholinergics within 48 hours prior
             to the enrollment into the study, as these may further change the rate of secretions
