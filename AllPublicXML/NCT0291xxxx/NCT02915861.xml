    <textblock>
      This is an observational study of patients with scrub typhus (rapid diagnostic
      test/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RDT/qPCR) positive) and an inoculation eschar
      present on examination, recruited from Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital, North of Thailand.

      In this study, we aim to:

        -  Investigate relevant pathogen dissemination dynamics, early innate immune response, and
           pathogen-host interactions in scrub typhus using a minimal set of easily accessible
           samples; the inoculation eschar (crust or biopsy), whole blood and - where possible - a
           lymph node fine-needle aspiration (FNA).

        -  Determine the potential use of the inoculation eschar for improving early diagnostics
           and assessing the diversity of human pathogenic strains; by evaluating non-invasive
           swabs and scrapings, as well as biopsies for molecular diagnostics templates.

        -  Dissect the underlying patho-biology associated with the inoculation eschar and in a
           subgroup, including the draining lymph node; by defining the spectrum of infected cells
           via microscopy and double-immune labeling; by determining cytokine and RNA gene
           expression profiles in blood peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) and eschar
           samples.

      Scrub typhus patients will be recruited into the scrub typhus patient (EXP) arm of the study.
      There will be 3 sub-groups:

        -  EXPa (n=12) will have blood and non-invasive eschar samples collected (consent to study,
           declined biopsy).

        -  EXPb (n=12) will have blood, non-invasive eschar samples, and an eschar biopsy collected
           (consent to study, draining lymph node (LN) inaccessible).

        -  EXPc (n=12) will have blood, non-invasive eschar samples, eschar biopsy, and LN FNA
           collected (consent to study, draining LN accessible).

      Samples will be collected at baseline (all) and 2 weeks (blood only).

      Control participants will be recruited into the scrub typhus control.

      - EXC (n=12) are healthy individuals, attending hospital for elective/minor surgery or
      treatment of minor skin injury, and normally reside in a scrub typhus endemic region. Blood
      and a skin sample will be collected at baseline only.
