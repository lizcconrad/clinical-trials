  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to investigate the feasibility of home based
      inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on chronic hypercapnia in patients with severe COPD, and to
      examine the relationship between inspiratory muscle strength and carbon dioxide level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of chronic hypercapnia in patients with COPD indicates an imbalance of
      increased ventilatory work caused by hyperinflation and airway resistance and a decreased
      inspiratory muscle reserve, probably caused by diaphragm- dysfunction. The inspiratory muscle
      strength can be trained by a devise, which provides a resistance to inspiration.

      This study will be conducted as an a feasibility study and will examine whether inspiratory
      muscle training with a Power Breathe device (K3) is possible over a 6 week period in patients
      with COPD and chronic hypercapnia (pCO2 &gt; 6 kilo pascal).

      IMT will be considered as feasible if 80% of the planned training sessions have been
      completed, and if the maximum inspiratory strength improves by an average of 10% from MIP and
      if patients do not experience any discomfort or increased dyspnea during training.

      The training of the respiratory strength is carried out daily with an electronic handheld
      device (Power Breathe K3) and will consist of 2x30 inspirations per day with the resistance
      adjusted individually and progressively with a pressure of 30 - 50% of maximal inspiratory
      pressure. Training will take place in the home.
