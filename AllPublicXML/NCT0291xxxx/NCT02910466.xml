  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hypoparathyroidism is a life-long and irreversible disease for which the chronic
      administration of rhPTH(1-84) is a potential treatment option. The group of participants in
      the AAAE0544 core study has been taking rhPTH(1-84) for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism
      for up to 11 years. This study is designed to extend this experience and gain knowledge about
      how safe and effective rhPTH(1-84) is in participants with hypoparathyroidism over a
      long-term duration.

             (PTH) concentration.

          5. Able to perform daily subcutaneous self-injections of study medication (or have
             designee perform injection).

             contraindicates participation in the study.

          3. The participant and/or the participant's parent(s) or legally-authorized
             representative(s) is unable to understand the nature, scope, and possible consequences

          4. The participant is unable to comply with the protocol, eg, uncooperative with protocol
             schedule, refusal to agree to all of the study procedures, inability to return for
             evaluations, or is otherwise unlikely to complete the study, as determined by the
             investigator or the medical monitor.

          5. The participant is pregnant or lactating.

          6. Participants who are at increased baseline risk for osteosarcoma such as participants
             with Paget's disease of bone or unexplained elevations of alkaline phosphatase,
             participants with hereditary disorders predisposing to osteosarcoma or participants
             with a prior history of external beam or implant radiation therapy involving the
