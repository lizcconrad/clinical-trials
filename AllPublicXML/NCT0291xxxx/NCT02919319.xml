  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this first-into-man study were to investigate the safety, tolerability
      and the pharmacokinetic profile of single oral doses of ACT-541468 in healthy male adults.
      Pharmacodynamic effects (through a battery of Central Nervous System tests) were also
      assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consisted of ascending dose groups; each dose group was investigated in a new group
      of 8 healthy male subjects (6 on active drug and 2 on placebo). In addition, the study
      included a biocomparison part (dose group 2), an absolute bioavailability part (dose group
      4), and a mass balance / metabolism part (dose group 3).
