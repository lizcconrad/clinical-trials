    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a study to compare the
      patient recorded and clinical outcomes for the surgical management of Hallux Valgus
      correction. A prospective trial will randomise the patients into two groups - Open Scarf/Akin
      osteotomy and Minimally Invasive Chevron/Akin osteotomy.

      This study will assess the feasibility of a prospective trial that would randomise the
      patients into two groups for surgical correction of Hallux Valgus - Open Scarf/Akin osteotomy
      and Minimally Invasive Chevron/Akin osteotomy. Patients will complete a validated
      questionnaire (Manchester Oxford Foot questionnaire) preoperatively and post operatively at 6
      months and 1 year. Range of motion of the Great Toe Metatarsal Phalangeal Joint will also be
      measured by goniometer. This study will assess the ability to recruit and retain patients and
      thus determine if a study comparing the surgical techniques would be feasible. In addition,
      for data collected statistical differences of the change in patient reported outcomes, range
      of motion between the two groups will be calculated with a significance level of p&lt;0.05. This
      study will assess if a larger study comparing minimally invasive to open Hallux Valgus
      correction would be able to be performed

             and MICA procedures.

          -  Patients with the capacity to provide informed consent.

          -  Patients who have, in addition to Hallux Valgus Deformity, lesser toe deformities
             requiring correction distal to the metatarsal phalangeal joint at time of procedure.

          -  Patients without significant other mid foot or hind foot pathology

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under 18 years of age

          -  Patients with severity of Hallux valgus deformity necessitating Open procedure

          -  Patients with significant co-morbidities that would increase the risk of surgery

          -  Patients unable to understand or complete questionnaires.

          -  Patients without the capacity to provide informed consent.
