      This study aims to compare antibiotic treatment versus surgery for patients with
      uncomplicated appendicitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients aged 16 and over, with a first admission with right iliac
      fossa pain and a raised white cell count or C-reactive protein. Patients will be randomised
      electronically in a 1:1 ratio either to undergo emergency appendectomy or to receive
      intravenous antibiotics as an inpatient, until clinical and biochemical improvement is
      observed, followed by outpatient oral antibiotics. Those who have surgery will have 3
      post-operative doses of intravenous antibiotics, unless perforation was identified at the
      time of surgery, in which case, microbiology will be contacted to advise regarding antibiotic
      choice and duration. Follow-up by telephone interview will be at 1 week, 1, 3 and 12-month
      intervals.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Successful treatment of appendicitis</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Successful treatment is defined as the resolution of appendicitis resulting in discharge from the hospital and no recurrent appendicitis during the one-year follow-up. The number of patients requiring surgery for appendicitis in the non-operative group will be measured.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late recurrence of appendicitis</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed appendicitis occurring after discharge and within one year of enrolment. The number of patients with appendicitis confirmed on either imaging or pathology will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clostridium difficile infection</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Confirmed symptomatic clostridium difficile infection occurring within one year of enrolment. Any patient who presents with diarrhea during the follow-up period or reports diarrhea during assessment with the follow-up questionnaire will be asked to provide a stool sample which will be tested for clostridium difficile toxins.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Need for re-admission or repeat imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Recurrence or non-resolution of abdominal pain requiring re-admission or re-imaging after discharge and within one year of enrolment. The number of patients who need to be re-admitted to hospital for abdominal pain or require ultrasound, MRI or CT for investigation of abdominal pain during the one year follow-up will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured in both treatment groups at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year post enrolment. Quality of life will be measured using the EQ-5D-3L validated quality of life questionnaire.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complication of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Complications of treatment including surgical site infection, abscess formation and ongoing pain will be measured.</description>

The patient will receive inpatient intravenous antibiotics until sufficient clinical improvement is noted by the surgical team, who will be assessing the patient twice daily. After discharge the patient will receive 5 further days of oral antibiotics.</description>
