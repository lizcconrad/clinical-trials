  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment, women receive hormone stimulation with
      gonadotropins to induce growth of several ovarian follicles. Selecting the optimal dosage of
      gonadotropin is important to avoid maturation of too few or too many follicles, which may
      impair the chances of treatment success, lead to treatment cancellation, or serious side
      effects.

      Motivated by the lack of standardised procedures to estimate the optimal dosage of
      gonadotropins, a patient-specific test has been developed to predict the optimal hormone
      dosage. By measuring internalisation of gonadotropin by the patient's monocytes isolated form
      the peripheral blood ex vivo, the Gonadotropin Removal Test determines whether a patient
      needs increased or reduced hormon doses.

      In this clinical study the investigators compare deviation from optimal outcome at oocyte
      pick-up day in two patient groups. Optimal outcome of stimulation is defined as 10 oocytes
      collected in the group of patients matching the inclusion criteria of the study.

      The control group receives starting hormone dosage assigned by the clinician according to
      standard clinical procedures. The intervention group receives starting hormone dosage
      adjusted according to the results of the Gonadotropin Removal Test.
