    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that subjects undergoing liver resection and who are exposed
      preoperatively to high illuminance blue spectrum light will exhibit reduced organ injury,
      specifically liver dysfunction, than subjects exposed to standard ambient white fluorescent
      light.

    <description>Illumination: High illumination lighting will be instituted with a Day*Light Classic Light (Uplift Technologies, Dartmouth, NS)
Blue wavelength: Each subject will be fitted with blue filtered goggles (Lee Filters, Burbank, CA). These goggles ensure the transmission of a bright (1700 lux) blue (peak 442 nm) spectrum light when the subject is within 12 inches.
Photoperiod: A 24-hour photoperiod will be used that commences at 0800 the morning prior to surgery and continues for 24 hours. To account for potential variability in the exposure of interest, each subject will complete a diary to catalogue duration and distance of light exposure. Postoperatively the same photoperiod will be instituted and continued for one 24 hour period.</description>
