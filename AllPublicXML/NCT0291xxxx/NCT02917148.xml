      The goal of this research proposal is to identify a miRNA expression profile as a biomarker
      to diagnose and predict acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) in patients who undergo
      allogeneic transplantation. This biomarker, once identified, will need validation in larger
      cohorts.

      Human subjects that volunteer to participate in this study will be requested to have
      approximately 20 cc of blood drawn (about 12 tablespoons) at several time intervals. These
      time intervals include prior to conditioning regimen for transplant, the day of
      transplantation, day +30, +60 and +100 after transplantation. If a given subject develops
      acute graft-versus-host disease, a blood sample will be obtained at that time as well. The
      amount of blood samples collected in an 8 week period will not exceed 50 ml and collection
      will not occur more than twice a week. There will be no pregnant women or children involved
      in the investigators study.

      All patients involved in the study will be undergoing bone marrow transplant and pregnancy
      screening is done in pre-transplant testing. This blood will be collected in lavender top,
      EDTA tubes; some plasma (or serum) may be collected and stored for additional analysis.

      This blood will be collected in lavender top, EDTA tubes; some plasma (or serum) may be
      collected and stored for additional analysis.

      Plasma and serum samples from all patients will be frozen at -20 o C immediately after
      collection. RNAs will be extracted from plasma using Ambion RecoverAll kits, according to the
      directions provided by the manufacturer. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
      reaction (qRT-PCR) will be performed on the samples as well. 754 microRNAs will be tested
      using ABI OpenArray platform.
