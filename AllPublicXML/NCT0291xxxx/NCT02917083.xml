  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subject has a type of lymph gland cancer called Lymphoma.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:
      antibodies and T cells. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting
      blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with
      germs. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they both
      have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. Investigators hope
      that both will work better together.

      Investigators have found from previous research that they can put a new gene into T cells
      that will make them recognize cancer cells and kill them. They now want to test whether these
      genetically modified T cells given after chemotherapy will be more effective at killing
      cancer cells.

      The gene that will be put into the T cells makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody
      sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30.
      Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma, but have not been strong
      enough to cure most patients.

      For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so that instead of floating free in
      the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way
      it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cells (CD30.CAR T
      cells) seem to kill some of the tumor, but they don't last very long and so their chances of
      fighting the cancer are unknown.

      Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to multiply and grow to
      accomplish their functions, and that this may not happen if there are too many other T cells
      in circulation. Because of that, doctors may use chemotherapy drugs to decrease the level of
      circulating T cells prior to the CD30.CAR T cells infusion. This is called &quot;lymphodepletion&quot;.

      CD30.CAR T cells have previously been studied in lymphoma patients. What is new for this
      study is that lymphodepletion chemotherapy will be administered in patients who are not post
      autologous transplant in the hope that it will result in more durable anti-tumor effects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prepare the CD30.CAR T cells, research staff will take some blood from the subject. This
      would be drawn as 2 (two) separate blood collections.

      Alternatively, if the subject's blood counts are low, staff may collect the cells needed to
      prepare T cells by a pheresis procedure. This procedure will involve placing a needle in both
      arms, collecting the cells over 3 to 6 hours during which the subject will be required to lie
      relatively still.

      After the T cells have been collected, some of them will be activated stimulating them with
      antibodies and will then be infected with a retroviral vector (a special virus that can
      carries a new gene into cells) containing a new gene called anti-CD30 that will make an
      antibody to lymphoma cells. The trained cells are called CD30.CAR T cells. Then, the cells
      will be tested to make sure that they kill lymphoma cells that express the CD30 antigen and
      not normal cells.

      The cells generated will be frozen and stored to give back to the subject.

      This is a dose escalation study. This means that at the beginning, patients will be started
      on the lowest doses (1 of 3 different levels) of CD30.CAR T Cells. Once that dose schedule
      proves safe, the next group of patients will be started at a higher dose. This process will
      continue until all 3 dose levels are studied. If the side effects are too severe, the dose
      will be lowered or the T cell infusions will be stopped. The risks of harm and discomfort
      from the study treatment may bear some relationship to the dose level. The potential for
      direct benefit, if any, may also vary with the dose level.

      Subjects will be given one injection of CD30.CAR T cells. The injection will be on Day 0. The
      subject may be given a dose of Benadryl and Tylenol before the injection of T cells to
      minimize any possible allergic reaction. The injection will take 1-10 minutes. The subject
      will be monitored in the clinic after each injection for up to 3 hours.

      If the subject is not post autologous transplant they will receive treatment with
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy drugs) before the CD30.CAR T cells. These
      drugs will decrease the numbers of the patient's T cells before the CD30.CAR T cells are
      infused. Although the investigators do not expect any effect on the tumor with the dose that
      the patient will receive, these drugs are part of many regimens that are used to treat
      lymphoma or leukemia.

      To learn more about the way the CD30.CAR T cells are working and how long they last in the
      body, extra blood will be drawn. On the day that the subject receives the cells, blood will
      be taken before the cells are given and several hours afterwards. Other blood will be drawn
      at 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks (optional), 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks, every 3 months for 1
      year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years.
