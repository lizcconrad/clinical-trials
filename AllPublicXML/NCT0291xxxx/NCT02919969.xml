      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for advanced anal
      cancer.

      The following intervention will be involved in this study:

      -Pembrolizumab

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for Advanced
      Anal Cancer, but it has been approved for other uses.

      Pembrolizumab, also known as KEYTRUDA or MK-3475, is approved in the USA and several other
      countries to treat a type of skin cancer called Malignant Melanoma.

      In this research study the investigators are studying an investigational drug called
      Pembrolizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are manmade and mimic
      proteins in the immune system by attaching to specific proteins in the body. T cells are
      cells in the immune system that are controlled by PD-1. PD-1 is a protein on the T cells that
      prevent the body from overproducing T cells. Pembrolizumab targets PD-1, attaches to it and
      blocks its action. By preventing PD-1 from working, T cell production rises and the body's
      immune system may increase its action against Cancer cells. Clinical and laboratory studies
      using pembrolizumab suggest that pembrolizumab may be useful in shrinking certain tumors.

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

             specialist.

             expert consultant. Patients with hepatitis B are required to be treated with anti-HBV

             and/or ongoing hepatitis C treatment.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
