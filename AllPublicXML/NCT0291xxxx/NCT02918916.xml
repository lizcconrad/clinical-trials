      Introduction: Recent studies have shown positive results from the application of phototherapy
      for the improvement of performance and acceleration of the recovery process both in the
      application before and after exercise. However, the effects of phototherapy during combined
      training and after a primary adaptation process remain unclear.

      Research objectives: The primary objective of the study is to analyze and compare the effects
      of phototherapy using different light sources (laser and light emmiting diode - LED)
      interacting with combined training on clinical, functional, and psychological outcomes and
      vascular endothelial growth factor. The secondary objective is to compare the benefits
      provided by phototherapy in participants with different levels of training adaptation.

      Design: A controlled trial, double-blind, placebo-controlled will be conducted with
      stratified randomization and concealed allocation.

      Participants and Setting: After fulfilling the eligibility criteria, forty-five male
      participants will participate in the study.

      Procedure: In phase 1, the participants will perform six-weeks of combined training (sprints
      and squats). In phase 2, participants will be allocated, through stratified randomization
      (based on adaptation capacity to training), into three groups: active phototherapy group
      (AG), placebo phototherapy group (PG), and control group (CG). A new six-week training period
      will then start. In this phase the participants will carry out training normally with the
      adjusted loads and between sprints and squats will receive the recovery strategy related to
      the group to which they belong.

      Intervention: Active and placebo phototherapy will be applied by a trained therapist, between
      sprints and squats. During the period of recovery strategies for the AG and PG, the CG
      participants will remain seated for passive recovery, supervised by an independent therapist.

      Measurements: The measurements include clinical, functional, and psychological outcomes and
      vascular endothelial growth factor.

      factor. The secondary objective is to compare the benefits provided by phototherapy in
      participants with different levels of training adaptation.

      Design: A controlled trial, double-blind, placebo-controlled will be conducted with
      stratified randomization and concealed allocation.

      Participants and Setting: After fulfilling the eligibility criteria, forty-five male
      participants will participate in the study. The inclusion criteria include: healthy male,
      aged between 18-30 years who agree to participate in the study. Participants with the
      following will be excluded from the study: presence of anemia, inflammation, diabetes,
      history of metastasis or muscle injury in the lower limbs or spine in the previous six
      months, and occurrence of musculoskeletal injury during the study.

      Procedure: In phase 1, the participants will perform six-weeks of combined training (sprints
      and squats). In phase 2, participants will be allocated, through stratified randomization
      (based on adaptation capacity to training), into three groups: active phototherapy group
      (AG), placebo phototherapy group (PG), and control group (CG). A new six-week training period
      will then start. In this phase the participants will carry out training normally with the
      adjusted loads and between sprints and squats will receive the recovery strategy related to
      the group to which they belong.

      Intervention: Active and placebo phototherapy will be applied by a trained therapist, between
      sprints and squats, bilaterally to six sites of the quadriceps in direct contact with the
      skin. The dosage applied will be 30J per site. The same procedures as the AG will be applied
      to the PG, however the emitter will be disabled. During the period of recovery strategies for
      the AG and PG, the CG participants will remain seated for passive recovery, supervised by an
      independent therapist.

      Measurements: The measurements include clinical (muscle soreness, pain threshold, perception
      of exertion, and perception of recovery), functional (squat strength and power, maximal
      voluntary isometric contraction, maximal incremental test, squat jump, and sprint test), and
      psychological (self-assessments of readiness for exercise, fatigue, vigor, pain, and belief
      of intervention effectiveness) outcomes and vascular endothelial growth factor.

      Analysis: For analysis of functional outcomes, data normality will be checked by the
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with changes from baseline followed by the Student T test for
      comparisons. For other outcomes, sphericity of the data will be tested by the Mauchly's test.
      In case of violation of the sphericity assumption, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections will be
      used. Data will be analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance (Bonferroni's test
      will be performed when required), which provide information on time, group, and interaction
      effects. A significance level of 5% will be assumed for all statistical analysis.

    <description>Prior to the MVIC evaluation, participants will conduct a warm up consisting of 10 repetitions of knee flexion-extension at 180°.s-1 throughout the range of motion. The MIVC will be determined by the highest maximal isometric torque over three contractions of five seconds at 60° of knee flexion (with 0° corresponding to the maximum extension). The repetitions will be separated by a 2-minute rest interval. Participants will be instructed to perform maximal contractions and verbally encouraged by the researcher during the evaluation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle soreness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-week, after 6-week, 12-week, after 13-week of training</time_frame>
    <description>Values of muscle soreness will be obtained through a visual analog scale (VAS), with 10-points, with 'zero' corresponding to absence of soreness and '10' to the maximum level supported by the participant, as described previously. Participants will be asked about the presence of soreness in the lower limbs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 5-week, after 6-week, 12-week, after 13-week of training</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the pain threshold, pressure algometry will be applied at five specific sites of the quadriceps. The participant will be placed in the supine position and the markers will be carried out in the dominant leg. The sites will be located using the reference system, which primarily identifies two anatomic points: anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and upper pole of the patella (UPP). Thus, the sites assessed will be: 15 cm distal to the ASIS, 4 cm proximal to the UPP, mean point between the ASIS and UPP, and 2 cm lateral and medial to the mean point.
Pain threshold will be defined in Kgf through the minimal pressure required to induce a pain sensation or discomfort. Participants will be instructed to signal when the pressure sensation becomes discomfort. The pressure will not exceed 2.55 Kgf.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perception of exertion</measure>

    <time_frame>Baseline, before 5-week, before 12-week of training</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a psychological questionnaire that aims to document, subjectively, the readiness for exercise, fatigue, vigor, sleepiness, and pain. Participants will be instructed to mark an &quot;X&quot; on a 10-cm visual analog scale between two extremes, with 'zero' corresponding to 'least possible' and '10' 'most possible' for each rating.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Belief questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>After 6-week, after 13-week of training</time_frame>
    <description>After phase 1, participants will answer a belief questionnaire to measure their 'belief' in the effectiveness of the technique. Participants will be instructed to mark an &quot;X&quot; on a 5-point Likert Scale, with 'zero' corresponding to 'not effective' and 'ten' to 'extremely effective'.
After application of the recovery techniques, the participants will complete a similar questionnaire to measure their perceived effectiveness of the technique.</description>
