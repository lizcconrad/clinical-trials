  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of autologous
      mononuclear cells (MNS) collected from bone marrow (BM) and using an add-on intramyocardial
      delivery for individuals with Ebstein anomaly undergoing surgical intervention compared to
      the control group undergoing the same surgical procedure without cell delivery. This add-on
      procedure has the potential to foster a new strategy for individuals with congenital heart
      disease.This is an open-label study of autologous MNC derived from bone marrow with a 2-year
      follow-up to document 1) incidence and severity of adverse event and 2) monitor changes in
      cardiac structure and function.

    <textblock>
      This study is an open label Phase I trial to determine the safety and feasibility of bone
      marrow-derived mononuclear cells to the right ventricle of subjects with Ebstein anomaly at
      the time of a planned surgical Ebstein repair compared to the control group undergoing the
      same planned surgical intervention without the cell delivery add-on procedure. Subjects will
      be screened at outpatient clinic visits at Mayo Clinic and interested qualified subjects will
      be consented and offered participation in this trial. Subject/Family will decide to
      participate in cell delivery or control arm. Once informed consent has been obtained,
      subjects will undergo identical evaluation (other than Hematology consultation and BM harvest
      occurring only in the cell-treatment group),preoperative values will be established/confirmed
      and a selection committee will review subjects within three days prior to planned procedure
      to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria. This will require a non-study cardiologist to
      review the clinical case and confirm the baseline cardiac function with evidence of right
      ventricle dysfunction. However, individuals at high-risk, primarily neonates and those with
      preoperative advanced right heart failure will NOT be included such that the risk of this
      add-on procedure may not be acceptable. Following surgical Ebstein repair for the control
      group and following cell-based product delivery for the treatment group, all subjects will be
      followed for 24-months according to a pre-determined schedule that includes imaging studies
      along with a questionnaire, electrophysiology and laboratory studies at 1, 6, and 24 months
      post procedure. All subjects will be contacted for surveillance by phone at 3, 12, and 18
      month post procedure.
