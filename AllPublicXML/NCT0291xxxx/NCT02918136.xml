    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-site, safety and efficacy study in subjects with
      rotator cuff injuries.

      Patients will fall into two categories: treatment group (12 subjects) and non-treatment or
      control group (six subjects). The treatment group will undergo a small liposuction procedure
      and receive rotator cuff repair treatment with an ultrasound-guided injection of 5cc
      adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) into the point of injury. The control group will receive a
      5cc cortisone injection into the point of injury

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females 30-75 years of age.

          2. Clinical symptoms consistent with a rotator cuff lesion including but not limited to
             pain, muscle weakness, or active-limited range of motion (AROM).

          3. Subjects who have not responded to physical therapy treatments for at least six weeks.

          4. Subjects with &gt; 70% passive range of motion (PROM).

          5. Diagnosed with &gt;50% tear to supraspinatus muscle or &lt; 5mm separation assessed by MRI.

          6. Diagnosed with a partial-thickness rotator cuff tear

          7. The ability of subjects to give appropriate consent or have an appropriate
             representative available.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt;30 or &gt; 75

          2. Insufficient amount of subcutaneous tissue to allow recovery of 50cc of lipoaspirate.

          3. History of systemic malignant neoplasms within last 5 years.

          4. History of local neoplasm within the last 6 months and any history of local neoplasm
             at site of administration.

          5. Subject is receiving immunosuppressant therapy or has known immunosuppressive or
             severe autoimmune disease that requires chronic immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., human
             immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.).

          6. Subjects who are known to be HIV positive

          7. Patients who have received a corticosteroid injection in rotator cuff site within last
             3 months

          8. Severe arthrosis of the glenohumeral or acromioclavicular joint

          9. Irreparable rotator cuff tear (including rotator cuff tear arthropathy)

         10. Fatty atrophy above Grade 2 in affected shoulder

         11. Previous shoulder surgeries in affected shoulder

         12. History of tobacco use within the last 3 months

         13. Any contraindications to MRI scan according to MRI guidelines, or unwillingness to
             undergo MRI procedures

         14. Patients on an active regimen of chemotherapy

         15. Patients with a documented history of liver disease or an ALT value &gt;400

         16. Allergy to sodium citrate of any &quot;caine&quot; type of local anesthetic

         17. Patients pregnant or breast feeding

         18. Subject is in the opinion of the Investigator or designee, unable to comply with the
             requirements of the study protocol or is unsuitable for the study for any reason. This
             includes completion of Patient Reported Outcome instruments.

         19. Subject is currently participating in another clinical trial that has not yet
             completed its primary endpoint.

         20. Subject is part of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the investigator,
             is unable to give Informed Consent for reasons of incapacity, immaturity, adverse
             personal circumstances or lack of autonomy. This may include: Individuals with mental
             disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished persons, persons in
             emergency situations, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those incapable of
             giving informed consent. Vulnerable populations also may include members of a group
             with a hierarchical structure such as university students, subordinate hospital and
             laboratory personnel, employees of the Sponsor, members of the armed forces, and
             persons kept in detention.

         21. Uncooperative patients or those with neurological/psychiatric disorders who are
             incapable of following directions or who are predictably unwilling to return for
             follow-up examinations.
