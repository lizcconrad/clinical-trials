  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about Mindfulness based Group Cognitive Behavior
      Therapy (M-gCBT) as a treatment for Provoked Localized Vulvodynia (PLV). M-gCBT is a
      counseling technique that has been shown to reduce pain and anxiety with other medical
      conditions, including chronic pain conditions. The investigators wish to see if participation
      in M-gCBT course will help reduce anxiety, fear, and pain in women with PLV greater than
      education alone. Both techniques use a group setting including other women with PLV.
      &quot;Mindfulness-Based Group Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Women with Localized Vulvodynia&quot; is a
      study designed to learn more about the use of mindfulness based group cognitive behavior
      therapy for PLV pain and anxiety over education alone. Participants will be randomized to one
      of two groups: mindfulness based cognitive behavior therapy or group education seminars.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      M-gCBT is a type of counseling that teaches women to have more control over their pain.
      Educational seminars teach women about the different aspects of PLV that affect emotional and
      physical health. Both groups will be given a binder containing course material at the first
      session and homework at each session that you will be asked to complete. The group education
      seminars will include an informational video clip reviewing an aspect of PLV and sexuality
      and will be followed by a group discussion facilitated by an instructor. Each session will
      involve a teacher and a small group of 6 to 12 women with PLV. Additionally, women in both
      groups will be asked to perform a weekly test to measure pain and to complete a daily diary.

    <measure>Tampon Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>The reduction in pain measured by the Tampon Test tested throughout the intervention phase. The tampon test is a validated tool used to measure (vulva) vestibular skin pain by having participants insert and remove a tampon. Participants will be asked to rate their pain along a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale on a scale of 0 (No pain) to 10 (Pain as bad as you can imagine). This test will occur at baseline, weekly for 8 weeks and at 3 months and 6 months follow up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Distress Survey Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in sexual function from baseline survey. Participants will complete a Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS) survey to rate their feelings associated with sexual activities. Survey questions are on a number scale of 0 (Never) to 4 (Always). The FSDS surveys will be completed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3 months and 6 months follow up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Function Questionnaire Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in sexual function from baseline questionnaire. Participants will complete a Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) survey which asks questions about participants sexual feelings over the past 4 weeks. Responses to FSFI questions are assigned a number value ranging from 0 (No sexual activity, if applicable) to 5 (Very satisfied). Domain scores and an overall score will be derived from those values using a computational formula in order to obtain participant scores for the FSFI. The FSFI surveys will be completed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3 months and 6 months follow up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Questionnaire Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in depression from baseline questionnaire. Participants will complete the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-PC) questionnaire. The BDI-PC consists of 21 groups of statements where participants selects which statement best describes how they have been feeling during the past 2 weeks. The BDI-PC questionnaire will be completed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3 months and 6 months follow up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety Questionnaire Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in anxiety from baseline questionnaire. Participants will complete the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale questionnaire. The GAD-7 consists of 7 problems where participants rate on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day) how often they have been bothered by those problems during the past 2 weeks. The GAD-7 questionnaire will be completed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3 months and 6 months follow up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from time of enrollment until 6 months after study</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in pain catastrophizing from baseline survey. Participants will complete the Pain Catastrophizing Scale survey. The survey consists of thirteen statements describing different thoughts and feelings that may be associated with pain. Participants are asked to rate the degree to which they have these thoughts/feelings expressed in each statement on a scale of 0 (Not at all) to 4 (All the time). The survey will be completed at baseline, end of treatment, and at 3 months and 6 months follow up.</description>
