    <textblock>
      This project aims to assess the ability of cardiac imaging (cardiac MRI and
      Doppler-echocardiography) post-processing tools to predict a combined end-point of
      intraventricular thrombosis, silent brain infarcts, clinical stroke and peripheral arterial
      embolism in patients with first acute myocardial infarction and ventricular dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a clinical situation that entails an increased risk
      of both subclinical and clinically devastating cardioembolic events. This increased risk of
      embolic phenomena may be related to blood stasis caused by alterations in the blood flow
      inside the left ventricle (LV) after AMI. Using flow velocity measurements obtained by
      cardiac MRI and Doppler-echocardiography it is possible to quantify the stasis in the LV and
      assess its relation to the risk of embolic events. The ability of cardiac imaging (cardiac
      MRI and Doppler-echocardiography) post-processing tools to predict embolic events in a cohort
      of 92 patients with a first AMI and left ventricular dysfunction shall be addressed. The
      potential confusion generated by the possible existence of paroxysmal AF will be controlled
      by implanting cardiac monitoring devices in random order in a subset of patients.

    <measure>Left ventricle mural thrombosis assessed by cardiac MRI performed one week and 6 months after STEMI</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Left ventricle mural thrombosis will be assessed by contrast cardiac MRI. Early after gadolinium contrast administration (3 min), two dimensional T1-weighted fast-field-echo sequences with an inversion-recovery prepulse will be used. A long inversion time (520 ms) will be used to identify intraventricular thrombus as a LV mass with low-signal intensity surrounded by high-signal intensity structures</description>

    <measure>Silent brain infarcts (SBI) within the 6 months following a first STEMI</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>SBIs diagnosis entails the presence of a focal lesion &gt; 3 mm that meets one of the three following criteria: 1) high signal on DWI isotropic images and low signal on the map of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). DWI sequence allows to detecting ischemic lesions (4 hours) and assessing their chronology. (2) cavitary lesion hyperintense on T2, with no signal (or low) in the FLAIR sequence usually surrounded by a ring gliotic hyperintense, hypointense on T1). (3) hyperintense lesion on T2 / T1 hypointense with prior distribution defect known or new in a follow-up study. The studies will be interpreted by a neuroradiologist blinded to clinical and echocardiographic information. For the assessment of whether the brain infarct is clinically silent, a medical history and physical examination focused on neurological symptoms will be performed including for that purpose the National Institute of Health (USA) questionnaire</description>
