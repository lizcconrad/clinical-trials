    <textblock>
      The drug iatrogenesis represents an important public health problem. In the Iatromed project,
      we want to to assess a specific therapeutic drug conciliation sheet (TDC). This multicenter
      observational study is focus on 750 patients aged over 75 year old with polymedication. The
      main objective will be to determine if the use of the TDC, at the discharge of hospital,
      allows to reduce the number of use in emergency care within the two month after their
      hospital discharge

      The drug iatrogenesis represents an important public health problem with 5-10% of the grounds
      of hospitalization after age 65, and more than 20% after 80 years. Based on this observation,
      the health authority has proposed in 2011 the realization of therapeutic drug conciliation
      particularly in the elderly with multiple pathologies and multiple drugs. Taking into account
      the central role of the family practitioner in prescriptions, and the importance of
      coordination information such as output of hospitalization (vector of many malfunctions), we
      have achieved a therapeutic drug conciliation sheet (TDC) based primarily on the information
      needs by family practitioner after hospitalization of their patients. The issue of this study
      is to assess the interest for the use of a such TDC on the decrease in the rate of
      rehospitalization in the target population.

      To do this, we are proposing a multicenter observational study. Randomization would be across
      the centres. The study would focus on 750 patients more of 75 with polymedication. The
      follow-up will last 6 months.

      The main objective will be to determine if the use of the TDC, at the discharge of hospital,
      allows to reduce the number of use in emergency care within the two month after their
      hospital discharge. The first secondary objective will be identical to the main objective but
      rated at 6 months and the second secondary objective will be to assess the impact of the use
      of the TDC on overall mortality at 6 months.

    <description>The use of hospital care in emergency is defined as a consultation in an emergency room and/or an emergency hospitalization.
An emergency hospitalization is an hospitalization for which programing was made maximum 48h before the admission in hospital or clinic. The use will be documented by contact with the patient (or the support person if necessary) and his doctor. Here, it should be noted that deaths will be accounted for in the urgently use of to the hospital care regardless of the place of death. This in intended to take into account the possibility that a death may be related to a drug iatrogenic event for which the patient has not had time to resort to the hospital care in emergency.</description>
