  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced diarrhea is seen in up to 40-80% of patients receiving this treatment
      for HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. This diarrhea can
      significantly impact a patient's quality of life and ability to tolerate chemo/anti-HER2
      therapy. This study will look at the efficacy of the drug crofelemer in preventing diarrhea
      in breast cancer patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various anti-diarrheal agents, such as loperamide, codeine, octreotide, are available for
      diarrhea management, but few are used in the prophylactic setting and none provide a targeted
      approach for treating chemotherapy induced diarrhea (CID).

      Pre-clinical studies have suggested that blocking EGFR results in excess chloride secretion
      and thus diarrhea. Crofelemer is an extract from the blood red bark of Croton lechleri that
      inhibits luminal chloride efflux by blocking the calcium activated chloride channel (CaCC)
      and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) chloride channels. Due to its size and
      polarity, it acts only luminally and is not systemically absorbed. It is currently FDA
      approved for use in preventing diarrhea in HIV/AIDS patients on anti-retroviral therapy.
