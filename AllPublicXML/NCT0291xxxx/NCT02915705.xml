    <textblock>
      UX023-CL301 is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study comparing the efficacy
      and safety of KRN23 with active control (oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy) in children
      with XLH (aged 1 to ≤12 years) who have radiographic evidence of rickets, open epiphyses, and
      have received oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy for ≥ 6-12 consecutive months prior to
      screening. Approximately 60 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive open-label KRN23
      administered by subcutaneous injection or oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy for a
      total of 64 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, aged 1 to ≤12 years with radiographic evidence of rickets as
             determined by central read

          2. PHEX mutation or variant of uncertain significance in either the patient or in a
             directly related family member with appropriate X-linked inheritance

          3. Biochemical findings associated with XLH: Serum phosphorus &lt;3.0 mg/dL (0.97 mmol/L)

          4. Serum creatinine within age-adjusted normal range

          7. Willing to provide access to prior medical records for the collection of historical
             growth and radiographic data and disease history.

          8. Provide written or verbal assent (as appropriate for the subject and region) and

             undergo additional pregnancy testing during the study. If sexually active, male and
             female subjects must be willing to use highly effective method(s) of contraception for
             the duration of the study.
