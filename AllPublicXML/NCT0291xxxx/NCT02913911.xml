      -  Does the utility of external feedback in terms of goal-directed LLL approach during STS
           training immediately improve functional ability relating to walking in ambulatory
           patients with SCI?

        -  Does the utility of LLL feedback improve functional ability relating to walking in
           ambulatory patients with SCI after 2-week training?

      -  To compare immediate effects of STS training with and without LLL feedback on functional
           ability relating to walking in ambulatory patients with SCI

        -  To compare 2 weeks effects of STS training with and without LLL feedback on functional
           ability relating to walking in ambulatory patients with SCI.

    <description>Subjects will be trained using the sit-to-stand weight-taking machine. Prior to the training, subjects sit in a standard sitting position. Then they will be instructed to take most of their body-weight onto the legs while they standing up where the light bars will be gradually lightened from the red, yellow and green zones according to the level of LLL. Then they stand up, hold a standing position for 3-5 seconds and sit-down with always maximize their body-weight onto their legs during performing the task in which the green zone will always be lightened.</description>
