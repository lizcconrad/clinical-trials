  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cesarean section (CS) is a procedure with prolonged hospital stay compared to the routine for
      normal vaginal delivery in multiparas. The difference is caused mainly by postoperative pain
      but improvements in management of pain may change this situation and make early discharge
      possible. However, several aspects need to be considered.

      The aim of this project is to evaluate fast-track discharge for multiparas after elective CS
      concerning neonatal and maternal complications as well as the parents' sense of security and
      well-being.

      The study is a randomized controlled trial including 142 women allocated to either 1) the
      intention to discharge within 28 hours followed by a home visit or 2) standard discharge
      after at least 48 hours after elective CS.

      This study will be among the first evaluating fast-track discharge after CS in a European
      context. If a positive outcome is achieved, we expect that fast-track discharge can be
      implemented with improved quality and reduced costs in postnatal care following elective CS.
