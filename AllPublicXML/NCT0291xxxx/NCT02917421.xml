  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer with an indication for
      post-operative radiotherapy after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protocol has two cohorts. Cohort 1 will receive radiation to breast and chest wall. Prone
      whole breast or chest wall 3D-CRT or IMRT at 2.7 Gy x 15 fractions (40.50 Gy) with a
      concomitant boost of 0.50 (7.5 Gy) to the original tumor bed in post-segmental mastectomy
      patients or mastectomy scar in post-mastectomy patients. Patients who have undergone
      reconstruction will not receive concomitant boost.

      Cohort 2 patients will receive radiation to breast, chest wall and LevelII/SCV nodes.

      In addition to receiving radiation to the original tumor bed, patients will also receive
      radiation to Level III axillary nodes and Supraclavicular nodes: 3D-CRT or IMRT at 2.7 Gy X
      15 fraction (40.50 Gy).

      Patients will complete treatment in three weeks (15 fractions). All patients will be followed
      at 3 months after the completion of treatment then yearly for the next 5 years.
