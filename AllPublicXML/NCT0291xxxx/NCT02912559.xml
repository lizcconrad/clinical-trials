      This randomized phase III trial studies combination chemotherapy and atezolizumab to see how
      well it works compared with combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with stage
      III colon cancer and deficient deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair. Drugs used in
      combination chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      combination chemotherapy with atezolizumab may work better than combination chemotherapy
      alone in treating patients with colon cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether atezolizumab combined with oxaliplatin, leucovorin calcium, and
      fluorouracil (FOLFOX) and its continuation as monotherapy can significantly improve
      disease-free survival (DFS) compared to FOLFOX alone in patients with stage III colon cancers
      and deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether atezolizumab combined with FOLFOX and its continuation as monotherapy
      can significantly improve overall survival compared to FOLFOX alone in patients with stage
      III colon cancers and dMMR.

      II. To assess the adverse events (AE) profile and safety of each treatment arm, using the
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and patient related outcomes
      (PRO)-CTCAE.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of the addition of atezolizumab to FOLFOX on patient-reported
      neuropathy, health-related quality of life (QOL), and functional domains of health-related
      QOL.

      II. To determine if the &quot;immunoscore&quot; can predict the efficacy of atezolizumab for
      disease-free survival among patients with stage III colon cancer.

      III. To assess whether circulating immune cell populations can predict the efficacy of
      atezolizumab as adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer.

      IV. To explore the associations of genomic alterations identified in cell-free (cf)DNA with
      DFS in patients treated with FOLFOX with or without atezolizumab.

      V. To assess whether soluble markers of systemic inflammation in blood can predict the
      efficacy of atezolizumab as adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer.

      VI. To assess the relationship between baseline plasma 25(OH) D levels, change in 25(OH)D
      levels, and DFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with stage III colon cancer receiving
      FOLFOX +/- atezolizumab.

      VII. To determine the ability of using fecal microbiota and their metabolic products to
      predict survival benefit from anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy in dMMR colon cancer patients.

      VIII. To determine if hypermutation or hyper-indel status is associated with response to
      atezolizumab.

      IX. To determine if unique messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression signatures are
      predictive of disease-free survival among patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for stage
      III colon cancer.

      X. To determine if the efficacy of atezolizumab differs among dMMR cancers due to germline
      MMR mutation (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) versus those with MLH1 hypermethylation and CIMP in
      patients with stage III colon cancer.

      XI. To identify overall mutational burden and number of putative tumor neoantigens in colon
      carcinoma specimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV
      over 2 hours on day 1, and fluorouracil IV as a bolus on day 1, then continuously over 46
      hours on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive atezolizumab IV over
      30-60 minutes starting on day 1 of course 1 or 2. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to
      25 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours
      on day 1, and fluorouracil IV as a bolus on day 1, then continuously over 46 hours on days
      1-3. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for recurrence every 6 months
      for 2 years, then annually for 3 years. Patients are also followed up for survival every 6
      months for up to 8 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven stage III colon adenocarcinoma (any T [Tx, T1, T2, T3, or T4],
             N1-2M0; includes N1C)

          -  Presence of deficient (d) DNA mismatch repair (dMMR); MMR status must be assessed by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR protein expression (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) where
             loss of one or more proteins indicates dMMR; dMMR may be determined either locally or
             by site-selected reference lab; Note: loss of MLH1 and PMS2 commonly occur together;
             formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue is required for subsequent
             retrospective central confirmation of dMMR status

          -  Patients with testing that did not show dMMR (loss of MMR protein) are not eligible to
             participate; patients whose tumors show MSI-H by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based
             assay are not eligible to participate unless they also have MMR testing by IHC and are
             found to have dMMR (i.e. loss of one or more MMR proteins)

          -  Patients who are known to have Lynch syndrome and have been found to carry a specific
             germline mutation in an MMR gene (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) are eligible to participate

          -  Tumors must have been completely resected; in patients with tumor adherent to adjacent
             structures, en bloc R0 resection must be documented; positive radial margins are not
             excluded as long as en bloc resection was performed; proximal or distal margin
             positivity is excluded

          -  Entire tumor must be in the colon (rectal involvement is an exclusion); surgeon
             confirmation that entire tumor was located in the colon is required only in cases
             where it is important to establish if the tumor is a colon versus (vs.) rectal primary

          -  Based upon the operative report and other source documentation, the location of the
             primary tumor will be categorized as proximal or distal to the splenic flexure (distal
             includes), and further categorization will be as follows: cecum/ascending, descending,
             sigmoid colon, or rectosigmoid colon

          -  No evidence of residual involved lymph node disease or metastatic disease at the time
             of registration based on clinician assessment of imaging; the treating physician will
             determine if incidental lesions on imaging require workup to exclude metastatic
             disease; if based on review of images, the treating physician determines the patient
             to be stage III, then the patient is eligible

          -  No prior medical therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic or targeted therapy)
             or radiation therapy for colon cancer except for one cycle of mFOLFOX6

          -  For women of childbearing potential only, a negative pregnancy test done =&lt; 7 days
             prior to registration is required; a female of childbearing potential is a sexually
             mature female who:

               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or

               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months)

             cycle 1 of mFOLFOX6 prior to registration

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt;= 45 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault equation

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) except in the case of Gilbert
             disease

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 2.5 x upper limit
             of normal (ULN)

          -  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits (WNL); supplementation is
             acceptable to achieve a TSH WNL; in patients with abnormal TSH, if free T4 is normal
             and patient is clinically euthyroid, patient is eligible

          -  No active known autoimmune disease, including colitis, inflammatory bowel disease
             (i.e. ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), rheumatoid arthritis,
             panhypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency
