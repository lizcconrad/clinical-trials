  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 150,000 children present each year to emergency departments (EDs) in the US
      with concussion and many more are treated by primary care physician, or outpatient
      specialists.

      Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and
      involves a complex pathophysiological process. There is a variety of symptoms related to
      concussion, and the diagnosis of concussion requires the use of symptom-checklist. Since
      there is a various degree of the severity of those symptoms, the diagnosis is a subjective
      one and lacks sensitivity.

      One major problem is that approximately one-third of the children with concussion experience
      ongoing somatic, cognitive, and psychological or behavioral symptoms, referred to as
      persistent post-concussion symptoms. A recent study that investigated the validity a 12-point
      PPCS risk score revealed that it had modest validity (0.71). Moreover, one of the greatest
      concerns is the child's schedule return to activity.

      Since the basic mechanism for concussion is acceleration/ deceleration movement of axons, it
      is likely to be expressed in desynchronization of delta wave activity between anterior
      hemispheres as seen in pathological problems related to attention and/ or working memory).

      The aim of this proof-of-concept study is to find-out whether interhemispheric
      desynchronization of delta waves (IHDD) in the anterior hemispheres can identify acute
      concussion in children. If the investigators find that IHDD can accurately diagnose acute
      concussion, a second objective will be to examine whether this index can be a useful tool in
      the follow up of patients with persistent post-concussion symptoms.

        A prospective case control study will be performed. The investigators will enroll patients
        presented to the pediatric ED of Rambam Health Care Campus (RHCC) with symptoms of acute
        concussion within 24 hours of mild head injury). The control group will be consisted of
        previously healthy children with an isolated limb injury. Study participants will be
        enrolled on the basis of a convenience sample.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Study group will include children aged 11-18 years with diagnosis of acute concussion
             based on the RPSQ. (Eisenberg et al., 2013; Harmon et al., 2013)

          -  Controls will be healthy children who will be admitted to the ED due to an isolated
             limb injury such as laceration, contusion or fracture and are not painful. Nonverbal
