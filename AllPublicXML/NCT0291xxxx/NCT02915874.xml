    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief, intensive 1-day
      psychotherapy group intervention (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, ACT), compared to a 12
      week time control group on anxiety symptoms, vascular function, inflammation, muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity (mSNA), and oxidant stress. Similar measures will be performed at
      baseline in individuals with low or no anxiety for comparison. Individuals who are interested
      in the study will be identified by an online screening survey and will be contacted by the
      research team; advertisements, flyers and mass emails will direct individuals to the online
      screening survey. Those deemed eligible to participate will be randomized to the ACT
      intervention or a control group. Assessments of anxiety symptoms (via various surveys) and
      vascular function (via non-invasive, well-established techniques) will be performed at
      baseline and 12 weeks post-ACT group intervention session. In addition, reassessment of
      anxiety symptoms via aforementioned surveys will take place 6 weeks post-ACT group session.
      After 12 weeks, anxiety and vascular assessments will be repeated to re-evaluate severity of
      anxiety symptoms, vascular function, inflammation, and oxidant stress.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that reducing the burden of anxiety symptoms using Acceptance
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT) will improve vascular function, inflammation, mSNA, and oxidant
      stress.

      The investigation also explore other secondary endpoints related to oxidant stress and
      inflammation in vascular endothelial cells. If anxiety increases inflammation, then we
      predict that ACT will reduce circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines, and produce a phenotype
      of endothelial cell proteins reflecting decreased inflammation compared to pre-treatment. And
      if anxiety increases oxidative stress, then ACT should produce a phenotype of endothelial
      cell proteins reflecting decreased oxidant stress and increased nitric oxide synthase
      activity.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the ACT Intervention group will attend a 1-day group workshop in which two broad areas will be covered:
Behavioral Change training will involve a) teaching subjects how to recognize ineffective patterns of behavior and habits, b) exploring and setting life goals and those related to mental and physical health, and c) promoting effective and committed actions to achieve these goals despite the urge to do otherwise;
Mindfulness and Acceptance Training will emphasize new ways of managing troubling thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations (i.e. learning how to recognize, and develop cognitive distances from unhelpful thoughts such as &quot;I can't take this anymore&quot; and learning how to willingly face experiences that cannot be changed). In-session exercises and practice will be heavily emphasized during the group intervention and handouts will be distributed for home use.</description>
