  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, partially blinded study to determine whether 42-day old
      red blood cells (RBCs) deliver oxygen as effectively as 7-day old RBCs and also to determine
      whether transfusion with 28-day old RBCs is non-inferior to 7-day old RBCs with respect to
      oxygen delivery.

      In this study, subjects will be randomized to be transfused with 2 units of autologous (one's
      own) RBCs that are either 7-, 28-, or 42-days old. Endpoints include changes in exercise
      duration and VO2 max (test of oxygen consumption/delivery) between groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations permit additive-containing RBCs to be
      stored for up to 42 days prior to transfusion. However, RBCs progressively develop
      abnormalities during storage. The efficacy of older stored blood, i.e., effective oxygen
      delivery, has not been established in rigorous controlled studies. Due to pragmatic reasons,
      a large clinical trial that randomizes patients to &quot;old&quot; blood may not be feasible.

      Every subject will have 2 phlebotomy visits at Stony Brook University Hospital. Subjects
      randomized to the 7- and 42-day old groups will have 2 units of blood removed at Week 0 and
      another 2 units removed at Week 5. However, the remaining 28-day group will have 2 units of
      blood removed at Week 2 and only 1 unit of blood removed at Week 5. During week 6, each
      subjects will have 3 study visits: 1) On Monday, a VO2 max test; 2) On Wednesday, a
      transfusion with 2 units of autologous RBCs (each over 1 hour), followed by a VO2 max test 2
      hours later; 3) On Friday, a VO2 max test will be done in order to calculate a delta VO2 max
      (Friday minus Monday results).

    <description>Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) is the maximum rate at which the body can consume and use oxygen, calculated via exhaustion from exercise on a treadmill or cycle ergometer with direct measurement of O2 consumption using a metabolic cart to analyze inspired and expired gases. The primary outcomes of this study are the change in VO2 max from Monday to Friday of week 6, after receiving 7-, 28-, or 42-day old blood on the Wednesday of Week 6.</description>

             VO2 max test will be performed, and subjects with a low value (&lt; 35 mL/kg/min) will be
             excluded (screen failure). Based on our previous experience, we anticipate that &lt;10%
