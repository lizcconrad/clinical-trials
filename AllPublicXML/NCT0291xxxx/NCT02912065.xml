    <textblock>
      A retrospective chart review to assess feeding tolerance in children who had been switched
      from an intact protein formula to a Peptide based formula due to feeding intolerance in a
      pediatric facility for the developmentally delayed.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medical records of pediatric patients with enteral feeding intolerance on standard polymeric
      formulas that were switched to a peptide based formula will be retrospectively analyzed. Data
      will be collected on caloric intake, ability to meet enteral nutrition goals, incidence of
      intolerance, and the use of medications to control gastrointestinal symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  13 months to &lt; 18 years of age on admission to facility

          -  Required enteral nutrition to meet 90% or more of their energy needs prior to switch
             to a Peptide based formula

          -  Received enteral nutrition with an intact protein formula for a minimum of two weeks
             prior to a switch to a Peptide based formula

             in formula received to a Peptide based formula

          -  Have documentation of an assessment of feeding tolerance following the switch to a
             Peptide based formula

          -  Formulas received must be indicated for use in children or adults (not infant
             formulas).
