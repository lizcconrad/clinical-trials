  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural changes are commonly used as therapeutic maneuver to enhance or reduce cerebral
      perfusion. For instance, in acute stroke, the patient can be positioned in head down tilt
      position so as to increase perfusion of cerebral tissues perfusion. In During stroke and in
      hypertensive patients and during stroke, varying degrees a various loss of cerebral
      autoregulation is loss are usually observed. The aim of this study is to assess cerebral
      perfusion with ASL perfusion in human subjects in different conditions: healthy, hypertensive
      and stroke.

      Material and methods:

      Eighteen stroke patients, eighteen hypertensive patients and eighteen healthy subjects (men
      and women) will be enrolled. The investigator will use a 1.5 Tesla MRI device with a large
      magnet bore (70 cm) allowing positions change. Two measures will be performed, one in supine
      position and the other in head down position (-20°). A 3D FSE ASL sequence will be acquired
      and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) maps will be reconstructed. Volume of interest (VOI) will be
      placed on cortical grey matter (frontal and posterior gyrus), on subcortical deep grey matter
      (caudate nuclei, thalami) and subcortical white matter (semi oval centers). Differences in
      CBF values (in mL/100g/min) will be analyzed using SAS 9.3 software for Windows (SAS
      Institute, Cary North Carolina, USA).

      Expected results and hypothesis:

      CBF is expected to significantly vary between the supine and head down positions. It is
      expected to at least increase in the head down position, for stroke patients. For healthy
      subjects and hypertensive patients, cerebral autoregulation may limit CBF increase although
      an increasing trend for CBF is expected.

    <description>The endpoint is the change in the value of the cerebral blood flow ( ml / 100g / min) depending on the switching position ( 0 ° and -20 °). This development will be assessed in different brain regions . In particular, it will be searched in excess of a threshold of significance .
This will be accomplished independently by two experienced readers (knowing that the variation between and within road has been assessed) . If a significant difference between the two players, it will be made a consensual common measure.</description>
