  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) such as Polycythemia Vera (PV) and, Essential
      Thrombocythaemia (ET) are rare clonal myeloid neoplasms associated with an increased risk of
      both venous and arterial thrombosis. Thrombotic complications are the main determinant of
      morbidity and in a less extend mortality.

      Routine haemostasis analysis (TP, aPTT) are usually normal and are useless to demonstrate a
      hypercoagulable state. However, previous evidence suggests that global coagulation tests such
      as thrombin generation or thromboelastometry are able to detect signs of procoagulant
      imbalance in MPN. Similarly, current data seems to demonstrate that fibrin clot properties
      (clot permeability, turbidimetry, clot lysis time) properties is altered suggesting an
      hypercoagulable state.

      Goals of PV and ET treatments are to control blood count to reduce the risk of thrombotic
      events. Moreover, new drugs such as Janus Kinase Inhibitors (JAKi) were recently licensed for
      PV and are under investigations on clinical trial for ET. It is currently unknown if
      treatments that were used for ET and PV, and especially JAKi are able to modify the
      hypercoagulable state that is observed in those diseases, and if there is difference between
      drugs.

      To evaluate impact of MPN treatment on prothrombotic haemostatic profile, we propose to
      evaluate global coagulation and fibrin clot properties in MPN, depending on the treatment.
