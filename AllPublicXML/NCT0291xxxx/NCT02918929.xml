  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess the safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple orally administered doses of EDP-305 in healthy
      adult subjects, and adult subjects with presumptive NAFLD (i.e., obese subjects with or
      without prediabetes or T2DM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first phase assesses single ascending doses for EDP 305 (active drug or placebo) in
      healthy subjects. A &quot;fasted&quot; and &quot;fed&quot; two-part cohort will also assess food effect.

      The second phase assesses multiple ascending doses (active drug or placebo) for 14-days in
      healthy subjects and also in subjects with presumptive NAFLD (i.e., obese subjects with or
      without prediabetes or T2DM).

      Each cohort within each phase will enroll a total of 8 subjects who will be randomized to
      receive EDP-305 or placebo. The cohort assessing food effect will enroll 10 subjects
      randomized to receive EDP-305 or placebo.
