  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present investigation is to record and compare bacterial compositions in
      supragingival plaque samples and saliva samples in subjects discontinuing regular oral
      hygiene for 10 days. The hypothesis is that the composition of the salivary microbiota might
      reflect local bacterial alterations in relation to discontinuation of oral hygiene.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      35 orally healthy individuals will be enrolled in this study, in which they will discontinue
      regular oral hygiene procedures for a period of 10 days. Clinical registrations and
      collection of microbiological samples (supragingival and saliva) will be performed at
      baseline and 4, 7 and 10 days after discontinuation of regular oral hygiene, and will be
      repeated 14 days after regular oral hygiene has been resumed.

    <description>The intervention of the present study is discontinuation of regular oral hygiene procedures for a period of 10 days. Discontinuation of oral hygiene will allow undisturbed biofilm formation (supragingival dental plaque) along the gingival margin of the teeth. After 10 days all individuals will resume regular oral hygiene. Clinical registrations and collection of microbiological samples (supragingival and saliva) will be performed at baseline and 4, 7 and 10 days after discontinuation of regular oral hygiene, and will be repeated 14 days after regular oral hygiene has been resumed.</description>
