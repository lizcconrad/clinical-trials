  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment or training of fascial tissues has moved into the focus of medical research in the
      last decade. In this context, the use of foam rollers or roller massagers for
      self-myofascial-release (SMR) techniques has become increasingly popular in health and
      fitness professionals. The primary objective of these techniques is to mimic manual massage
      or myofascial-release therapy with a self-usable tool. Recent studies suggest that SMR
      improves, inter alia, range of motion (ROM) without a decrease in neuromuscular performance
      (Cheatham et al. 2015).

      Concurrent effects on the muscle and especially the surrounding connective tissue network
      have been proposed as underlying mechanisms for these observed changes in ROM after SMR.
      Several authors assume a positive effect of SMR on sliding properties of different
      independent fascial layers. Also, changes in passive tissue stiffness is suggested. Passive
      stiffness is thereby characterized by passive resistance in the tissues' (muscles')
      functional direction, the passive resistive torque (PRT).

      In conclusion, for many of the proclaimed effects of SMR, such as improvements of sliding of
      fascial layers or decreases of passive stiffness, there is a lack of evidence in the
      literature. Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate acute effects of SMR on the
      viscoelastic properties of the muscles on the anterior thigh and the corresponding fascia.

      In a cross over design, 16 subjects receive all of the following interventions after a
      familiarization session: a) 2x60 seconds of SMR at the anterior thigh, b) 2x60 seconds of
      static stretching at the anterior thigh, c) no intervention in a balanced permutated
      randomization sequence. Before and directly after each intervention, outcome parameters are
      collected.

      Passive Resistive Torque is evaluated using a computerized isokinetic dynamometer. In passive
      mode, the lower leg is moved from full knee extension (0°) to the point of maximal knee
      flexion with a velocity of 5°/s. Torque and angle are recorded at 100 Hertz (Hz). Sliding of
      fascial layers is quantified with a frame-by-frame cross correlation algorithm of
      high-resolution ultrasound images (Dilley et al. 2001).

      First stretch sensation is quantified using the passive mode in the isokinetic dynamometer.

      Maximal ROM is detected using a an ultrasonographic movement analysis system in a prone
      position.

    <description>Sliding of fascial layers is quantified with a frame-by-frame cross correlation algorithm of high-resolution ultrasound images. The cross-correlation method calculates the correlation coefficient between the pixel grey levels for selected rectangle-shaped regions of interest (ROIs) in two adjacent images. The pixel shift that gives the maximum correlation coefficient corresponds to the relative movement between two frames.</description>

    <description>A triplet of ultrasonographic markers is placed on the lower leg, a second triplet is placed as a reference on the thigh. Participants are placed on a physio table including a pre-stretch of the hip (210° in total) using a bed wedge (30°). In this position, participants are instructed to perform three consecutive active knee flexion-extension cycles at a self-selected velocity. Subsequently, the investigator performs three passive knee flexion-extension cycles. Movements are recorded in three dimensions at 20 Hz, and maximal active as well as passive ROM can be calculated as the maximal displacement relative to the starting position recorded by the US markers.</description>

    <description>Position of the first stretch sensation is quantified using the isokinetic dynamometer in the above-described position. In passive mode, the knee is flexed from full extension to flexion at 5°/s. The subject uses a switch to stop the passive movement at the position of first stretch sensation.</description>
