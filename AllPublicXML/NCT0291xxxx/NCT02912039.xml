  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need for an easy-to-use and accurate quantitative neuromuscular monitor in
      the clinical setting. The aim of this clinical investigation is to examine a prototype of a
      quantitative monitoring instrument that will meet most, if not all, of the clinical
      requirements.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of train of four measurements between TOF Watch and TetraGraph</measure>
    <time_frame>During stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be an analysis of the agreement between the TOF-Watch (the current gold standard) and TetraGraphTM devices during neuromuscular monitoring. Data Acceleromyography (AMG) and Electromyography (EMG) will be compared between the two devices during testing of single twitch (ST) and train of four (TOF) patterns at varying current amplitudes, from threshold amplitude (the lowest current amplitude that is able to generate a muscle response), to supramaximal current amplitude (the amplitude that elicits maximal muscle response). Bias and limits of agreement will be calculated for each stimulation pattern (ST and TOF) at currents between submaximal and supramaximal amplitude. Measured responses obtained with the two technologies (AMG and EMG) will be compared.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Noise level</measure>
    <time_frame>During stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptable levels of electrical noise when no stimulus is being applied (random noise, power-line noise, and background EMG recorded in a relaxed volunteer with low recording electrode impedance should be 0.2 mV RMS or less).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stimulus artifact</measure>
    <time_frame>During stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>That the stimulus artifact will not obscure the EMG response when a stimulus is applied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appearance EMG response</measure>
    <time_frame>During stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Appearance of an EMG response at threshold stimulation levels, enough to just barely elicit a visible twitch response and elicit measurable acceleration on the TOF-Watch.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EMG amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>During stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Increase in the amplitude of the EMG response, with constant response latency, corresponding to the increase in the AMG response as stimulus strength (current) is increased.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal EMG amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>During stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The observation of a maximal EMG amplitude, corresponding to the maximal AMG response, at maximal and supramaximal (up to maximal+10%, but below 70 mA) stimulus levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consistency in amplitude</measure>
    <time_frame>During stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Consistency in the amplitude of the AMG and EMG response amplitudes, with measured variations less than 10%, on repeated 1 Hz stimulation when the stimulus current is held constant between threshold and supramaximal intensity.
Consistency of the AMG and EMG response amplitudes in repeated (ST and TOF) stimulus protocols (in which variation should be less than 10%).
Consistency of EMG response characteristics and association with AMG responses independent of patient age, gender, or weight (despite different stimulus amplitudes being required to elicit submaximal and supramaximal responses).
Consistency of EMG response characteristics and association with AMG responses independent of whether the right or left arm is being stimulated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Discomfort level</measure>
    <time_frame>During stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Establish the discomfort associated with nerve stimulation (from submaximal to supramaximal current amplitudes) in awake, unpremedicated human volunteers. Assessment will be made using an 11-point visual analog score (VAS) scale, anchored with 0 = no distress and 10 = worst distress ever experienced</description>
