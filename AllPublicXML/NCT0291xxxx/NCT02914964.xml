      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of the Swank Diet (low saturated fat) and
      the Wahls Elimination Diet (modified paleo) on fatigue levels in individuals with
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who have documented fatigue. Participants will follow
      their usual diet for 12 weeks and then be randomly assigned to follow one of the two diets
      for 24 weeks.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of the Swank Diet (low saturated fat) and
      the Wahls Elimination Diet (modified paleo) on fatigue levels in individuals with
      relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who have documented fatigue. Participants will follow
      their usual diet for 12 weeks and then be randomly assigned to follow one of the two diets
      for 24 weeks. Individuals will continue with their current treatments in addition to
      following the study diet.

      The study requires four visits to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City,
      Iowa. Visits will be 12 weeks apart. Study activities include fasting blood draws, weighed
      food records, motor and cognitive testing, physical activity assessment, questionnaires, and
      daily diet checklists while following the study diet. Some reimbursement available.
