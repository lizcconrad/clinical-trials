    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot research study is to test the effects of a medication called
      nabilone (Cesamet) in adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Participants will
      receive either nabilone on its own, or nabilone in combination with a form of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) called exposure and response prevention (EX/RP). Nabilone
      is a synthetic cannabinoid and acts on the brain's &quot;endocannabinoid system,&quot; which has been
      hypothesized to play a role in OCD. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. It is not FDA-approved for treating OCD.
