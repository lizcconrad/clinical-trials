    <textblock>
      The investigators study aims are:

        1. To investigate folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels in patients with
           schizophrenia.

        2. To evaluate the relationships among folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels,
           genetic variants of one-carbon cycle pathway, psychopathology, including positive
           symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognition, and metabolic abnormalities in patients with
           schizophrenia.

        3. For patients with low folate levels, the investigators would like to conduct a 24-week
           double-blinded, placebo-controlled of folic acid (5 mg/d) and vitamin B12 (500 ug/d)
           supplementation study to know whether combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 can
           improve patients' psychopathology or metabolic profiles, and the effects of genetic
           variants in one-carbon cycle pathway on treatment response.
