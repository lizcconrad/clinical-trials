      The purpose of this study is to improve the efforts of Community health workers (CHWs) by
      developing materials to help increase lung cancer screening in NYC Chinese taxi drivers who
      smoke or who have quit smoking within the past 15 years.

    <description>The investigators will conduct a series of 4-6 focus groups with Chinese livery drivers who (currently, or in the past) smoke, and a series of 12-15 in-depth interviews with livery base management and staff, and with 12-15 primary care physicians (PCPs), clinic directors, hospital CFOs, heads of financial services and counseling, and heads of radiology facilities serving the Chinese community. Both focus group and in-depth interview methodologies have previously been used successfully to explore barriers and factors related to cancer screening among both male and female Chinese immigrants. Focus groups and in-depth interviews will be 75-90 minutes in duration.</description>

        Participants for the focus groups will be recruited in concert with 6-8 Chinese livery
        bases identified through our preliminary work, the Taxi Network, 3 of which previously
        collaborated with us in our health needs assessment.
