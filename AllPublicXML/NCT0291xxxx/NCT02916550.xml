      This study examines the impact of a breathing training intervention on cardiorespiratory
      sensations and anxiety in adults with cardiac arrhythmias.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cardiac arrhythmias develop increased rates of anxiety and depression. Atrial
      arrhythmias, such as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), and ventricular arrhythmias, such
      as those with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are particularly at risk. While
      ICDs can be life saving, many patients (including those without prior psychiatric illness)
      develop elevated rates of anxiety and depression, particularly after receiving discharges
      (shocks) from the device. Treatments involving modulation of the breath have been shown to
      improve both psychological and cardiac outcomes in patients with AF. Since breathing
      modulation alters sympathetic balance, this may be a mechanism of the therapeutic effect.
      This study examines the impact of a breathing training intervention on cardiorespiratory
      sensations and anxiety in adults with atrial and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.

          -  BMI 17 to 35

          -  Proficient in English language

          -  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or ventricular fibrillation or frequent premature
             atrial/ventricular contractions

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No telephone access

          -  Active suicidal ideation with intent or plan

          -  Active drug or alcohol dependence, or active binge drinking within the last month

          -  Cardiovascular instability, as evidenced any of the following:

               1. New York Heart Association (NHYA) heart failure class IV (i.e., unable to carry
                  on any physical activity without discomfort, symptoms of heart failure at rest,
                  increased discomfort with any physical activity is undertaken)

               2. American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association congestive heart
                  failure stage D (i.e., heart failure symptoms at rest, receiving end of life
                  care).

               3. Unstable angina or exercise induced angina

               4. Persistent atrial fibrillation

          -  Pacemakers or combined pacemaker/ICDs will be excluded

          -  Presence of unstable cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, endocrine,
             neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, or metabolic disease; or any other condition
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would make participation not be in the best
             interest (e.g., compromise the well-being) of the subject or that could prevent,
             limit, or confound the protocol-specified assessments.
