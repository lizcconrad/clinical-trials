  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to determine if it is possible to perform acupuncture on women
      diagnosed with stable angina who have symptoms. The investigators want to determine if
      acupuncture reduces the pain and other symptoms of angina. The investigators also want to
      examine whether this study is acceptable to the participants, and by carrying out this study
      the investigators will be able to tell how many participants they will need in a future
      larger study to further test acupuncture to reduce the symptoms of angina in women.

      The investigators are conducting a pilot study aimed at gathering feasibility, acceptability,
      and effect size data for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the effect of
      acupuncture on anginal symptoms in women. The investigators long term goal is pain and
      symptom management resulting in improved functional status and quality of life for women with
      stable angina. This study will include 26 community dwelling women with a medically confirmed
      diagnosis of stable angina, whose pain and associated symptoms have not been completely
      controlled with guideline-directed medical management. The investigators will use a
      randomized attention control design with 13 women assigned to initial acupuncture and 13 to
      control. Participants in the experimental group will receive a standardized acupuncture point
      prescription two treatments per week, for 5 weeks. The attention control group will receive
      non-pain related video health education over 5 weeks equal to the approximate 10 hours of
      treatment for the acupuncture group.

    <description>The instrument consists of 7 items in 5 domains (Physical Limitation, Angina Stability, Angina Frequency, and Quality of Life) measuring the impact of angina on participants' health status. Item responses are coded sequentially from worst to best status and range from 1 to 6 except Quality of Life (range 1-5). Scores are generated for each domain and are scaled 0 to 100, with 0 denoting the worst and 100 the best possible status.</description>
