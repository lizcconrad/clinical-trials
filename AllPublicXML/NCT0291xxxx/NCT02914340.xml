      This is a multicenter, prospective study designed to evaluate performance of the SVS in the
      REACH SVS control patients. The study is expected to enroll up to 20 patients at up to 12
      sites with up to 6 patients per site.

    <description>The treatment algorithm is complete occlusion of one lobe of the lung by using valves to occlude all segments of the lobe. The lobe will be selected based on imaging with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The lobe to be treated will have severe heterogeneous emphysema based on visual exam. The selected lobe will also have an intact fissure separation with the ipsilateral lobe. An intact fissure will be estimated visually to be â‰¥ 90% complete after viewing the HRCT in 3 dimensions. If more than one lobe meets criteria, the investigator will determine a primary lobe to treat based on fissure completeness, heterogeneity, disease severity, and the anatomy of the airways that will be treated.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is classified as ASA Class greater than P4 including presence of co-morbidity
             that could significantly increase the risk of a bronchoscopy procedure.

          -  Patient participated in a study of an investigational drug or device within the past
             30 days prior to participation in this study.

          -  Patient has demonstrated unwillingness or inability to complete baseline data
             collection procedures.

          -  Patient has co-existing major medical disease that will limit evaluation,
             participation, or follow-up in the study.

          -  Patient is unable to provide informed consent.

          -  Patient is not an appropriate candidate for or is unable to tolerate, flexible
             bronchoscopy procedures.

          -  Patient has history of 4 or more hospitalizations for COPD exacerbation or respiratory
             infections in the past year and none have occurred in the prior 3 months.

          -  Patient has evidence of systemic disease or neoplasia expected to compromise survival
             during the 3-month study period

          -  Patient has demonstrated unwillingness or inability to complete screening or baseline
             data collection procedures.
