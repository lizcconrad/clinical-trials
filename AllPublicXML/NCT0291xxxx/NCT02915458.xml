      Making a weaning decision for a patient on a mechanical ventilator is an important clinical
      issue. The most common index to predict successful weaning is the rapid shallow breathing
      index (RSBI), however, the accuracy of RSBI to predict successful weaning have been
      questioned.

      The investigators proposed a new mathematical model and algorithm, called WIN, which capture
      the essential feature of the variability ruling the physiological dynamics to provides better
      perdition to wean than RSBI.

      Making a weaning decision for a patient on a mechanical ventilator is an important clinical
      issue.

      It is thus important to decide accurately when patients can be weaned from the ventilator. To
      increase the weaning success, the present common practice is to conduct spontaneous breathing
      trials to get physiological signals that may provide the information about capacity of
      successful weaning. The most common index is the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI),
      however, the accuracy of RSBI to predict successful weaning have been questioned. Weaning
      failure usually results from a complex interplay of multiple factors. Thus, predictors
      targeting a single pathophysiologic mechanism tend to be unreliable for heterogeneous
      abnormalities.

      The investigators proposed a new mathematical model and algorithm, which capture the
      essential feature of the variability ruling the physiological dynamics. Through the modern
      adaptive signal processing techniques, the investigators develop an index called WIN, which
      is evaluated from the 5 minutes continuous physiological signal and provides better perdition
      to wean than RSBI in a retrospective analysis. In this study, the investigators evaluate the
      predictive power of WIN and RSBI prospectively in patients undergoing weaning prospectively.
