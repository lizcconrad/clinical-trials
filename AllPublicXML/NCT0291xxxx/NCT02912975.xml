      A randomized controlled clinical to examine the effect of mirror therapy on phantom pain and
      residual limb pain in patients with traumatic transtibial amputations in Cambodia. The study
      will be conducted with a semi-crossover design using self-rated pain and function as the main
      result variables.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two phases: Firstly, the effects of mirror treatment (M)
      versus tactile treatment (T) will be compared in an open, randomized, semi-cross-over
      case-control design study. The second phase includes the responders from the initial
      treatment (M or T), the duration of the initial treatment effect will be observed, and the
      effect of a second round of similar treatment will be registered.

      Phase one: The study patients will be randomized for M or T treatment. The main outcome
      variables will be gathered before the initial randomization and after an initial treatment
      period of three weeks. Non-responders (NR) will be allocated for an immediate second
      three-weeks treatment period of combined treatment (M+T); the responders (R) of the M, T and
      M+T enter the second phase of the study. The M+T non-responders discontinue the study.

      Phase two: The responders will be observed for a period of maximum three months. When
      symptoms of phantom limb pain and/or CRPS resume, the patients will undergo a second
      treatment period with the same treatment as during phase one. The duration of the second
      treatment period will be maximum three weeks, but each patient may decide to interrupt the
      treatment at an earlier stage if he finds the effect satisfactory. The main outcome
      indicators will be gathered at the start and the end of the second treatment period.

      The study closes at the end of the second treatment period. For both study phases the
      treatment effects will be compared between the strata and also inside each stratum, using
      each patient as his own control.

    <description>The mirror treatment: The patient sits on a chair, both knees in 90 degrees flexion, both lower limbs undressed, and places a mirror of 100 cm x 25 cm along the trans-tibial amputation stump so that the uninjured limb is reflected in the mirror while the amputation stump can not be seen by the patient. The patient then performs slow repeated movements of the foot from neutral position into maximum flexion while closely observing the reflected image of the uninjured limb - the illusion of a limb regained - in the mirror. The procedure goes on uninterrupted for five minutes in the morning and in the evening in the home of the study patient.</description>

    <description>In Tactile Treatment five different sensory stimuli is applied repeatedly to the skin of the affected part of the limb, in the actual case to the amputated limb from ten cm above the knee joint and distally to include the entire amputation stump: gentle touch with a feather, a brush, a piece of paper, a stone and a wooden stick. The stimuli are applied two times daily for five 5 minutes each time, one minute per material.</description>
