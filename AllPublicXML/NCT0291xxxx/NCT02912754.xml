  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves adding the kinase inhibitor Ruxolitinib to Ibrutinib to treat Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ibrutinib is an effective drug that can extend the lives of CLL patients but it is not
      curative as a single agent and may eventually select for more aggressive disease. Survival of
      CLL cells in the presence of Ibrutinib may be enabled by signals from the microenvironment
      where the leukemia cells originate. These signals are transmitted into the cells by Janus
      Kinases (JAKs) such as janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and janus kinase 2 (JAK2). According, JAK
      inhibitors may overcome the cytoprotective properties of the CLL microenvironment and help to
      improve outcomes with Ibrutinib.

      The JAK2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib is licensed for use in myelofibrosis and polycythemia rubra
      vera and its toxicity and efficacy as a single agent in CLL has been studied in two previous
      clinical trials. As a single agent, Ruxolitinib was inferior to Ibrutinib. However,
      Ruxolitinib was shown to cooperate with Ibrutinib and increase killing of CLL cells in vitro.
      Based on these observations, it is hypothesized that Ruxolitinib will significantly improve
      the therapeutic efficacy of single-agent Ibrutinib.

      This is a single center phase I/II trial to determine the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib
      tablets in CLL patients being treated until progression with Ibrutinib and considered at risk
      to progress on the basis of persistent lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy after 1 year of
      Ibrutinib or elevated beta-2-microglobulin (b2M) levels after 6 months of Ibrutinib.
      Ruxolitinib will be administered for 21 days of a 35-day cycle to be repeated 6 more times.

             ruxolitinib and for 3 months after stopping treatment (N.B. the mean elimination
             half-life of ruxolitinib is around 3 hours) and not father a child in this period.
             Vasectomized men must also agree to use a condom during intercourse to prevent
             delivery of ruxolitinib via seminal fluid.

         23. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive human choriogonadotropin (HCG) laboratory test (&gt;5 mIU/ml).

         24. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             throughout the study duration inclusive of 30 day safety follow up. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. Incase of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). the vasectomized male
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject.

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception Women are
                  considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12
                  months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
                  (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical
                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or
                  tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only
                  when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
                  level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

         25. Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors for patients in the phase I component of the trial.
