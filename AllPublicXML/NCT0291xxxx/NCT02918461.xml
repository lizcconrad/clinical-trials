  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the investigators have developed a novel curriculum for a
      6-week psycho-educationally-based, cognitive behavioral program to help patients with
      subjective cognitive complaints after cancer treatment, titled Emerging from the Haze™
      (Haze). Each series meets once a week for 2-2.5 hours for 6 weeks.

      The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of a trainee-taught Emerging from the
      Haze course on gynecologic cancer survivors' self-report of cognitive changes based on the
      change of FACT-Cog score.
