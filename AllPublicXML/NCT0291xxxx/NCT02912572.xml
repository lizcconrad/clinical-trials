      This research study is evaluating a drug called Avelumab as a possible treatment for
      recurrent or Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
      effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and that
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the
      side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of
      cancer. It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not yet
      approved the drug for use in patients, including people with Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.

      Avelumab is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing by enabling the activation of the
      immune system. Avelumab blocks an immune inhibiting signal that can impair the ability of the
      immune system to attack cancers. In this research study, the investigators are looking to see
      whether Avelumab is effective in treating recurrent and Metastatic Endometrial Cancer.

      Additionally, the investigators are looking to see if participants whose tumors contain a
      particular genetic make-up will have better response to Avelumab.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Participants must be classified into one of two cohorts of recurrent or persistent
        endometrial cancer of any histology:

        --The first cohort (MSI/POLE cohort) includes endometrial cancers that are: MSI-H as
        determined by immunohistochemical complete loss of expression (absence of nuclear
        immunoreactivity) of at least one of the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2.
        This test is now done routinely for every newly diagnosed endometrial cancer patient in
        most centers in the US.

        And/OR:

          -  POLE-mutated, i.e. endometrial cancers known to harbor mutations in the exonuclease
             domain (amino acid residues 268-471) of polymerase e (POLE) as determined by targeted
             sequencing or other next generation sequencing assay. Any Clinical Laboratory
             Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved genomic test documenting mutations in the
             exonuclease domain of POLE gene (amino acid residues 268-471) in the tumor will be
             accepted as proof of presence of POLE mutations and will lead to classification into
             this patient cohort.

          -  The second cohort (MSS cohort) includes:

        Endometrial cancers that are MSS as determined by normal immunohistochemical nuclear
        expression of all the mismatch repair genes MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2. Tumors which have
        not been sequenced for POLE mutations (i.e. their POLE mutations status is unknown) but are
        MSS, will be included in this cohort.

          -  All patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1. Measurable disease
             is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion must be &gt;= 10 mm when
             measured by CT, MRI or caliper measurement by clinical exam; or &gt;= 20 mm when measured
             by chest x-ray. Lymph nodes must be &gt; 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or MRI.

          -  Prior Therapy:

               -  There is no upper limit of prior therapies but patients must have had one prior
                  chemotherapeutic regimen for management of endometrial carcinoma. Initial
                  treatment may include chemotherapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and/or
                  consolidation/maintenance therapy. Any platinum based chemotherapy (single agent
                  platinum or any platinum doublet) administered in conjunction with primary
                  radiation as a radio-sensitizer WILL be counted as a systemic chemotherapy
                  regimen. Furthermore, patients who have only received chemotherapy in the
                  adjuvant setting will be eligible for the study.

               -  Prior hormonal therapy is allowed.

               -  Patients must NOT have received any class of drugs targeted to the PD-1/PD-L1
                  pathway.

          -  Age of 18 or greater years. Because insufficient dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of Avelumab in participants &lt; 18 years of age, children
             are excluded from the study. Endometrial cancer is very rare in the pediatric
             population.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (reference Appendix A for ECOG performance status
             criteria).

          -  Availability of a formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block of cancer tissue from
             the original surgery or biopsy or from a biopsy of recurrent disease.

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL

               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mcL

               -  hemoglobin ≥ 9g/dL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

          -  Participant must not be pregnant or breastfeeding given that avelumab is an agent with
             unknown effects in pregnancy and breastfeeding and the potential for teratogenesis.
             Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or
             post-menopausal (defined as ≥ 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical
             cause). Serum pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential) negative at
             screening.

          -  The effects of avelumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because some immunomodulatory agents are known to be teratogenic, women of
             child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier
             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
             study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          -  Toxicities of prior therapy (excepting alopecia and sensory neuropathy) should be
             resolved to &lt; grade 2 per the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
             Events (CTCAE) version 4. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy
             of the CTCAE version 4. A copy of the CTCAE version 4 can be downloaded from the CTEP
             website at: http://ctep.cancer.gov.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to avelumab or any component in its
             formulations, or compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to avelumab.

             v 4.03), any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma (that is, 3 or more
             features of partially controlled asthma)

          -  Participants with a history of treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-CTLA-4 or
             other investigational agents that target immune checkpoint inhibitors.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

             antibody tested positive)

          -  Subjects requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the
             steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at doses ≤
             10 mg or 10 mg equivalent prednisone per day

          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 7 days prior to enrollment
             with the following exceptions to this exclusion criterion:

               -  Intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (eg,
                  intra-articular injection);

               -  Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of
                  prednisone or equivalent;

               -  Steroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (eg, CT scan
                  premedication).

          -  Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory
             agent. Patients with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid
             disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible.

          -  Prior organ transplantation including allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.

          -  Persisting Grade &gt;=2 toxicity related to prior therapy; however, Grade 2 sensory
