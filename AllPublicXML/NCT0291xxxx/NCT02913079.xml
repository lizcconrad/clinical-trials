      Context and Rationale: Uninterrupted sitting is associated with increased risk of diabetes,
      heart disease, and death, even among people who are physically active. These relationships
      are likely due to increases in post-meal blood sugar observed when people sit for long
      periods (e.g. &gt; 1 hour) without interruption. In contrast to sitting, standing results in
      large reductions in post-meal blood sugar levels. Our group has recently shown that sit-stand
      desks result in large (e.g. 2.5 hour/day) reductions in occupational sitting time. Taken
      together, these findings suggest that sit-stand desks may help to reduce post-meal blood
      sugar levels. However, this has yet to be examined in the field. Theoretical Approach and
      Objectives: The objective of this randomized crossover study is to determine whether people
      have lower blood sugar when using a sit-stand desk, in comparison to a desk that can only be
      used while sitting. Methods and Procedures: Sixteen participants will be asked to wear a
      continuous glucose monitor to measure their blood sugar levels during 2 separate conditions.
      During one condition, they will be asked to use a sit-stand desk to sit and/or stand as much
      as they like during 1 workday. During the other condition, they will be asked to work at a
      seated desk for 1 workday. Participants will be provided with identical meals to eat during
      each of the two conditions. We hypothesize that participants will have lower blood sugar
      levels on the day when they use the sit-stand desk, in comparison to the day using a
      traditional seated desk. Significance and Future Use: If our results support this hypothesis,
      this would suggest that sit-stand desks may be a useful way to reduce blood sugar levels in
      people at risk for diabetes. This could also lead to larger population-based interventions
      studying the health impact of sit-stand desks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To participate in this study, participants must be between the ages of 20 and 65, and
             have access to a sit-stand desk (depending on your workspace, we may be able to
             provide you with a sit-stand desk during the study if you do not already have one).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be excluded if they are currently taking any diabetes medications
             targeting blood sugar or insulin sensitivity as this will impact our primary outcome
             of postprandial glucose. Participants will also be excluded if they are unable to
             stand or walk independently, as these are secondary outcomes in the present study.
