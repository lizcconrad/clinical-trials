  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, systematic evaluation to assess the effectiveness and safety of
      introduction of UBT into PPH care at secondary level and district hospitals in 3 low-resource
      countries. The first component of the evaluation is a prospective stepped wedge cluster
      randomized design to assess the potential reduction in PPH-related mortality and invasive
      procedures (blood transfusion, arterial ligation, hysterectomy and uterine arterial
      embolization) for PPH performed at participating facilities following introduction of UBT.
      The second component is a nested cohort analysis to assess the safety and acceptability of
      UBT among women diagnosed with PPH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To assess the effectiveness of introduction of the UBT, a stepped wedge cluster randomized
      design will be employed to monitor maternal health outcomes among vaginal deliveries
      occurring at all participating facilities during the study phases described below:

      Baseline phase: A baseline phase will be conducted in all participating sites before training
      and introduction of the UBT for PPH management. This phase will consist of prospective data
      collection to establish the baseline rates of key study outcomes.

      Step 1 intervention phase: In this phase, participating sites will be randomized such that
      half will receive training on use of the UBT for PPH management with subsequent introduction
      into their standard practice and half will continue data collection without UBT introduction.

      Step 2 intervention phase: In this phase, the remaining sites will receive training on use of
      the UBT for PPH management with subsequent introduction into their standard practice. During
      this phase, all participating sites will continue data collection to document study outcomes
      and all will be using UBT in their standard practice.

      To assess the safety and acceptability of the use of UBT for PPH management, a nested cohort
      analysis will be done among women diagnosed with PPH during the stepped wedge trial. The
      investigators will assess the rates of treatment of postpartum infection and examine
      acceptability of care provided among the following two cohorts of women:

      UBT group: All women diagnosed with PPH following a vaginal delivery and who have an
      attempted UBT placement (including successful or unsuccessful placements).

      No-UBT group: All women diagnosed with PPH following a vaginal delivery that do not have an
      attempted UBT placement.
