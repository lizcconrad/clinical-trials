      -  Are there differences in immediate effects of stepping training with and without the use
           of visually weight-taking machine (VWTM) on variables relating to well-controlled
           walking and walking symmetry in ambulatory patients with stroke?

        -  Are there differences of 4-week stepping training with and without the use of VWTM on
           variables relating to well-controlled walking and walking symmetry in ambulatory
           patients with stroke?

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Stepping training with feedback</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects stand in a step standing position with placing the affected leg on the load cells of the VWTM and the non-affected leg slightly backward outside the load cells, look forward to light bars of the displayed section which will be set at their eye level. Then subjects will be instructed to shift/take their body-weight onto the affected leg until the green zone of the displayed section is lighting and a beep sound to alarm the subjects to step the non-affected leg forward and backward as much as they can. Subjects repetitively practice the task for 30 minutes with a period of sufficient rest as required.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Stepping training without feedback</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects will be trained and instructed the same as the experimental group but without using the displayed section, for approximately 30 minutes/day (excluding rest periods), 5 days/week, for 4 week. Then, every subject will be trained to walk overground with or without a walking device for 10 minutes in order to promote transferability of the part-task practice to the whole/target task. Subjects still receive routine treatments from other rehabilitation professionals as needed during participation in the study.</description>
