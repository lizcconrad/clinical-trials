      -  To compare effects of exercise training on hard, soft and sand surfaces in elderly
           without history of fall during 12 month prior to participate in the study

        -  To compare effects of exercise training on hard, soft and sand surfaces in elderly with
           history of single fall during 12 month prior to participate in the study

        -  To compare effects of exercise training on hard, soft and sand surfaces in elderly with
           history of multiple falls during 12 month prior to participate in the study

        -  To compare the changes of functional ability and risk of fall after exercise training on
           hard surface among elderly with no fall, single fall and multiple falls during 12 month
           prior to participate in the study

        -  To compare the changes of functional ability and risk of fall after exercise training on
           soft surface among elderly with no fall, single fall and multiple falls during 12 month
           prior to participate in the study

        -  To compare the changes of functional ability and risk of fall after exercise training on
