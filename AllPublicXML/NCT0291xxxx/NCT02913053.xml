  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise interventions to prevent dementia and delay cognitive decline have gained
      considerable attention in recent years. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that
      regular physical activity targets brain function by increasing cognitive reserve. Although
      initial studies indicate enhanced cognitive performance in patients with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) following an exercise intervention, little is known about the effect of an
      extensive, controlled and regular exercise regimen on the neuropathology of patients with
      MCI.

      The aim of this study is to compare a 12- month aerobic exercise programme versus a
      stretching and toning (non-aerobic) programme versus a control group on the progression of
      cognitive decline in MCI.

      It is hypothesized that MCI-related decreases in cognitive and psychomotor functioning will
      show less progression or even be improved after a one-year aerobic exercise intervention
      compared to a group of patients undergoing stretching and toning exercise as well as to a
      control group provided with no intervention.

      This randomised controlled clinical intervention study will take place across three European
      sites; the German Sport University Cologne, Germany, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands
      and Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. Seventy-five previously sedentary patients with a
      clinical diagnosis of MCI will be recruited at each site. Participants will be randomised to
      one of three intervention arms. One group will receive a standardised one-year extensive
      aerobic exercise intervention (3 units of 45min / week). The second group will complete
      stretching and toning (non-aerobic) exercise (3 units of 45min / week) and the third group
      will receive usual care. Change in all outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), after six
      months (T1) and after 12 months (T2).
