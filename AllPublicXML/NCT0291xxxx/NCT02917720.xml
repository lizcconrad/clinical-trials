      The main goal of the study is the assessment of duration of major molecular response (MMR) or
      better at 12 and 36 months after stopping tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) therapy a second
      time in patients with at least three years prior TKI treatment comprising at least two years
      of nilotinib treatment within this trial and maintained stable MR4 (BCR-ABL ratio &lt;0,01% on
      international Scale (IS) for at least one year and MR4.5 (BCR-ABL ratio &lt;0,0032% on IS) for
      at least 6 months:

        -  who failed a first stop in the EURO-SKI study (standardized criteria)

        -  who failed a first stop outside the EURO-SKI study but would have had fulfilled same
           eligible criteria and were stopped according to EURO-SKI rules

        -  who failed a first stop outside the EURO-SKI study without fulfilling EURO-SKI rules
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposal is to re-treat patients with a minimum of two years with nilotinib 2x300 mg/d
      resulting in total of at least three years TKI treatment who show recurrent disease after
      unsuccessful first stop after TKI treatment in or outside the EURO-SKI study.

      If MR4 or better is re-achieved and maintained for at least one year and MR4.5 or better is
      re-achieved and maintained for at least 6 months, patients will be eligible for a second stop
      attempt within this study. For MR4, three consecutive PCRs with MR4 or deeper should be
      measured within one year and for MR4.5, two PCRs during 6 months should demonstrate a MR4.5.

      Patients who exhibited hematological relapse after the first stop attempt will not be
      eligible for a second stop attempt within this study.

      After inclusion, 3 monthly monitoring will be performed under nilotinib treatment within the
      trial. Patients fulfilling the criteria mentioned above will then enter the screening phase.

      After verification of MR4.5, TKI treatment will be stopped and patients followed in the same
      manner as described in EURO-SKI (monthly PCRs for 6 months, 6-weekly PCRs 7-12 months after
      stopping, thereafter 3-monthly). If MMR is lost (BCR-ABL &gt;0.1% (IS)), TKI treatment will once
      again be restarted; here the same TKI (nilotinib) is recommended.

      It is assumed that after failure of first stop a switch to treatment with 2GTKI may increase
      the chance of stopping a second time [Legros et al. Blood 2012; Rea et al. Blood 2014] It is
      expected that the rate of a successful second stop at 12 and 36 months is more than 25%.

    <description>Treatment after unsuccessful 1st discontinuation at least two year with nilotinib (300 mg/bid). In total, retreatment with TKI for at least 3 years before entering screening for stopping phase is warranted. Clinical monitoring every 3 months during this 2 years.
Patients who re-achieved and maintained MR4 for at least 12 months and MR4.5 for at least 6 months can enter screening phase for TFR .If MR4.5 is confirmed by an validated laboratory, patient may enter stopping phase of the study. Patient not fulfilling these criteria can be screened again every 3 months until month 48. After TKI-stop hematological monitoring and quantitative PCR of BCR/ABL1 (month 1-6 after stopping: monthly; month 7-12 after stopping: every 1.5 months, thereafter once every three months, for 3 years in total.
Relapse is defined as BCR-ABL1 &gt; 0.1% on IS at a single time point (loss of MMR) In case of relapse restart of TKI. In general, the same TKI (nilotinib) as before second stop is recommended</description>
