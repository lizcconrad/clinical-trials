      Phase I/II Study of EP-guided Noninvasive Cardiac Radioablation (ENCORE) for Treatment of
      Ventricular Tachycardia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) who have failed standard therapy (medicines,
      invasive catheter ablation) have limited options, with one-year survival below 20%.
      Preclinical data demonstrate that single fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to
      discrete portions of the heart is feasible and may result in a reduction or elimination of
      VT. The efficacy may be further improved when guided by cardiac electrophysiologic (EP)
      testing. In total, the mapping and ablation proposed for this EP-guided Noninvasive Cardiac
      Radioablation (ENCORE) is a rapid and totally non-invasive method. Overall safety and early
      efficacy of ENCORE have not been rigorously studied in a prospective trial to-date. The
      purpose of this phase I/II study is to demonstrate the short-term safety and preliminary
      efficacy of ENCORE for patients with life-threatening, treatment-refractory VT.

    <measure>Acute (≤ 90 days) safety of noninvasive stereotactic cardiac ablation radiotherapy (ENCORE).</measure>
    <time_frame>&lt; or = 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Demonstrate acute (≤ 90 days) safety of noninvasive stereotactic cardiac ablation radiotherapy (ENCORE). The primary safety endpoint is defined by a ≤ 20% rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) using CTCAE v4.0 criteria that are possibly/probably/definitely related to study treatment, based on previously published data for expected invasive catheter-based VT-ablation procedures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of ENCORE</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Primary efficacy endpoint is defined by the number of subjects with a reduction in VT burden comparing the period six months before ENCORE treatment to the six months after ENCORE treatment as adjudicated by continuous ICD monitoring (number of ATP and ICD shocks and sustained (&gt;30 second) nontreated slow VT). There will be a six-week &quot;blanking period&quot; after therapy to allow for ablation effect. For patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, the primary efficacy will be any reduction in PVC burden based on ambulatory heart monitors.</description>

    <measure>Stricter efficacy (50% reduction)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate stricter efficacy endpoint of ENCORE treatment, as defined by number of patients who have had 50% reduction in any VT therapies (ATP or ICD shocks or sustained (&gt;30sec) nontreated slow VT) after ENCORE treatment (6 months before vs. 6 months after treatment, with a 6 week blanking period immediately after treatment). For patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, the stricter efficacy will be &gt;50% reduction in PVC burden based on ambulatory heart monitors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strictest efficacy (95% reduction)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate strictest efficacy endpoint of ENCORE treatment, as defined by number of patients who have had 95% reduction in any VT (ATP or ICD shocks or sustained (&gt;30 sec) slow VT) after ENCORE treatment (6 months before vs. 6 months after treatment, with a 6 week blanking period immediately after treatment). For patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, the strictest efficacy will be abolition of PVC burden (&lt;1%) based on ambulatory heart monitors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Most clinically useful efficacy (ICD shocks &amp; LVEF improvement)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the most clinically useful efficacy endpoint of ENCORE treatment, namely, number of patients with reduction specifically in ICD shocks (6 months before vs. 6 months after treatment, with a 6 week blanking period immediately after treatment). For patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, the most clinically useful efficacy will be improvement in cardiac function in the setting of any improvement in PVC burden.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Longer-term durability (6 to 12 month period)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate longer-term durability endpoint of ENCORE treatment, as defined by number of patients with reduction in VT therapies (ATP or ICD shock or sustained (&gt;30 sec) slow VT and ICD shock alone) during the early phase (treatment to 6 months, with 6 week blanking period) vs. the late phase (6 months to 1 year). For patients with PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, the longer-term durability efficacy will be persistence of any reduction in PVC burden based on ambulatory heart monitors during early phase vs. late phase.</description>
