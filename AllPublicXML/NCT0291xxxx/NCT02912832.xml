  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to determine the performance characteristics of TBDx with
      culture as a gold standard. In addition, the investigators will assess the laboratory
      technicians' appraisal and technical suitability of the TBDx system.

      This will be a blinded, prospective study to determine the performance of the TBDx system for
      detection of pulmonary TB in comparison to LED microscopy and culture as a gold standard. The
      study will involve recruitment of 300 TB suspects per site with a high workload and
      experienced technicians. Participants will be recruited under the FIND TB Reference Materials
      project and leftover sputum samples used for the assessment of the TBDx.

    <description>Two days of hands-on, onsite TBDx training was provided to laboratory technicians with prior experience using smear microscopy, followed by 1-day observation. Each operator performed 3-4 runs under supervision and a proficiency assessment was conducted prior to study initiation. Following study completion all technicians were given a survey to assess perception of training needs and ease of use.</description>

    <description>The TBDx is an automated platform is based on an Olympus BX41 microscope with a 40 x objective lens, fitted with an Olympus XC 10 colour camera and a movable slide stage, with an attached computer that receives high-quality digital images acquired from the camera. The computer then operates detection algorithms that segment, evaluate, and classify objects of interest in these images which can be stored for subsequent review. The platform is able to integrate an optional 200-slide automated slide loader for high volume settings. The application can capture 100, 300 or more digital fields-of-view and can provide results for positive or negative smears in 5 minutes or less.</description>
