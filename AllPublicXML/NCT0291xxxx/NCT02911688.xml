      To study the effects of 1200mg gamma tocopherol (yT), a form of vitamin E, given daily on the
      response of the airway in mild asthmatics after exposure to ozone (O3)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic asthma (AA) is the most commonly encountered respiratory disease in children and
      adults in the United States and is a leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Among the most
      disruptive expressions of disease in AA is acute asthma exacerbation. The CDC lists ambient
      air pollutants and environmental tobacco smoke as among the most common triggers for acute
      asthma exacerbation. Ozone (O3) is the most commonly encountered ambient air pollutant in the
      US.

      Increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant capability have been observed in
      asthmatics. These pollutants are pro-inflammatory and are associated with increased oxidative
      stress, which would exacerbate reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and
      RNS)-induced injury in asthmatics. O3 injures epithelial cells, releasing secondary mediators
      which activate inflammatory cells, in part by ligation of TLR4, the primary receptor for LPS.
      TLR4 activation of inflammatory cells activates NF-kB and induces oxidative stress. O3 and
      LPS has been associated with exacerbation of asthma, and we have reported that O3 and LPS
      augments allergic airway inflammation in allergic asthmatics (AA). Development of
      interventions to mitigate these responses will greatly decrease disease morbidity. Given the
      role that oxidants play in the pathophysiology of asthma exacerbation, defects in antioxidant
      levels would increase risk for acute asthma exacerbation. Nutritional deficiencies in vitamin
      E, ascorbate and selenium have been linked to asthma severity, and asthmatics have decreased
      antioxidant levels in airway fluid. It has been shown that vitamins C and E are decreased in
      airway fluids of asthmatics. Additionally, genetic factors may increase risk for oxidant
      induced exacerbation of asthma. Many investigators have reported that persons who are
      homozygous for the null polymorphism of the Glutathione-S-Transferase Mu1 (GSTM1) gene and
      unable to produce GSTM1 protein (the GSTM1 null genotype) have increased risk of acute
      pollutant-induced exacerbation of asthma. This lab has shown in healthy volunteers that the
      GSTM1 null genotype is associated with increased inflammatory response to O3, with no impact
      on the nociceptive response to this pollutant.

      Other researchers have shown that the GSTM1 null genotype is associated with increased
      response to secondhand tobacco smoke, diesel exhaust, and other particulate matter
      components. Romieu et al demonstrated that children with asthma in Mexico City were had
      increases susceptibility to O3-induced exacerbations if they had the GSTM1 null genotype.
      This group also found that GSTM1 null AAs selectively benefited from antioxidant
      intervention. The GSTM1 null genotype is found in 20-40% of the population, and may be
      overrepresented in allergic populations. Taken together, these observations show that the
      sizable GSTM1 null population is at risk for pollutant-induced airway disease, and that
      antioxidant intervention targeting the action of ROS and RNS will benefit asthmatics and
      especially GSTM1 null asthmatics.

      A non-exclusive list of proposed antioxidants includes radical scavengers such as ascorbate,
      a-tocopherol (aT), y-tocopherol (yT) or inducers of NRF2, which activate NRF2 with subsequent
      broad upregulation of acute phase II and antioxidant proteins. These agents are available in
      naturally occurring foods and as nutritional supplements. A number of animal, cell culture
      and epidemiological studies support the idea that antioxidant supplementation is useful in
      allergic airway disease. However, despite these studies and widespread public and scientific
      enthusiasm regarding use of such agents in asthmatics, there are scant human data to support
      or refute the use of such interventions for either acute or chronic allergic airways disease.

      Gamma tocopherol has both radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory actions which may play
      important roles in decreasing pollutant-induced and allergic injury to the airway. Like other
      isoforms of vitamin E, yT is a potent ROS scavenger and is also a powerful nucleophile that
      traps electrophiles such as peroxynitite in lipophilic compartments. One mechanism by which
      y-T is cytoprotective is scavenging of RNS at the un-substituted C-5 position on the
      hydroxy-chroman ring of y-T to form 5-NO-y-tocopherol (5-NO-yT). Overall, vitamin E provides
      general protection of DNA, lipids and proteins from radical stress. An example of such
      protection is shown in rodent studies of prostate cancer in which intake of yT is associated
      with decreased DNA methylation of CpG rich regions of the NRF2. NRF2 is a master regulator of
      numerous cytoprotective antioxidant enzymes.

      Supplementation with yT also prevents protein nitration and attenuates loss of plasma vitamin
      C in plasma in a rodent peritonitis model of inflammation. Our group has also shown that yT
      inhibits COX-2 and 5-LO in LPS-stimulated macrophages and IL-1b stimulated epithelial cells.
      These actions are mediated primarily by the yT metabolite 2, 7,
      8-trimethyl-2S-(.-carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychroman (y-CEHC) which requires hydroxylation of the
      y-methyl group of yT by cytochrome P450 (CYP450). In carrageenan- induced inflammation in
      male Wistar rats, yT decreases prostaglandin (PGE2) and leukotriene (LTB4) production,
      suggesting that LO-mediated production of leukotrienes may also be inhibited by yT.
      Tocopherols, including yT, also modulate gene expression of a number of inflammatory genes.
      Thus, yT and other tocopherols decrease production of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines
      at the transcriptional level.

      In animals, it has also been shown that gamma tocopherol reduces baseline eosinophilia in the
      airway. In our early phase I studies of gamma tocopherol-enriched mixed tocopherols (gT-mT)
      we have shown that gT-mT inhibits monocyte induced cytokine production, decreases baseline
      nitrosative stress, and inhibits LPS eosinophil and neutrophil influx in healthy volunteers.

      SUMMARY:

      There is widespread opinion that antioxidant nutrients like gamma tocopherol ( yT, a form of
      Vitamin E) are an untapped and inexpensive intervention for environmentally triggered acute
      asthma. However, there is a crucial gap in evidence-based support of such interventions in
      asthma. A lack of coordinated research assessing specific antioxidant regimens from
      preclinical, phase I and phase II studies impedes development of phase III antioxidant trials
      in asthmatic populations. It is also unclear which physiological endpoints are most relevant
      in such studies.
