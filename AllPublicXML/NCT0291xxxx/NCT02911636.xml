        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior pelvic radiotherapy

          -  Contra-indication to radical prostate radiotherapy e.g. connective tissue disease or
             inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Contraindication to prostate MRI

          -  Anticoagulation medication (if unsafe to discontinue for gold seed insertion)

          -  Diagnosis of bleeding diathesis

          -  Large prostate with significant arch interference on TRUS after 3 months of
