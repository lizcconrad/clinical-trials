  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the proximal intercostal block to the more medial
      (classic) ultrasound-guided paravertebral block. The investigators hypothesize that the
      proximal intercostal block will allow for improved needle visualization, shorter block time,
      and improved safety profile compared to the classic paravertebral bock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although previous studies have made advances towards applying ultrasound guidance to the
      performance of paravertebral blocks (PVB), a technique combining both safety and technical
      ease remains elusive. The ideal technique (1) permits continuous visualization of the entire
      needle shaft and tip, (2) avoids aiming the needle tip and injectate directly toward the
      neuraxis or lung, and (3) is easy to perform. Visualization of all structures by ultrasound
      is essential to minimize the risk of vascular puncture, nerve root or spinal cord injury, and
      pneumothorax. Failure to consistently and quickly identify the transverse process and pleura,
      as occurs when using older techniques, results in several needle redirections, causing pain
      and discomfort to patients, and increases the potential risk of pneumothorax. The technical
      difficulty of applying previously-described US-guided techniques takes an inordinate amount
      of time and is clinically less practical within a busy surgical practice.

      In the current study, the investigators describe a novel, modified approach to real-time
      ultrasound-guided single shot paravertebral blockade, the proximal intercostal block (PICB),
      which utilizes a sagittal paramedian US probe placement to identify the intercostal space and
      PVS. In this method, instead of placing the probe at a fixed traditional distance of 2.5 cm
      from the spinous processes, the probe is moved laterally to obtain a comprehensive image,
      with a clear view of the ribs, internal intercostal membrane, and the parietal pleura.

      The investigators propose that moving the probe laterally towards the proximal intercostal
      space allows clearer simultaneous visualization of both pleura and needle as it advances
      towards the PVS, while achieving comparable injectate spread and, ultimately, similar or
      better clinical results. Such improved visualization will reduce the number of needle passes,
      increase confidence in the user, decrease block placement time, and improve overall block
      success. This technique combines the advantages of more lateral approaches (better
      visualization of structures, in particular the pleura) with the advantage of the more medial
      approaches (in-plane, closer, and not directed at the neuraxis).

    <description>After identifying the correct intercostal space, the ultrasound probe will be moved medially to identify the transverse processes, then again laterally from the transverse processes to rest over the ribs so as to obtain the best view of ribs and pleura. A 10cm, 21G needle will be inserted in-plane at the caudal border of the probe. An attempt will be made to keep the needle tip and the target injection position (just under the internal intercostal membrane (IIM)) in view. Correct needle tip placement will be demonstrated by depression of the pleura/endothoracic fascia upon local anesthetic injection and by lack of retrograde spread of LA over the muscles or the ribs. The LA will be injected in 4 cc aliquots after negative aspiration of air, CSF and blood.</description>

    <description>After identifying the correct intercostal space, the ultrasound probe will be placed between the adjacent transverse processes in a longitudinal/parasagittal plane measuring 2.5cm from the midline. The best possible view of the transverse processes, the superior costotransverse ligament and pleura will be obtained. An attempt will be made to keep the needle tip and the target injection position (immediately beneath the costotransverse ligament) in view. Correct placement of the needle tip will be demonstrated by depression of the pleura upon injection of local anesthetic and by lack of retrograde spread of LA over the muscles or transverse processes. The LA will be injected in 4 cc aliquots after confirming negative aspiration of air, CSF and blood.</description>
