  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of nanohydroxyapatite (nano-HAP)-containing
      toothpastes and cream to relieve dentin hypersensitivity, comparing it with those of a
      commercial desensitizing dentifrice containing calcium sodium phosphosilicate (Novamin®
      technology) and a standard fluoride dentifrice containing 1,500 ppm fluoride as sodium
      monofluorophosphate (MFP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel group, outpatient clinical trial,
      involving a total of 270 patients diagnosed with dentin hypersensitivity, who will be
      randomly assigned to nine treatment groups of 30 patients each. Males or females of age 18 to
      80 years will be enrolled. The nine groups will be randomly assigned to use one of the nine
      test products: (1) toothpaste containing nano-HAP (high concentration); (2) toothpaste
      containing nano-HAP (low concentration); (3) toothpaste containing nano-HAP and potassium
      nitrate (KNO3); (4) toothpaste containing NovaMin; (5) standard fluoride toothpaste with 1500
      ppm MFP; (6) toothpaste containing nano-HAP (medium concentration); (7) placebo toothpaste;
      (8) cream containing nano-HAP; (9) placebo cream. Subjects will be instructed to use the
      study toothpaste as their sole oral hygiene product for the 8 weeks treatment duration while
      the cream will be applied with a retainer tray for 5 minutes before bed at night. For those
      using toothpastes, subjects will be instructed to brush their teeth twice daily for 2
      minutes, morning and last thing before bed, applying on each occasion a one-inch strip of
      their assigned toothpaste on a wetted commercially available soft-bristled toothbrush. Dentin
      hypersensitivity examination, which will include air blast sensitivity and cold thermal
      sensitivity combined with visual analog scale and Dental Pain Scale, will be conducted at
      baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. Subjects will be screened for adverse effects on every visit,
      and all observed adverse events will be recorded when they occur.

                  condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with
                  trial participation or may interfere with the interpretation of trial result and,
                  in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for
                  entry into this trial?

               -  Does the subject have significant oral soft tissue pathology, based on the
                  dentist's visual examination and at the discretion of the investigator?

               -  The sensitive tooth is associated with gum pain from gingivitis, occlusal trauma,
                  thermal or chemical burns?

               -  Patients having pain from periodontal related causes but not dentin
                  hypersensitivity?

               -  Previous professional desensitizing treatment?

               -  Subject use of over-the-counter desensitizing products within the previous 3
                  months?

               -  Subjects using medication which could interfere with the perception of pain?

               -  Eating disorders or conditions associated with vomiting?

               -  Systemic conditions that are etiologic or predisposing to dentinal
                  hypersensitivity?

               -  Excessive dietary or environmental exposure to acids?

               -  The sensitive tooth was restored in the preceding 3 months?

               -  The sensitive tooth is an abutment tooth for fixed or removable prostheses?

               -  The sensitive tooth has extensive restorations or restoration extending into the
                  test area?

               -  Patients below 18 years or above 80 years of age?
