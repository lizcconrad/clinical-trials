  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients having surgery to remove a liver or biliary tissue mass or having a biopsy of a mass
      or lesion will have a tissue sample collected and stored for future research of liver and
      biliary diseases. A blood sample may also be collected at the time of enrollment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study establishes a tissue and blood registry at Mayo Clinic Florida to support
      translational investigations into the biology, etiology and prognosis of liver and biliary
      masses such as through the use of patient-derived xenografts.

      Patients having surgery to remove a liver or biliary mass or having a biopsy of a mass or
      lesion will be asked to donate a portion of the removed mass for research purposes. Only
      portions of the mass not required for clinical diagnostic evaluation, or surgical waste, will
      be used in this research study.

      The tissues acquired will be stored and used for any specific, hypothesis driven protocols
      that are IRB approved. Serum and plasma samples may also be obtained at enrollment.

      Clinical patient data from medical charts that may be correlative to outcomes will be
      collected and stored in a password secure data base. Data will be extracted from medical
      records charts.
