    <textblock>
      ELDERL-IE is a multicenter national prospective observational study.

      The main objective is to describe geriatric characteristics (comorbidities, cognitive status,
      autonomy, nutritional status, balance and walking) in patients aged 75 years or older with
      infective endocarditis (IE).

      The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of geriatric features on the medico -
      surgical care and on morbidity and mortality at 3 months after the end of the
      hospitalization, and to describe the initial clinical presentation and diagnostic modalities
      in the IE elderly.
