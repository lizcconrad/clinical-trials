      OBJECTIVES: To investigate the incidence of cardiovascular events as well as progression of
      coronary artery calcium (CAC) in healthy middle-aged subjects over a period of 7 years, and
      the relation to traditional as well as new cardiovascular risk factors.

      METHODS: The Danrisk cohort was established in 2009-2010 based on random retrieval from the
      Danish national civil registry (N=1825). Initially, distribution of gender, area of residence
      and year of birth (1949 or 1959) were equal among the 4 involved centres (OUH, Svendborg,
      Vejle and Esbjerg). A total of 1257 subjects (69%) accepted the invitation to undergo
      cardiovascular risk evaluation including non-contrast enhanced cardiac CT-scan for CAC
      estimation, and a total of 1227 subjects were found free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and
      diabetes (DM), and was included in the study back then.

      In 2014-2015 the DanRisk cohort was invited to a 5 year follow-up examination. The
      investigators examined a total of 1031 subjects (82%) in the investigators 4 regional
      centres. The follow-up examination included general health evaluation and estimation of CAC
      by non-contrast enhanced cardiac CT-scan. Information of death, cardiovascular events and
      medication usage was obtained from the Danish national patient register, the Danish register
      of causes of death and the Danish national database of reimbursed prescriptions in 2016.
