      The main objective of the APW-RSV II clinical trial is to evaluate if the addition of
      azithromycin to routine bronchiolitis care, among infants hospitalized with RSV
      bronchiolitis, reduces the occurrence of recurrent wheeze during the preschool years.

      The APW-RSV II clinical trial is a double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      randomized trial, including otherwise healthy 188 participants, ages 1-18 months, who are
      hospitalized due to RSV bronchiolitis. The study includes active treatment phase with
      azithromycin or placebo for 2 weeks, and an observational phase for up to 48 months.

      The main objective of the APW-RSV II clinical trial is to evaluate if the addition of
      azithromycin to routine bronchiolitis care, among infants hospitalized with RSV
      bronchiolitis, reduces the occurrence of recurrent wheeze (RW) during the preschool years.

      Study participants will be enrolled during 3 consecutive RSV seasons beginning in Fall 2016.
      Study participants will be randomized to receive PO azithromycin 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days
      followed by 5mg/kg/day for additional 7 days, or matched placebo. The primary clinical
      outcome is the time to the occurrence of a third episode of wheezing. The duration of follow
      up is 18-48 months, which is determined based on the year in which the participants is
      recruited: first year recruits will be followed for up to 48 months, while the 3rd year
      recruits will be followed for at least 18 months.
