  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic imaging (DI) tests (for example, x-ray tests, ultrasounds, CT scans, or MRIs) are
      used by health care providers to help diagnose patient illness, but decisions regarding when
      these tests should be ordered are subjective. As a result, some physicians order these tests
      more than others. Ordering rates between clinicians seeing similar kinds of patients have
      been shown to be considerably different, suggesting that many of the tests are unnecessary.
      DI currently accounts for about 6.6% of Canadian hospital budgets, but this percentage may be
      much higher in Newfoundland where test ordering rates are almost twice the national average.
      However, cost is not the only concern. Over-testing can lead to further unnecessary testing
      to follow-up on harmless findings, and in the case of CT, large doses of potentially harmful
      radiation. The purpose of this study is to assess DI test-ordering by family physicians
      across the Eastern Health region, and compare these test ordering rates with those from other
      jurisdictions. We suspect that many clinicians are not aware that they order more DI tests
      than their peers. We will therefore develop a &quot;report card&quot; for family physicians in the
      province that shows them how many tests they are ordering compared to other physicians in the
      region. We expect that physicians who are over-ordering DI tests will reduce the number of
      tests they order after receiving their report cards. This is a low-cost way to potentially
      prevent expensive over-ordering of DI tests that can easily be implemented in the province's
      other health regions and elsewhere.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if a &quot;report card&quot; for family physicians in the
      province that shows them how many tests they are ordering compared to other physicians in the
      region will result in reducing test ordering rates. Family physicians and general
      practitioners will be stratified (grouped) by community of practice within Eastern Health,
      then randomized into an intervention &quot;report card&quot; group or into a usual practice &quot;no report
      card&quot; group. Communities with fewer than five physicians will be grouped with similar
      communities for stratified randomization purposes. Physicians in the intervention group will
      be provided a semi-annual (every 6 months) report card outlining the number of CT scans,
      ultrasounds and plain x-rays they ordered on the patients for whom they were the primary
      provider. We will assume that the primary provider is the most frequent biller of primary
      care services. Intervention participants will receive a link to the report card via email
      from the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association (NLMA) by a two-step process: The
      initial email gives a brief description of the report and contains a link which then
      redirects the clinician to a secure web page that displays the individual clinician
      diagnostic imaging utilization in a prior six month period compared to the aggregate of their
      peers in the same region.

        There are no restrictions on the age of participants.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1) All family physicians or general practitioners practicing within Eastern Health. In
             order to obtain an accurate assessment of the report in real-world implementation, we
             are requesting the right to enroll everyone who meets the inclusion criteria, and to
             waive the requirement to obtain informed consent

          -  2) Be the most frequent provider of primary care billings for a minimum of 20 patients
             during the period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Physicians who will be within the Eastern Health network for a relatively short
             period, e.g. clinicians engaged in an exchange program for training, or locums.
