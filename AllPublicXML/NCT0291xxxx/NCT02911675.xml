    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death following injury in civilian
      populations and is a major cause of death and disability in combat casualties. While primary
      brain injury cannot be reversed, the management of severe TBI focuses on the mitigation of
      secondary injury mechanisms which occur as part of the downstream effects of the primary
      damage to the brain. Many secondary injury mechanisms are manifested clinically as elevated
      intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CCP). This level and duration of
      elevated ICP is strongly associated with poor long term patient outcome.

      Currently, there are two invasive techniques that are used at our facility for monitoring ICP
      and CPP. The first method requires the placement of an intra-parenchymal fiberoptic pressure
      monitor (IPM), also known as a camino, into the brain tissue that measures and displays ICP
      continuously. The second method requires placement of an extracranial ventricular drain (EVD)
      which both measures ICP when it is closed or clamped and also allows for therapeutic drainage
      of cerebral spinal fluid (CFS) to reduce pressure within the skull when it is open.

      While clinical practices vary greatly across institutions, current clinical practice at our
      institution when using the EVD for ICP management is to allow continuous therapeutic CSF
      drainage and to manually close the drain for ICP assessment on an hourly basis. However, in a
      retrospective of study of TBI patients at our institution with simultaneous IPM and EVD
      placement, a spike in ICP was noted to correspond with the clamping of the EVD which often
      remained elevated for 15-30 minutes before returning to baseline. Due to the strong
      association between poor patient outcome and elevated ICP, this finding is alarming. These
      findings have important implications for procedures to not only treat elevated ICP, but also
      prevent potentially harmful intermittent elevations in ICP. Therefore, this study seeks to
      prospectively investigate the association between EVD clamping and elevated ICP.

      Specifically, this study has 2 main objectives:

        1. Evaluate the need for an optimized device that can simultaneously measure intracranial
           pressure and drain CSF without requiring potentially harmful clamping.

        2. Provide data in support of retaining or modifying current clinical practices regarding
           intermittent versus continuous monitoring during periods of therapeutic drainage of CSF.

      Investigators plan a single-center, 36 month prospective observational study of 50 patients
      presenting with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) at R Adams Cowley Shock
      Trauma Center who require intracranial pressure monitoring. This is an interventional device
      study utilizing the EVD/IVC and the IPM/Camino to provide and evaluate data for optimized
      treatment for the control of elevated ICP and CCP in patients with severe TBI. Enrolled
      patients will be randomized to one of two study groups listed below following the consent
      process. Once a potential participant has consented to the study, we will use the excel
      random number generator function (randbetween(0,1)) to generate random numbers between 0 and
      1 for each participant. If 0 is generated participants will be placed in Group 1 (Hourly EVD
      closures) and if 1 is generated, participants will be placed in Group 2 (EVD closure every 12
      hours). There is no placebo or control group.

      Standard of Care (25 patients): Standard EVD management with therapeutic drainage as
      appropriate and hourly EVD ICP measurements with simultaneous IPM/Camino ICP measurements
      collected.

      Experimental (25 patients): Therapeutic CSF drainage as appropriate, with EVD closure and ICP
      assessment every 12 hours with simultaneous IPM/Camino ICP measurements collected.

      Data will be collected on age, mechanism of injury, time interval between injury and MRI,
      past medical history, admission hemodynamics, admission component GCS, post-resuscitation
      component GCS, injury severity score, abbreviated injury score for head injury, blunt carotid
      or vertebral artery injury, and therapeutic interventions. Continuous vital signs streams
      will be collected.

      In addition, if available, video surveillance from the patient's stay in the Neurotrauma
      Critical Care Unit will be collected and be stored with the patients study data.
