  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled study of aripiprazole in 132 persons with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and
      bipolar I or II disorder, currently depressed or mixed phase. Primary Aim will be to assess
      change in alcohol use by the Timeline Followback (TLFB) method. Secondary Aim will include
      change in alcohol craving using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS). Changes in psychiatric
      symptoms (mania/hypomania and depression) and predictors of response will be assessed.
      Participants with ≥ 1 drinking day at week 12 will be enrolled in a 4-week extension phase
      with an upward titration to 30 mg/day for those in the active treatment group. The placebo
      group will remain on placebo.

      Subjects will be discontinued from the study if any of the following conditions occurs:
      change in diagnosis to other than bipolar I or II disorder and AUD, development of active
      suicidal or homicidal ideation with plan and intent, worsening in mood symptoms, that in the
      opinion of the investigators requires discontinuation, pregnancy, development of severe or
      life-threatening medical condition, involuntary psychiatric hospitalization or incarceration,
      significant alcohol withdrawal (e.g. delirium tremens) based on clinical judgment (increases
      in Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scores will initiate a
      careful clinical assessment of possible worsening of withdrawal symptoms), or cocaine or
      amphetamine-positive urine drug screen during the study.
