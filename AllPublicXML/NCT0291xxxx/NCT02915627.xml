      Study comparing different groups of people and how they respond to application of the
      non-pneumatic anti-shock garments. Investigators will divide all recruited participants into
      three groups based on health status (group 1: hemodialysis patients; group 2: patients with
      severe chronic kidney disease but not on dialysis; group 3: healthy participants with no
      clinically known kidney disease). Each group, which will comprise of 10 people, will receive
      the same treatment using the non-pneumatic anti-shock garments.

      Primary Aim: To determine how blood flow restriction to the lower extremities using
      non-pneumatic anti-shock garments affects hemodynamic and cardiovascular parameters such as
      blood pressure in Hemodialysis (HD) patients while they are not on dialysis.

      Investigators propose a pilot study to assess the effects of blood flow restriction using
      non-pneumatic anti-shock garments in HD patients while they are not on dialysis.

      Outcomes: The primary objective will be a measurement of blood pressure upon application of
      the non-pneumatic anti-shock garments.

      Secondary outcomes will include the following: baroreflex sensitivity; trends in beat-to-beat
      blood pressure upon application of the anti-shock garments; patient tolerability of the
      non-pneumatic anti-shock garments, ejection fraction via echocardiogram analyses.
