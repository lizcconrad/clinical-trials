  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spleen Deficiency Syndrome(SDS)is a widely researched issue, but due to the limitations of
      the research methods, the scientific mechanism of SDS is biased and not comprehensive. SDS
      would be researched in this project deeply and systematically with modern life-scientific
      methods. Based on the previous work, the participants, with SDS, suffering from Qi deficiency
      syndrome--chronic superficial gastritis--chronic atrophic gastritis--gastric cancer would be
      included, and the corresponding research would be conducted at the molecular-cell-gastric
      tissue level, and at the same time, systematical biological database of SDS would be built by
      systematical biological methods, such as pioneered SPARS sequencing technology created in our
      research group, proteomics and metabonomics. Under the above work, the investigators would
      conduct data mining and molecular network analysis, and then verify the key functions. By
      analyzing the systematical biological features of syndrome and its relationships with
      constitution and disease, this study would provide a new basis for objective reality of
      syndrome, and also offer a crucial premise of revealing biological basis for syndrome
      correctly, which is of important theoretical and practical significance.

        A total of 90 cases will be gathered between August, 2016 and September, 2017. All the
        cases include: ①10 healthy volunteers in Beijing with balanced constitution, 10 with Qi
        Deficient Constitution (Spleen-qi Deficiency Syndrome) and 10 with Damp-heat Constitution.
        ②Patients in Dongfang Hospital diagnosed as chronic superficial gastritis,chronic atrophic
        gastritis or gastric cancer, 20 for each disease and half of each with Spleen-qi Deficiency
        Syndrome, half with Spleen Damp-heat Syndrome.
