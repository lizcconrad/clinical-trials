  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the main severe disease of public health importance. Recent studies showed
      that old age is one of the most important factors in influencing the outcome of patients with
      acute stroke, and the young plasma can reverse age-related brain impairments in mice.
      Therefore, this pilot study aims to investigate whether young plasma is effective in
      alleviating brain injury and neurologic deficits induced by acute stroke in patients.

      This study will enroll 78 stroke patients who have been diagnosed with stroke and meet the
      inclusion criteria.

      After successfully meeting initial screening criteria, investigators will contact the family,
      explain the study, and send a consent form for their review.

      After that, patients will be given 2 unit/day young health plasma (young plasma exchange)
      over a course of 3 consecutive days, then investigators will make a neurofunctional
      assessment before and 7 days, 30 days and 90 days after young health plasma treatment. And
      Magnetic Resonance of the brain before, 7 days, 14 days and 90 days after young health plasma
      treatment.
