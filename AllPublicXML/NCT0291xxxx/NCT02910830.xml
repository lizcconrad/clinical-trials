      The role of tobacco in osteoarthritis remains controversial. The Khoala cohort is the first
      multicenter French cohort of subjects with knee and / or hip osteoarthritis prevalent . It
      guarantees its methodology great representativeness and therefore an interesting material for
      the study of risk factors in the population. In addition, it should have little here
      Radiographs of hands for all its patients. It therefore has the opportunity to study a
      possible relationship between tobacco and hip osteoarthritis , knee and hand but also to
      study the relationship between tobacco and structural evolution of hip osteoarthritis and /
      or symptomatic knee.
