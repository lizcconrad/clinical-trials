      open-label study of ME-401 in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory
      B-cell malignancies. The two arms of the study will be conducted in parallel, with subject
      allocation to ME-401 alone or ME-401 plus rituximab based on disease type and availability of
      an open enrollment slot in the dose escalation arm.
