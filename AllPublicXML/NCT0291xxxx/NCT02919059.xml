      This superiority of central pressure versus peripheral measures to predict cardiovascular
      events has also been reported in general population or in elder people

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognostic value of central systolic/diastolic pressure, central pulse pressure and AI
      has been well demonstrated, firstly after CAFÉ study, with 2073 hypertensive subjects
      followed up 3.4 years. It also evidenced higher prognostic value of central blood pressure
      compared to peripheral blood pressure. One year later, the STRONG study, showed central pulse
      pressure to be an independent cardiovascular risk factor as well as higher prognostic value
      compared to peripheral pulse pressure (Hazard ratio; 1,1510 mmHg Vs 1,10mmHg; X2: 13,4; p &lt;
      0,001). Those subjects with higher central blood pressure and central pulse pressure showed
      higher incidence of cardiovascular events. This superiority of central pressure versus
      peripheral measures to predict cardiovascular events has also been reported in general
      population or in elder people.

      Finally, it has been also reported that dapagliflozin modestly reduces systolic blood
      pressure in patients with T2DM who were mostly receiving treatment for hypertension. Despite
      office blood pressure remains the gold standard method for screening, diagnostic and
      treatment of hypertension, it has been also well demonstrated that ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring (ABPM) better estimates cardiovascular risk and target organ damage than office
      blood pressure. It still remains unclear the effects on 24 hours blood pressure reduction
      with SGLT-2 inhibitors.

      The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on central blood pressure reduction have not been documented.

    <description>Dagliflozin will be administred once daily before the first meal of the day for the duration of the study or until early discontinuation. Subjects will take the first dose of study drug at the study centre on Day 1.
On the day of study visits when fasting blood samples are collected, subjects will be instructed to refrain from taking the study drug before the clinic visit. The subject will be instructed to take the dose of study drug before the subject´s next meal.
The study drug must be swallowed whole with liquid and not chewed, divided, dissolved or crushed. If the subject doesn´t take the study drug within 12 hours after the first meal of the day, the dose of the study drug should be skipped for that day and keep on taking the study drug on the following day before the first meal.</description>
