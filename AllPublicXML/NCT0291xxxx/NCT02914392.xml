      This is a community-based case-control study in SHANGHAI,a municipality in CHINA. Cases will
      be identified from maternity centers. Matched controls will be accrued from the same region
      as the case came from. Pregnant cases and their controls are women (18-45 years). Cases are
      gravidas with fetal congenital heart disease diagnosed by echocardiography in 16th-29nd of
      gestational weeks. Controls are pregnant women without fetal congenital heart disease
      diagnosis. Only gravidas who are willing to have complete pregnancy checks and finally
      delivery or abortion in the hospital are interviewed are eligible for the study. About 2
      controls matched by year of birth and region will be allocated to each case. A standardized
      questionnaire will be used for all cases and controls. Field investigations are also
      conducted for them by quantitative measurement of some chemical, physical and nutritional
      factors related indicators may affect fetal cardiovascular development. Study participants
      will be asked for their informed consent.
