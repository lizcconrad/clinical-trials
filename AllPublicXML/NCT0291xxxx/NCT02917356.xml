    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of chronic degenerative joint disease, as well as
      the main cause of pain and disability in older persons worldwide. The limited results of
      physical therapy in OA makes OA patients potential candidates for complementary therapies,
      such as laying on of hands. The present study aims to investigate the effect of Laying on of
      Hands on the Pain, Joint Stiffness and Functional Capacity of Elderly Women With Knee
      Osteoarthritis. This is a randomized controlled trial with three allocation groups: spiritual
      laying on of hands (&quot;passe espiríta&quot; - Spiritist passe/spiritual healing) (SP), non-spiritual
      laying on of hands (LH) and Control Group without laying on of hands (CG). All subjects will
      participate in a 45-minute kinesiotherapy program. After that, groups will be directed to the
      5-minute session of laying on of hands according to their groups. During the application of
      SP, LH and CG, the subjects will remain in a sitting position, blindfolded with dark goggles,
      and receive the following verbal command: &quot;Relax and calm your mind.&quot; The intervention will
      happen twice a week for eight weeks and a blinded physical therapist will assess the pre and
      post scores of pain, functionality, joint stiffness (through WOMAC and visual analogic
      scale), anxiety and depression (HADS), religiosity (DUREL) and spirituality (FACIT Sp12) and
      quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref), among other secondary outcomes.

      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of chronic degenerative joint disease, as well as
      the main cause of pain and disability in older persons worldwide. The limited results of the
      medical and physical therapy approach in the OA treatment make patients with such disorder
      into possible candidates for complementary and alternative therapies (CAT) aiming to obtain a
      relieve in their symptoms. Given the importance of providing alternative scientific
      evidence-based, painless and low cost treatments, it is necessary to carry out studies in
      order to investigate the impact of CAT in culturally accepted contexts, such as laying on of
      hands with spiritual or non-spiritual contexts. The present study aims to investigate the
      effect of Laying on of Hands on the Pain, Joint Stiffness and Functional Capacity of Elderly
      Women With Knee Osteoarthritis. This is a randomized controlled trial with three allocation
      groups: spiritual laying on of hands (&quot;passe espiríta&quot; - Spiritist passe/spiritual healing)
      (SP), non-spiritual laying on of hands (LH) and Control Group without laying on of hands
      (CG). All subjects will participate in a 45-minute kinesiotherapy program. After that, groups
      will be directed to the 5-minute session of laying on of hands according to their groups.
      During the application of SP, LH and CG, the subjects will remain in a sitting position,
      blindfolded with dark goggles, and receive the following verbal command: &quot;Relax and calm your
      mind.&quot; The intervention will happen twice a week for eight weeks and a blinded physical
      therapist will assess the pre and post scores of pain, functionality, joint stiffness
      (through WOMAC and visual analogic scale), anxiety and depression (HADS), religiosity (DUREL)
      and spirituality (FACIT Sp12) and quality of life (WHOQOL-Bref), among other secondary
      outcomes.

    <description>The SP will be applied after physical therapy (kinesiotherapy). Spiritual healers from Spiritism will perform the SP. In order to produce a culturally acceptable environment, the Spiritist therapists will 'prepare' the environment by praying for 5 minutes. The Spiritist therapists will hold both hands 10-15 cm above the patients' head. Then, they will longitudinally lower their hands starting from the patients' head towards their legs, for four times. Subsequently, the therapists shall lay their hands on patients' head and on their knees. The therapists will remain silent during these procedures and try to 'heal' the patients. The subjects will remain in a seated position, blindfolded with dark-blinded goggles, and will receive the following verbal command: &quot;Relax and calm your mind.&quot;</description>

They will visualize the following sentence: &quot;I want you to heal&quot;; without saying prayers or invocations. The subjects will remain in a seated position, blindfolded with dark-blinded goggles, and will receive the following verbal command: &quot;Relax and calm your mind.&quot;</description>
