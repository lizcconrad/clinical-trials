  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine if administering ketamine as an
      intravenous (IV) infusion over 15 minutes, as compared to an IV push, will decrease adverse
      drug reactions without attenuating its analgesic effects.

      Study design: prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial.

      Objective: The purpose of this randomized, controlled, double-blind trial is to evaluate if
      sub-dissociated dose ketamine given as an infusion versus an intravenous (IV) push over 1
      minute has fewer and/or less severe adverse drug reactions and provides equivalent analgesia
      for patients with moderate to severe pain in the emergency department (ED).

      Study design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blind trial

      Participants: Research assistants will recruit patients ≥18 years old with moderate to severe
      pain (NRS≥5) and an anticipated stay in the emergency department ≥1 hour. A sample size
      calculation was performed based on prior data which suggests that 60% of IV push arm and 20 %
      of infusion arm will have adverse drug reactions. investigators assume an alpha of 0.05 and a
      power of 0.8, which results in 56 patients needing to be enrolled.

      Intervention: After a trained research assistant obtains written informed consent,
      pharmacists will randomize the participants to the IV push or IV infusion arm of the study.
      All patients will be placed on a cardiac monitor. All patients will receive and IV push over
      1 minute and a 100 mL normal saline minibag over 15 minutes.

      In the IV push arm, pharmacists will provide to the nurse ketamine 0.3 mg/kg in a 10 mL
      syringe and a 100 mL normal saline minibag. The nurse will start the minibag of normal saline
      and then administer the IV push of ketamine over 1 minute.

      In the IV infusion arm, pharmacists will provide to the nurse ketamine 0.3 mg/kg in a 100 mL
      normal saline minibag and a 10 mL syringe of normal saline. The nurse will start the minibag
      of normal saline and then administer the IV push over 1 minute.

      Data collection: The trained research assistant will collect data on the patients' pain
      scores, adverse drug reactions (presence, severity, and how bothersome they are), and vital
      signs.

      Statistical analysis: Investigators will perform descriptive statistics, compare the
      proportion of patients with side effects, compare the severity of the side effects scores,
      and compare how bothersome the side effects.
