  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a single 84-milligram (mg)
      dose of intranasal esketamine compared to placebo, on next day driving performance and
      repeated administration of 84 mg intranasal esketamine on same-day driving performance as
      assessed by the mean difference of standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) from an
      on-road driving test.
