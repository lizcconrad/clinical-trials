  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients' experiences with having gynecologic or prostate medical
      oncologists and surgeons offer them genetic testing, and having genetic counselors return the
      test results to patients over the telephone. This is different from the usual approach to
      genetic testing, where gynecologic or prostate medical oncologists and surgeons refer their
      patients to a genetic counselor in order to have these tests done, and the genetic counselors
      return the test results to the patient in person or over the telephone. The investigators
      will only be evaluating this alternative way of providing genetic testing to ovarian or
      prostate cancer patients.

    <description>This study is a prospective single-arm study to examine how an alternative clinical genetics cancer care delivery model affects ovarian, prostate or pancreas cancer patients' cognitions, emotions, and behaviors. Participants will be contacted 1 week (+/- 1 week) (Assessment #2; and 3 months (+/- 2 weeks) (Assessment #3;) following the telephone post-test counseling session to complete the follow-up assessments. These assessments will measure psychological and behavioral study constructs.</description>

        Patients with ovarian, prostate or pancreas cancer who are considered appropriate for
        multiplex genetic testing by their MSK DMT physician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MSK patient age 18 years or older.

          -  Diagnosed with or presumed by physician to have invasive epithelial ovarian cancer,
             peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer, or prostate cancer, or pancreatic cancer.

          -  Deemed to be clinically appropriate for multiplex genetic testing by their MSK Gyn DMT
             ,GU DMT or GI DMT physician.

          -  Agreed to receive clinical multiplex genetic testing from their MSK Gyn DMT, GU DMT or
             GI DMT physician.

          -  English-fluent; the surveys were designed and validated in English and are not
             currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other
             languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures.
             Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete the
             surveys.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who do not or will not receive their ongoing cancer care at MSK.

          -  Major psychiatric illness or cognitive impairment that in the judgment of the study
             investigators or study staff would preclude study participation.

          -  Any patients who are unable to comply with the study procedures as determined by the
             study investigators or study staff.

          -  For ovarian cancer patients only: patient insured by a payer that does not provide
             coverage for multiplex genetic testing as delivered in this protocol (e.g., Cigna,
             United Health Care, or Oxford, (because these payers require genetic counseling by a
             genetics professional prior to testing).
