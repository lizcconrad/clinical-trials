      The study evaluate the quality of epidural anaesthesia and the safety of Chloroprocaine HCl
      3% compared with Ropivacaine HCl 0.75% in patients with an epidural catheter in situ
      undergoing unplanned Caesarean section.

    <textblock>
      Labouring women who have an epidural catheter in situ and established analgesia, in need of
      an unplanned Caesarean section, will be randomly allocated to receive either Chloroprocaine
      HCl 3% (T-group) or Ropivacaine HCl 0.75% (R-group) epidurally. Prior to the epidural
      injection, the patient will be transferred to the operating theatre. The local anaesthetic
      solution will be freshly prepared and 20 mL will be administered by epidural injection,
      according to the standard hospital procedures, as detailed in the &quot;Study Schedule&quot; section
      below. Time T0 is defined as the start time of the first epidural injection of the
      investigational product. In case of pain or discomfort, a 6 mL epidural top-up of the same
      anaesthetic, i.e. Chloroprocaine HCl 3% in T-group and Ropivacaine HCl 0.75% in R-group, will
      be administered. The anaesthesiologist(s) administering the anaesthetic and collecting the
      data will be blinded with respect to the treatment given to each patient.
