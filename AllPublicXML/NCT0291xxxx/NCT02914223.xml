        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent in a language understandable to the subject prior to any
             study-mandated procedure

          -  Healthy male subjects aged between 45 and 65 years (inclusive) at screening

          -  No clinically significant findings on the physical examination at screening

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18.0 to 30.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at screening

          -  Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 100-145 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 50-90
             mmHg, measured on either arm, after 5 min in the supine position at screening and at
             Day 1 pre-dose

          -  Heart rate (HR) 55-90 bpm (inclusive) measured with 12-lead ECG after 5 min in the
             supine position at screening and at Day 1 pre-dose

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to cenerimod or to S1P receptor modulators, or to any
             excipients of the cenerimod drug formulation

          -  History or clinical evidence of any disease and/or existence of any surgical or
             medical condition, which might interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of the study treatment (appendectomy and herniotomy allowed,
             cholecystectomy not allowed)

          -  History or clinical evidence suggestive of active or latent tuberculosis including a
             positive QuantiFERON®-TB test at screening

          -  Any cardiac condition or illness (including 12-lead ECG abnormalities) with a
             potential to increase the cardiac risk of the subject based on the standard 12-lead
             ECG at screening and at Day 1 pre-dose

          -  Participation in another study with a radiation burden of &gt; 0.1 mSv and ≤ 1 mSv in the
             period of 1 year prior to screening; a radiation burden of ≥ 1.1 mSv and ≤ 2 mSv in
             the period of 2 years prior to screening, etc. (add 1 year per 1 mSv)

          -  Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may affect
             the subject's full participation in the study or compliance with the protocol

          -  Any immunosuppressive treatment within 6 weeks or within 5 elimination half-lives of
             the immunosuppressive treatment, whichever is longer, before study treatment
             administration
