  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interscalene block provides effective analgesia after shoulder surgery. It consists of
      injecting local anaesthetic within the brachial plexus, in the interscalene groove, between
      the anterior and middle scalene muscles. Unfortunately, this technique is associated with
      respiratory complications such as hemidiaphragmatic paresis due to the spread of the local
      anaesthetic towards the phrenic nerve that lies close to the brachial plexus, with an
      incidence up to 100%. The diaphragmatic paresis may be a serious side-effect, especially in
      patients suffering from a reduced respiratory function such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease; this entity may even represent a contraindication to the performance of the block.

      The shoulder is mainly innervated by the suprascapular and axillary nerves, both of them
      coming from C5 and C6 branches of the brachial plexus block. Recently, several authors have
      successfully identified and block these two nerves under ultrasound guidance. Only one
      randomised controlled trial compared interscalene block with a combination of suprascapular
      and axillary nerve blocks, and showed inconclusive results probably due to the absence of
      ultrasound guidance; indeed, analgesia was equivalent at the sixth postoperative hour, while
      patients with an interscalene block had reduced pain scores in the recovery room. Besides,
      the authors did not investigate the impact on the respiratory function.

      In that randomised controlled trial, the investigators would like to compare the analgesic
      efficacy and the respiratory outcomes between the interscalene block and the combined
      suprascapular-axillary nerve blocks.
