    <textblock>
      This project aims at testing the effect of applying the KMC on the premature infants'
      physiological outcomes. The findings of this project are expected to contribute to the
      discipline of preterm infants' care by providing evidence of the benefits, barriers, and
      facilities of providing the KMC in our Jordanian NICUs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature infants are often unable physiologically to adapt well to the stressful environment
      of the NICU. These neonates are commonly at risk for the development of short and long term
      outcomes ranging from mild developmental delay to severe disability. The Kangaroo mother care
      approach (KMC) is developed to minimize the effect of prematurity and the NICU environmental
      stressors on premature infants. This project aims at assessing the neonatal nurses' knowledge
      and attitudes of the application of the KMC approach in the neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU), testing the effect of applying the KMC on the premature infants' physiological
      outcomes, and exploring the mothers' lived experiences of providing KMC for their premature
      infants. The findings of this project are expected to contribute to the discipline of preterm
      infants' care by providing evidence of the benefits, barriers, and facilities of providing
      the KMC in our Jordanian NICUs.
