    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess: 1 safety and tolerability of adenovirus serotype 26
      (Ad26) prime and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boost versus placebo in participants on
      suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) that was initiated during acute Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection; 2) Measure the frequency and duration of sustained
      viremic control after receiving Ad26 prime/MVA boost or placebo, defined as greater than 24
      weeks with plasma HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) lesser than (&lt;)50 copies/ml after antiretroviral
      (ARV) analytical treatment interruption (ATI).
