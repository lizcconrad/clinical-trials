    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether different DAV132 dose regimens are safe and
      effective for capturing fecal residues of moxifloxacin in healthy volunteers.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the performances of different DAV132 dose regimens in
      healthy volunteers:

        -  To capture antibiotic residues in the colon without interfering with its systemic
           pharmacokinetics.

        -  To prevent antibiotic-induced changes of the intestinal microbiota. In addition, the
           security of DAV132 given at different dose regimens during 7 days will be evaluated.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, repeated doses, 12 parallel groups, open-label
      study, blinded to analytical and microbiological evaluations.
