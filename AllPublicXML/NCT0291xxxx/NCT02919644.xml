      Vaccination with autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous tumour homogenate after
      curative resection for stage IV colorectal cancer: a phase II study.

      Primary objectives: Safety Immunological efficacy, expressed as number of patients who show
      enhancement of the proportion of circulating immune effectors specific for a selected panel
      of Colon-Rectal Cancer (CRC)-associated antigens.

      Secondary objectives: Clinical outcome of the patients (OS, RFS, TTR). To evaluate the
      predictive role of the development of a positive DTH test after at least three vaccine
      administrations.

      To evaluate the persistence of an antitumor immune response after the completion of the
      vaccination program.

      To evaluate the prognostic or predictive role of the enhancement of a specific immune
      response.

      To evaluate a panel of inflammatory cytokines involved in antitumor immune response.

      To evaluate the predictive role of immune cells in tumour microenvironment. To evaluate the
      predictive role of tumour antigen expression.

      This is a two-stage, phase 2 clinical trial designed according to Simon minimax design. A 40%
      immune response rate would preclude further studies, while a 70% immune response rate would
      indicate that further studies would be warranted. Given α and β error of 0.1, the first stage
      will require enrolment of 7 patients. If at least 3 patients show an immune response and
      toxicity is acceptable, the study will proceed to the second stage and additional 12 patients
      will be enrolled.

      The vaccine will be considered immunologically active if at least 11 patients are
      immunological responders.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have histologically confirmed stage IV colorectal cancer surgically
             treated with radical intent.

          2. The autologous surgical specimen must have been collected and sent to the Somatic Cell
             Therapy Lab of Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori (IRST
             IRCCS) and must fulfil all the acceptance criteria prescribed by the Good
             Manufacturing practise (GMP) procedures.

          3. The patient must be disease-free, as assessed by CT scan or MRI of the chest, abdomen,
             pelvis performed within 60 days before enrolment. If the resected lesions had occurred
             in other sites, these must be also included in the baseline CT scan and in all the
             subsequent evaluations.

          4. The patient must have recovered (grade 1 or less by CTCAE 4.0) from all the adverse
             events related to previous surgery.

          5. Age &gt;18 years.

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.

          7. Patient must have acceptable organ function, defined as:

               1. Haemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl

               2. White blood cells ≥4000/μl.

               3. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;1500/μl.

               4. Platelets ≥100000/μl.

               5. aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;3 times the
                  upper institutional reference level.

               6. Total bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper institutional reference level.

               7. Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 times the upper institutional reference level.

          8. Patients aged 70 years or older must have left ventricular ejection fraction not lower
             than 55% as assessed by echocardiography.

          9. Female patients of childbearing potential and all male patients must accept and be
             compliant with an highly effective contraceptive method (i.e. with a failure rate of
             &lt;1% per year: double barrier method, one barrier method plus spermicidal, intrauterine
             device, or oral contraception) from informed consent signature and up to three months
             after end of study. For this purpose are considered of childbearing potential all
             female subjects after puberty unless they are post-menopausal for at least two years
             or are surgically sterile. Complete abstinence from sexual intercourses is acceptable
             if patients' lifestyle guarantees his/her strict compliance with this prescription in
             the judgement of the Investigator.

         10. The patient is willing and able to give written informed consent for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with residual disease after surgery. Marginal resection of any lesion in the
             absence of clinically evident residual disease is acceptable.

          2. Patients who relapsed within 6 months since primary treatment of stage I-III
             colorectal cancer. If adjuvant chemotherapy had been administered, the term must be
             computed since last chemotherapy dose.

          3. Patient who completed surgery more than 60 days before study enrolment.

          4. History of other neoplastic diseases in the previous 5 years, except basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin and in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri treated with curative
             surgery.

          5. History of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, including history of organ
             transplantation.

          6. Any positivity for the serologic markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) (including at
             least anti-HBs antibodies and anti-hepatitis B core (HBc) antibodies), hepatitis C
             virus (HCV), HIV or Treponema pallidum. The serologic tests must have been performed
             within 30 days before any GMP-regulated activity (i.e. surgical resection and
             leukapheresis). The sole positivity for antibodies against the HBV S antigen (i.e.
             with all other HBV markers negative) is indicative of previous HBV vaccination and
             therefore is acceptable.

          7. Female patients who are pregnant or nursing.

          8. Patients undergone surgery after preoperatory chemotherapy with a fluoropyrimidine
             plus oxaliplatin, unless they are not candidate for postoperatory chemotherapy with
             the same schedule in the opinion of the Investigator (e.g. for unacceptable toxicity)
             or refuse completion of the perioperatory treatment.

          9. Participation in another clinical trial with any investigational agent within 30 days
             prior to study screening.

         10. Any active inflammatory or autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids or other
             immunomodulatory agents as detailed in section 6.4, or potentially requiring such
             treatments during the study treatment in the judgement of the Investigator.

         11. Any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Transfusion
             Medicine specialist, is a contraindication to leukapheresis. In addition, all patients
             aged 70 or older must be evaluated by a cardiology specialist before the procedure to
             exclude any clinically relevant cardiac condition and any grade 3-4 cardiac
             arrhythmia, even if asymptomatic.

         12. Any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates the
             subcutaneous administration of low-dose IL-2 as per protocol (see section 6.2 for
             details).

         13. Any uncontrolled serious intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations potentially impacting
             patient safety and compliance in the opinion of the Investigator.

         14. Refusal of giving written informed consent.
