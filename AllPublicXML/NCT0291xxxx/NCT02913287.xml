    <textblock>
      The aim of the overall project is to investigate the potential of a combination of
      commercially available nutraceuticals produced by Marigot Ltd (natural seawater derived
      mineral-rich AquaminMG and seaweed-derived mineral-rich food supplement AquaminTM (FDA GRAS
      000028) isolated from Lithothamnion species), as safe and effective supplements to promote
      cognition in the aged brain.

          4. Have a significant acute or chronic co-existing illness (cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, endocrinological, immunological, metabolic or any condition which

          7. Have diagnosis of significant low or high calcium or magnesium levels.

          8. Have a condition or are taking a medication that the investigator believes would
             interfere with the objectives of the study, pose a safety risk or confound the
             interpretation of the study results; to include misoprostrol, polystyrene sulfonate,
