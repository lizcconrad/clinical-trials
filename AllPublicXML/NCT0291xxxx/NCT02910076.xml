  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are among the oldest prescribed drugs still
      used in clinical practice. Relatively inexpensive and well tolerated, these drugs have been
      recognized to be effective in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Interestingly, there is growing evidence of their
      beneficial impact on cardiovascular risk, particularly diabetes. HCQ therapy can improve
      balance in patients with unbalanced diabetes. This drug therapy may be a new therapeutic
      approach for diabetes. There is need for a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible
      for the improvement of the metabolic response to drug treatment. The investigators
      hypothesize that treatment with a drug improves the function of the beta cell and its ability
      to secrete insulin in response to glucose. The investigators will examine the impact of
      short-term therapy for HCQ in beta cell function in healthy volunteers and in patients with
      type 2 diabetes.
