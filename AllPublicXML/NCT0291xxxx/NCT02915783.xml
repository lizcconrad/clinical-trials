  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter, Phase 2 study of lenvatinib in combination with everolimus
      in participants with unresectable advanced or metastatic non clear cell renal cell carcinoma
      (nccRCC) who have not received any chemotherapy for advanced disease. The primary objective
      of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR). This study consists of three
      phases: a Pretreatment Phase (Screening and Baseline Periods), a Treatment Phase (starting
      Cycle 1, Day 1), and a Posttreatment Phase (End of Treatment Visit and survival Follow-up).

    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of participants who have a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to &lt;10 millimeters (mm). PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded at Baseline or during treatment. The sum must also have an absolute increase of ≥5 mm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug until the date of death from any cause.</description>
