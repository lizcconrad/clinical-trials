  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a substudy to a randomised trial investigating the effect of liraglutide on body
      weight and pain in overweight or obese patients with knee osteoarthritis (NCT02905864). In
      the parent trial, patients will be subjected to an 8-week diet intervention phase including a
      low-calorie diet and dietetic counselling, after which.they will be randomised to receive
      either liraglutide 3 mg or liraglutide 3 mg placebo as an add-on to dietetic guidance on
      re-introducing regular foods and a focus on continued motivation to engage in a healthy
      lifestyle.

      This substudy aims to investigate any changes in physical activity associated with the
      initial 8-week weight loss intervention.

      The investigators aim to describe changes in physical activity associated with a significant
      weight loss among overweight/obese individuals with knee OA. The investigators will take
      advantage of the planned trial &quot;Effect of liraglutide on body weight and pain in overweight
      patients with knee osteoarthritis: A randomised, double blind, placebo‐controlled, parallel
      group, single‐centre trial&quot; (the parent trial) in which a significant weight loss is sought
      achieved over 8 weeks by means of intensive dietary counseling and meal replacement in
      overweight/obese individuals with knee OA.

      The investigators hypothesize that weight loss is associated with a decrease in daily time
      spent physically inactive.

      Physical activity is measured using accelerometer based recordings using a wearable sensor
      that continuously records physical activity over the entire weight loss program (8 weeks).
      The sensor is miniaturised, discretely worn on the thigh, and is waterproof. Thus the
      measurements interfere minimally with the participants daily life.

    <description>Participants receive a hypo-caloric formula diet containing 800 to 1,000 kcal/day. The formula diet consists of ready-to-use meal bars and powders to mix with water to make shakes, soups, or porridge. The weight loss programme consists of an 8-week period with full meal replacement by a standard liquid energy intake protocol. To facilitate compliance with the programme, participants will be scheduled for weekly facility-based group sessions with 6-8 participants led by a dietician. The recommendations for daily nutrient intake will be met.</description>
