  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective imaging study investigating the utility of hyperpolarized
      C-13 pyruvate as a Biomarker of PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition in patients with advanced solid
      tumor malignancies. The current protocol will serve as a companion imaging biomarker study
      paired with therapeutic trials of PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors (e.g. CUDC-907, BYL719), as
      well as a stand-alone protocol for patients treated with standard-of-care therapies
      inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway (eg. everolimus).

      This is a single center prospective imaging study investigating the utility of hyperpolarized
      C-13 pyruvate/metabolic MR imaging. The current protocol will serve as a companion imaging
      biomarker study paired with therapeutic trials of PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors (e.g.
      CUDC-907, BYL719), as well as a stand-alone protocol for patients treated with
      standard-of-care therapies inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway (eg. everolimus).

      In Part A (run-in feasibility phase), patients will undergo imaging at a single time point,
      without paired tumor biopsy. There will be no follow up imaging or requirement for treatment
      with PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor. Iterative adjustment of radiofrequency coil geometry and
      imaging sequences will be undertaken to optimize intra-tumoral hyperpolarized
      pyruvate/lactate signal-to-noise ratio with the goal of achieving signal-to-noise ratio of at
      least 10 in a minimum of 3 patients in order to proceed to Part B of the study.

      In part B, patients will undergo paired baseline hyperpolarized C-13 pyruvate imaging + tumor
      biopsy,then initiate treatment with agent inhibiting the PI3K/mTOR pathway. After 21 days
      (+/- 14 days), patients will undergo repeat hyperpolarized C-13 pyruvate MR imaging + tumor
      biopsy. Patients will subsequently be treated with PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient/physician decision to discontinue therapy.

    <description>For the purposes of analyzing the association between percent change from baseline in intra-tumoral peak lactate/pyruvate ratio on HP MRI with subsequent clinical outcomes, the cohort will be dichotomized by the median percent change.

    <description>Analyses will be performed to compare the HP MR markers with immunohistochemical and enzyme expression and activity data from biopsy tissue to investigate the molecular and physiological underpinnings of the HP 13C MR data. When both the HP biomarker and molecular biomarker (LDHA activity) are continuous variables, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient will be used to investigate a possible correlation between them. If the outcome is categorical (e.g. immunohistochemistry score 0-1+ vs 2-3+ for pS6, pAkt, LDHA, and MCT 1/4 expression), the HP biomarker distributions will be compared between the two categories using the Mann-Whitney test.</description>
