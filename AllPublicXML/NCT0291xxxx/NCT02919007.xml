      Study objectives:

      To test the Silk'n HST Device usability, i.e., the self-selection, labeling comprehension,
      and safe and effective device use by potential end users, under actual use conditions.
      Additionally, this study was aimed to evaluate if contraindicated subjects self-exclude from
      use of the device.

      Investigation Design:

      The study is a usability study. Twenty five potential participants were enrolled in a single
      location (shopping mall). Participants received the Silk'n HST device in its original package
      with the complete user manual and performed a full treatment. Post-treatment questionnaire
      and labeling comprehension exam were conducted following treatment. Out of the twenty five
      subjects five participants contraindicated to the study inclusion criteria were self-exclude
      from use of the device.

      Success criteria:

      Using the device, all 20 tested subjects are able to complete device related tasks, including
      applying and operating the Silk'n device without assistance in a timeframe of up to one hour
      and with minimal attempts to ask for assistance.

      Additionally, measurable usability criteria for specific, critical steps, such as
      time-to-completion, frequency of attempts to ask examiner, numerical ratings, etc., were
      evaluated using observer evaluation and user post-test questionnaire responses.

      Sample Size:

      Twenty five subjects identified as potential end users of the device including five subjects
      with contraindication to the device were recruited to the study. The number of subjects is
      appropriate considering the device and user related risks, low probable occurrence and
      severity of these risks, and the design of the study. Furthermore, usability studies are not
      seeking statistical significance.
