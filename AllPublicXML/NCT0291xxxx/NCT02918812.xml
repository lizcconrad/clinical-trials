    <textblock>
      This study compares the effect of intracervical block with 1% lidocaine and intramuscular
      diclofenac 75mg in decreasing pain perception during hysterosalpingography. Half of
      participants will receive intracervical block with 1% lidocaine, while the other half will
      receive intramuscular diclofenac 75mg.

    <textblock>
      Hysterosalpingography (HSG) is a radiographic test to evaluate the contour of the uterine
      cavity and patency of the fallopian tubes after injection of a radio-opaque dye through the
      cervix. It is typically performed in the evaluation of infertility or to diagnose uterine
      anomalies. It is the most common method of tubal evaluation in the developing countries
      because it is cheap, readily available and requires less expertise. Unfortunately, HSG can
      cause discomfort or pain for the patient during or after the procedure, and this evokes
      anxiety and fear for many patients. Up to 72 % of women complain of significant discomfort
      with this test.

      Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic which exerts its effect by altering neuronal depolarization
      by blocking the sodium channels in the cell membrane, thereby preventing transmission of the
      sensation of pain to the higher neurons. Lidocaine is commonly used for infiltration and for
      peripheral nerve blocks if an intermediate duration is required.

      Diclofenac is a Non-steroidal anti inflammatory drug that reduce nociception which is related
      to inflammation and inflammatory mediators whether from trauma

    <description>A detailed description of the visual analogue scale (VAS) will be given personally to each woman prior to the procedure. The VAS included a 10 cm linear scale on which 0 represents 'no pain' and 10 represents 'worst pain imaginable'. All patients will be asked to grade their perceived lower abdominal pain levels during specified stages of HSG using the VAS as explained to them. The scale will be used at different stages of the procedure: (1) before beginning the procedure; (2) after speculum application but before instrumentation; (3) after the application of the tenaculum and metal cannula and just before the injection of contrast medium; (4) at the end of uterine filling with contrast medium;</description>
