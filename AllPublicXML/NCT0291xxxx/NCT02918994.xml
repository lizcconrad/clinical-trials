  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to conduct a series of case studies on the impact of
      LearningRx cognitive training on cognitive skills, brain structure, and daily functioning for
      participants with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a multiple baseline design across cases with start point randomization, the proposed
      study will examine the outcomes from LearningRx one-on-one cognitive training across domains
      on standardized measures used to monitor treatment effectiveness for TBI.
