    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a phase 1 study which carried out to establish the pharmacokinetic
      equivalence and equal safety of human recombinant anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal
      antibody injection and Adalimumab when used as a single subcutaneous injection in healthy
      volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This is a comparative, open, randomized clinical study. The purpose of the study is to
      demonstrate that human recombinant anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody
      injection is equivalent to adalimumab in terms of pharmacokinetics and safety after single
      subcutaneous injection in Chinese healthy volunteers.The study will enroll 180 healthy
      volunteers, who will be randomized into 2 groups.
