    <textblock>
      This research will help us to learn if the medicine called metformin reduces the risk of
      death, heart attacks, and/or strokes in patients who have pre-diabetes and heart or blood
      vessel problems.

      CSP #2002 is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double blind, secondary prevention trial
      to test the hypothesis that treatment with metformin, compared with placebo, reduces
      mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with pre-diabetes and established
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Qualifying patients have pre-diabetes defined by
      HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and/or oral glucose tolerance test criteria; clinically evident
      coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arterial atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; and
      estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 45 mL/min/1.73 m2; and do not fulfill any
      exclusion criteria. Patients who are eligible and agree to participate are randomly assigned
      to treatment with metformin XR (titrated to a maximum dose of 2000 mg daily based on safety
      and tolerability) or matching placebo. All patients receive counseling on therapeutic
      lifestyle recommendations.
