      This will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose, Phase I
      study in healthy male subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Single oral doses of AKB-4924 will be investigated in up to 6 sequential cohorts of 8 healthy
      male subjects. Primarily 6 dose levels are planned; the proposed doses are 20 mg, 60 mg, 120
      mg, 240 mg, 360 mg, and 480 mg. Actual doses may be decreased or increased based on the
      safety and tolerability of the drug, as determined by the Investigator and Sponsor.
      Additional cohorts may be added as needed to test lower, higher, or repeat doses.

          3. Understands the procedures and requirements of the study and provides written informed
             consent and authorization for protected health information disclosure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-vasectomized male subjects and their female partners who are unable or unwilling
             to use an acceptable method of contraception (as described in Section 8.1.3,
             Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance Measures) during the study and for 30 days
             following the last dose of study medication.

          2. Evidence of active infection, unless the medical monitor and Investigator agree that
             the subject is appropriate for this study.

          3. Current or past history of chronic disease including, but not limited to,
             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, pulmonary, neurologic, renal, or

          5. Clinically important or significant conduction abnormalities on ECG at Screening
             (including QTcF intervals &gt;450 msec) and/or history of long QT syndrome. It is
             acceptable to repeat the ECG to confirm findings.

          6. Any history of malignancy in the previous 5 years except for curatively resected basal
             cell carcinoma of skin or squamous cell carcinoma of skin, or resected benign colonic

             (HBsAg), or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies.

          8. Serum transaminase (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase
             [ALT]) levels &gt;1.5X the upper limit of normal (ULN). If a subject presents with an
             abnormal AST and/or ALT results, the subject may be re-scheduled or the test may be
             repeated once at the discretion of the Investigator.

          9. Serum creatinine level ≥1.50 mg/dL. It is acceptable to repeat the test to confirm
             findings.

         15. Any use of alcohol within 48 hours of admission to the CRU.

         16. Consumption of foods or beverages containing caffeine from 24 hours prior to dosing
             until the last sample collected during the Treatment period.

         17. Subjects with a known history of smoking and/or has used nicotine or
             nicotine-containing products within the past 6 months.

         18. Positive screen for drugs of abuse or a positive alcohol or cotinine result at
             screening or Day 1.

         19. Donation of blood or blood products during the 4 weeks prior to dosing of study drug.

             longer, preceding Day 1, or ongoing or scheduled participation in another
             investigational study during the present study through the Day 8 Follow-Up.

         22. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
             the Investigator's judgment, would make the subject inappropriate for study entry.

         23. Known allergy to HPβCD.
