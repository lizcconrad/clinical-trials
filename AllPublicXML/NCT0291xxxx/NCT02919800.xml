      A Phase 1, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single dose, dose-escalation study
      to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of subcutaneous
      administration of a long-acting recombinant factor VIIa (MOD-5014) in healthy adult males.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-dose, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating
      study.

      The study will include four escalating dose groups, with eight subjects in each dose group.
      Subjects will be randomized in 3:1 ratio to receive a single SC injection of MOD-5014 (n=6)
      or a placebo (n=2), and will be followed up for 30 days. The initial MOD-5014 dose group will
      receive 100 µg/kg followed by single doses of 200, 400 and 600 µg/kg administered to
      subsequent subject cohorts.

      The decision to proceed to the higher dose level will be made by a Data Safety Monitoring
      Board (DSMB) after review of relevant safety data (including adverse events, clinical
      laboratory and vital signs), collected up to and including 7 days after the last subject of
      the previous dose group has been dosed.

      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) guidelines will be used to determine
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Dose escalation will be
      permitted if the prior dose is well tolerated, and there are no safety or tolerability
      concerns raised by the investigator, sponsor, medical monitor or DSMB over 7 days
      post-dosing.

    <description>MOD-5014 longevity is the result of fusion of three consecutive C-terminal peptide (CTP) domains to the C-terminus of FVII. CTP technology is based on a natural peptide, the C-terminal peptide of the beta chain of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which provides hCG with the required longevity to maintain pregnancy (initial half-life [t1/2] ~10 h, terminal t1/2 ~37 h). The beta chain of luteinizing hormone (LH), a gonadotropin that triggers ovulation, is almost identical to hCG but does not include the CTP. As a result, LH has a significantly shorter half-life in blood (initial t1/2 ~1 h, terminal t1/2 ~10 h) (Fares et al., 1992).</description>
