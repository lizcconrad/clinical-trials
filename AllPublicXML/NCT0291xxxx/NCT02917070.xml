    <textblock>
      Inbreeding and consanguineous marriages are known to increase the risk of autosomal recessive
      disorders. The aim of this study was to examine the association between consanguinity and
      kidney diseases in the adult Turkish population.

      This was a national, cross-sectional study recruiting patients from nephrology out-patient
      clinics and dialysis units. All patients between 18 and 70 years of age who were on follow up
      in outpatient clinic and dialysis unit at the Istanbul Medical Faculty from October 2009 to
      October 2015 were included in the study. All patients and healthy controls enrolled in this
      study gave informed consent to participate in the survey. They were all asked to answer a
      questionnaire including socio-demographic data, history of familial kidney disease and
      consanguineous marriage. Additional information was obtained from their private physicians
      and medical files. To ensure reliability of administration of the questionnaire, all
      interviewers underwent training using a standardized protocol.
