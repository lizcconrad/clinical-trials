  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase I study of apalutamide in combination with abiraterone acetate,
      docetaxel and prednisone in patients with metastatic mastrate resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC).

      This study is designed to determine the dose that apalutamide can be administered safely in
      combination with abiraterone acetate, docetaxel and prednisone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are enrolled in up to three 3-6-subject cohorts and are administered combination
      (apalutamide, abiraterone acetate and docetaxel plus prednisone) according to a
      dose-escalation schedule. The first dose of docetaxel infusion begins on Day 1 Cycle 1. Daily
      oral apalutamide, abiraterone acetate plus twice-daily oral prednisone begins on Day 1 Cycle
      1. Docetaxel 1-hour infusions are administered intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W), preceded by
      oral dexamethasone. While a subject is receiving chemotherapy, a treatment cycle is defined
      as 21 days. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) determination is based on toxicities observed within
      the initial 2 cycles defined as 6 weeks. DLT will be assessed before the start of the third
      docetaxel infusion. Once a combination dose is determined to be safe (i.e. no more than 2 of
      6 subjects experience DLT), the next cohort will enroll. Subjects remain at their allocated
      combination dose until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

      The primary objective is to determine a safe dose combination of apalutamide plus abiraterone
      acetate, docetaxel, prednisone in subjects with mCRPC.
