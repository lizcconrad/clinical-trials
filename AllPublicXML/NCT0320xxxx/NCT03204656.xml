  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficult orotracheal intubation carries a risk of hemodynamic collapse, neurological
      sequelae secondary to cerebral anoxia or death. Anesthetic scores and predictive indices are
      used to predict difficulties and avoid complications for usual tracheal intubation. However,
      existing indices are not adapted to selective bronchial intubations.

      The aim of the study is to determine the incidence of unexpected difficult SBI using
      conventional screening tests. It is a prospective descriptive epidemiological monocentric
      study comparing two groups of patients (selective vs. non selective intubations).
