  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the use of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) in human
      nasopharyngeal mucosa for the differentiation of the nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to depict the applicability of pCLE examinations for diagnosing NPC
      in comparison to the gold standard of histopathological examination, as well as developed an
      easy-to-use and straightforward scoring system for the identification of NPC on the basis of
      morphological and architectural criteria in order to enable a valid and reproducible CLE
      assessment even for non-experts in their daily clinical practice.

    <description>The nasopharyngeal lesions were first identified endoscopically by nasal endoscope. Then, an initial dose of 0.5 mL prior to the examination with a maximum dose of 2.5 mL of 10% fluorescein (IV; Akorn Inc, Lake Forest, Illinois, USA) during the measurement procedure was defined according to the experiences of workgroup in the gastrointestinal tract.</description>
