  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates safety and efficacy of surgical treatment of patients with anterior
      urethral stricture using a tissue-engineered construct based on autologous buccal mucosa
      cells and matrix from reconstituted collagen and reinforcing polylactoglycolide fibers. This
      is a single arm study with no control. Success will be assessed via objective and subjective
      methods; complications will be tallied in a standardized fashion. Outcomes will be measured
      at five years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of urethral strictures longer than 2 cm is an actual clinical challenge. In this
      case, the common method is replacement surgery using a buccal mucosa graft. However, the main
      disadvantage of this method is associated with limited donor resources and donor site
      morbidity.

      The aim of this study is to assess safety and efficacy of surgical treatment of patients with
      anterior urethral stricture using a tissue-engineered construct. The construct consists of
      autologous buccal mucosa cells and matrix from reconstituted collagen and reinforcing
      polylactoglycolide fibers. Patients will be followed up for 5 years within this study. The
      follow-up regimen includes retrograde and pericatheter urethrography, voiding
      cystourethrography, uroflowmetry, biopsy, and quality of life monitoring. Telephone follow-up
      will take place in between these assessments.

      The data obtained from this study will have practical implications for the urethral stricture
      treatment and will be based on the principles of evidence-based medicine.
