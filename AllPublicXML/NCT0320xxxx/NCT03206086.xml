      Background:

      Fanconi anemia is a genetic disease. Some people with it have reduced blood cell counts. This
      means their bone marrow no longer works properly. These people may need blood transfusions
      for anemia (low red blood cells) or low platelet counts or bleeding. Researchers want to see
      if a new drug will help people with this disease.

      Objective:

      To find out if a new drug, eltrombopag, is effective in people with Fanconi anemia. To know
      how long the drug needs to be given to improve blood counts.

      Eligibility:

      People at least 4 years old with Fanconi anemia with reduced blood cell counts.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with blood and urine tests. They will repeat this before
      starting to take the study drug.

      Participants will take eltrombopag pills by mouth once a day for 24 weeks. They will be
      monitored closely for side effects.

      Participants will have blood tests every 2 weeks while on eltrombopag.

      Participants will visit NIH 3 months and 6 months after starting eltrombopag. At these
      visits, participants will:

      Answer questions about their medical history, how they are feeling, and their quality of life

      Have a physical exam

      Have blood and urine tests

      Have a bone marrow sample taken by needle from the hip. The area will be numbed.

      If participants blood cell counts improve, they might join the extended access part of the
      study. They will continue taking eltrombopag for 3 years and sign a different consent.

      After 24 weeks of treatment, if there is no improvement in blood cell counts, participants
      will stop taking eltrombopag. They will return for an optional follow-up visit that repeats
      the study visits.

    <textblock>
      Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disease that often presents as a bone marrow failure
      (BMF) syndrome but also can affect any other organ. Etiologically, loss of function mutations
      in more than 21 different gene members of the FA core complex (i.e. FANCA-FANCV) have been
      associated with FA. The FA core complex is involved in interstrand cross-link DNA damage
      repair during cell division. Impaired DNA repair causes genomic instability which
      consequently can cause apoptosis of the cell or malignant transformation. In addition to
      impaired DNA repair mechanisms, FA cells exhibit increased sensitivity to pro-inflammatory
      cytokines (e.g. IFN- &gt;=, TNF- ) and elevated levels of these cytokines have been associated
      with bone marrow failure in subjects with FA and other inherited bone marrow failure
      syndromes.

      Patients with FA may present with congenital anomalies, such as microcephaly or short
      stature. However, the failure of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment to produce
      sufficient numbers of peripheral blood cells, and progression to myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia are the greatest risk factors for morbidity and
      mortality, particular in young patients with FA In a few reported cases, spontaneous somatic
      reversion of inherited mutations has resulted in a selective growth advantage of corrected
      HSCs that subsequently restored hematopoiesis. However, therapeutic options are limited in
      FA. Although HSC transplantation outcomes have significantly improved over the past two
      decades, donor availability, graft failure, and FA-specific transplant toxicities are still
      significant hurdles towards a curative treatment of FA-associated BMF. Moreover, attempts at
      genetic correction of FA are not yet ready for patient care.

      The thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetic eltrombopag (EPAG) has recently been shown to be effective
      in restoring tri-lineage hematopoiesis in patients with treatment refractory acquired severe
      aplastic anemia (SAA). Of particular interest for patients with FA is the observation that
      EPAG also improves the repair of double strand DNA breaks, a mechanism that is impaired in
      patients with FA. Additionally, our pre-clinical studies indicate that EPAG evades INF- &gt;=
      blockade of signal transduction from the TPO receptor (c-MPL) resulting in improved survival
      and proliferation of HSCs. Based on these clinical and pre-clinical studies, we hypothesize
      that EPAG will improve peripheral blood cell counts in patients with FA and thus positively
      affect morbidity and mortality.

      This phase II clinical trial proposes to treat patients with FA for 6 months with EPAG to
      assess safety and efficacy at improving hematological manifestations of FA. Responders at 6
      months will be able to continue EPAG on the extension part of this protocol for an additional
      3 years. During this time frame we anticipate further improvement of peripheral blood cells
      counts that will eventually result in the discontinuation of EPAG after a tapering period.
      Translational studies will explore EPAG effects on DNA repair activity, apoptosis, global
      transcriptome and TPO signaling pathways in patient s hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
      (HSPCs).

             contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had over 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile age appropriate (e.g. generally 40-59 years), history of
                  vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flushes) in the absence of other medical
                  justification or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In
                  the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman
                  has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of
                  child bearing potential.

        Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the study
        treatment and for 30 days after stopping study treatment and should not father a child in
        this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men as well as during
        intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

          -  History of thromboembolic events.

          -  Unable to take oral medication

          -  History or current diagnosis of cardiac disease indicating significant risk of safety

             disease, including any of the following:

               -  Recent myocardial infarction (within last 6 months),

               -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure,

               -  Unstable angina (within last 6 months),

               -  Clinically significant (symptomatic) cardiac arrhythmias (e.g., sustained
                  ventricular tachycardia, and clinically significant second or third degree AV
                  block without a pacemaker.)

               -  Long QT syndrome, family history of idiopathic sudden death, congenital long QT
                  syndrome or additional risk factors for cardiac repolarization abnormality, as
