  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics equivalence and safety by
      comparing pharmacokinetics characteristics between the SYP-1512 Tab and Revlimid cap (25mg)
      when administered a single-dose to healthy male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers are administrated single-dose over the period I and II (crossover) of
      SYP-1512 Tab and Revlimid cap (25mg) as of lenalidomide 25mg.

      Every time before and after each medication, pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and safety of
      SYP-1512 Tab and Revlimid cap (25mg) is performed using a blood sample and conducting some
      tests (vital signs, physical exam, ECG, laboratory test, etc.) respectively
