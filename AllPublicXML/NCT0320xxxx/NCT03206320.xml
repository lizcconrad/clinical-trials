  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin infiltration with local anesthetic is commonly used to decrease patient discomfort
      during peripheral nerve blocks. Topically applied local anesthetic gel might provide
      analgesia while eliminating the need for additional injections. The primary objective of this
      study was a noninferiority comparison between the analgesia achieved with topical gel with
      that of skin infiltration for pain upon needle insertion and injection during administration
      of the interscalene brachial (ISBP) and axillary (AX) plexus blocks.
