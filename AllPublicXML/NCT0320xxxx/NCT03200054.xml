  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      South Africa is implementing the policy of universal initiation of lifelong antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) in all HIV-infected pregnant women regardless of CD4 cell count or disease
      stage (&quot;Option B+&quot;). There is a recognised need for innovative models of service delivery to
      support adherence and retention in care in this group, particularly during the postpartum
      period. The investigators are conducting a pragmatic randomised control trial to compare
      virological outcomes 24 months postpartum in two models of service delivery for provision of
      HIV care and treatment services postpartum in women who initiated ART during pregnancy: local
      adult ART clinics and community-based adherence clubs.

      South Africa is implementing the policy of universal initiation of lifelong ART in all
      HIV-infected pregnant women regardless of CD4 cell count or disease stage (&quot;Option B+&quot;) and
      given the high antenatal HIV seroprevalence, HIV-infected pregnant women represent the
      largest group of patients initiating ART in primary care facilities. However, there are few
      well developed models of service delivery to support implementation. There are particular
      concerns regarding the postpartum period, with multiple studies indicating high levels of
      non-retention in care and/or inadequate adherence to treatment postnatally. Adherence Clubs
      (ACs) are an innovative but untested model of care based on chronic disease management
      strategies that emphasize social support, adherence to treatment and retention in care,
      rather than intensive clinical management, as the most important determinant of long-term
      health outcomes in stable patients in chronic care. ACs have preliminarily been shown to to
      result in virologic outcomes that are similar to routine clinic services in patients stable
      on ART. The investigators are conducting a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial to evaluate
      two different strategies for delivering HIV care and treatment services during the postpartum
      period to HIV-infected women who initiated ART during pregnancy. Participants will be
      allocated to receive ART care at either local adult ART clinics, following the current
      standard of care, or the community-based adherence club system.

    <description>Women will be referred to the ACs at their postpartum ART clinic visit at the midwife obstetric unit (MOU) at the Gugulethu community health centre (CHC). AC visits occur 2-4 monthly at a community hall near the CHC. At routine visits, which last ~1 hour, community health workers provide health education, weigh participants, ask about symptoms, and dispense pre-packed ART. Symptomatic participants are referred back to the main ART facility at the CHC for assessment by a nurse. A nurse performs routine phlebotomy at an annual club visit, and does a clinical assessment and reviews blood results at the subsequent visit. Participants requiring more regular follow-up and those with raised viral loads are referred back to the ART clinic at the CHC by the nurse.</description>
