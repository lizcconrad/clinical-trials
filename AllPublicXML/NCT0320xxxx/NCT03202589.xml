      Hip fracture is the second indication of surgical management elderly patients. It remains
      linked with a one-year mortality of 20%-25% according to diiferent governmental agencies, and
      the incidence reaches 30% for those over 80 years old.

      The factors recognized and found to be most correlated with the survival / mortality ratio of
      patients are age, sex, intervention time, and prior health status.

      The aim of a preoperative clinical evaluation is to estimate the benefit-risk balance of
      different clinical and technical managements and to prepare the postoperative patient
      outcome. During the last decade, management of hip fracture has improved mainly due to the
      different recommendations for a multidisciplinary management of perioperative procedures.
      However, none of them have yet highlighted FOCUS echocardiography as a &quot;routine&quot; examination
      of the preoperative evaluation as in most noncardiac surgeries.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the preoperative management of these patients:
      Clinical and biological evaluation, and to analyze the place that would have the FOCUS
      preoperative echocardiography in the choice of the anesthesia technique resulting from the
      patient evaluation.That study in a pre-requisite study to evaluate the incidence of FOCUS
      echocardiography realized by anesthesiologists in the preoperative period in order to define
      patient's outcome and anesthetic management.

      The question is whether the pre-operative routine preoperative echographic evaluation would
      allow the correction or optimization of any comorbiditie, and / or lead to the modification
      of the anesthetic management of the patients. Feasibility studies have recently focused on
      the issue of ultrasound targeted at the patient's bedside. Thus, echocardiography data may
      have implications for anesthetic but also surgical management.

      With the advent of ultraportable ultrasound machines, the limit to routine preoperative
      bedside use of the ultrasound tool appears to be resolved. The use of point-of-care
      ultrasounds has proven useful in the management of critical patients in emergency and
      intensive care units and is recommended in many countries.

      Tthe investigators first want to assess the preoperative assessment of elderly and fragile
      patients admitted urgently for hip surgery. The investigators are setting up a multicenter
      observational questionnaire for consecutive patients. An electronic questionnaire is
      distributed via SurveyMonkey to various university hospitals, general hospitals and private
      institutions in France. The objective of this study is to evaluate the preoperative
      management of these patients: Clinical, biological evaluation, and analyze the current daily
      practice regarding the place of POC ultrasound preoperatively; the second question is to know
      if the choice of the anesthesia technique results from the patient's assessment.

      The investigators hope to have a reliable survey of current practices on a group of 500
      consecutive patients and then to determine with greater accuracy the first expected real
      hypothesis for a future prospective randomized multicenter study evaluating the use and
      impact of preoperative ultrasound assessment versus a control group for perioperative
      management, complications and outcome of patients undergoing hip fracture.
