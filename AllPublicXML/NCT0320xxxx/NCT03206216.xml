      This clinical trial studies how well Diode laser fiber type selective stimulator works in
      predicting pain development in patients with ovarian cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.
      Stimulating of the pain nerve fibers in your skin with an investigational device using laser
      light stimulation may help to predict whether a patient will develop painful peripheral
      neuropathy, correlate with the severity of neuropathy during and after chemotherapy
      treatment, and may help to explain the mechanisms of chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Demonstrate that the Adelta:C pain threshold ratio is significantly higher in patients
      with painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) than in patients with painless
      CIPN.

      II. Determine the Adelta:C ratio over time in patients with CIPN.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo Diode laser fiber type selective stimulator (DLss) test over 30 minutes at 9
      and 21 weeks after the first day of standard of care chemotherapy.

    <description>Will study the correlation between the &quot;Adelta:C pain threshold ratio&quot; and the development of pain. Will generate a Spearman correlation coefficient for the &quot;Adelta:C pain threshold ratio&quot; obtained at the first testing session and the presence or absence of pain at the time of the second test. Will conduct logistic regression analysis of the binary pain value (pain or no pain) at the time of the second testing (independent variable) on the &quot;Adelta:C pain threshold ratio&quot; at the time of the first testing (dependent variable).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the Adelta:C pain threshold ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 21 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess the difference in the Adelta:C pain threshold ratio for patients with a painless response to chemotherapy versus painful neuropathy, as measured using the Diode laser fiber type selective stimulator. The &quot;Adelta:C pain threshold ratio&quot; is calculated using the Adelta-fiber and C-fiber pain thresholds. Will calculate the average value of this parameter for each group (A and B) on a logarithmic scale.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have pathologically proven ovarian cancer that requires first-line treatment with a
             taxane + platinum based chemotherapy regimen

          -  GROUP A (painful neuropathy group): Must have subjective symptoms of painful
             peripheral neuropathy (burning, stabbing, throbbing, painful tingling, aching in the
             fingers and/or toes)

          -  GROUP B (no pain group): Must either have subjective symptoms of painless neuropathy
             (loss of sensation, worsening balance, strange sensation in fingers and/or toes) or no
             complaints related to neuropathy

          -  Have a life expectancy of 6 months

          -  Ability to understand the study protocol, participate in testing, and the willingness
             to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received systemic chemotherapy for ovarian cancer other than first-line treatment
             with a taxane + platinum based chemotherapy regimen

          -  Has received investigational drugs suspected to cause peripheral neuropathy; no
             concurrent investigational drugs may be used

          -  Has a history of:

               -  Neuropathy or numbness/tingling suspicious for neuropathy prior to the first dose
                  of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer

               -  History of prior treatment for other cancers that includes drugs known to cause
                  neuropathy; these drugs include but are not limited to vinca-alkaloids,
                  platinums, taxanes, bortezomib.

               -  B12 deficiency

               -  Known peripheral vascular disease

               -  Chronic daily headache or headache more than 14 days of the month

          -  Has pain rated 50 or higher on a scale of 0-100, with 0 = no pain at all and 100 =
             worst pain imaginable before the first DLss test

          -  Known pregnant or nursing patients

          -  Cancer survivors who have previous exposure to medications or chemotherapy that cause
             neuropathy are excluded from this study

          -  Patients who are known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive will be
             excluded as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and HIV itself are known to
             cause peripheral neuropathy

          -  Patients who do not speak or read English are excluded from this study
