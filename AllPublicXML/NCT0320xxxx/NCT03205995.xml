    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the platelet count change from baseline and safety
      of OMS721 in adults and adolescents with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The study
      will also evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and anti-drug antibody
      response (ADA).

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter study of OMS721 in adults and adolescents with atypical
      hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). The uncontrolled, open-label study will evaluate the effect
      of OMS721 in subjects with plasma therapy-resistant aHUS and plasma therapy-responsive aHUS.
      This study has four periods: Screening, Treatment Induction, Treatment Maintenance, and
      Follow-up. Approximate enrollment is 80 subjects. An interim analysis will be performed after
      40 subjects have completed 26 weeks of treatment for potential registration.

          -  Have malignant hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [BP] greater than 120 mm Hg with
             bilateral hemorrhages or &quot;cotton-wool&quot; exudates on funduscopic examination).

          -  Have a poor prognosis with a life expectancy of less than three months in the opinion
