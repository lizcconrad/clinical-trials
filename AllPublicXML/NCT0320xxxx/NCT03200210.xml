  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with
      hyperuricemia and randomly divide them into two groups, treated with Febuxostat and placebo
      respectively. After 3 years of following up, cardiovascular events, all cause mortality,
      cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events are collected and recorded. The
      difference of cardiovascular events, all cause mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular event
      rate will be analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate enrolling 548 CAPD patients who have hyperuricemia in 21 centers
      and randomly allocate them into Febuxostat treatment group and placebo group. This study is
      double-blinded and will be followed up for 3 years. The primary endpoint is cardiovascular
      events, secondary endpoints are all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and non-fatal
      cardiovascular events separately. All the endpoints will be collected, as well as other
      outcomes, such as blood pressure and dialysis dose and so on. The outcomes will be analyzed
      using statistics software.
