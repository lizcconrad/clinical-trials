    <measure>Trans epidermal water loss</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The trans epidermal water loss is measured on the peristomal skin using a probe. The trans epidermal water loss is a measure for the skins barrier function. There is always a loss of water from the skin due to natural evaporation. However, when the skin barrier is damaged the evaporation of water increases leading to a higher trans epidermal water loss. Thus, trans epidermal water loss is used to assess the damage to the skin.</description>

    <description>On the peristomal area four different patches are applied to the skin. There is a bag welded on each patch. The bag contains real output.
The difference between the four patches is that they consist of different adhesives.
One patch is made of a standard hydrocolloid adhesive
The primary endpoint is maesured after 8 hours and 24 hours And the three other patches consist of the newly developed adhesives. P-4 P-15 P-16</description>
