  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of people suffering from gambling disorder is relatively high, and the impact
      on this disorder the individual and those around him is considerable. The etiopathogenic
      model of gambling disorder is multifactorial, involving various risk and vulnerability
      factors, involved in the initiation and maintenance of the disorder. Among these factors,
      neurocognitive alterations associated with the disorder has recently aroused interest among
      researchers. In this study, the investigators propose to explore the neurocognitive
      impairments of patients suffering from gambling disorder compared to a control group, in
      order to identify alterations that could be the target of cognitive remediation programs.
      Gambling disorder provides a unique opportunity to study the specific neurocognitive
      impairments of the addictive process because it is not biased by the neurotoxic effect of
      substances as it is the case in substance use disorders.
