    <textblock>
      The broad goal of the Exercise During Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer (ERASE) trial
      is to examine the effects of exercise in prostate cancer patients undergoing active
      surveillance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ERASE Trial will be a phase II randomized controlled trial. A total of 66 men with low-
      or intermediate-grade clinically localized prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance
      will be randomized to either a 12-week of supervised high-intensity aerobic interval training
      or usual care. The primary outcome will be peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) as a measure of
      physical fitness. The secondary outcomes include tumour-related biomarkers, fear of cancer
      progression, quality of life, and psychological distress. Exploratory outcomes will include
      indicators of cancer progression including prostate-specific antigen. Based on this sample
      size, our study has 80% power with a two-tailed alpha &lt;0.05 to detect a clinically meaningful
      effect of 3.5 ml/kg/min on our primary outcome of VO2max. This power will also be sufficient
      for detecting differences in our secondary biomarkers and patient-reported outcomes if the
      effects are at least moderate (i.e., a standardized effect size of d=0.60).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Peak Oxygen Consumption (VO2peak)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12-week (postintervention)</time_frame>
    <description>VO2peak is a measure of cardiopulmonary fitness and a powerful surrogate outcome for cancer-specific and overall survival. VO2peak will be defined as the highest oxygen-uptake value recorded during the test and quantified where participants reach a plateau in oxygen consumption, which will be expressed as relative to body mass (i.e., ml O2·kg-1·min-1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes of Natural Killer Cell Cytotoxic Activity (NKCA) and Counts</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and 12-week (postintervention)</time_frame>
    <description>NKCA significantly contributes to the regulation of tumour suppression in response to exercise and it has been demonstrated to have a diagnostic value in patients with cancer. NK cell activities are assessed using blood analysis as the total number of circulating NK cells and their cytotoxic activity. NK cell counts and NKCA will be measured using the phenotypic markers of NK cells (CD3-CD16+CD56+). NKCA will be expressed as the percentage of target cells killed by a sample of 100,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells at the effector-to-target ratios of 5:1, 20:1, 40:1, and 100:1.</description>
