  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Concept: Alcohol misuse is common among Veterans with PTSD. It has been proposed that this
      high comorbidity is the result of &quot;self-medication,&quot; with alcohol being used to alleviate
      common PTSD symptoms (e.g., hyperarousal, sleep problems). Given this high prevalence and
      functional relationship, researchers at the BSD of the NCPTSD developed the VetChange
      self-management website to concurrently address these conditions. In a large scale RCT,
      VetChange has shown efficacy to reduce both alcohol misuse and PTSD symptoms. Unfortunately,
      the recently launched publicly available VetChange website (Vetchange.org) has been plagued
      by a high rate of visitors not completing the mandatory registration process, which is
      required for repeated use. Based on the promising findings of the VetChange research, the D&amp;T
      Division partnered with the BSD Division to develop the VetChange mobile app, which is set to
      be released to the public very soon. However, unlike the VetChange website, the app has not
      yet been evaluated and has the advantage of allowing users to easily obtain it without having
      to register and repeatedly log on through an Internet connection.

      This research partnership between the D&amp;T and BSD Divisions will extend and enhance an
      ongoing successful cross-center collaboration in a high priority topic for the larger Center.
      The purpose of this proposal is to conduct a pilot evaluation of the VetChange mobile app in
      order to test its feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy to reduce alcohol
      consumption, PTSD severity, and improve psychosocial functioning among Veterans with PTSD who
      exhibit signs of problem drinking. In this study, 280 Veterans with problem drinking and
      clinically significant PTSD symptoms will be recruited using social media and randomized in
      equal numbers to receive one of four conditions: 1) Assessment only, 2) VetChange mobile app
      only, 3) AFT plus the VetChange mobile app supplemented with a package of supportive
      accountability tools (VetChange+). In addition to receiving the mobile app, VetChange+
      participants will receive SMS reminders to log drinking behavior using the mobile app. The
      investigators will track objective use of the VetChange mobile app to assess feasibility, and
      this usage data will also be used in real-time to tailor the content of text messages
      provided to participants in the VetChange+ condition. Participants will complete measures of
      alcohol use, functional well-being, and PTSD symptoms at baseline and again after 8 weeks
      (posttreatment). At post-treatment, participants in the VetChange app arms of the study will
      also be asked to report their level of satisfaction with the app and to complete a brief
      qualitative evaluation of their experience using the VetChange mobile app.

      Results of this pilot study will be used to characterize the feasibility, acceptability, and
      potential efficacy of a mobile app-based self-management intervention to reduce problem
      drinking behavior in Veterans with PTSD, will inform optimization of the intervention, and
      will serve as the foundation for subsequent proposals for extramural funding.
