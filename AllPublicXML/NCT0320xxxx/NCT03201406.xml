  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During 1993 and 2006, a total of 987 patients older than 20 years underwent native kidney
      biopsy at the Renal Division of this hospital. 404 patients with membranoproliferative
      glomerulonephritis and mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, and patients with secondary
      glomerulonephritis or other renal pathologies, such as diabetic nephropathy, lupus nephritis,
      rapid progress glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, and tubulointerstitial nephritis
      will be analyzed. The demographic characteristics and laboratory data of these patients at
      presentation or before renal biopsy will be recorded. These data included parameters such as
      age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, immunosuppressants treatment, BUN, serum creatinine,
      albumin, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and urine protein. All subjects will
      be followed until 2015 for occurrence of primary endpoints, including all-cause death or ESRD
      requiring long-term dialysis or renal transplantation. A total of 433 patients who had been
      followed for 3 years during 2003 and 2007 will receive regular clinic follow-up. GFR will be
      estimated according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) abbreviated formula:
      186 x Scr -1.154 x age -0.203 x 0.742 (if female). CKD stage will be determined as described
      by the National Kidney Foundation of the United States. At the time of entry, GFRs of 30-59,
      29-15 and &lt; 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 for more than 3 months will be classified as CKD stages 3, 4
      and 5, respectively. Baseline Data of the 433 patients are used as recorded at the beginning
      during 2003 and 2007. The observation period of each patient is defined to start immediately
      after the registered measurement of serum creatinine satisfying the above criteria
      (designated as the index date) and lasted until ESRD or end of 2015. ESRD is defined as
      initiation of RRT, i.e. chronic dialysis or renal transplantation.
