  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Addiction to drugs and alcohol is increasingly becoming a worldwide trend that is
           prevalent in both rich and poor countries . Substance abuse shows a significant warming
           to the health, social and economic build of families, communities and nations. Extent of
           worldwide psychoactive substance use is estimated at 2 billion alcohol users and 185
           million drug users .

        -  Substance abuse (including alcohol and drugs) is an important risk factor for poor
           health globally due to their intoxicating effects or their toxic effects on organs and
           tissues that lead to the development of diseases, injuries and other health conditions

        -  Drug abuse is associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. A study on
           the need for hospitalization in approximately 4800 drug users found that 223 of these
           were admitted to hospital due to cardiovascular diseases .

        -  The majority of abused substances or their metabolites are excreted through the kidneys
           and renal complications of drug abuse are very common .The involvement of the kidney due
           to drug abuse is either attributed to their elimination through the kidney, or a direct
           nephrotoxic effect. The damage may be acute and reversible, or chronic and can leads to
           end stage renal failure .

        -  Addiction is responsible for different types of liver diseases including fatty liver,
           hepatitis and liver failure. . Intravenous drug addiction by sharing of contaminated
           needle is very important risk factor for the development of liver diseases, particularly
           hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Globally, 90% of new hepatitis C infections are attributed
           to drug injection . In the long run, substance abuse has negative effects on sexual
           functions and leads to the onset of sexual disorders. .

        -  Long term use of alcohol was reported to inhibit of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
           and reduces the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary . Morphine administration
           suppresses LH release and reduces the levels of testosterone, which affects testicular
           function.
