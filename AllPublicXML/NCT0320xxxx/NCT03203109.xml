    <textblock>
      Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients investigated in a neurorehabilitation ward
      after a first hemispheric stroke. Postural and gait disorders in relation to referential of
      verticality have been analyzed in routine care.

    <textblock>
      300 consecutive patients, admitted in our department for neurorehabilitation after a first
      hemispherical stroke, have been enrolled retrospectively. During their hospitalisation, all
      patients have been routinely evaluated with clinical scales, evaluating motor and cognitive
      deficits. Postural and visual vertical (VV) assessments have been performed 1 to 4 times
      during in-patient-stay.

      The objective was to analyse the determinants of balance recovery after stroke, in particular
      the impact of wrong referential of verticality.

      Data collection was performed by means of medical records. Observation period covered from
      january 2012 to february 2018.
