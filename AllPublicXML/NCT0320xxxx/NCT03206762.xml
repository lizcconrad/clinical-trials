      A prospective, multicenter, randomized study evaluating the use of Jetstream Atherectomy (JS)
      followed by DCB in comparison to the use of plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) followed by
      DCB alone in the treatment of complex lesions in femoropopliteal arteries in subjects with
      claudication (Rutherford Clinical Category (RCC) of 2-4) (complex lesions are defined as long
      (≥ 10 cm) lesions, or moderately or highly calcified lesions, or chronic total occlusions
      irrespective of length).

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria:

        Subject must meet all of the following angiographic inclusion criteria. Unless otherwise
        specified, the Investigator performing the procedure bases all angiographic inclusion
        criteria on visual determination at the time of the procedure.

          1. Has evidence at the target lesion of ≥ 70% de novo stenosis of a. ≥ 10 cm length, or
             b. any chronic total occlusion (&gt; 1 month by history or known by conventional or CT
             angiography or arterial duplex ultrasound) in the SFA (at least 1 cm from the
             bifurcation of the profunda) and/or popliteal artery, or 3. at least grade 2 or higher
             calcification as defined by the peripheral arterial calcium scoring system (PACCS)26

          2. Has evidence of at least one runoff vessel to the ankle/foot of the limb to be treated
             that does not have significant (&lt; 70%) stenosis during the index procedure.

          3. Has a reference vessel diameter of 4 - 7 mm.

          4. Has a target lesion an exchangeable guidewire can cross via the true lumen (without
             using a re-entry device or a subintimal approach).

        General Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject must not meet any of the following general exclusion criteria.

          1. Has one or more of the contraindications listed in the JetStream or Ranger IFUs.

          2. Has a contraindication or known untreated allergy to antiplatelet therapy,
             anticoagulants, thrombolytic drugs or any other drug anticipated to be used (that
             cannot be reasonably substituted).

          3. Is expected to require cilostazol (Pletal) during the one-year follow-up period.

          4. Has a hypersensitivity to contrast material that cannot be adequately pretreated.

          5. Patient has already been enrolled in the study or any other study that by the
             investigator judgment may interfere with the outcome of this trial

          6. Has two or more lesions that require treatment in the target vessel. Lesions have to
