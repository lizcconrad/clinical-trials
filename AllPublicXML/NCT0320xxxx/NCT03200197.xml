  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of menthol chewing gum compared
      to maintained fasting (usual care) in reducing the intensity of the surgical patient's thirst
      during the preoperative period. The hypothesis of the study was that the use of menthol
      chewing gum in surgical patients in the preoperative period would be more effective than the
      maintenance of fasting with regard to the decrease in thirst and its discomforts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that chewing gum is effective in relieving thirst in the surgical patient
      in the preoperative period as it stimulates the salivary glands by means of mechano and
      chemoreceptors, increasing the salivary pH and flow, lubricating the oral cavity, acting in
      this way on peripheral thirst, which is triggered by dehydration of the oral mucosa.
      Furthermore, menthol gum stimulates the cold receptors, known as TRPM8, which are responsible
      for deactivating centers of thirst. Thus, the risk of bronchoaspiration due to gastric
      fullness is avoided and the discomfort of a dry mouth is reduced.Preliminary evidence
      indicates that the chewing gum strategy assists in the relief of a dry mouth and thirst in
      patients undergoing dialysis and head and neck radiotherapy. However, there is no scientific
      evidence of controlled studies with results that can be generalized regarding the use of
      chewing gum to reduce thirst and its discomforts in surgical patients in the preoperative
      period when they remain in a fasted state.

    <description>Alteration in the evaluation of the final intensity of thirst in relation to the evaluation of the initial intensity of thirst [10 minutes]. For evaluation of the intensity of thirst, a Verbal Numeral Scale (VNS) was used, with a range from 0 (no thirst) to 10 (very intense thirst), as reported by the patients when questioned.</description>

    <description>Alteration in the evaluation of the final discomfort of thirst in relation to the evaluation of the initial discomfort of thirst [10 minutes]. The Perioperative Thirst Discomfort Scale (PTDS) was used to evaluate the discomfort of the thirst.This scale is composed of 7 attributes that evaluate the signs of discomfort of perioperative thirst, as follows: dry mouth, dry lips, thick tongue, thick saliva, bad taste in the mouth, and desire to drink water. Each attribute varies between 0 (no inconvenience), 1 (a little inconvenient), and 2 (very inconvenient). The final sum of the PTDS can range from 0 to 14 points.</description>

    <description>Allocation concealment was performed through the use of individual opaque envelopes numbered externally in sequence, containing the randomly defined group information.This step was performed by a researcher who did not participate in the data collection. The intensity of the initial thirst was measured by means of the Verbal Numerical Scale (VNS), which ranged from 0 (no thirst) to 10 (very intense thirst) and the discomfort of the initial thirst was measured through the Perioperative Thirst Discomfort Scale (PTDS), which is composed of 7 attributes and ranges from 0 to 14. After using the intervention (menthol chewing gum) for 10 minutes, chewing at a natural rhythm and swallowing the saliva produced, the intensity and final discomfort were measured using the same scales.</description>

    <description>The experimental group received one unit of mentholated chewing gum, chewing and swallowing the saliva in a natural rhythm for 10 minutes. The menthol chewing gum used is called TRÍDENT®and is composed as follows: base gum, hydrogenated vegetable oil, vegetable oil, sweeteners: sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, maltitol, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose, humectants: glycerin and triacetin, flavorings (contains wheat derivatives), anti-humectant talc, emulsifiers: esters of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids with acetic acid, soy lectin and mono and diglycerides of fatty acids and colorings: tartrazine and brilliant blue FCF, presenting a weight of 1.8g per unit.</description>
