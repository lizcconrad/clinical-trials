      This trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm Objective Performance Criteria
      controlled confirmatory study. It is for evaluating safety and effectiveness of the WEB
      Aneurysm Embolization System when treating wide neck bifurcation aneurysms (WNBN).The study's
      primary endpoints include a primary effectiveness endpoint and a primary safety endpoint. The
      study device must meet both endpoints. The primary effectiveness endpoint is adjudicated by
      an independent third party core lab.

    <description>The WEB is an intra-aneurysmal device intended for use in endovascular embolization of intracranial aneurysms. The intended therapeutic effect of the WEB device is to line the neck of the aneurysm with a metallic structure that disrupts the inflow of blood, causing hemostasis within the aneurysm sac, and leading to thrombus formation within the implant. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility after giving informed consent.</description>
