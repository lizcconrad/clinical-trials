  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2894512 (trans-isomer) is a fully synthetic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. This
      study is being conducted to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of GSK2894512 cream, 1
      percent administered topically to healthy adult subjects. PK parameters obtained in this
      study will be used to support the design of future maximum use PK (MUPK) studies in subjects
      with atopic dermatitis (AD) and plaque psoriasis or psoriasis (PSO). This is a phase 1,
      randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 3-period, sequential, inpatient study consists
      of a Screening visit, 3 treatment periods and a follow-up visit. GSK2894512 cream, 1 percent
      (or matching vehicle) will be administered sequentially in the treatment periods. Period 1
      will include once daily repeated topical applications on approximately 5000 centimeter (cm)
      ^2 intact non-occluded skin area for 21 days. Period 2 will include once daily repeated
      topical applications on approximately 5000 cm^2 intact occluded skin area for 21 days. Period
      3 will include a single topical application on up to 400 cm^2 gently taped-stripped skin
      area. Each treatment regimen will be followed by washout period for approximately 21 days,
      except for Treatment Period 3. Approximately 26 healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in to
      the study. Total duration of participation in this study will be approximately 18 weeks.
