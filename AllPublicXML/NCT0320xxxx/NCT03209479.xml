    <measure>Changes in functional evaluation scores (Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments and higher score refers to people with higher levels of disability by multiple sclerosis.</description>

    <measure>Changes in functional evaluation scores (Functional Systems [FS])</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>FS is based on a standard neurological examination; the 7 functional systems plus &quot;other&quot; (Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Brainstem, Sensory, Bowel and bladder function, Visual function, Cerebral [or mental] functions, other) are rated. Each FS is scored on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 5 or 6 (more severe disability), and total score ranging from 0 to 40. Higher score in each functional system refers to people with higher levels of disability by multiple sclerosis.</description>
