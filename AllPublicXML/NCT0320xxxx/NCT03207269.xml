  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 3 million Canadians have type 2 diabetes, a condition where the blood sugar
      levels are too high, uncontrolled blood sugars lead to cardiovascular disease and other
      complications. Patients with type 2 diabetes are often advised to consume a snack before bed
      in order to help control morning blood sugar levels. However, scientific evidence for this
      dietary approach is limited and there is no data to help elucidate what the ideal bedtime
      snack is. We hypothesize that a high protein, high fat snack with very little carbohydrate,
      will be an effective bedtime snack for lowering morning glucose without spiking glucose
      levels in the night. In this study we will determine if a bedtime snack that is high in
      protein and fat but low in carbohydrate can help improve morning glucose control in people
      with type 2 diabetes. This information will provide scientific evidence for the potential
      health benefits of strategically-timed high protein, high fat snack consumption in people
      with type 2 diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Fifteen patients with physician diagnosed type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6.5-9%), between the ages of
      30-80 years, and not on exogenous insulin therapy, will complete three, 3-day intervention
      periods (proof-of-concept randomized trial). Participants will consume a standardized diet
      for three days with either i) two hard-boiled eggs, ii) fruit yogurt; or iii) control
      no-bedtime snack, thirty minutes prior to bedtime. Fasting blood samples will be obtained on
      Day 4 in the morning after following each 3-day dietary intervention. Blood glucose will be
      monitored continuously across the intervention period using continuous glucose monitoring
      (CGM). CGM allows for the moment-to-moment changes in blood glucose to be examined for
      several days, allowing the unique opportunity to examine the glucose responses at different
      points of the day, including fasting hyperglycemia in the morning, nocturnal glucose, and
      postprandial glucose in response to meals. To our knowledge, CGM technology has never been
      used in a bedtime snacking study in type 2 diabetes.
