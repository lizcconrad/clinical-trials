    <textblock>
      This research trial studies saliva, semen, and blood samples to determine effects of
      chemotherapy on fertility in osteosarcoma survivors. Study biospecimen samples from
      osteosarcoma survivors in the laboratory may help doctors learn whether chemotherapy causes
      fertility problems and to learn more about the long term effects.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether infertility and/or biomarkers of spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis
      differ in male osteosarcoma survivors treated with cisplatin with or without ifosfamide
      compared to male controls without a history of cancer.

      II. Evaluate whether cisplatin with or without ifosfamide for the treatment of osteosarcoma
      alters sperm deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the role of genetic susceptibility in the development of impairments in
      spermatogenesis or steroidogenesis with contemporary regimens for the treatment of
      osteosarcoma.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a health questionnaire over 30-45 minutes. Patients also provide saliva
      and semen samples and undergo collection of blood.

    <description>The American Society of Reproductive Medicine's definition of &quot;infertility&quot; as...&quot;the failure to achieve a successful pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected intercourse&quot; will be used to categorize patients as to a history of infertility. Based on interview questions regarding each subject's personal and partner's history of medical investigations and treatment for infertility, an attempt will be made to further distinguish each subject's history of infertility as being due to the male (study subject), the female or indeterminate.</description>
