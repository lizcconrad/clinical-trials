  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-operative treatment of pelvic fractures is possible. Immobilisation implies different
      adjustment processes. Patients with pelvic ring fractures and partial weight bearing have to
      obtain theses. The aim of this pilot study was to prove the additional effect of the
      anti-gravity treadmill in patients with non-operatively treated pelvic fractures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We prospectively included patients with non-operatively treated pelvic fractures as the
      intervention group (IG) and healthy volunteers of different age, sex and body mass index
      (BMI) as the reference group (RG).

      Patients of the IG participated in a training session every three days with an anti-gravity
      treadmill (Picture 1, alterGÂ®, www.alterg.com) for a total of 40 days in addition to
      physiotherapy, lymph drainage massage and manual therapy.

      Patients were evaluated on three successive dates: Baseline (S1), after mobilization without
      crutches with full weight-bearing (20 days, S2) and after 40 days (S3)
