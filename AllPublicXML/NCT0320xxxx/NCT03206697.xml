      The present study has the objective to study whether the mitochondrial DNA copy number values
      that can be generated when human embryos are analyzed for chromosomal content before embryo
      transfer correlates with the actual number of mitochondria as well as their energy
      requirements of the human embryo.

      The possibility of analyzing trophectoderm cells from human blastocyst during
      preimplantational genetic testing offers the opportunity of analyzing not only the
      chromosomal constitution of the trophoblastic cells, and by extension, to infer not with
      certain degree of uncertainty, the chromosomal content in the inner cell cells mass and the
      entire embryo; but analyzing other interesting aspects related to cellular physiology such us
      the mtDNA content.

      The number of mitochondrial copy number has a huge variation among oocytes from the same
      cohort and also from oocytes from different patients. It is believed that this initial number
      of mtDNA content is correlated with the ability of oocytes to fertilized and to achieve
      blastocyst stage. Whatever the initial concentration of mtDNA a given oocyte will have, it
      expected to equally segregate into the number of blastomeres along embryo development, so the
      mtDNA copy number of per daughter cell will transiently decrease, being the smallest at the
      blastocyst stage. Studies in different mammalian species including humans have shown that
      mtDNA replication does not occur before morula stage so the mitochondrial content of the
      oocytes should be enough to sustain embryo development before implantation occurs.

      The net amount of mitochondrial DNA will exponentially increase at blastocyst stage
      coinciding with an increases in oxygen consumption. Despite the mtDNA copy number is higher
      in ICM compared to TE cells the proportion of moderate and high activity mitochondria is
      higher in the TE cells. This also agrees with mitochondrial morphological changes in the
      trophectoderm cells where mitochondria are much more elongated, less matrix electrodense and
      have more cristae, in ICM the will be rounded and more electrodense.

      The objective of the present work is to analyze whether a correlation exist between the
      mitochondrial DNA copy number and both the actual number of mitochondria in the blastocyst
      and the metabolic needs of the human blastocysts and the ATP production.
