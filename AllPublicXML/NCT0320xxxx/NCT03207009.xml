  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multi-site, single-dose, Phase 3 study in approximately 15 subjects ≤50
      years of age with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT), who have a β0 mutation at both
      alleles of the β-globin (HBB) gene (i.e. β0/β0). The study will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using LentiGlobin BB305
      Drug Product.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects ≤50 years of age at the time of consent or assent (as applicable), and able
             to provide written consent (adults, or legal guardians, as applicable) or assent
             (adolescents or children). Provided that the DMC has approved enrolling subjects
             younger than 5 years of age, subjects younger than 5 years of age may be enrolled if
             they weigh a minimum of 6 kg and are reasonably anticipated to be able to provide at
             least the minimum number of cells required to initiate the manufacturing process.

          -  Diagnosis of TDT with a history of at least 100 mL/kg/year of packed red blood cells
             (pRBCs) in the 2 years preceding enrollment (all subjects), or be managed under
             standard thalassemia guidelines with ≥8 transfusions of pRBCs per year in the 2 years
             preceding enrollment (subjects ≥12 years).

          -  Clinically stable and eligible to undergo HSCT.

          -  Treated and followed for at least the past 2 years in a specialized center that
             maintained detailed medical records, including transfusion history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of a mutation characterized as other then β0 (e.g., β+, βE, βC) on at least
             one HBB allele.

          -  Positive for presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2),
             hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C (HCV).

          -  A white blood cell (WBC) count &lt;3×10^9/L, and/or platelet count &lt;100×10^9/L not
             related to hypersplenism.

          -  Uncorrected bleeding disorder.

          -  Any prior or current malignancy.

          -  Prior HSCT.

          -  Advanced liver disease.

          -  A cardiac T2* &lt;10 ms by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  Any other evidence of severe iron overload that, in the investigator's opinion,
             warrants exclusion.

          -  Participation in another clinical study with an investigational drug within 30 days of
             Screening.

          -  Any other condition that would render the subject ineligible for HSCT, as determined
             by the attending transplant physician or investigator.

          -  Prior receipt of gene therapy.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding in a postpartum female or absence of adequate contraception
             for fertile subjects.

          -  A known and available HLA-matched family donor.

          -  Any contraindications to the use of G-CSF and plerixafor during the mobilization of
             hematopoietic stem cells and any contraindications to the use of busulfan and any
             other medicinal products required during the myeloablative conditioning, including
             hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients.
