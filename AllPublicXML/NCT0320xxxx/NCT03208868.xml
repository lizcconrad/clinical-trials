  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of skeletal muscle mass or sarcopenia is the most common and potentially reversible
      complication in cirrhosis that increases morbidity and mortality before, during and after
      liver transplantation. No proven treatments exist for the prevention or reversal of
      sarcopenia in cirrhosis, primarily because the mechanisms responsible for this are unknown.
      Based on compelling preliminary studies and those of the co investigator, investigators
      hypothesize that the mechanism of reduced skeletal muscle mass in cirrhosis is due to a
      myostatin mediated impaired mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling resulting in
      reduced protein synthesis and increased autophagy. Investigators further postulate that
      leucine, a direct stimulant of mTOR, will reverse the impaired mTOR phosphorylation in the
      skeletal muscle of cirrhotics. The consequent increase in protein synthesis reduced autophagy
      will result in an increase in skeletal muscle mass. Investigators will test these hypotheses
      by quantifying the response to acute and long term (3 month) administration of leucine
      enriched essential amino acid (EAA/LEU) compared with an isonitrogenous isocaloric
      non-essential balanced amino acid mixture (does not stimulate protein synthesis) in cirrhotic
      patients. Fractional protein synthesis rate (FSR) in skeletal muscle, responses of the
      molecular regulatory pathways of skeletal muscle protein synthesis, and autophagy flux will
      be quantified in the acute and long term protocols. Tracer studies using L-[D5]-phenylalanine
      (Phe) as a primed constant infusion (prime 2µmol.kg-1.hr-1; constant 0.05 µmol.kg-1.hr-1)
      with and L [ring-D2] tyrosine, forearm plethysmography, and sequential skeletal muscle
      biopsies (total of 3 per study subject) will be used to quantify these outcomes.
      Anthropometric, clinical and body composition measures will be additional outcome measures
      for the long term intervention. Expression of regulatory signaling proteins, myostatin, IGF-1
      (insulin like growth factor) , phospho-Akt, phospho-AMPK (activated protein kinase),
      phospho-mTOR and phospho-p70s6k will be quantified by Western immunoblots. Autophagy flux
      will be measured by quantifying expression of the autophagosome proteins.

    <description>To test whether fractional synthesis of skeletal muscle proteins changes from baseline to 90 days with the administration of BAA or EAA/LEU. Fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of mixed muscle proteins will be calculated from the incorporation rate of the L- [ring D5] phenylalanine into the proteins and the free tissue phenylalanine enrichments using precursor product model: FSR= (∆Ep/t)/(∆Ec) x60x100 and expressed as %/hour. ΔEp is the increment in myofibrillar protein-bound L- [ring D5] phenylalanine enrichment, t is the time between the muscle biopsies. ∆Ec is the L- [ring D5] phenylalanine enrichments in the free intracellular pool in the muscle biopsies.</description>
