  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used against cancer work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as CMAB009,
      can block tumor growth in different ways. Giving combination chemotherapy together with
      CMAB009 as first treatment after diagnosis of a metastatic colorectal cancer（first-line
      treatment）may improve the treatment efficacy. However, it is not yet known whether giving
      combination chemotherapy together with CMAB009 is more effective than combination
      chemotherapy alone. This open-label trial investigates the effectiveness of CMAB009 in
      combination with a standard and effective chemotherapy FOLFIRI（5-Fluorouracil /Folinic acid
      plus Irinotecan）for RAS/BRAF wild-type, metastatic colorectal cancer in first-line setting,
      compared to the same chemotherapy alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assign in one of the two groups to either receive the combination
      chemotherapy alone or with CMAB009 and will then be treated until progression of the disease
      or unacceptable toxicity occurred. Regular efficacy assessments（every 8 weeks）based on
      imaging will be performed throughout the study together with regular safety assessments.

      After participant discontinuation from the trial, regular updates on further treatments and
      survival status will be requested from the investigator.
