    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of single-blind with 2 arms (Control group and
      experimental group), in which a pre-treatment-postest design has been used.

      The study will define two groups:

        -  A control group (CG) that will not be submitted to treatment, which will be evaluated in
           the pre and post phase of the study. Participants assigned to this group will receive
           general advice on the positive effects of regular physical activity and will be given a
           guide to recommendations for promoting physical activity.

        -  An experimental group (GE) that after an initial evaluation will undergo a physical
           training program based on Pilates exercises.

      Once the intervention is finished, it will be submitted to a final evaluation to see if there
      is a difference or not with the results obtained at the beginning.

    <masking_description>The assignment to the groups will be of simple random type and hidden. Those responsible for admitting patients to the intervention phase will not know what group has been assigned each. This assignment will be made in advance by a researcher who will not intervene in the later stages of evaluation, intervention, data recording and elaboration of database. The assignment will be communicated through sealed and totally opaque envelopes.
All measurements given above will be made both to the control group and to the experimental group just prior to the start of the intervention, and immediately after and six months after the end of this period, and the results will be recorded in a data record</masking_description>
