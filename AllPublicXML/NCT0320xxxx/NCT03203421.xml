    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the
      candidate malaria vaccines ChAdOx1 LS2 and MVA LS2.

      Healthy adult volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated in Oxford.

      This is an open label, dose-escalation, first in human, partially blinded, phase I/IIa
      controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study. The study will assess the safety,
      immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the novel malaria vaccine candidates ChAdOx1 LS2
      and MVA LS2 in healthy UK adults.

      Healthy, malaria naive adults, aged between 18 and 45 years, will be recruited and vaccinated
      in Oxford.

      A total of between 23 and 31 volunteers will be recruited across four groups:

      Group 1 volunteers will receive a low dose ChAdOx1 LS2 vaccination on day 0. Group 2
      volunteers will receive a high dose ChAdOx1 LS2 vaccination on day 0 and a dose of MVA LS2 on
      day 56, followed by a CHMI on day 77. Volunteers exhibiting sterile protection will undergo a
      repeat CHMI 5-7 months later.

      Control Group A will not receive any vaccinations and will undergo CHMI on day 77.

      Control Group B will not receive any vaccinations and will undergo CHMI during the repeat
      challenge.

             their General Practitioner

          -  For females only, willingness to practice continuous effective contraception (see

             until anti-malarial treatment is completed).

          -  Answer all questions on the informed consent quiz correctly.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             vectored experimental vaccine. If any volunteers in Group 2 undergo rechallenge, this
             exclusion criterion does not extend to the vaccines previously received in the VAC067

             than 42 standard UK units every week.

          -  Suspected or known injecting drug abuse in the 5 years preceding enrolment.

          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) detected in serum.

          -  Seropositive for hepatitis C virus (antibodies to HCV) at screening (unless has taken
