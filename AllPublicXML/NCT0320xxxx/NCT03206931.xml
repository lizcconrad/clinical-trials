  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LOXO-195 expanded access is for patients with cancer with a NTRK1, NTRK2, or NTRK3 gene
      fusion who are ineligible for an ongoing LOXO-195 clinical trial or have other considerations
      that prevent access to LOXO-195 through an existing clinical trial. Expanded access is
      intended to treat individual patients with different types of cancers, including blood
      cancers, with a NTRK gene fusion who have previously received TRK inhibitor therapy
