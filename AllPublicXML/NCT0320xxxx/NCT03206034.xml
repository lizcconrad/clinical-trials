  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impairments in higher level cognitive processing, such as new learning and memory, are common
      in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and negatively impact multiple aspects of everyday life, including
      occupational and social functioning. Despite this, few studies have attempted to remediate
      these cognitive deficits in order to improve everyday functioning. While not applied in
      traditional rehabilitation protocols as of yet, many techniques from cognitive psychology
      significantly improve learning and memory in healthy persons. These techniques include the
      generation effect (GE), the spacing effect (SE), and the testing effect (TE). These
      techniques have recently been incorporated into an 8-session treatment protocol, Stylistic
      Memory Enhancement (SME), designed to teach participants about each of the techniques, train
      them on how to apply the techniques in daily life and practice their application to daily
      life memory demanding situations. The protocol includes teaching participants how to
      restructure a memory demanding situation in order to make optimal use of self-generation,
      spaced learning and self-testing. The objective of the study is to test the efficacy of the
      SME in an MS population.
