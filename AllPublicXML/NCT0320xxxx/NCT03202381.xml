      The aim of this phase IV interventional study is to evaluate variation in bone mineral
      density and lean and fat body composition in patients with prostate cancer without bone
      metastasis, treated with Degarelix. These variations are evaluated at time 0 (before starting
      androgen deprivation therapy with Degarelix) and after 12 months of therapy by dual-energy
      X-ray absorptiometry (DXA scan).

    <textblock>
      Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists decrease bone mineral density (BMD) and
      increase fracture risk in men with prostate carcinoma. GnRH agonists also increase fat mass
      and decrease lean body mass. These treatment-related changes in body composition may
      contribute to fatigue, emotional distress, and decreased quality of life. Whereas the
      consequences of initial GnRH agonist on BMD and body composition are well characterized, less
      is known regarding the effects of GnRH antagonists. At the best of our knowledge the changes
      in body composition induced by Degarelix in prostate cancer patients has never been explored.
      Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a reliable and accurate method to determine the
      changes in body composition in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT).

      The change in body composition is a major determinant of increased morbidity and mortality
      induced by ADT and DXA provides the most precise measure of body composition. This study is
      designed to obtain explorative information on changes in bone mineral density, fat body mass
      and lean body mass by DXA scan after administration of Degarelix. These preliminary data
      compared with historical data of patients submitted to GnRH agonists could provide a
      rationale for a subsequent prospective randomized clinical trial.
