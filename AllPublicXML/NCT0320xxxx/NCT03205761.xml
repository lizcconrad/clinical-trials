  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter single-arm phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of olaparib in patients diagnosed of advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with
      methylation of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 promoters assessed in DNA from metastatic lesions and
      absence of BRCA1 and 2 germline mutations.

      Patients must have received at least one previous regimen in the advance disease setting and
      must have at least one measurable lesion that can be accurately assessed according to RECIST
      v.1.1. Potential eligible patients will be screened to assess somatic (s) BRCA promoter
      methylation at an reference central laboratory. Germinal (g) BRCA mutational status will be
      analyzed also centrally at Myriad GmBh laboratory unless the BRCA mutational status is
      already known based on a Myriad previous report. Patients with a positive methylation status
      on at least one of the two genes and lacking of known deleterious or suspected deleterious
      mutations in both genes could be enrolled in the study and receive olaparib.

      Blood and tumor samples collected from all screened patients could be used for the biomarker
      analysis, including the assessment of germline methylation status and gene expression levels
      of BRCA1/2. An early efficacy review will be performed after 12 evaluable patients are
      enrolled; if at least 4 of them show tumour response, additional patients will be included to
      complete a total of 34 patients.

             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection or
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation
             or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study. Examples
