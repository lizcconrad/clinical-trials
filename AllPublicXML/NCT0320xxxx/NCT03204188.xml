    <textblock>
      Background:

      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a cancer of white blood cells. It is also called small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). It causes tiredness, night sweats, weight loss, swollen lymph
      nodes, easy bruising or bleeding, and frequent infections. Researchers want to test if a drug
      combination is effective and safe for people with CLL/SLL.

      Objective:

      To test how safe and effective a combination of ibrutinib, short-course fludarabine, and
      pembrolizumab is for people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), also known as small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

      Eligibility:

      Adults at least 18 years old who have CLL or SLL, with certain genetic changes.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Heart tests

        -  Blood and lab tests

        -  Small lymph node sample removed by needle

        -  Sample of bone marrow taken by needle in the hipbone. The area will be numbed.

        -  CT or PET scan. They will lie in a machine that takes pictures. They may have a
           radioactive sugar injected before the scan.

        -  Pregnancy test

      Phase 1 will be 12 weeks. Participants will take ibrutinib by mouth once a day. For weeks 5
      and 9 they will also take fludarabine. It will be infused in a vein for half an hour each day
      for 5 days in a row.

      Phase 2 will be 2 years. Participants will take ibrutinib by mouth once a day. They will also
      get pembrolizumab by vein for half an hour once every 3 weeks.

      After that, the study team will decide if participants should continue therapy.

      During the study, participants will have regular visits. They will repeat some or all
      screening tests.

      Background:

        -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (hereby referred as CLL) are
           tumors of B cells. A subset of patients categorized as high-risk CLL has a poor clinical
           outcome when treated with conventional chemotherapy. High-risk CLL is defined by
           relapsed/refractory disease status, or the presence of high-risk mutations, such as
           deletion 17p, TP53, and NOTCH1. While the cause of CLL is still unclear, studies have
           indicated critical factors required for the tumor cells. First, CLL cells grow and
           survive because they receive signals through the B-cell receptor (BCR); and second, CLL
           cells benefit from interactions with other cells, especially T cells.

        -  The stimulation through the BCR can be blocked by ibrutinib, which is an oral drug that
           selectively inhibits Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK). In clinical trials, ibrutinib
           demonstrated safety and high response rates in patients with high-risk disease.
           Ibrutinib has gained FDA approval as a treatment for CLL regardless of prior treatment
           or cytogenetic status. However, single-agent ibrutinib has limitations; the drug does
           not eliminate all tumor cells and, with time, the tumor cells may become resistant.
           Therefore, combination of ibrutinib with other drugs could be beneficial.

        -  This study investigates the combination of ibrutinib, fludarabine and pembrolizumab for
           treatment of CLL. Fludarabine is a well-tolerated drug that has been used widely to
           treat CLL. Also, fludarabine can kill both malignant B cells and T cells that support
           the growth of leukemia cells. Pembrolizumab targets immune checkpoint molecules and
           enhances the cell-killing activity of T cells. With this approach we hope to achieve a
           greater reduction in CLL cells than with single agent ibrutinib and to restore healthier
           immune system that could contribute to durable responses.

      Objectives:

      -To investigate the rate of complete response to ibrutinib, short course fludarabine and
      pembrolizumab.

      Key eligibility criteria:

        -  Patients with active CLL meeting treatment indications defined by 2008 International
           Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) consensus guideline.

        -  High-risk CLL defined by one of the following:

             -  Relapsed/refractory disease status (except patients with deletion 13q AND mutated
                IgHV), or

             -  Presence of high-risk mutations regardless of prior treatment status: deletion 17p,
                TP53 mutation, NOTCH1 mutation, or complex cytogenetics.

      Design:

        -  This is a single-arm, open-label phase II study.

        -  Timeline: Treatment on this study is given in cycles from cycle -3 to 30, then in months
           beyond cycle 35. Cycles -3 to -1 are 28-day cycles. Cycles 1 to 30 are 21-day cycles.
           After completion of 2 years of pembrolizumab, the time on study is by chronological
           months on study.

        -  Treatment plan: Ibrutinib is given daily until disease progression or intolerable side
           effects occur. Fludarabine is given on cycles -2 and -1 only. Pembrolizumab is given
           every 3 weeks from cycle for 2 years Minimal residual disease will be measured at 2
           years from cycle 1 to determine the need for long- term treatment with ibrutinib.
