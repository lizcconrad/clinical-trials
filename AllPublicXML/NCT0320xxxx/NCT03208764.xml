      A Prospective, Open labeled, multi-Center, Evaluation of the Efficacy Safety and Tolerability
      of Nitric Oxide Given Intermittently via Inhalation to Subjects with NTM (specifically MABSC)

      Nitric Oxide (NO) has been shown to play a critical role in various biological functions. In
      the airways, NO is considered to play a key role in the innate immune system in which the
      first-line of host defense against microbes is built.

      In vitro studies suggested that NO, in part per million (ppm) concentrations, possesses
      anti-microbial activity against a wide variety of phyla including fungi, and
      antibiotic-resistance bacteria.

      In this study the investigators wish to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 160
      ppm Nitric Oxide intermittently delivered via inhalation to subjects infected with
      Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (NTM), specifically with MABSC.

          2. Diagnosis of pulmonary non-tuberculosis mycobacterial lung disease in accordance with
             the 2007 ATS/IDSA criteria with evidence of nodular bronchiectasis and/or cavitary
             disease by chest computed tomography (CT) and by culture.

          3. History of at least 6 months chronic infection with Mycobacterium abscessus.

          4. Mycobacterium abscessus positive sputum sample at screening or prior to screening.

          5. Receiving ATS/IDSA guidelines-based treatment regimen defined as: adherent to a
             multi-drug regimen for at least 6 months prior to screening with persistently positive
             mycobacterial abscessus cultures.

          6. FEV1 ≥ 30% at screening as well as baseline.

          7. Ability to produce sputum or be willing to undergo an induction of sputum for clinical
             evaluation.

          8. Life expectancy ≥1 year

          9. Ability to perform 6MWT, but not to exceed a distance of 700 meters during screening.

         10. Ability to understand and comply with study requirements.

         11. Approved and signed informed consent by subject and/or by parent/legal guardian
             (depending on subject's age).

        Exclusion Criteria:
