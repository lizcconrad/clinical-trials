  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)
      thickness measured using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and scanning
      laser polarimetry (SLP) in uveitic eyes compared to healthy eyes.

      A descriptive, observational, prospective, consecutive, cross-sectional, controlled,
      mono-center case series was conducted from May to October 2015. Clinical characteristics,
      best-corrected visual acuity, intra-ocular pressure, RNFL thickness measurement with SD-OCT
      and SLP using GDx variable corneal compensation (GDx VCC) were performed for each patient. An
      evaluation of anterior chamber inflammation with laser flare cell meter was also carried out.
      Correlations between SD-OCT and GDx VCC RNFL measurement were evaluated by linear regression
      analysis.

        Sixty-eight consecutive patients were screened between May 2015 and October 2015, 3 (4.4%)
        of whom were excluded based on poor OCT quality criteria, 7 (10.3%) for poor GDx VCC
        quality criteria, and 4 (5.9%) for poor visual field quality or reliability criteria.
        Fifty-four patients were included and divided into two groups: 50 healthy eyes in 29
        patients and 42 uveitic eyes in 25 patients. Of these 42-uveitic eyes, 25 eyes (59.5%) had
        active uveitis and 17 eyes (40.5%) had inactive uveitis
