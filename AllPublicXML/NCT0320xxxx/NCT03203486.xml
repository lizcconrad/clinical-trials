      The effects of Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) on clinical, biochemical and inflammatory profile
      in NAFLD patients with simple steatosis. Potential associations of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms to diet composition and patients' profile were also investigated.

      Diet is a modifiable key factor targeted in prevention and management of non-alcoholic fatty
      liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of Mediterranean
      Diet (MedDiet) on clinical, biochemical and inflammatory profile in NAFLD patients with
      simple steatosis. Potential associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms to diet
      composition and patients' profile are investigated. In this non-randomised, open-label study,
      44 untreated NAFLD patients with non significant fibrosis receive nutritional counsel to
      increase adherence to MedDiet. Adherence to MedDiet is estimated with MedDietScore.
      Furthermore, genotyping of STAT3 rs2293152 and GCKR rs1260326 single nucleotide polymorphisms
      takes place.

    <description>Participants were instructed to include vegetables, whole grains and fruits in their diet and increase fish, legumes and raw nut intake. Emphasis was given to extra virgin olive oil as the main added fat in meals. Particular attention was drained to decrease fermented dairy and poultry, with small amounts of red meat and homemade sweets. All participants were given meal plans in which the distribution of nutrients in relation to total caloric value was as follows: 40% of total energy as fat (50% as MUFAs), 20% as protein, 40% as carbohydrate, 300mg/d as dietary cholesterol and 20-30g fiber/d.</description>
