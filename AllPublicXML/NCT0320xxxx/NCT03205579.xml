  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer pain is one of the problems of treating cancer pain. Although, there is a WHO
      analgesic ladder to improve this problem, it is still inadequate pain control. Pain does not
      affect only physical but also emotional and quality of life.

      From review literatures we found that patients' knowledge about cancer pain management is
      inaccurate; for example, fear to use opioid, try to patience of pain, concerning only cancer
      treatments, which can cause of unfavorable pain management outcome.

      Therefore, we will conduct the RCT of using pain education by video comparing to conventional
      face to face pain education by nurse in hospitalized cancer pain patients.We will use 25 MCQs
      examination for testing pre-post intervention to test level of understanding of patients. The
      measurements are NRS, ThaiHADs and FACT-G at the first and last day of study. We expect that
      NRS should improve more than 50% at the seven day of study.

      protocol Randomized controlled trial study Sample size is 70 patients divided to 2 groups (35
      for video group and 35 for conventional face to face group) Inclusion criteria

        1. patients' age 18-70 years old

        2. moderate to severe cancer pain

        3. ECOG(Eastern cooperative Oncology Group) performance status &lt;= 3

        4. Patients can write and read Thai language Exclusion criteria

      1.Clinical unstability 2.Confusion and delirium 3.Bed ridden 4.Psychotic problem We will
      randomly allocate patients by using computer program nQuery advice 6.0. After patients sign
      inform consent we will record baseline characteristics, assess baseline Numerical rating
      scale (NRS), emotional status (ThaiHADs), Quality of life status (FACT-G). All patients will
      do the 25 MCQs test within 30 minutes before intervention. Video group will watch video 10
      minutes and conventional group will receive pain education from trained nurse in the same
      period. The knowledge includes cancer pain definition, cancer pain management, pain
      assessment and role of patients in cancer pain management. After finishing intervention
      patients will the same 25 MCQs test (30 minutes) and patients can ask questions to the
      trained nurse.

      All patients will be educated to record pain diary everyday for seven days. All patients will
      receive standard pain management from the physicians. At the day seven we will assess NRS,
      ThaiHADs and FACT-G and finish the study.
