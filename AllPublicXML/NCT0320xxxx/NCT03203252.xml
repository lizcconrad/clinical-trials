  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Measuring appearance of implant-based breast reconstruction after mastectomy for breast
      cancer - an online approach to research. Using 3-dimensional surface images we intend to
      create a tool to measure appearance after surgery in order to improve standards of care for
      women. We want to minimise the number of visits and amount of time involved in research
      participation so this pilot study will develop new online tools for information giving and
      gathering, and for consent so that only one visit to hospital will be required for
      photographs. This will also extend the availability of expensive 3D technology to more women.

      Aim To test the feasibility of a number of novel initiatives prior to their use in a
      multi-centre study. The future study will develop a way to measure cosmetic outcome for
      implant-based breast reconstruction using 3-dimensional Surface Imaging (3D-SI).

      Methods At The Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton 125 implant-based reconstructions are
      performed per year (data from 2014). The study team would like to invite women who have had
      their treatment within the previous 1-5 years to participate in the pilot. The women can be
      identified through operation records. The study team will aim to include 50.

      A letter of invitation will be sent by post. This will include a participant information
      leaflet, a link to the website, and a unique study ID for each participant. In recent
      studies, more than 8 out of ten women who were asked to participate agreed.

      The website will have the following features:

        -  Patient study information including links to other relevant information sources (e.g.
           ABS, Breast Cancer Care, RMH, ICR, BRC), patient testimonials, and biographies from the
           study team.

        -  An online consent process for the study.

        -  A questionnaire for patient demographics (height, weight etc)and treatment information
           (i.e. type of operation and other treatments like radiotherapy).

        -  An online version of the BREAST-Q reconstruction module and radiotherapy module from the
           breast conserving surgery BREAST-Q (a questionnaire designed to assess quality of life
           and satisfaction with care for patients having breast surgery).

        -  An online calendar to book a 3D-SI appointment at the hospital.

        -  A user survey to gain patient feedback on the website and the concept of online consent.

        -  A 'contact us' section in case further information is required.

      At each stage the participant will enter their unique study ID so all of the information
      collected will remain anonymous. We will hold the code for study IDs securely. There is no
      patient identifiable data collected on the website. The participant will be guided through
      the different aspects of the online recruitment processes outlined above. When they have read
      the patient information, they can click on the link to consent to the study at which point a
      check screen will ask:

        1. I have had enough information and wish to consent to the study - link to the consent
           form

        2. I would like further information which is not available on the website - link to contact
           us section

      Only then will they be able to access the data collection stages of the website and book a
      photography slot, thereby we can be sure that no patient starts to enter information or
      attends for a photograph without valid consent.

      Following this the participant will be required to attend the hospital only once for an
      appointment (booked online) for a 3D photograph and height and weight measurement. This will
      take less than 20 minutes. This will be the end of the patient involvement in the study.

      Success in this pilot will provide:

        -  A bespoke website to facilitate online patient education, consent, and data collection
           to streamline research processes.

        -  Information on uptake rate and specific evaluation of the acceptability of the web
           system and accuracy of patient entered data.

        -  Data on the accuracy of the VECTRA software to measure implant base reconstruction.

        -  A secure online 3D-SI storage facility to enable access from multiple hospitals to
           enable wider involvement in large scale research.

        -  A library of 3D-surface images on which to base a panel assessment score for
           implant-based reconstruction by way of a consensus meeting at the outset of the future
           multi-centre study.

    <description>Dropout rate - participants who complete the online recruitment process as a proportion of the number who start the process i.e. those who consent to the study versus those who progress through to booking their photography slot. The user survey is not a compulsory part of the study, therefore if it is not filled it will not preclude women from completing the study by having a 3D-SI.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy of reporting e.g. for yes/ no questions such as 'Did you have radiotherapy after breast reconstruction?' will be represented as the percentage of correct answers (should be &gt;95%).
For continuous data e.g. weight we will assess the proportion of answers within 5kg of correct answer and for height, the proportion within 5cm/2 inches. This will be represented as a dichotomous within/not within range for analysis, but a range of accuracy will also be reported.</description>

    <description>For which objective measurements are the inter- and intra-observer variation within 10% Based on previous findings this is an acceptable level of variation. Measures with a greater variation will not be useful in a multi-centre study with more observers and should therefore be avoided.</description>

    <measure>To assess the feasibility of an online secure storage facility for 3D surface images i.e. how long it takes to upload and evaluate the images, how user-friendly is it?</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time taken to upload and analyse 10 images for a single observer. In one sitting the observer will log onto the program, upload, and analyse each image once (as would be done in the panel assessment). The time will start from the logon and finish when the observer logs out at the end of the 10th image analysis. The mean time taken will be reported. Qualitative data on user friendliness will be gathered to inform improvements in the process by issuing surveys to a test team of medical professionals at the Royal Marsden Hospital with experience in using the VECTRA so the use of the data storage system is the only variable.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The BREAST-Q has a pre-and a post-operative section. The post-operative section will be used for this study. The reconstruction module has 14 post-operative domains, each with sub-scales rated 1-4. Domains 7-9 will not be used as these are in reference to autologous reconstruction, domain 10 will only be appropriate for women who have had nipple reconstruction, domains 11-14 are pertaining to satisfaction with information and staff which is not relevant to this study so will not be assessed. The Breast Conserving Therapy Post-operative module domain 2, subscales a-g will be used for women who have undergone radiotherapy. The main point of the exercise in the pilot study will be to ensure the BREAST-Q data can be collected online and analysed. The results will only be for 50 patients so will not be generalisable.</description>
