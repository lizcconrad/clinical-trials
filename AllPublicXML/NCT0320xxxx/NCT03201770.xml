  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to be performed in public health facilities in Central and West Africa where
      Pyramax will be used as treatment of uncomplicated malaria episodes, including repeat
      episodes. The study is to assess the safety of Pyramax, particularly in patients with
      underlying liver function abnormalities, in patients who have co-morbid conditions, such as
      HIV, and also in very small children (&lt;1 year of age).

      This is a non-comparative Cohort Event Monitoring study. The study will assess the safety of
      Pyramax in terms of the evaluation and identification of the hepatic safety events in a sub
      group of patients enrolled with liver function tests (LFT)s &gt;2x upper limit of normal (ULN)
      from blood taken immediately prior to treatment without any clinical signs or symptoms of
      hepatotoxicity and with signs and symptoms of uncomplicated malaria confirmed by a Rapid
      Diagnostic Test (RDT) or microscopy (thick blood smear). The study will compare the clinical
      hepatic safety of Pyramax between a cohort of patients enrolled with LFTs &gt;2xULN and a cohort
      of patients enrolled with normal LFTs matched for demographic characteristics.

      An estimated 8,572 malaria episodes are to be recruited to provide 120 malaria episodes in
      patients with baseline raised LFTs &gt;2xULN for follow up of liver function. A cohort of at
      least 2% of children who are &lt;1 year of age will be included for monitoring of liver
      function.

               -  Fever or history of fever in the previous 24 h and/or the presence of anaemia,
                  for which pallor of the palms appears to be the most reliable sign in young
                  children.

               -  Confirmation of malaria by a parasitological diagnosis (RDT or Microscopy (thick
                  blood smear). analysis).

          -  Weight ≥5 kg - &lt; 20 kg (granules); ≥20 kg (tablets).

          -  The patient has to comply with all scheduled follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinical signs or symptoms of hepatic injury (such as nausea, abdominal
             pain associated with jaundice) or known severe liver disease (i.e. decompensated
             cirrhosis, Child-Pugh stage 3 or 4).

          -  Known allergy to artemisinin and/or to pyronaridine.
