      Purpose: Have an evaluation of clinical benefits and risks of hybrid operating techniques in
      management of complex intracranial aneurysms (CIAs), which could coexists with multiple risk
      factors. Meanwhile, as a new cooperative interventional modality, optimized workflows,
      technical key knots and operation routines will be explored in the study.

      Objects: Patients with CIAs, coincident with inclusion and exclusion criterion and admitted
      in participating organizations.

      Methods: Patients will be distributed into 2 groups, including traditional therapy
      group(control group) and hybrid operating group(trial group), and conduct with traditional
      neurosurgical management or one-stage hybrid operating management correspondingly.
      Peri-operative mortality rate is considered to be the primary observing indicator, and
      morbidity rate of peri-operative cerebral hemorrhagic/ischemic event, morbidity rate of
      aneurysmal residuals, morbidity rate of neural functional deteriorations, and health-economic
      indicators are secondary indicators.The information of operations will be recorded in detail
      as evidence of optimization of workflow and technical key knots.

    <description>It is a cooperation of existing endovascular interventional techniques and microsurgical techniques. Different from traditional management, hybrid operating techniques make it possible for 2 existing techniques conducting simultaneously in a hybrid operating theater. It optimizes the traditional microsurgical techniques for complex intracranial aneurysms and avoids the transportation of patients and the risks of intervals between stages in traditional ones. It includes balloon-assisted parental arterial occlusion, one-stage aneurysm clipping/wrapping/isolation and embolization/diverter implantation, etc.</description>
