      This study evaluates the comparison of the incidence of postoperative home pain after
      ambulatory surgery with general anesthesia between a group with pre-surgical prescription
      delivered during anesthesia preoperative clinic and a group with postoperative prescription.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ambulatory surgery increased over the last twenty years in France. The management of home
      pain after ambulatory surgery is a major challenge because it is the principal complication
      after day surgery with several consequences: nausea and vomiting, chronic pain, functional
      impairment with handicap, sleeping troubles, extra-hospital consultation. Management of home
      pain remains currently could be performed in ambulatory surgery. The French Society of
      Anesthesiology recommends to deliver pre-surgical prescription during the preoperative
      anesthesia clinic but this guideline is not bases on evidence in the literature. Also, we
      have previously shown in a retrospective non-randomized work a decrease of postoperative home
      pain in patient with general anesthesia. The main objective of this controlled and
      comparative study is to compare the incidence of postoperative home pain after ambulatory
      surgery with general anesthesia between a group with pre-surgical prescription delivered
      during anesthesia consultation and a group with postoperative prescription.
