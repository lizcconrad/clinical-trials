    <textblock>
      Continued uncertainty exists over benefits of early intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering in
      acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), related to the non-significant primary outcomes,
      patient selection, and discordant results of INTERACT2 and ATACH-II. We designed INTERACT3 to
      determine the effectiveness of a goal-directed care bundle of active management (intensive BP
      lowering, glycemic control, treatment of pyrexia and reversal of anticoagulation) vs. usual
      care in ICH.

      INTERACT3 is a large-scale pragmatic clinical trial to provide reliable evidence over the
      effectiveness of a widely applicable goal-directed care bundle in acute ICH.

      Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of a goal-directed care bundle of active
      management involving early physiological control (intensive blood pressure [BP] lowering,
      glycemic control, early treatment of pyrexia, and rapid reversal of anticoagulation), versus
      usual standard of care, on functional outcome (defined by a shift in scores on the modified
      Rankin scale [mRS] in patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

      A cluster clinical trial design involves implementation of a guideline-recommended
      intervention package applied to patients with ICH as part of routine care. Patients are only
      excluded if they refuse to have details of their management included and/or participate in
      the follow-up procedures.

      Study site inclusion criteria: Organized systems of acute stroke care; no established
      comprehensive protocols for the management of patients with ICH; suitable location,
      infrastructure and willingness to participate in clinical research; large volume of ICH
      patients (approx. 100 per year). The hospitals will have training, prior to their activation
      and commencement of the intervention. Data collection at baseline,Day 1, discharge/ Day 7,
      and 6-month (end of follow-up), will be captured through a web database. Randomized
      allocation of intervention will be assigned by a statistician not otherwise involved in the
      study according to a statistical program stratified by the country of the site.

      Assuming a stepped-wedge trial of 3 groups and 4 phases, one needs 75 hospitals randomized
      into 3 groups of 25 hospitals, each recruiting an average of 27 patients per phase, for a
      total of 8147 subjects. Assuming 5% with missing endpoint data, the overall sample size
      increases to 29 subjects per hospital per phase, i.e. a total sample size of 8,621 subjects.
      Allowance will be made to include some very large hospitals (10%, 7) to recruit 50 patients
      per phase, and smaller hospitals (10%, 7) to recruit 10 patients per phase, in order to allow
      a broad range of hospitals with variable experience and systems of care for the management of
      ICH. This sample size provides 90% power to determine a treatment effect of a 5.6% absolute
      improvement in the proportion of patients experiencing a bad outcome (modified Rankin scale
      [mRS] scores of 3-6), from 55.6% down to 50%. This also translates to a 10% relative risk
      reduction (relative risk of 0.90). Various assumptions have been made including an interclass
      correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.044 between sites. All analyses will be undertaken at the
      patient level on an intention-to-treat basis at each center using Generalised Estimating
      Equations (GEE) or random-effects regression to account for clustering.

      A mixed consent process is proposed, according to local/national rules and regulations, for
      the following protocol:

      Cluster Guardian consent or appropriate approval (e.g. signed by General Manager or Chief
      Executive of hospital, or Head of Neurology/Stroke Department) for the goal-directed care
      bundle to be the new usual management for patients with ICH;

      With one of the following:

      (i). Individual standard consent for the collection of data through in-person assessment and
      data extraction from medical records during the hospital stay and follow-up, and for release
      of personalized information for research purposes to allow centralized follow-up at 6-month
      after admission, or (ii). Opt-out consent for collection of data through in-person assessment
      and data extraction from medical records during the hospital stay and follow-up, and for
      release of personalized information for research purposes to allow centralized follow-up at
      90 days after admission.

      The internet based data management system is managed at the George Institute for Global
      Health, which has extensive experience in clinical trial data capture and security. The
      George Institute has in place system security SOP with VeriSign SSL digital certification and
      encrypted HTTPS connection. Only staff listed in the delegation log will be given unique
      individual password to access the internet-based data management system.

      Paper CRFs will be provided for sites preferring to use these for the initial collection of
      data. These forms will be used as source document and will need to be signed and dated by the
      investigator completing the form.

      All computerized forms will be electronically signed (by use of the unique password) by the
      authorized study staff and all changes made following the initial entry will have an
      electronic dated audit trail. It is the requirement that the collection of data and transfer
      of information for the 90 day follow-up assessment has to be approved by the local IRB for
      each site.

      Central international coordination is from GI, China and together with regional coordinating
      centers established and located in Sydney, and Santiago, Chile, the study will be overseen by
      an International Steering Committee comprised of world experts in the fields of stroke,
      neurocritical care, neurology, geriatrics, cardiovascular epidemiology and clinical trials.
      The investigators of the 75 participating hospitals (see study organisational chart) will be
      administratively tied through a structure designed to enhance effective communication,
      collaboration and study monitoring by maintaining operations through adherence to a common
      protocol.

      Data Safety &amp; Monitoring Board (DSMB): The DSMB will review the safety, ethics and outcomes
      of the study.The DSMB will be governed by a charter that will outline their responsibilities,
      procedures and confidentiality.
