  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body, and the most exposed to the risk of
      dislocation notably anterior. Chronic instability of the shoulder is frequent after
      dislocation, and principally affects people who are young and active. It can have major
      functional repercussions, leading to restricted participation in professional or sports
      activities, even in everyday life activities.

      Surgical stabilisation is the reference treatment for chronic anterior shoulder instability,
      and has given good results. There are numerous surgical techniques available; the
      orthopaedists at Dijon CHU now practice the Bristow-Trillat technique under arthroscopy,
      following many years of reflexion and adaptation.

      Rehabilitation following the surgery is essential, notably to recover muscle strength in the
      shoulder rotator cuff after surgery, which correlates directly with dynamic stability of the
      joint. At the moment, we do not know the objective evolution of muscle strength after the
      Trillat arthroscopic technique.

      The isokinetic evaluation of muscle strength in the rotator cuff has been validated and is
      reproducible. It gives objective and reliable values for muscle strength, thus making it
      possible to guide and to optimise rehabilitation protocols done by patients under the
      supervision of a physiotherapist, and to estimate time to the return to physical,
      professional or sports activities, without risk.
