      The total study duration for a screened subject will be about 3 - 8 weeks (excluding
      screening of 2 to 28 days), treatment period of 2 days for each 3 periods (1 overnight stay),
      a washout period of 5-18 days (preferentially 7 days between consecutive dosing), and an
      end-of-study visit of 1 day between Days 5 and 14 after the last administration of the
      investigational product.
