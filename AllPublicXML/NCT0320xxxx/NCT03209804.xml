      Purpose: Have an evaluation of clinical benefits and risks of hybrid operating techniques in
      management of cerebral arteriovenous malformations(AVMs). Meanwhile, as a new cooperative
      interventional modality, optimized workflows, technical key knots and operation routines will
      be explored in the study.

      Objects: Patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformations, coincident with inclusion and
      exclusion criterion and admitted in participating organizations.

      Methods: Patients will be distributed into 2 groups, including traditional therapy
      group(control group) and hybrid operating group(trial group), and conduct with traditional
      neurosurgical management or one-stage hybrid operating management correspondingly. Residual
      rate of AVM is considered to be the primary observing indicator, and morbidity rate of
      post-operative complications, post-operative mortality rate, and morbidity rate of neural
      functional deterioration are secondary indicators.The information of operations will be
      recorded in detail as evidence of optimization of workflow and technical key knots.
