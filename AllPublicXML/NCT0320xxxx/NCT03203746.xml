      The study was designed as a randomized controlled clinical trial. Total subjects selected
      were allocated into three study groups, Group I (Test group), Group II (Positive control
      group) and Group III (Negative control group). Group I: Included 8 patients with severe
      chronic periodontitis managed by Scaling and root planing and local delivery of lycopene
      loaded in solid lipid microparticles. Group II: Included 8 patients with severe chronic
      periodontitis managed by Scaling and root planing only. Group III: Included 8 patients with
      clinically healthy periodontium.

      Protein carbonyl biomarker level and clinical parameters were assisted to evaluate the effect
      of lycopene as an adjunct to scaling and root planing.
