  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will focus on examining the supports required to enable community Senior JASPER
      Trainers to support the training and development of junior interventionists throughout the
      province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The study will examine the training and
      supports delivered by Senior Trainers to help junior interventionists provide a targeted
      social communication intervention (JASPER: Joint Attention, Symbolic Play, Engagement, and
      Regulation) with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children's engagement, play,
      and social communication outcomes will be examined as well as the influence of junior
      interventionists' intervention implementation on children's outcomes. Further, the study will
      examine the supports required to help junior interventionists who demonstrate slower gains in
      implementation fidelity after the first three months of standard support. Interventionists
      who are slow to gain implementation fidelity will be randomized to either (a) enhanced
      feedback plus peer support or (b) enhanced feedback plus intensive refresher course.

      The proposed study is an adaptive intervention trial that will focus on tailoring supports
      for new JASPER interventionists. Coaching and training supports will be provided by Local
      Senior JASPER Trainers will support the development of new interventionists. Based on the
      interventionist's individual response to the coaching/training supports, a change in support
      may be provided at a priori time points including end of month 1 (training case) if at least
      70% fidelity is not reached, and at end of month 4 (midpoint of first child cohort), at least
      90% fidelity is not reached.
