  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Performance Validity Tests (PVTs) are widely used for the detection of sub-optimal effort and
      malingering in neuropsychological assessments. Threats to their validity however likely to
      intensify with time (e.g., information available on the web or from legal representatives)
      and may lead to a decline in their ability to differentiate between malingerers and
      non-malingerers. Eye movements and response time (RT) are less obvious outcome measures and
      under less conscious control than more conventional PVT indices (e.g., accuracy). They are
      therefore promising measures that can aid in detecting malingering when used in conjunction
      with more conventional PVT indices. The Word Memory Test (WMT) is a widely used PVT in
      neuropsychological evaluations. As part of the proposed study, TBI patients, chronic pain
      patients and healthy adults (60 in each group) will be randomly divided to one of two
      conditions; optimal effort or sub-optimal effort (participants will be asked to play a TBI
      patient who wishes to present himself as having cognitive deficits or exaggerate existing
      cognitive deficits). The proposed study will improve the WMT's efficacy in detection of
      sub-optimal effort in neuropsychological evaluations and therefore protect its validity from
      future threats. In addition, the proposed study will provide us with better understanding of
      the effect of TBI on eye movements and RTs in general.

        Inclusion criteria for all participants:

          -  Adult (18-65) female and males.

          -  Signed informed consent form.

        Inclusion criteria for TBI group:

          -  TBI of at least mild severity, as operationalized by Post traumatic amnesia (PTA) &lt; 24
             hours

          -  Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 13-15

          -  Loss of consciousness (LOC) of 30 minutes or less.

        Inclusion criteria for chronic pain patients:

        â€¢ Pain without apparent biological value that has persisted beyond three months. This will
        be based on the participant self-report, electronic medical records and consultation with
        treating physician.
