    <description>Baseline 6MWT distance will be the average of the measurements recorded at the Screening and Day 1 visits. The 6MWT distance at Week 26 will be defined as the average of the 6MWT distance recorded on two separate days at Week 26.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 26 in Participants' Quality of Life as Measured With European Quality of Life 5-Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The European Quality of Life (EuroQol) 5-Dimension Questionnaire, 3-level version (EQ-5D-5L), is a self-report health status questionnaire that consists of six questions used to calculate a health utility score. There are two components to the EuroQol EQ-5D: a five-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a visual analogue scale (VAS) that measures health state. Overall scores range from 0 to 1, with low scores representing a higher level of dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. Serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, or resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Laboratory Values and Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 52</time_frame>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical symptoms consistent with IPF of ≥ 6months duration

          -  Participants could have both &quot;confident&quot; or &quot;consistent&quot; with UIP diagnosis of IPF
             based on clinical, radiologic and pathologic data according to 2011 American Thoracic
             Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines at the Screening. HRCT scan
             performed within 24 months before the start of the Screening may be used, if it meets
             all image acquisition guideline

          -  No features supporting an alternative diagnosis on transbronchial biopsy,
             bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), or surgical lung biopsy, if performed. Results of the
             surgical lung biopsy performed within the last 4 years must be confirmed by central
             review

          -  Participants with %FVC ≥ 40 % at the Screening
