  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the Think Life study is to test the effect of an online, unguided self-help
      intervention, i.e. Think Life. The primary hypothesis is that Think Life will reduce suicidal
      ideation. The secondary hypothesis is that Think Life will lead to improvements in depressive
      symptoms, hopelessness, rumination, and anxiety. Positive changes are expected after
      completing Think Life and at follow-up, twelve weeks after baseline.

    <description>The intervention was originally developed by van Spijker, van Straten, and Kerkhof (2010). For this study, it was adapted to the Flemish context and called Think Life. Think Life is mainly based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). Additionally, it encompasses elements from Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), Problem Solving Therapy (PST), and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). It encompasses six modules and every module starts with a psycho-educational section followed by a weekly assignment, core exercises and optional exercises. The participant weekly receives access to a new module. A more detailed description of the intervention is described elsewhere (Kerkhof, van Spijker, &amp; Mokkenstorm, 2013; van Spijker et al., 2010; van Spijker, van Straten, et al., 2014).</description>
