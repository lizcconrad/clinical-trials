    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a Person Centred Care online
      training programme confers significant benefit in terms of improving staff attitudes and
      quality of care of residents with dementia living in care homes, in comparison to enhanced
      usual training for professional care staff.

      There is considerable interest in e-learning and dementia from care home providers.
      Significant investment has been made into the production of resources for care staff but to
      date there appears to be no, or very limited, evaluation of their effectiveness.

      The aim is to provide a cost-effective, simple and practical evidence-based intervention,
      improving staff attitudes towards residents with dementia and quality of care provision. The
      trial will be a randomized controlled 3-arm cluster single blind trial that will take place
      over 9 months in 24 care homes in the UK.

      The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded Well-being and Health for People
      with Dementia (WHELD) programme, An Optimized Person Centred Intervention to Improve Quality
      of Life for People with Dementia Living in Care Homes. This optimized intervention is based
      on a factorial study and qualitative evaluation, to combine: training on person-centred care,
      promoting person-centred activities and interactions, and providing care home staff and
      general practitioners with updated knowledge regarding optimal use of psychotropic
      medications for persons with dementia in care homes. Using a train-the-trainer model, the
      intervention was delivered by trained therapists, who trained 2 lead care staff members
      (WHELD champions) within each care home to implement the intervention over a 9-month period.

      The primary objective of this study involving 24 care homes, with approximately 240 care
      staff, is to determine whether an online version of the optimized WHELD intervention, with or
      without supervision support, confers significant benefit in terms of improving attitudes of
      care staff caring for people with dementia and quality of care of residents with dementia
      living in care homes.

      There is considerable interest in e-learning and dementia. Significant investment has been
      made into the production of resources for care staff but to date there appears to be no, or
      very limited, evaluation of the effectiveness of e-learning in either raising awareness
      amongst care staff, or increasing outcomes of care for people with dementia. In spite of the
      lack of evidence, e-learning remains popular with care home providers and managers, as they
      are perceived to be low-cost, can be delivered to staff on-site or even at home, and with
      minimal disruption to staffing routines and schedules.

      The e-learning programme is based on the aforementioned WHELD RCT programme, which included
      over 80 care homes and 1000 participants in the study, and has already shown significant
      benefits in improvements in quality of life and agitation. This study will provide pilot
      testing to evaluate the effectiveness of an e-learning version.

      Key secondary objectives will be to determine the specific impact of the e-learning
      intervention on a range of outcomes including quality of care, quality of the interaction of
      care staff with people with dementia, person-centered practice, staff knowledge about
      dementia and staff general health, work stress and experience working with residents with
      dementia.

      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention (in particular with supervision support)
      will significantly improve several key outcomes. Specifically, the investigators hypothesize
      that, compared to enhanced usual training, the optimized e-learning intervention will:

      â€¢ Improve staff attitudes towards people with dementia

      The secondary hypotheses are that the WHELD e-learning intervention will:

        -  Improve quality of care

        -  Improve quality of interactions between staff and residents

        -  Improve person-centred practice

        -  Increase staff knowledge about dementia

        -  Improve staff general health

        -  Reduce staff work stress

        -  Improve satisfaction in caring for people with dementia

      Baseline, post intervention and 4-month follow up data will be collected on all consented
      participants who meet the inclusion criteria at each participating care home.

    <measure>Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) assessing change between time points</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: up to 2 weeks post intervention, T3: 4 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure includes 19 attitudinal items, each scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) [3]. They are summed to form a total score (range 19-95) as well as a hope subscore (8 items, range 8-40) and a person-centred subscore (11 items, range 11-55). Higher scores indicate more positive attitudes. Example items indicative of hope (reverse scored) include ''people with dementia are very much like children'' and ''it is important not to become too attached to residents.'' Items related to person-centred care include ''it is important for people with dementia to be given as much choice as possible in their daily lives'' and ''people with dementia need to feel respected, just like anybody else.''</description>

    <measure>Dementia Care Mapping assessing change between time points</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: up to 2 weeks post intervention, T3: 4 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure will be used as an observation tool to assess quality of care [4]. DCM is an established and National Institute for Clinical Excellence/Social Care Institute for Excellence (NICE/SCIE) recommended, routine care home/NHS practice development intervention that is regularly used for ensuring a systematic approach to providing individualised person-centred care. It is used to support the sustained implementation of PCCT in dementia care practice. DCM is an observational tool, set within a practice development cycle. There is good evidence of its use in practice settings as a quality audit and improvement tool.</description>

    <measure>The General Health Questionnaire-12 assessing change between time points</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: up to 2 weeks post intervention, T3: 4 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is a widely used short screening instrument comprised of 12 items [5]. Goldberg and colleagues (1997) found the GHQ-12 to have good overall sensitivity (83.4%) and specificity (76.3%). The mean area under the ROC curves was 0.88 with a narrow range. Goldberg and colleagues (1997) scored the scales using both the GHQ method (0-0-1-1) as well as using a Likert method (0-1-2-3). It was found, for the GHQ-12, that the GHQ method was better for specificity and sensitivity than the Likert method. The GHQ-12's validity characteristics were not significantly different when accounting for gender, age group or educational level.</description>

    <measure>Staff Experience Working with Residents with Dementia assessing change between time points</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: up to 2 weeks post intervention, T3: 4 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure includes 21 items assessing satisfaction, each scored from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely) and summed to create a total score ranging from 0 to 84 [6]. Higher scores indicate more satisfaction, and subscales can be created for each of six domains: (satisfaction with) feedback, the care organization, one's own expectations, patient contact, expectations of others, and the environment.</description>

    <measure>Knowledge in Dementia Scale assessing change between time points</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: baseline, T2: up to 2 weeks post intervention, T3: 4 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is a 16-item self-report questionnaire used to measure knowledge in dementia [7]. The questionnaire is scored on an agree/disagree scale; 'agree' responses are given a score of 1, 'disagree' responses are given a score on 0. This means that it is possible to gain a total score between 0 and 16, a higher score being representative of better knowledge about dementia.</description>
