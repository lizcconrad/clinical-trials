  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being carried out in order to evaluate a new cancer vaccine called IMA970A
      combined with CV8102, a new adjuvant for the treatment of liver cancer (hepatocellular
      carcinoma). It will be investigated whether IMA970A and CV8102 is safe and can trigger an
      immune response against the tumor, which may prevent the tumor (cancer) from recurring or
      spreading or may even lead to tumor shrinkage following the standard treatments the patients
      have previously received.

  <detailed_description>

      The trial is designed as a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, first-in-man phase I/II
      study investigating an off-the-shelf, multi-peptide-based HCC vaccine (IMA970A) plus CV8102
      adjuvant (RNAdjuvant®) following a single pre-vaccination infusion of low-dose
      cyclophosphamide (CY) acting as an immunomodulator, in patients with very early, early and
      intermediate stage HCC.

      The study treatment is applied without any concomitant anti-tumor therapy, with the intention
      to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence/progression in patients who have received all
      indicated standard treatments.

      Overall, it is planned to treat about 40 patients with IMA970A (off-the-shelf vaccine) plus
      CV8102 (adjuvant) plus a single low-dose of pre-vaccination CY acting as an immunomodulator
      in the HepaVac-101 study.

      Patients are requested to sign the 1st informed consent (IC 1) for screening 1 procedures
      (blood drawings for Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing and for cellular immunomonitoring,
      capture of demographics and staging of disease [routinely performed, older images may be used
      if requirements are met]), which takes up to 4 weeks. Thereafter, patients receive indicated
      standard treatment followed by recovery, which lasts for at least 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks.
      The main-phase with full safety surveillance starts with the patient's signature of the 2nd
      informed consent (IC 2) and lasts until the end of the EoV (End-of-Visit, Visit 10) Visit
      (4-6 weeks after last vaccination). For each patient this main-phase lasts up to approx. 6.5
      months consisting of up to 4 weeks screening 2, about 4.5 months vaccination period and about
      4 weeks follow up (until EOV Visit [Visit 10]).

    <time_frame>Through study completion, up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessments will consist of continuous monitoring and reporting of adverse events (AEs) including serious adverse events (SAEs), regular monitoring of vital signs, ECOG performance status and regular conduct of physical examinations and laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical [bio]chemistry including C reactive protein (CRP) and Glomerular Filtration rate (GFR), coagulation test, assessment of viral infection, thyroid function test (TFT), urinalysis), electrocardiogram (ECG) and pregnancy tests (if applicable). Additionally, an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be implemented to evaluate safety data independently and at defined intervals.</description>

    <measure>Immunogenicity (T-cell response in peripheral blood)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of immunogenicity will be performed for all patients using standardized immunomonitoring assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients will be analyzed for the occurrence of T-cell responses to peptides contained in IMA970A vaccine before application of standard therapy, such as before and after vaccination. The induction of immune responses by IMA970A vaccine will be subsequently analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Infiltrating T-lymphocytes, immune cells and potential other (bio)markers in tumor tissue</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two years</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of paraffin-embedded tumor tissues (also potentially in liquid-nitrogen frozen tissue, if available) will be performed to characterize both the tumor cells and the tumor-infiltrating components by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and potentially other analysis techniques. Classical hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining will be first performed to assess the cellular and stroma composition of the tumor tissue. Markers such as Cytokeratin 8, Cytokeratin 18 and HepPar-1, will be assessed to distinguish tumor cells from other cellular components. The tumor infiltrating cells will be characterized to assess leukocyte subpopulations such as myeloid (monocyte-macrophages, granulocytes) and lymphoid (T, B, NK) cells.</description>

          3. Very early, early and intermediate stage (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage
             0, A, B disease) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosed by biopsy or resected tissue
             (pathohistological diagnosis) or imaging findings (non-invasive criteria) following
             any standard treatment (e.g. hepatic resection, Radiofrequency Ablation / Percutaneous
             Ethanol injection (RFA/PEI), Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and SIRT) and
             without any evidence of active disease that warrant further treatment

               1. Pathohistological diagnosis of HCC based on biopsy is required for all nodules
                  occurring in non-cirrhotic livers, and for those cases with inconclusive or
                  atypical imaging appearance in cirrhotic livers

               2. Non-invasive criteria can only be applied to cirrhotic patients and need to be
                  based on imaging techniques obtained by 4-phase multi-detector CT scan or dynamic
                  contrast-enhanced MRI and on the identification of the typical hallmark of HCC
                  (hypervascular in the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed
                  phase). One imaging technique is sufficient for nodules beyond 1 cm (&gt; 1 cm) in
                  diameter.

          4. Patients for whom no standard anti-tumor therapy is indicated for the next 3 months

             treatment of BCLC stage 0, A and B HCC (e.g. RFA/PEI, TACE, and SIRT) are allowed to
             be applied in combination with the study treatment. Patients for whom treatment for
             advanced disease (e.g. sorafenib) is indicated will be withdrawn from study treatment.

             study visit

               1. Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated
                  with inhibition of ovulation applied intravaginal or transdermal for a minimum of
                  1 full cycle (based on the patient's usual menstrual cycle period) before first
                  study drug application

               2. Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
                  applied via injection or implant for a minimum of 1 full cycle (based on the
                  patient's usual menstrual cycle period) before first study drug application

               3. Total abstinence from sexual intercourse is acceptable, if it was established
                  prior to the trial and if this is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
