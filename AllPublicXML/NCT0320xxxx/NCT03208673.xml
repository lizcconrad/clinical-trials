    <measure>Change from baseline in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS): Symptomatology upon waking</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 30 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The participant rated the severity of their symptomatology upon waking using a VAS scale. Participants put a mark on a 100 millimeter line where 0 (far left on the line)=no symptoms to 100 (far right on the line)=most severe symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Lissamine green staining of the lid margin and conjunctiva</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Lissamine green dye is instilled into the eye. Damaged cells become stained by the dye and an assessment can be made of the state of the health of the patient's lid margin and conjunctiva.</description>

    <measure>Tear Film Kinetics video recording</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A video recording is taken of a patients' eye to determine at what point the tear film disperses. Tear quality and break up time can give an indication of dry eye severity</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical grading of ocular surface staining.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic dyes such as fluorescein and lissamine green dye is instilled into the eye. Damaged cells become stained by the dye and assessment can be made of the state of the health the patient's ocular surface</description>
