  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects submitted to unilateral THA will be randomized into two rehabilitation groups. One
      group will receive a booklet with guidelines for postoperative care, while the other group
      will participate in face-to-face sessions with exercises with emphasis on muscle
      strengthening.

      Individuals with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip submitted to total hip arthroplasty (THA) may
      present alterations in their functional capacity, and associated, among other aspects, the
      reduction in muscle strength. Our overall objective is to compare the effects of an exercise
      program based on training of muscular strength to orientations and functional home exercises
      in patients submitted to THA, as well as to compare the outcomes of both groups with those of
      healthy individuals. Individuals with THA will be randomly assigned to two groups. One group
      will receive face-to-face treatment (G1) and the other will receive postoperative guidance
      (G2). A blinded appraiser regarding the allocation will apply the evaluation tools at the
      moments: preintervention, after completing 7 days and after 10 weeks of the end of the
      treatment. The research will present as clinical outcomes: the muscular strength, through the
      values of torque peaks obtained in dynamometry; the functional capacity through the results
      of the Timed Up and Go test and the Harris Hip Score questionnaire; the range of joint motion
      measured with and flexometer; the pain through the results of the numerical scale of pain;
      and kinesiophobia, through the scores obtained in the Tampa Scale.
