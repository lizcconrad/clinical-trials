  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to investigate the hypothesis that in adults with SAH, early
      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) and high protein supplementation (HPRO) will
      improve muscle mass, metabolic and inflammatory biomarker profiles, compared to SAH controls
      receiving standard of care interventions for nutrition and mobilization. The investigators
      will accomplish this by studying the effects of a high protein (HPRO) nutritional treatment
      as well as NMES intervention have upon muscle wasting and motor strength acutely after SAH.
      This will be addressed in a prospective trial of SAH patients receiving HRPO with NMES as
      compared to age and severity-matched SAH patients undergoing standard of care interventions
      for nutrition and mobilization. Additionally, the study will investigate the impact HPRO and
      NMES interventions have upon inflammatory cytokines and markers of energy balance. Results of
      this study will establish evidence for precision nutrition plus early exercise to mitigate
      the catabolic and inflammatory state produced by SAH to improve muscle, metabolic, and health
      recovery outcomes.
