  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current standard treatment for Old World CL is based on daily painful injections with
      antimonials, which in Pakistan requires specialised care provided in secondary level care
      facilities.

      Apart from potential toxic side effects of these antimonials, the long treatment course, high
      cost and inconvenience, it may prevent patients from seeking care or completing treatment,
      especially women and children in the Pakistan context. Untreated cutaneous leishmaniasis may
      leave disfiguring scars leading to stigmatisation and (psycho) social problems. If the CL
      lesions/scars are located on joints they can cause problems in motion and lead to disability.
      At a public health level, patients with untreated CL lesions are a reservoir for further
      transmission of CL in the family and community.

      Thermotherapy is topical, not invasive, non-toxic, and the treatment duration is only 7 days,
      and therefore is expected to have major benefits for patients.

      Additional advantages are that the HECT-CL can be applied by lower level qualified health
      workers, and the costs are low (less than 3 USD) per re-usable heat pad), and therefore can
      be rolled out to peripheral health facilities, potentially having a major impact on access to
      treatment.
