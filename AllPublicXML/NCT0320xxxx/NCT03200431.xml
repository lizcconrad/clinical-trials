    <measure>Trans epidermal water loss</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The trans epidermal water loss is measured on the peristomal skin using a probe. The Tran epidermal water loss is a measure for the skins barrier function. There is always a loss of water from the skin due to natural evaporation. However, when the skin barrier is damaged the evaporation of water increases leading to a higher trans epidermal water loss. Thus, trans epidermal water loss is used to assess the damage to the skin.</description>
