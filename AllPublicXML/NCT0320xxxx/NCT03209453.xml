      To identify the therapeutic effects of short-term family-centered work shop for children with
      developmental delays
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. The family work shop has a total of 6 weeks, with 6 families in one course. 2. Two hours
      per session, one time per week. Aims;

        1. Assess the effects of family work shop for children with developmental delays, including
           functional performance and health-related quality of life.

        2. Assess the family strain by work shop for parents of children with developmental delays.
