  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well carboplatin with or without atezolizumab
      works in treating patients with stage IV triple negative breast cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving carboplatin with atezolizumab may work better in
      treating patients with stage IV triple negative breast cancer

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) of carboplatin +
      atezolizumab (using irRECIST) versus carboplatin alone (using RECIST) in patients with triple
      negative metastatic breast cancer

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine overall response rate.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy, as measured by clinical benefit rate, of carboplatin +
           atezolizumab (using irRECIST) versus carboplatin (using RECIST) alone in patients with
           triple negative metastatic breast cancer. Clinical benefit rate is defined as complete
           response plus partial response plus stable disease for 6 months.

        -  To determine the duration of response for patients achieving a partial or complete
           response.

        -  To evaluate the overall survival (OS) of carboplatin + atezolizumab versus carboplatin
           alone in patients with triple negative metastatic breast cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To perform the following correlative studies from biopsies taken at baseline:

             1. Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte frequency and phenotype (TILs) at baseline

             2. PD-L1 expression from the baseline pre-treatment tissue and at progression lesion,
                performed by IHC (SP142 clone)

             3. HER2 (IHC, FISH) and ER/PR levels (IHC) from a metastatic site

             4. Perform RNA-seq to determine non-synonymous mutation burden in expressed genes and
                gene expression to assign a triple negative subtype at baseline for correlations
                with clinic outcome

             5. Immune phenotyping (IHC) for markers of T cell subsets and activation (CD4, CD8,
                FoxP3, CD25, Glut1) and exhaustion (PD1, CTLA4) and test feasibility of flow
                cytometric analyses to include additional markers

        -  To assess the effect of BRCA mutations on response to the study drugs

        -  To evaluate the effect of steroids on the efficacy of atezolizumab To assess the
           prognostic effects of TILs on PFS and CBR in patients receiving atezolizumab

          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) disease, except for treated asymptomatic CNS
             metastases, provided all of the following criteria are met: measurable disease outside

             mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension,
