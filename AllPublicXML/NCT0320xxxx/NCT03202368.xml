    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, interventional, open-label, long-term extension study of Study WA28119
      (NCT01791153) to evaluate the long-term safety of SC tocilizumab in participants with GCA who
      subsequently have flare or persisting disease activity. A maximum of 11 participants from six
      centers in France that participated in the WA28119 study will be enrolled. The entire study
      duration is anticipated to be approximately 160 weeks.

             tocilizumab in this study

          -  Participants whom the investigator wants to treat with SC tocilizumab due to
