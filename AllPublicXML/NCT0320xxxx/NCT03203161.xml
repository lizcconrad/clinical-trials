  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While bariatric surgery is established as a safe and effective alternative with well-defined
      risks for severely obese adults, little has been published on its use in children.

      There are many unresolved questions concerning the long-term metabolic and psychological
      consequences of bariatric surgery in adolescents, and the difference with the adult
      population. The appropriate timing for bariatric surgery in young people, and the predictors
      of success and safety still need to be determined.

      The aim of this long-term prospective study is therefore to establish the safety and efficacy
      profile of surgical procedures and to clarify whether reductions in morbidity and mortality
      outweigh the risks of serious surgical complications and lifelong nutritional deficiencies.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective observational cohort design study to collect
      data during standard clinical care of adolescent bariatric patients (younger than 18 years)
      who were operated (RYGB or SG) for weight loss.

      Medical, psychological, behavioral, fitness and social data will be collected by medical
      personnel guided by checklists and prepared questionnaires. All non-invasive and invasive
      examinations will be performed following the existing protocol of the multidisciplinary group
      at the hospital (no alteration of normal standard care). Data regarding family environment
      (birthdays, weight, length, medication, comorbidities, smoking and education of parents and
      siblings) will also be obtained from caregivers of the patients.
