      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of mixed methylene blue
      compound Injection for the treatment of nonneoplastic epithelial disorders（NNEDS） of vulva.

      NNEDS of skin and mucosa of vulva refer to a group of chronic diseases including squamous
      hyperplasia and lichen sclerosus, which mainly cause vulvar itching and hypopigmentation.
      Usually the itching is severe may influence social activities and sleep. In addition, NNEDS
      cause scarring of the vulva which may cause significant sexual dysfunction or pain. The
      reasons for NNEDs are not clear and the methods of treatment are diverse. The current
      treatments are primarily local drug (e.g. steroid, calcineurin inhibitors, immunosuppressive
      agents ), surgical treatments, laser or photodynamic therapy, and the &quot;gold standard&quot;
      treatment for lichen sclerosus is potent steroids creams. However, all the treatments are not
      good enough, and the diseases often recur and severely affect women's quality of life. So the
      investigators reviewed plenty of literatures, and found some authors used single intradermal
      1% methylene blue injection for intractable idiopathic pruritus ani and the effect was good.
      As a preliminary experiment, the investigators used intradermal mixed methylene blue compound
      injection for a NNEDs patient in the year of 2012, the itching of the patient stopped
      immediately and the color of the vulva recovered 6 months later. The patient keeps healthy
      till now. And from then on, the investigators designed this study and to verify the effect
      and complications of intradermal mixed methylene blue compound injection for the treatment of
      NNEDS. So far, there is no similar study reported internationally.

      Methylene blue compound injection are mixed by Methylene Blue injection, Dexamethasone
      powder-injection, Ropivacaine injection and Normal saline injection. Each individual
      component can help in a very wide range of medical conditions without serious side effects.

      In this study，the investigators used methylene blue compound injection intradermally to treat
      NNEDs patients. Patients with a diagnosis of biopsy proven NNEDs from Maternal and Child
      Health Hospital of Hubei Province (China) between October 2013 to October 2016 were
      recruited. Every patient received intradermal mixed methylene blue compound injection twice.
      All patients were observed during the hospitalization at the first injection, and two weeks
      later they received the second injection at the outpatient department. Ages, itching scores,
      percentage of hypopigmented skin, and recurrences were recorded through inquiry and physical
      examination before and after treatment. Side effects (such as edema, fever and vulva pain)
      were also recorded. All women were followed up 1, 3, 6, 12 months after treatment, which
      included inquiry and physical examination.

    <description>The patients rate the itching on a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and after the treatment. A VAS is a 100-mm long horizontal line with verbal descriptors at each end to express the extremes of the itching feeling. The most severe itching equals to score 10, and no itching equals to score 0. Patients marked the point on the line that best corresponded to their itching severity.</description>

    <measure>percentage of hypopigmented skin</measure>
    <time_frame>1 years</time_frame>
    <description>Doctors rate the hypopigmented skin on a vulva surface area scale (VSAS) before and after treatment through colposcopy. The vulva area is divided into six regions as labia majora, labia minora, interlabial sulci, clitoris and clitoral hood, perineum, and perianal area. The investigators estimated that the area percentage of labia majora, labia minora, interlabial sulci, clitoris and clitoral hood, perineum, and perianal area was 48%, 24%, 4%, 4%, 10% and 10% differently. Among the six regions, interlabial sulci, clitoris and clitoral hood, perineum, and perianal area could be divided into four equal proportions at most when the area percentage was calculated. And each side of labia majora and labia minora could be divided into four equal proportions at most. If all the vulva area is involved, the VSAS score is 100%, and if no area of vulva is involed, the VSAS score is 0%.</description>
