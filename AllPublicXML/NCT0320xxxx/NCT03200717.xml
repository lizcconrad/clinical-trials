  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An international, multicenter, single arm Phase II trial to determine the efficacy, safety
      and quality of life of pazopanib treatment after previous therapy with immune checkpoint
      treatment. Approximately 100 patients will be enrolled, with approximately 40 of those
      patients receiving pazopanib as 2nd-line therapy. Patients will receive treatment with
      standard dose pazopanib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, pregnancy, death,
      discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason or until study end. All
      patients will be followed for survival. Patients who discontinue treatment without documented
      disease progression will be followed for efficacy.

    <description>Quality of life measured through the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Kidney Symptom Index (FSKI-DRS).
FKSI-DRS is a set of items selected which was developed and validated to specifically assess symptoms experienced by patients with advanced kidney cancer. Item development was conducted using both clinician and patient input to determine the 9 most important symptoms and concerns of people being treated for advanced kidney cancer. These 9 items were then validated by administering the symptom index to patients diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer. The symptoms covered by the 9-item FKSI-DRS include fatigue, pain, weight loss, dyspnea, cough, fever and hematuria. The FKSI-DRS will be scored according to the developers' instructions.</description>

    <description>Quality of life measured through the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. The EQ-5D-5L is a general health status and health utility measure. It measures 5 dimensions of health state: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression each assessed by a single question on a threepoint ordinal scale. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the scored scales at each scheduled assessment time point. Additionally, changes from baseline in the scores at the time of each assessment will be descriptively analyzed.</description>

             checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

             considered 1 line of therapy)

          -  Patient has not recovered from toxicity from prior immune checkpoint inhibitor
             therapy. Recovery is defined as ≤ NCI-CTCAE Grade 1, except for liver function test
             levels which must be &lt;Grade 1.

          -  Disease recurrence less than 6 months from the last dose of prior neoadjuvant or
             adjuvant therapy (including VEGF-R TKI)

          -  Patients receiving prohibited concomitant medications that cannot be discontinued or
             replaced by safe alternative medication at least 5 half-lives of the concomitant
             medication or 7 days, whichever is longer, prior to the start of pazopanib treatment.

          -  Administration of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of
             study treatment
