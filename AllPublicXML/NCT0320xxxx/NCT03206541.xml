  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center case-control study that aims to define the association between the
      exposure to an arbovirus infection and the development of a neurological syndrome in patients
      from Colombia. The study makes part of the Neurovirus Emerging in the Americas Study (NEAS)
      that is a collaborative effort that looks to combine the efforts of researchers, healthcare
      providers and patients in Colombia to establish a comprehensive registry of the clinical,
      radiological and laboratory profile of patients with new onset of neurological diseases
      associated mosquito-borne viruses, known as arboviruses.

    <textblock>
      NEAS is led by Dr. Carlos Pardo-Villamizar at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and Drs. Beatriz
      Parra and Lyda Osorio at Universidad del Valle (UV) in Colombia. They have established a
      collaborative network with physicians, neurologists and experts in microbiology and
      epidemiology in that country. NEAS is actively recruiting patients in seven university-based
      hospitals in five Colombian cities. The protocol of the study has been approved in each of
      the participating centers.

      NEAS prospective case-control study aims to define the association between the exposure to
      arbovirus (Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya) and the development of a neurological syndrome in
      patients from Colombia, a country with endemic transmission of arbovirus. The cases are
      defined as individuals that present with new onset of a neurological syndrome of unknown
      etiology, including but not limited to encephalitis, myelitis, meningitis,
      polyneuropathy/Guillain-Barre syndrome and cranial nerve involvement. There are two
      age-matched control groups: 1) household controls and 2) controls with a febrile syndrome of
      unknown etiology that do not present neurological involvement. The estimated sample size in
      the study is 50 participants in each group (cases and controls 1 and 2). The time to collect
      the complete sample size is between 12-24 months, and depends on the local incidence of
      cases.

      Each center has a coordinator team that includes a neurologist, a physician - neurology or
      internal medicine resident -, and a research coordinator. The team is constantly screening
      the patients admitted to the center. The patients that fulfill the criteria for cases or
      controls are approached by the research coordinator who is in charge to inform the
      participant about the study and complete the informed consent. Then, the medical team perform
      the neurological evaluation, including the history and the physical exam according to the
      NEAS forms. Samples of blood and urine are collected in all participants. If a lumbar
      puncture is done as part of the standard of care, spinal fluid is also collected. Based on
      resources availability, the participants are followed every week for a 4-week period and in
      each visit a clinical assessment and sample collection are completed.

      Demographic and clinical information, laboratory and imaging results are stored in a secured
      web-based database in the platform REDcap,based at JHU. Each center has a unique combination
      of a username and a password to enter the database and include the information of each
      participant in real time. Each center has access to the included information by the same
      center and no by other centers. Standardized forms (NEAS forms) were created by the study
      team that include relevant information necessary to achieved the aims of this study and
      guarantee the data consistency. Laboratory testing and imaging results are obtained from the
      medical records. A permanent monitoring of the data base is done by the teams at JHU and UV.

      After the samples are collected they are shipped to the study core laboratory located at UV
      (Dr. Beatriz Parra). Each center has been trained in the correct handling, processing, and
      shipping of the samples. Once the samples are in the core laboratory, they are aliquoted and
      stored. Blood, urine and spinal fluid are tested by Real Time/Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the presence of viral RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) of Zika
      virus and Dengue virus. Serum and spinal fluid are tested by ELISA for the detection of
      anti-flavivirus IgM and IgG. The results are shared with the local study team and with the
      medical team taking care of the participant. In addition, aliquots of samples are sent to JHU
      for additional immunological and virological assessments (Dr. Carlos Pardo-Vllamizar).

      Standard Operative Procedures (SOP) have been created for patient recruitment and consent,
      REDcap data entering, and biosamples process and shipment. The statistical analysis will be
      done by epidemiologists at UV (Dr. Lyda Osorio) and it will include frequency measures and
      central tendency measures of the variables. The measure of the strength of association will
      be done using Odds ratio and confidence intervals.

    <ipd_description>NEAS is part of the ZikaPLAN, which is a consortium led by the European Community. There is a plan of sharing information with other collaborators within the consortium. The information will include demographic information, laboratory results and neurological physical exam. No identifiers will be shared. The information will be obtained through the ongoing recruitment of patients. We plan to share the first set of information during the second semester of 2017.</ipd_description>
