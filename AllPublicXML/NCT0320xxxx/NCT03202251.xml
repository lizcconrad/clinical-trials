  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure using a device that improves motor
      symptoms of specific neurological and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease or
      Essential Tremor. As part of the patient's care, the DBS is implanted when symptoms cannot be
      satisfactorily controlled with medications or conventional therapies. Lower urinary tract
      symptoms are common in patients who have underlying neurological or movement disorders and
      control over lower urinary tract function is poorly understood. In this study we are
      evaluating the effects of DBS on lower urinary tract function.

    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that improves motor symptoms of
      specific neurological and movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease or Essential Tremor.
      DBS is implanted when symptoms cannot be satisfactorily controlled with medications or
      conventional therapies. After insertion of deep electrodes, electrical stimulation will be
      delivered to modulate specific neurons in certain areas of the brain. Despite, the known
      motor effects for DBS, its nonmotor effects on other organs such as the urinary tract and
      bladder function remains unclear. Lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency, urgency,
      urinary incontinence, or incomplete bladder emptying are common in patients who have
      underlying neurological or movement disorders. In addition, central neural control over lower
      urinary tract function is still poorly understand. In this trial we plan to evaluate the
      effects of Deep Brain Stimulators (DBS) on lower urinary tract function. This trial is
      designed to test the hypothesis that DBS improves objective and subjective symptoms of lower
      urinary tract function in specific patient populations. The investigators plan to test this
      hypothesis by using validated patient reported outcome questionnaires and urodynamic testing
      (both are part of routine care for neurogenic bladder) before and after DBS implantation. In
      addition, this trial will shed some light in understanding higher neural control of bladder
      and potentially identify target areas for future intervention.
