      This Phase III, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, active-controlled, multicenter study
      is conducted to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a single dose of MenACYW conjugate
      vaccine when administered alone and in combination with other pediatric vaccines in healthy
      toddlers in South Korea, the Russian Federation, and Mexico.

      Healthy, meningococcal-vaccine na√Øve toddlers aged 12 to 23 months are randomized either to a
      single dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine alone or in combination with other pediatric
      vaccines in healthy toddlers in South Korea (measles-mumps-rubella vaccine [MMR] + varicella
      vaccine), the Russian Federation (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13]), and Mexico
      (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, and Haemophilus
      influenza type-b conjugate vaccine [DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib]). Immunogenicity (pre- and 30 days
      post-vaccination) and safety are assessed.

             on the day of the first study visit (eligible for enrollment to MenACYW conjugate
             vaccine group) or 15 to 23 months on the day of the first study visit (eligible for
             enrollment to the MenACYW conjugate vaccine+PCV13 group or the PCV13 group)

          -  Participants had received all recommended standard of care vaccinations according to

             his or her age as per the country's National Immunization Program (NIP). The 2nd dose

             administered in the study.

             corresponding to his or her age at inclusion.

          -  For Mexico, participants must not have received the DTaP-IPV-HB-Hib vaccination
             corresponding to his or her age at inclusion.

             recommended for his/her age in the respective NIPs, but inclusion of participants with
             variations in the vaccine administration timeframes is considered acceptable if the
             total number of doses for the corresponding vaccines have been completed (e.g., in
             Mexico, 3 infant doses of the pentavalent vaccine must have been administered but the
             4th dose due in the 2nd year of life should not have been administered for
             participants to be included in the trial). For the Russian Federation only,
             participants that have not received a seasonal flu vaccination from 6 months of age

             vaccines. This exception includes monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and
             multivalent influenza vaccines.

          -  Previous vaccination against meningococcal disease with either the trial vaccine or
             another vaccine (i.e., mono- or polyvalent, polysaccharide, or conjugate meningococcal
