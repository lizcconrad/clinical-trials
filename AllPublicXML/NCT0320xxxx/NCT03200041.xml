    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the IONAÂ® test which is a
      non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) for Down's syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities in
      twin pregnancies, from a maternal blood sample.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      350 low risk and 150 high risk women with twin pregnancies will be recruited to produce a
      large cohort evaluation the use of the IONA test in twin pregnancies for Downs, Edwards and
      Patau syndrome. Reserve samples will also be used to further develop the test for other
      chromosomal abnormalities.
