  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will aim to assess the acceptance of the Snore PAP system as a treatment concept
      for snore. The study will subjectively assess participant and bed partner acceptability and
      usability of the Snore PAP system and objectively assess participant compliance with the
      Snore PAP system.
