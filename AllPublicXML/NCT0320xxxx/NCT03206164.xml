  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The barriers faced by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) begin in
      their mid to late 20s and often mirror the experiences of older adults (50+) living in the
      U.S. While evidence for successful population-specific health promotion programs and
      training, such as the 12-Week HealthMatters Program has been documented, an urgent need
      exists for continuous, readily available, on-demand training in these programs. Online
      training can substantially aid the widespread translation of evidence-based programs into
      practice and policy. This proposal seeks to test the effectiveness of an enhanced mode of
      translating the HealthMatters program into practice through the use of an on-demand
      e-Learning platform (HealthMatters@24/7) for staff in community based organizations (CBOs) in
      one state; thereby advancing the science of translational research. HO1. More CBOs in the
      asynchronous training program will have developed Strategic Action Plans for Health and
      Wellness, established Wellness Committees, and have equal or more resources and improved
      culture for health promotion at 1 year compared to CBOs participating in the current live
      HealthMatters TtT Workshop webinar. HO2. Staff in the asynchronous training group will have
      improved levels of learner/instructor satisfaction (job productivity, job performance, job
      satisfaction, organizational commitment, convenience) toward the training immediately after
      completing the enhanced mode of training, HM@24/7 compared to staff trained using the current
      live HealthMatters TtT Workshop webinar.

      The barriers faced by people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) begin in
      their mid to late 20s and often mirror the experiences of older adults (50+) living in the
      U.S. While evidence for successful population-specific health promotion programs and
      training, such as the 12-Week HealthMatters Program has been documented, an urgent need
      exists for continuous, readily available, on-demand training in these programs. Online
      training can substantially aid the widespread translation of evidence-based programs into
      practice and policy. Consistent with the mission of the Midwest Roybal Center for Health
      Promotion and Translation, our proposed study, HealthMatters@24/7 eLearning, is guided by the
      RE-AIM framework to evaluate the reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance
      of the HealthMatters Program for maximal positive impact on the health of people with IDD.
      The goal of HealthMatters@24/7 eLearning is to develop a low cost, readily accessible
      comprehensive staff training that will improve staff job performance, satisfaction, and
      organizational commitment to the provision of health friendly services while creating a
      productive and competitive workforce. These conditions will enable more community-based
      organizations to offer the program efficiently, thereby increasing access to HealthMatters
      among older adults with IDD.

Design. We will utilize a two-group (Table 1) pre-test/post test quasi-experimental design wherein the Experimental Group will receive HealthMatters@24/7 training and the Control Group will receive the customary real-time (live) webinar training (HealthMatters Train the Trainer Workshop).</intervention_model_description>
