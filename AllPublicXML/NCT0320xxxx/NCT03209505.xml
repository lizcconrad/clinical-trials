      This study examines the development of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE) in individuals fit with
      contact lenses having difference coefficients of friction (CoF)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objectives are to determine the amount of Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE)
      induced in subjects after contact lens fitting that do not have LWE at study enrollment.
      Subjects in the trial will be fit in 2 contact lenses with different coefficients of friction
      (CoF). One eye will be fit in a contact lens with a low coefficient of friction (Acuvue
      Oasys®, Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision, Jacksonville FL) while the contralateral eye will be fit in
      a contact lens with a high CoF (Air Optix® Night &amp; Day® Aqua, Ft. Worth, TX), as reported in
      the scientific literature. The eye receiving each lens will be assigned randomly. The
      presence of LWE will be assessed at 2 different time points, approximately 2 hours after
      contact lens fitting and approximately after 7 days of contact lens wear.
