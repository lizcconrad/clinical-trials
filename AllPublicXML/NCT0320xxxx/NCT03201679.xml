  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The worldwide occurrence of hip fracture is high with an annual incidence of approximately
      100 per 100.000 people. Mortality for patients undergoing hip fracture surgery is high with a
      30-day mortality rate varying between 4.5 and 13.3 %. It is agreed that non-modifiable
      factors such as age, gender and pre-existing comorbidities contribute to early death of hip
      fracture patients. However, not many studies have focused on preoperative sepsis as a
      potential risk factor. Hip fracture patients are commonly identified with sepsis after
      surgery, but the extent of preoperative sepsis and its consequences are sparsely elucidated.
      Being able to identify patients at higher risk of postoperative mortality could potentially
      improve outcome and extensive hospital registries of vital signs and cultures allow
      identification of preoperative sepsis.

      The aim of this study is to assess the association between preoperative sepsis and the 30-day
      mortality after hip fracture surgery.

      This study will be a retrospective analysis of a set of data collected prospectively. Data on
      relevant cultures, blood samples, co-morbidities, time to surgery and 30-day mortality will
      be extracted from patient records and clinical databases to examine the pre- and
      postoperative status of the patients.

        The population will consist of patients admitted with a primary diagnosis of hip fracture
        and who underwent hip fracture surgery between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with one of the following ICD-10 diagnoses for hip fracture: DS720(Fracture
             of neck of femur), DS721 (Pertrochanteric fracture), DS721A(Intertrochanteric
             fracture), DS721B (Trochanteric fracture), DS722 (Subtrochanteric fracture)

          -  Patients who underwent surgery for hip fracture.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a pathologic hip fracture related to an underlying metastatic disease
             (ICD-10: DM907).

          -  Patients with incomplete preoperative data. All patients must have at least one record
             of each of the following variables within 72 hours prior to hip fracture surgery:
             temperature, heartrate, respiratory rate and blood leukocytes.
