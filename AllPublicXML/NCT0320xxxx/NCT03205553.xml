  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroschisis is a clinical condition characterized by a defect in the normal development of
      the abdominal wall. The defect is present to the right of the umbilicus leading to in utero
      bowel evisceration and exposure to amniotic fluid. Prolonged exposure to amniotic fluid may
      lead to inflammatory changes and damage to the exteriorized bowel. After birth and prior to
      operation, the usual treatment consists of covering the bowel with impermeable plastic bag to
      prevent additional fluid losses and bowel desiccation. Subsequent operative intervention
      occurs either in the operating room or in the neonatal intensive care unit. Two surgical
      options include primary closure of the abdomen or placement of a silastic silo followed by
      subsequent closure several days later as a staged procedure. The main reason the abdominal
      wall is not closed initially is due to fear of abdominal compartment syndrome, a condition
      caused by high intra-abdominal pressures leading to respiratory and circulatory compromise.
      The key points of the initial surgery involve examining the intestine for any signs of
      atresia, bowel compromise, and either placement of the bowels back into the abdomen or a
      spring loaded silo.

    <description>Non-treatment group will be placed in silo at time of birth and subsequently serially reduced in silo with umbilical tape until the bowel contents are at the level of fascial and deemed suitable for closure. A drain will be placed at the top of the silo as described below to aspirate peritoneal fluid for sampling. These subjects will have no change in current clinical management by the neonatologists or pediatric surgeons and will not receive peritoneal dialysis fluid.</description>

    <description>The Investigational treatment group will be treated with direct peritoneal resuscitation (DPR). These subjects will undergo DPR during the entirety of silo placement which is usually four to five days. The silo and drain placement will be placed as described below. No additional incisions will be made. These subjects will also be serially reduced with umbilical tape and closed as staged procedure which is the same as the non-treatment group.</description>
