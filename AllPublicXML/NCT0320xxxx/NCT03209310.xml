  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) can be defined as a group of disorders of movement and posture, causing
      activity limitation that are attributed to nonprogressive deficits that take place in the
      immature brain. The motor disorders of CP are often accompanied by deficits in sensation,
      cognition, communication, perception, behavioral and respiratory system .

      Children with CP have many primary motor impairments such as selective mobility, muscle
      weakness, abnormal muscle tone, impaired coordination between agonist-antagonist muscles and
      insufficient postural control. These motor impairments also lead to secondary problems such
      as contractures and bone deformities. Whether primer or secondary, all these problems can
      reduce independence in activities of daily living (ADL) by affecting CP children at different
      levels.

      There are several studies in children with CP that investigate the effects of trunk control
      and/or respiratory functions. However, there are very few studies examining the relationship
      of these functions which have direct effects on ADL. In these studies, the functions of
      children who are more heavily affected and unable to move have been examined. However, there
      are no studies examining the effect of trunk control on respiratory muscle strength in
      children with CP with a better mobility level. There are many factors affecting both trunk
      control and respiratory functions in these children. Therefore, in children with CP, who have
      better functional level and can move on their own, revealing the interaction between trunk
      control and respiratory functions may contribute significantly to the treatment process. For
      this reason, this study was planned to investigate the effect of trunk control on ADL and
      respiratory muscle strength in children with CP having a Gross Motor Functional
      Classification System (GMFCS) levels of 1 and 2 and to compare them with healthy children.

    <textblock>
      Trunk control was evaluated by Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS), ADL was evaluated by
      Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI) and respiratory muscle strength was
      evaluated by mouth pressure meter.

    <measure>Trunk Control Measurement Scale (TCMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>TCMS measures the state of balance on the support surface and the ability to actively move body parts during functional activities, which are the two components of trunk control. TCMS consists of 15 items in total that are scored on 2, 3 or 4 point ordinal scale and administered bilaterally in case of clinical relevance. The total TCMS score ranges from 0 to 58. A high score on this scale represents a better performance</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The ADLs of the children participating in the study were assessed by the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). It is a clinical measurement developed by Haley and used to evaluate the change in the functional skills, functional abilities and performance of children with disabilities. PEDI consists of two sections as Functional Skills Scale and Caregiver Assistance Scale. The first section, the Functional Skills Scale, is divided into three subscales: self-care, mobility and social function. This section, which consists of 197 items in total, is scored as unable (0) and capable (1). The second section of PEDI, the Caregiver Assistance Scale, is also divided into three subscales: self-care, mobility and social function. It consists of 20 items in total. Each item in this section is scored between 0 and 5. A score of 5 indicates that the child is completely independent, while a score of 0 indicates that the child is completely dependent on the caregiver.</description>

    <measure>Respiratory Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>These measurements were made using the respiratory pressure meter (Micro Medical Micro RPM, UK) and performed according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society criteria (ATS. and ERS. 2002). Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) was measured in the residual volume after maximal expiration, while Maximal Expiratory Pressure (MEP) was measured in total lung capacity after maximum inspiration.</description>
