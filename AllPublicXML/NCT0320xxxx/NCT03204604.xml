  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Brain Ketone Body Challenge Imaging Study will measure how the brain uses different
      fuels. To do this, radioactive compounds will be used during Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) imaging.

      These compounds, called [11C]Acetoacetate (AcAc) and [18F] Fludeoxyglucose (FDG), are similar
      to the sugars and fats the brain already uses for fuel. These compounds safely allow
      researchers to see how the brain uses sugars and fats during PET scans.

      After consuming a chilled 4 ounce shake which contains various dietary fats, cognitive
      testing and dual-tracer Positron Emission Tomography scan will be completed. At Visit 1, each
      participant will be randomized to Challenge A (low calorie Ensure®) or Challenge B (Ensure®
      plus ketone esters). At Visit 2, each participant will undergo the remaining challenge (A or
      B) prior to the second imaging session. Each visit is designed to be identical to the other
      and only vary the dose of ketone esters. Randomization to either Challenge at Visit 1 will
      ensure that test/re-test learning effects are equally distributed between the challenge
      groups. This study consists of two visits that will take place over a two week period.

    <description>Subject will drink the shake. Immediate recall memory testing. Subject will be placed in the scanner. Prior to PET acquisition, a low dose CT scan of the head will be obtained for attenuation correction. Patients will be injected with an intravenous bolus of up to 5-10mCi (370 MBq) (+/- 10%) of [11C]AcAc (over 2 minutes). This is the standard dose used in published clinical studies using [11C]AcAc. The PET acquisition will begin immediately after the tracer injection and last for a total of 30 minutes. 2 ml of blood will be sampled from the forearm vein at 3, 6, 8, 12, 20, and 28 minutes post [11C]AcAc tracer injection. This will be used for quantification of radiation estimates throughout the scan-period</description>

    <intervention_name>Cognitive Testing - FCSRT</intervention_name>
    <description>The Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) measures verbal memory through multiple trials of a list learning task. A list of 16 items is visually presented to the participants, who then recall as many items as possible. On subsequent trials, participants are told only those items they omitted on the previous trial. The procedure continues until the participant recalls all items on two subsequent trials. After approximately 30-minute delay, participants are asked to recall as many items as possible. The number of items recalled after the delay is then summed.</description>

    <description>Story Recall: This test is a modification of the episodic memory measure from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R). In this modified version, free recall of one short story that consists of 44 bits of information will be elicited immediately after it is read aloud to the participant and again after a thirty-minute delay. The total bits of information from the story that are recalled immediately (maximum score = 44) and after the delay interval (maximum score = 44) are recorded. Six comparable versions of this task have been validated in prior studies with older adults.</description>

    <description>Benton Visual Retention Test (BVRT): The BVRT is a multiple-choice visual recognition task. Participants view a visual pattern and are then asked to select the target from an array of four patterns, three of which are distractors. It assesses visuospatial working memory. This recognition format has the advantage assessing visual memory while eliminating the influence of visuomotor and manual dexterity difficulties.</description>
