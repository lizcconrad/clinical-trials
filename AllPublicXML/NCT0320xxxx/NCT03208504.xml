      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Single Branch
      Nexus™ Aortic Arch Stent Graft System for the endovascular treatment of thoracic aortic
      pathologies requiring landing in the Aortic Arch (zone 0, zone 1, zone2). The investigational
      device is the Single Branch Nexus™ Aortic Arch Stent Graft System and its designated Delivery
      System.

      Subject population: ten (10) subjects diagnosed with thoracic aortic disease involving the
      aortic arch, and who have appropriate anatomy to accommodate the Single Branch Nexus™
      delivery system in an endovascular procedure. The study will be conducted in 2 clinical sites
      in Germany.

         12. Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to anticoagulants,
             antiplatelets, or contrast media, which is not amenable to pre-treatment.

         14. Patient with known sensitivities or allergies to the device materials- Nitinol and
             polyester

         15. Clinical conditions that severely inhibit x-ray visualization of the Aorta. Clinical
             conditions that severely inhibit x-ray visualization of the Aorta like obesity, or
             other metal stents in proximity to the designated implantation location that can cause

             dual antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy by the decision of the investigator.
             Medical management of patients undergoing endovascular procedures is required for
             several different reasons. Patients with Aortic pathologies usually have an increased
             risk of cardiovascular death, necessitating treatment to reduce the overall risk for
             cardiovascular events. Treatment is in-line with the medical management of coronary
             artery disease including anti-platelet therapy and sometimes statins. Anti-platelet
             therapy is also mandatory to prevent complications such as graft-limb thrombosis and
             peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which is common in such patients.

         18. Patient has an active systemic infection at the time of the procedure documented by
             pain, fever, drainage, positive culture and/or leukocytosis (WBC &gt; 11,000 mm3).

         19. Patients who have the condition that threatens to infect the stent graft. The main
             factors are: immunodepression at the site of the endovascular procedure, treatment of
             pseudoaneurysms and mycotic aneurysms, presence of neoplasms and use of
             corticosteroids.

         20. Acute renal failure; chronic renal failure (including dialysis); Creatinine &gt; 2.00
             mg/dl or &gt; 182 umol/L

         21. Patients already treated with an aortic stent graft

         22. Patient who underwent major surgery or interventional procedure in the last three
             months.

         23. Patients placed in an institution by authorities or court according to cf. sec 20
             para. 1 sentence 4 no. 3 MPG and sec 28d, para 1, sentence 2.

         24. Any other medical, social, or psychological issues that in the opinion of the
             investigator preclude them from receiving this treatment, or the procedures and
             evaluations pre- and post- treatment.

         25. Active participation in another clinical trial.
