    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety profile of a single
      dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine when given alone compared to that of the licensed vaccine
      NIMENRIX®.

      Observational objectives:

        -  To evaluate the antibody responses to the antigens (serogroups A, C, Y, and W) present
           in MenACYW conjugate vaccine and NIMENRIX® measured by serum bactericidal assay using
           baby rabbit complement (rSBA) and by serum bactericidal assay using human complement
           (hSBA)

        -  To evaluate the antibody responses against tetanus in subjects who received MenACYW
           conjugate vaccine or NIMENRIX vaccine

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine and NIMENRIX®
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will receive 1 dose of MenACYW conjugate vaccine or NIMENRIX® on Day (D) 0
      and will be evaluated for immunogenicity and safety profile. The duration of each subject's
      participation in the trial will be 30 to 44 days.
