    <textblock>
      This is a multisite, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and parallel study
      designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of Huaiqihuang granule for treatment to
      children with chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (Qi Yin deficiency).

    <textblock>
      The randomized clinical trial included subjects (n =216) will be randomly divided into
      experimental (n = 162) and control groups (n =54) according to a random number table.
      Patients in the experimental group will receive Huaiqihuang Granule . Patients in the control
      group will receive placebo a placebo-controlled designed is used for this study. To minimize
      the risks, treatment stopping rules and subsequent measures are established for subjects
      whose disease under study become worsening during the study. Subjects receiving placebo
      treatment will switch to investigational drug after Week 24 to reduce the risk of lack of
      efficacy by placebo.

      The primary outcome measures is proportion of patients whose hemorrhage has improved
      (clinical effective rate).

    <description>The improvement of hemorrhage is defined if at least one of the following criteria is met:
Severity of hemorrhage decreases one or more grade, the severity of hemorrhage is defined as following: none: there is any hemorrhage manifestation; mild: simple (often related with an unnoticeable minor collision without obvious ecchymosis) or obvious ecchymosis by collision; moderate: mucous membrane hemorrhage (nose hemorrhage, gum, oral mucosa) and menorrhagia; and severe: organ hemorrhage (digestive tract, respiratory tract, intracranial, etc.).
Significant increase in platelet count defined as platelet count is over 30×109/L and increases more than twice compared with the baseline. The results must be tested at least twice with at least 7 days apart).
The score of quality of life improves one or more points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the recovery rate of immune function</measure>
    <time_frame>24、48 and 60 Weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The recovery rate of immune function is the proportion of subjects who have normalized immune function after treatment. The parameters of immune function include cytokines, lymphocyte subsets and auto immunity. One of the three tests has been restored to normal is defined as the immune function has returned to normal.</description>
