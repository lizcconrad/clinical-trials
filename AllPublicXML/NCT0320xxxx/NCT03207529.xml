    <textblock>
      There are 2 parts to this study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion).

      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      alpelisib (also called BYL719) and enzalutamide that can be given to patients with breast
      cancer that is metastatic (has spread) and has come back after standard treatment or is
      intolerant to standard treatment.

      The goal of Part 2 of this study is to learn if the dose of alpelisib and enzalutamide found
      in Part 1 can help to control the disease.

      The safety of alpelisib when combined with enzalutamide will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Alpelisib is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only. Enzalutamide is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer.
      It is considered investigational to use alpelisib and enzalutamide to treat metastatic breast
      cancer.

      It is considered investigational to give alpelisib and enzalutamide together for breast
      cancer. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 28 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of
      the study and up to 10 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of alpelisib you receive will depend on when you join
      this study. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of alpelisib
      and enzalutamide. Each new group will receive a higher dose of alpelisib and enzalutamide
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. Up to 5 doses of
      alpelisib will be tested. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of alpelisib
      and enzalutamide is found.

      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive alpelisib and enzalutamide at the highest
      dose that was tolerated in Part 1. If you are taking part in Part 1 and are receiving a dose
      lower than what will be given to Part 2 participants, your dose may be changed to receive the
      highest tolerable dose.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      You will take alpelisib and enzalutamide by mouth each day with a cup (about 8 ounces) of
      water. Do not chew the tablets.

      If you are in Part 2 of the study, you will take alpelisib alone for the first week of the
      study. After that, you will take both study drugs.

      If you vomit after taking a dose, tell the study doctor or nurse that you vomited, but do not
      take an extra &quot;make-up&quot; dose. You should also bring any study pill bottles with you to each
      study visit.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation in this study will be over after the end-of-dosing visit (described
      below).

      Study Visits:

      If you are in Part 2 of the study, about 1 week before Cycles 1 and 2, you will have a tumor
      biopsy for biomarker testing.

      On Day 1 of each cycle, you will have a physical exam

      During Week 1 of Cycle 1 and Weeks 1 and 4 of Cycle 2 and then every 2 cycles after that
      (Cycles 4, 6, 8, and so on):

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, biomarker testing that
           includes genetic biomarkers, and immune system testing.

        -  Beginning at Cycle 2, you will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, you will have an EKG.

      End-of-Dosing Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, biomarker testing including
           genetic biomarkers, and immune system testing.

      If you have any side effects at this visit, the study staff will follow up with you until the
      side effect goes away or becomes stable. This may be a phone call or this information may be
      collected from your medical record. If called, this call may last about 5-10 minutes.
