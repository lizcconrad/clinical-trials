    <textblock>
      This proof-of-concept study evaluates ALLOD-2 for the treatment of chronic low back pain.

      The investigational product (ALLOD-2), is a combination of two marketed drugs. Both drugs are
      used at much lower doses than the doses used for the approved indications.

      The combination is a First-in-Class drug due to its new and unique mechanism of action.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is a male or female 18 years of age or older.

          2. A clinical diagnosis of nonmalignant, chronic low back pain (CLBP). LBP, as defined by
             Quebec Task Force in class 1 - pain without radiation and class 2 - pain with proximal
             radiation above the knee. CLBP is defined as being present for at least several hours
             a day, at least half the days in the previous 6 months, and being the principal pain
             condition. (In accordance with the NIH 2013 Task Force on Research Standards for
             Chronic Low Back Pain).

          3. The 24-hour average pain intensity (API) mean score for the baseline period is ≥ 4 and
             ≤ 8, [measured on the 11-point (0-10) numeric rating scale (NRS)] with each individual
             score ≥ 3. In addition, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score during the
             Randomization Visit is ≥ 30% and ≤ 60%.

        5. The patient agrees to refrain from taking opiate medications from Visit 1 to 7 days
        after the last dose of the study drug.

        8. The patient has been taking a stable dose of a medication with pain prevention potential
        for at least 6 weeks prior to the screening visit and agrees to not start, stop, or change
        the dose of any medication with pain prevention potential during the study period. (E.g.,
        tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
        (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), herbal preparations (e.g.
        feverfew or St. John's wort)). Botulinum toxin injections and steroid injections to the
        spine must be discontinued six months prior to Visit 1.

             occurring regularly or intermittently (e.g. menstrual pain, carpal tunnel syndrome,
             arthritis, tendinitis, etc.).

        The patient has concomitant migraine unless he/she treats migraine attacks only with
        ergotamine or triptans.

        4. Regular use of the following medications for any reason: acetaminophen, non-steroidal
        anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antipsychotic drugs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, muscle

        6. The patient has a history or diagnosis of moderate-to-severe hepatic or renal impairment
        (&gt;2 × the upper limit of normal [ULN] for alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase.
        ≥1.5 × ULN for Alkaline Phosphatase, bilirubin, BUN, or Creatinine). (Patients with
        elevated bilirubin level due to Gilbert's syndrome are allowed).

        7. The patient has a history of the previous 5 years of abuse of any drug, prescription,
        illicit, or alcohol.

        for 28 days after the last dose.

        9. The patient has known-hypersensitivity to components of the investigational drug.

        10. Participation in another study with an investigational drug within 30 days before Visit
