  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK2894512 cream for the topical
      treatment of plaque psoriasis (psoriasis) with its vehicle cream. This is a randomized,
      double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study in adults with psoriasis.
      The aim of this study is to show superiority of GSK2894512 over vehicle by comparing their
      response rates. The study will consist of 3 periods: up to 4 weeks screening, 12 weeks
      blinded treatment, and 1 week post-treatment follow-up period. Subjects will apply randomized
      study treatment to all psoriasis lesions once daily for 12 weeks. Subjects will be stratified
      by Baseline physician global assessment (PGA) category (PGA score=2, PGA score &gt;=3) at
      randomization. Approximately 120 subjects will be randomized into the study of which 80 will
      receive GSK2894512 1% cream and 40 will receive vehicle cream. Total duration of a subject's
      participation in the study will be approximately for 14 to 17 weeks.

    <measure>Proportion OF SUBJECTS WITH PGA SCORE OF CLEAR OR ALMOST CLEAR (0 OR 1) AND A MINIMUM 2-GRADE IMPROVEMENT IN PGA SCORE FROM BASELINE AND WEEK 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PGA is a clinical tool (a 5 point scale) for assessing the current state/severity of a subject's psoriasis. It is a morphological assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness/elevation as guidelines. Subjects will be scored using the following categories: 0=Clear; 1=Almost clear; 2=Mild; 3=Moderate; and 4=Severe.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of subjects with &gt;=75% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) from Baseline to Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI scoring system is a widely-used standard clinical tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis that takes into account the overall severity of erythema (redness), induration (plaque thickness), and scale, and the extent of percent body surface area (%BSA) affected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs are each graded on a 5-point scale (0=None; 4=Severe) and the % BSA affected is scored on a 7-point scale (0=0%; 6&gt;=90%) for each of the 4 specified body regions (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities). The individual scores are multiplied by a weighted factor for each body region; the sum of these scores gives the overall PASI score. Higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion OF SUBJECTS WITH&gt;=3-POINT REDUCTION IN WEEKLY AVERAGE ITCH/PRURITUS NUMERIC RATING SCALE (NRS) FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12 FOR SUBJECTS WITH A BASELINE SCORE &gt;=4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The severity and bother of psoriasis-related itching, stinging, burning, pain, and scaling and impact items about the embarrassment, avoidance of activities with other people, and movement restrictions will be assessed using Psoriasis Symptom Diary. It is a 16-item electronic, daily (24-hour recall), validated assessment that measures self-reports of psoriasis symptoms and impact on functional health. Each item will be rated on a 0 to 10 NRS, with unlabeled numbers in between the labeled anchors. Higher scores indicate more severe symptoms, bother, or impact.</description>
