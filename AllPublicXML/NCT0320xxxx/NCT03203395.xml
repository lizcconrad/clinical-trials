  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients with heart disease, and
      has a negative impact on quality of life, work capacity and treatment adherence. Screening
      for depression among heart patients are therefore recommended by the Norwegian Health
      Authorities. Also, symptoms of anxiety may negatively affect rehabilitation due to e.g. fear
      of physical activity and excessive worry. Patients currently receiving treatment for heart
      disease at Diakonhjemmet Hospital will be screened for symptoms of depression and anxiety. If
      such symptoms are detected, patients will be offered a counselling session with a clinical
      psychologist. Further, routines for collaborative communication between clinical
      psychologist, cardiologist and the patient's general physician will be emphasized.
