    <textblock>
      COSMOS-Eye is an ancillary study of the COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study
      (COSMOS) that will examine the role of a daily multivitamin and cocoa supplements in the
      prevention of cataract and AMD, two leading causes of visual impairment in US men and women.

    <textblock>
      COSMOS-Eye is an ancillary study of cataract and AMD utilizing resources and data from the
      COcoa-Supplement and Multivitamins Outcomes Study (COSMOS), a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 2x2 factorial trial of a high-quality cocoa extract supplement (Mars
      Symbioscience) and Centrum Silver multivitamin (Pfizer) in the prevention of cardiovascular
      disease and cancer among 12,000 women aged ≥65 years and 6,000 men aged ≥60 years.

      Women will be recruited among active Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Extension Study
      participants, and men will be recruited among non-randomized respondents to the VITamin D and
      OmegA-3 Trial (VITAL). Women who responded but were not randomized into VITAL will also be
      included as well as other women and men who express interest in research being conducted at
      Brigham and Women's Hospital.

      Participants will take three pills each day: two capsules that contain either cocoa extract
      or cocoa extract placebo, and one tablet that contains either multivitamin or multivitamin
      placebo. Participants will receive their study pills in convenient calendar packs via U.S.
      mail.

      Participants also will be asked to complete short mailed questionnaires each year. The
      questionnaires ask about health; lifestyle habits, such as diet, physical activity, and
      smoking; use of medications and dietary supplements; family history of illness and new
      medical diagnoses including cataract and AMD.

      Participants who report cataract or AMD will be asked to provide contact information for
      their eye doctor(s) as well as written consent to obtain the medical records. Eye doctors
      will be contacted by mail and asked to complete a cataract (or AMD) questionnaire or,
      alternatively, forward a complete copy of the patient's medical records pertaining to the
      diagnosis.
