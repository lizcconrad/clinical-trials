  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to examine the safety of the investigational drug, Xilonix(™),
      in addition to standard doses of Onivyde® (nanoliposomal irinotecan) and 5- fluorouracil
      (5FU)/folinic acid (leucovorin) for pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia. Cachexia is a
      syndrome that includes involuntary weight loss and physical deterioration that can contribute
      to poor outcomes of cancer treatment. In other studies, Xilonix has increased lean body mass
      in advanced cancer patients. This increase could lead to improved weight maintenance and
      quality of life.

  <detailed_description>

      Main inclusion criterion are a diagnosis of advanced pancreatic cancer, did not respond to an
      earlier treatment, and the patient has had unexplained weight loss in the last 6 months
      (cachexia).

      This study will prospectively evaluate advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. The
      intervention will be interleukin-1-alpha antagonist (Xilonix) in addition to standard
      chemotherapy. The first aim is to assess the safety and identify the maximum tolerated dose
      of Onivyde with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid in combination with the study agent, Xilonix. The
      study will also create a repository of serum, tissue, and fecal specimens to investigate
      novel biomarkers related to cachexia with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and interleukin-1-alpha
      blockade. Lastly, the study will assess for a correlation between cachexia, activity, and
      PROs on domains of quality of life.
