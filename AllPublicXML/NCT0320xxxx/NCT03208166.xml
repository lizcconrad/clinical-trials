    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of the Doctormate device, a specialized
      blood pressure cuff used to perform remote limb ischemic conditioning, on cerebral blood flow
      in subjects with intracranial atherosclerosis. Previous studies in patients with narrowing of
      the brain arteries have shown that this device is safe to use and suggested that if this
      device is inflated in both arms for 5 minutes, followed by deflation for 5 minutes and
      repeated 4 times in a row every day for 6-9 months, the risk of another stroke is lowered and
      the device may increase the blood flow to the brain.

      In this prospective randomized pilot study, 10 eligible high-risk subjects with ICAS will be
      randomized to RLIC (bilateral upper extremity daily for 30 days) plus medical management
      (n=5) or medical management alone (n=5). The medical management, which is the standard of
      care, will be started at study enrollment and continued until close-out in all subjects. It
      will consist of aspirin 325 mg per day, clopidogrel 75 mg per day, and risk factor management
      primarily targeting a systolic BP &lt; 140 mmHg and LDL cholesterol &lt; 70 mg /dl.

      All subjects will undergo baseline brain arterial spin labeling (ASL) and perfusion MRI to
      measure CBF and have blood drawn for biomarkers 3-5 days after randomization to allow for
      washout of any effect from the test RLIC treatment that will be done prior to randomization
      to determine the subjects' tolerability to RLIC treatment. The period of 3-5 days will
      provide flexibility for scheduling these tests. After the baseline MRI and biomarker tests
      are completed, the subjects randomized to RLIC will begin daily RLIC for 30 days. Each daily
      RLIC treatment will consist of 4 cycles of 5-minute inflations of both blood pressure cuffs
      simultaneously to a pressure of 200 mm Hg with 5 minutes of reperfusion between each
      inflation using the Doctormate device.

      All subjects will return for their close-out visits 33-35 days after enrolling in the study
      and will undergo brain ASL and perfusion MRI and have blood drawn for biomarkers at that
      visit. The study will be conducted at 4 sites (MUSC, MCG, UCLA, USC) to enable us to evaluate
      the consistency of CBF measurements across multiple sites and to ensure that the recruitment
      target of 10 subjects will be met in time to allow for the subsequent NIH grant submission in
      2017.
