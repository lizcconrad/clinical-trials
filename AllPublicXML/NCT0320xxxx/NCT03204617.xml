      The AELIX-002 study aims to evaluate the safety and the immunogenicity of DNA.HTI
      administered alone and as part of an heterologous prime-boost regimen in combination with
      MVA.HTI in early diagnosed and treated HIV-1 positive individuals, males and females,18-60
      years of age.

    <textblock>
      AELIX Therapeutics in collaboration with IrsiCaixa has developed a novel immunogen, termed
      HTI which was designed as an immunogen for T cells to be used as a a therapeutic HIV vaccine
      that could help HIV infected individuals to control viral replication in the absence of
      antiretroviral treatment. HTI is a chemically synthesized chimeric protein consisting of 16
      continuous segments of HIV-1 each between 11 and 78 amino acids in length and encoding
      critical targets of viral proteins Gag (45%), Pol (44%), Vif (8%) and Nef (3%). The function
      of the immunogen HTI is the induction of an immune response by HIV-1-specific T cells
      directed against the regions included in the insert HTI, which can control HIV-1 effectively.
      The HTI immunogen is administered through an heterologous prime-boost vaccination that
      includes two components, a DNA vaccine prime (DNA.HTI) and a viral vaccine boost (MVA.HTI).

      The AELIX-002 Phase I study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of both the DNA.HTI
      and MVA.HTI vaccines in HIV-1 positive patients on suppressive antiretroviral treatment,
      patients will be who started cART within first 6 months of confirmed HIV-1 acquisition. In
      Phase A, patients will be randomized to receive active vaccine or placebo in a double blinded
      fashion. There will be a sentinel group of three patients; two will receive active vaccine
      and one will receive placebo (0.9% normal saline). During the sentinel phase of the study
      only one patient will be enrolled per day. Two weeks later and in the absence of any related
      SAE or ≥ Grade 3 adverse event lasting &gt;72h after vaccination in any of the 3 sentinel
      individuals, six of the remaining cohort will be enrolled (in blocks of 3 patients per day)
      and the final six patients one week later, also in blocks of 3 patients per day. On each
      vaccination day, 2 patients will receive active IMP and 1 will receive placebo (2:1).

      After the first 15 participants (3 sentinel and 12 non-sentinel) have reached week 22 visit
      and a favourable report from the Safety Monitoring Committee has been released, transition to
      Phase B will be performed to further include 30 participants (Group 3). Participants will be
      recruited sequentially and without following blocks of pre-defined number of vaccinees and
      placebos per immunization day.

      At week 32, all participants will be invited to participate in an extension sub-study
      (Roll-over Phase) to assess long-term safety, tolerability and immunogenicity.
