  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study evaluates the use of Laser-Assisted Immunotherapy (LIT) plus placebo and LIT plus
      low-dose cyclophosphamide versus that of Standard of Care in patients presenting with Stage
      IIIA, IIIB or IV breast cancer.

      One-third of enrolled patients will receive LIT plus placebo, one-third will receive LIT plus
      low-dose cyclophosphamide, and one-third will be assigned to a control group that receives
      Standard of Care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laser-Assisted Immunotherapy (LIT) is intended to a systemic anti-tumor immune response by
      priming a tumor with laser energy to liberate an array of tumor antigens from whole cells,
      immediately followed by administration of the immune stimulant Glycated Chitosan (GC), which
      is designed to activate antigen presenting cells and facilitate the uptake of tumor antigens.
      In turn, the antigen presenting cells activate the patient's immune system, resulting in an
      immune response towards the remaining tumor(s).

      In this study it is investigated if the addition of low-dose cyclophosphamide increases the
      anti-tumor immune response of LIT, as well as comparing the effect of LIT plus Placebo or LIT
      plus low-dose cyclophosphamide to a control arm of patients receiving Standard of Care
      therapy.

    <description>Patients receive laser-assisted immunotherapy along with Placebo cyclophosphamide tablets. Patients' laser-assisted immunotherapy treatment will be based on the number and size of laser-accessible solid tumors available at the time of treatment. In and around each photothermal laser-treated site will be injected 1 mL of 1% Glycated Chitosan (GC) Injection, with a total of up to 4 sites being treated per patient. The maximum dose of GC Injection that a patient can receive in 1 visit is 4 mL.</description>

             disturbance, or uncontrolled intercurrent illness including active infection, arterial
             thrombosis, abnormal hyper-coagulation profile, or symptomatic pulmonary embolism) or
