    <textblock>
      To demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the Embrace device in identifying convulsive
      seizures (CS) and notifying a caregiver during patient hospitalization at an epilepsy
      monitoring unit (EMU).

      Subjects will be fit with an Embrace device upon admittance into the EMU. The Embrace system
      will be used in conjunction with the EMU standard care practices to monitor the subject
      during the subject's stay. EMU standard care practices will not be impacted by the Embrace
      system, but rather the Embrace will be used to supplement the EMU monitoring. The events
      detected by Embrace will later be compared to the gold standard results of the video EEG.

      A convulsive seizure (CS) is defined for the purpose of this study as any seizure with
      non-facial motor activity involving one or both upper and/or lower extremities that has
      repetitive motor activity (rhythmic motor movements).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients with a history of convulsive seizure (as defined above) who
             are admitted to a hospital for routine vEEG monitoring related to seizures. Patients
             who are expected to have a convulsive seizure during their monitoring based on
             interpretation of clinical history.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are not expected to have their typical convulsive seizure during the
             course of their hospital admission (i.e. expected reduction due to anti-epileptic
             drugs during hospital admission).

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Patients who are known or suspected to have a history of PNES only.

          -  Patients with known allergic reactions to nickel or stainless steel

          -  Infants who were born pre-term and may not have fully developed skin
