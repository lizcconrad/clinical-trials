  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women carry high HBV DNA loads before delivery, which is the most important factor
      leading to mother-to-child transmission of HBV. Nucleoside analogue antiviral treatment
      during late pregnancy can significantly reduce the incidence of HBV MTCT, but security
      problems of using NA treatment during pregnancy has not been eliminated, Therefore, the aim
      of our study is to explore the effect of starting to use Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate(TDF)
      antiviral treatment from the 32 weeks of gestation to block mother-to-child transmission of
      hepatitis B virus(HBV MTCT).

      HBV MTCT is the important reason to keep high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in China;
      high HBV DNA loads of Pregnant women before delivery is the most important factor resulting
      in mother-to-child transmission of HBV, therefore, how to drop HBV DNA levels of pregnant
      women before delivery to the level that can markedly decrease the rate of HBV MTCT on the
      base of HBIG combined hepatitis b vaccine injection for newborns, which is the most important
      method to improve HBV MTCT. Although Nucleoside analogue antiviral treatment during late
      pregnancy can dramatically reduce the rate of HBV MTCT, security problems of NA treatment
      during pregnancy has not been demonstrated, On account of the above problems, our study is to
      investigate the effect of starting to use Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate(TDF) antiviral
      treatment from the 32 weeks of gestation to block mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B
      virus(HBV MTCT).

      At the age of seven months, we extract venous blood of these children, separate the serums
      and collect the PBMC. Then, the serums are applied to test HBsAg, AntiHBs and HBVDNA which we
      adopt to analyse HLA classⅠand class Ⅱ gene polymorphism. meanwhile, detect HBVDNA loads of
      pregnant women with HBsAg/HBeAg positive and HBV DNA &gt; 106 copies/ml in 32 weeks，36 weeks of
      gestation and before delivery.
