  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The accurate evaluation of daily salt or sodium intake is difficult to implement in clinical
      practice and large epidemiological studies. 24-h urinary sodium excretion (USE) is considered
      the gold standard, but is expensive and has a high participant burden. To further explore the
      association between 24-h USE and spot urines in Chinese population, it was proposed that
      using collected multiple spot urine samples could be estimated for 24-h USE in Chinese
      children and adults.

      Specific Aims

        1. To collect multiple spot urine samples and a 24-h urine sample in a population of
           Chinese Children and adults. All participants will collect a spot urine in separate jugs
           during the 24-h period, recording every urination time.

        2. Validate previous finding that 24-h USE is estimated inaccurately by using only the
           second morning void.

        3. Explore a statistical formula to estimate 24-h USE by multi-time spot urine. The study
           plan to enroll 200 children and 200 adults to collect a whole 24-h urine spot by spot
           continuously. After a laboratory examination of sodium concentration from both spot
           urine samples and 24-h urine sample, the exploratory estimation using multi-spot urine
           to assess 24-h urinary sodium excretion will analyzed statistically. The validation for
           the estimation method will be conducted in Chinese population as well.

      Urine sodium and potassium concentration in each urine specimen will be determined by ion
      selective electrode methods and creatinine using enzymatic methods.The model established by
      using linear model step by step. And the validation analysis conducted through correlation
      analysis, bias distribution, residual analysis and Bland-Altman plot to assess accuracy. All
      statistics analysis will be conducted using Statistical Analysis System software version 9.4.
