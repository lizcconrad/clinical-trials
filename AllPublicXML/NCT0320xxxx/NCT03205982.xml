  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to design a user-centered design app linked to a smart pill
      box for people living with HIV (PLWH) and evaluate its effects in a randomized controlled
      trial. The proposed trial is scientifically significant in representing a principled and
      systematic effort to test the efficacy of a smartphone intervention linked to a smart pill
      box for antiretroviral (ART) adherence in PLWH in the United States (US). Guided by a strong
      theoretical framework building on earlier user-centered design work and integrating a
      real-time monitoring device, this work has the potential to improve ART adherence in PLWH and
      have a sustainable public health impact.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to affect 1.2 million Americans. Achieving viral
      suppression through adherence to antiretroviral (ART) therapy is a critical determinant of
      successful transmission prevention and long-term outcomes in HIV-infected patients. However
      only about 25% of persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the US are virally suppressed,
      demonstrating the need for effective interventions that enhance ART adherence. mHealth is a
      tool that has proven useful in supporting behavior change, but most mHealth tools for PLWH
      have not been well-developed or evaluated. Given the dearth of useful and likeable apps, the
      need for improving medication adherence in PLWH, and the great promise of mHealth, the
      investigators propose to build and test a user-centered smartphone app linked to a smart pill
      box targeting ART adherence in PLWH. Self-report of medication adherence is often criticized
      since it typically overestimated adherence especially in unmasked trials. Current adherence
      assessments, such as patient recall, pill counts and pharmacy refill data, typically detect
      missed doses long after they occur. This study will use real-time, wireless monitoring
      strategies via the Wisepill dispenser, for measuring ART adherence.

    <description>The CleverCapTM dispenser will automatically record each time a participant opens the dispenser. We will collect adherence data each day from the start to the end of trial (day 1 to 6 months), and it is a count response (number of times taking medication each day).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ART Adherence - Center for Adherence Support Evaluation (CASE) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 month follow up, and 6 month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The CASE Adherence Index is an easy to administer instrument that provides an alternative method for assessing ART adherence in clinical settings. Items are scored such that higher values indicate better adherence, and the maximum total score is 16. Scores of 11 or higher on this index indicate good adherence (Cronbach's Î±= 0.79).</description>

    <description>Using blood samples obtained during study visits, CD4 count and viral load levels will be used to asses ART adherence.</description>
