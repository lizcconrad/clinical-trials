    <intervention_name>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)</intervention_name>
    <description>DTI quantifies the degree to which water diffuses in different directions through a given brain region. The use of DTI as an in vivo index of the integrity of white matter has been applied to many disease states using several proprietary and open-source software programs (e.g. FSL 5.0). DTI tractography, employed via toolboxes such as Probtrackx within the FSL 5.0, allows the identification of white matter tracts connecting cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Furthermore, structural connectivity as measured with DTI does not duplicate functional connectivity as measure with rs-fcMRI, but rather provides complimentary perspectives.</description>

    <intervention_name>Resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI)</intervention_name>
    <description>rs-fcMRI is a relatively new neuroimaging technique that has been applied to studying multiple clinical populations including ADHD, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and other neurological disorders. The approach exploits measurement of changes in brain blood oxygenation (BOLD) as is employed in task based functional MRI (measuring changes in focal cortical vascular oxygenation when engaged in a defined task, e.g. motor movement).</description>

        The investigators estimate that about 12-15 posterior fossa brain tumor survivors are seen
        at MSK annually. The study staff will request a DataLine query to generate a list of
        potentially eligible patients. Co-PI, Dr. Khakoo will review this list and contact the
        parents of these patients by phone to briefly explain the study and to determine if they
        would be willing to discuss the details further with study staff in advance of their next
        scheduled clinical MRI scan. Study staff will contact each family who expressed interest in
        participating by phone, in order to answer their specific questions, as well as to arrange
        for them to review and sign the consent, assent (ages 6-16) and HIPAA forms. Study staff
        will attempt to reach the interested parent up to three times and leave no more than two
        voice messages when and if appropriate. Additionally, we will receive referrals from Dr.
        Souweidane in Neurosurgery who has a dual appoitment at MSK and Weill Cornell NYP.
