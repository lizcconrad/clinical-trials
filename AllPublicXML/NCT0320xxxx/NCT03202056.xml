  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry needling is a new treatment technique, addressed to mechanical pain of the
      neuromusculoskeletal system. Recent investigations has developed new hypothesis about the
      etiology of the osteoarthritis and could be in relation to musculoskeletal disorders, but
      there is no published studies evaluating the results of this technique in hip osteoarthritis
      patients.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate if dry needling is more effective in symptoms,
      function, range of motion, strength, muscular length, pain threshold and compared to sham dry
      needling and control.

      For this purpose the investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial double-blind
      (patient and examiner). The investigators included patients diagnosed of hip osteoarthritis
      Grade I-III by Scale of Kellgren and Lawrence.

      Patients included are randomized into 3 groups one receive Dry needling, other sham dry
      needling and the other is a control. Groups receive 3 treatment sessions.

      The variables are measured at the beginning and end of treatment. And also some variables are
      measured before and after each session. Patients who participated in sham dry needling or
      control group, when the intervention finish the investigators will be given the opportunity
      to receive the actual technique.
