    <description>Primary efficacy will be measured by Objective Response Rate (Complete Response + Partial Response). Complete response will be defined as the disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions. Partial Response will be defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.</description>
