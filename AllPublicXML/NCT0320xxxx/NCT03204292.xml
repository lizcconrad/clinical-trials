      ratio of the diameter of inferior vena cava to the diameter of the thoracic aorta (IVC / Ao)
      depends on the daily balance of fluids.

      During the routine abdominal ultrasound, the basilar and abdominal aorta were measured using
      a Sparq Philips ultrasonograph with a convex probe set in abdominal mode. All measurements
      were performed in one patient by the same operator who were experienced and performed the
      appropriate course of ultrasonography. The IVC and abdominal aorta were visualized using a
      paramedian long-axis view via a subcostal approach according to the methodology described by
      the American Society of Echocardiography. Inferior vena cava width was assessed at an
      interval of approximately 1 cm distal from connection of the hepatic vein to the inferior
      vena cava. No significant changes were observed in the width of the inferior vena cava during
      various respiratory phases, because of the positive pressure ventilation. The widest value
      was always chosen for the data. The assessment of the width of the abdominal aorta was
      performed above arise of the celiac trunk, at the height of the vein of the lower vena cava.
      The width of the inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta was assessed using transthoracic
      ultrasound for the following five days. Daily differences in the amount of fluid intake and
      lost was recorded. CVP measurement was performed.

        There were 57 mechanically ventilated patients examined. 8 patients were excluded from the
        study because of spontaneous ventilation within 5 days of data collection. Two patients
        died during the study. Five patients failed to obtain satisfactory results of imaging of
        vascular structures during subsequent examination. Data from 42 patients were analyzed.
