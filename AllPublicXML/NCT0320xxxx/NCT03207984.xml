  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) is considered gold standard for root coverage
      treatment. However, it is associated with postoperative morbidity, limited amount of donor
      tissue and longer surgical time. Thus, the search for a tissue substitute for SCTG is
      increasing. Currently, one of the possible autogenous soft tissue substitutes found in the
      market is the Mucograft® xenogeneic matrix (MG). The results with the use of MC are very
      promising, both for root coverage as well as for gain of keratinized tissue. The present
      study consists of a parallel randomized clinical trial with the objective of comparing SCTG
      (control group) and MG (test group) in the treatment of Miller's class I and II gingival
      recessions, multiple in aesthetic areas (upper central incisors, Lateral and canine).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obtaining an aesthetic smile is one of the main reasons for the patient's demand for dental
      treatment, especially when it comes to gingival recession. However, there is a lack of
      evidence in the literature explaining the most appropriate type of treatment for multiple
      recessions in aesthetic areas. For unitary gingival recessions, the subepithelial connective
      tissue graft (SCTG) is considered gold standard because it presents greater predictability
      for root coverage. However, it is associated with postoperative morbidity, limited amount of
      donor tissue and longer surgical time. Thus, the search for a tissue substitute for SCTG is
      increasing. Currently, one of the possible autogenous soft tissue substitutes found in the
      market is the Mucograft® xenogen matrix (MG). The results with the use of MG are very
      promising, both for root coverage as well as for gain of keratinized mucosa. The present
      study will consist of a double-blind parallel randomized clinical trial with the objective of
      comparing SCTG (control group) and MG (test group) in the treatment of Miller's class I and
      II gingival recessions, multiple in aesthetic areas (central incisors, Lateral, upper
      canine). All measurements will be evaluated initially and in the periods of 3, 6 and 12
      months after the surgical procedure.
