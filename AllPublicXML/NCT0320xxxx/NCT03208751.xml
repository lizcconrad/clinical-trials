  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise training has shown to improve exercise capacity in patients with
      cardiovascular disease. The feasibility and transferability of exercise training in a
      community based cardiovascular rehabilitation setting is currently less well investigated.
      The objective of this study is to translate regular exercise training into a community based
      setting. A 6 months training intervention program with lifestyle counseling is performed,
      with both supervised training in rehabilitation centres as well as home based training. The
      aim of the project is to implement this program for a wider patient population and to improve
      exercise capacity, diastolic function as well as cardiometabolic parameters.

      From 2011, patients insured at &quot;Techniker&quot; health insurance company with diagnosed coronary
      heart disease, heart failure and/or diabetes mellitus are being included in a 6-months
      training program. Training is performed 3 times weekly for 6 weeks, then twice weekly for
      another 6 weeks, while patients are asked to do home based training. The last phase of 12
      weeks, supervised training is only once/week. Patients are asked to perform exercise training
      3-5 times weekly. At the beginning as well as after 3 and 6 months, patients present for
      medical check-up with cardiorespiratory exercise testing from which training instructions are
      drawn. Training-intensity begins with moderate continuous training and switches to higher
      intensity interval training after 6 weeks. Resistance training starts after 6 weeks and is
      performed within the supervised training. All patients were offered an individual nutritional
      counseling.

    <description>Exercise intervention was divided into 3 phases:
Phase 1: 6 weeks of moderate continuous training (MCT) 20 to 40 minutes at intensity of 60% of VO2peak, 3 times/week Phase 2: 6 weeks of moderate intensity interval training (MIIT) 30-40 min, intensity 60 to 80% of VO2peak, twice weekly plus at least once weekly MCT home based training Phase 3 (after performing new exercise testing to adapt training intensities): 12 weeks of MIIT 40 min once/week, intensity 60-80/85% of VO2peak, plus at least twice weekly home based MCT. From phase 2, supervised sessions included resistance training of at least 3 muscle groups, 3x15 repetitions at moderate intensity (Borg 12-14).
Nutritional counseling is offered up to 4 times in 6 months on an individual basis.</description>
