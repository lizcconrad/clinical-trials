  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophagectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy is the standard surgical approach for patients with
      malignant tumors of the esophagus or pancreatic head. These procedures are associated with
      high morbidity rates, which are strongly correlated with the occurrence of anastomotic
      leakage. Current diagnostic methods, including clinical, biochemical and radiological
      techniques are frequently inconclusive. Delay in diagnosis leads to delay in treatment, which
      ratifies the need for development of novel and accurate non-invasive diagnostic tests for
      detection of anastomotic leakage. Urinary volatile organic compounds reflect the metabolic
      status of an individual, which is associated with a systemic immunological response. The aim
      of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of urinary volatile organic compounds
      to detect anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy in an early
      phase.
