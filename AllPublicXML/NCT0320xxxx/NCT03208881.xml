  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a substudy to a randomised trial investigating the effect of liraglutide on body
      weight and pain in overweight or obese patients with knee osteoarthritis (NCT02905864). In
      the parent trial, patients will be subjected to an 8-week diet intervention phase including a
      low-calorie diet and dietetic counseling, after which patients will be randomised to receive
      either liraglutide 3 mg or liraglutide 3 mg placebo as an add-on to dietetic guidance on
      re-introducing regular foods and a focus on continued motivation to engage in a healthy
      lifestyle.

      This substudy aims to investigate any changes in the thickness of Adventitia, Extra-media
      (EMT) and veia jugularis assessed by ultrasound in relation to an initial 8-week weight loss
      intervention.

      Change will be assessed by grey-scale ultrasound, the area measured will be from the anterior
      wall of arteria carotis interna to the jugular vein including the wall of the vein,
      subsequent the thickness of the artery will be subtracted to measure the thickness of the of
      Adventitia, Extra-media (EMT) and veia jugularis interna compelx.

    <description>Participants receive a hypo-caloric formula diet containing 800 to 1,000 kcal/day. The formula diet consists of ready-to-use meal bars and powders to mix with water to make shakes, soups, or porridge. The weight loss programme consists of an 8-week period with full meal replacement by a standard liquid energy intake protocol. To facilitate compliance with the programme, participants will be scheduled for weekly facility-based group sessions with 6-8 participants led by a dietician. The recommendations for daily nutrient intake will be met.</description>
