  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current health literacy (HL) pilot intervention was designed through focus groups with
      women in low socio-economic status (SES) communities. The primary HL issue identified was
      communication challenges at doctors' visits. As a unique HL intervention tailored to the
      participants' preferences, this intervention can serve as a model for improving HL in similar
      communities worldwide.

      Objectives include increasing the percentage of women who utilize patient-doctor
      communication skills and increasing their cardiovascular disease (CVD) knowledge. A unique HL
      intervention tailored to the participants' preferences was designed which consisted of three
      workshops conducted in municipality-sponsored women's groups in low SES Jerusalem
      communities. Questionnaires were completed before and three months after the intervention.
      The study answers the following: Can HL workshops improve patient-doctor communication skills
      and CVD knowledge in low SES women?

      The current health literacy (HL) pilot intervention was designed through focus groups with
      women in low socio-economic status (SES) communities. The primary HL issue identified was
      communication challenges at doctors' visits. As a unique HL intervention tailored to the
      participants' preferences, this intervention can serve as a model for improving HL in similar
      communities worldwide.

      Objectives include increasing the percentage of women who utilize patient-doctor
      communication skills, prepare for their doctor's visit, and increase their cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) knowledge.

      In order to accomplish these objectives, a unique HL intervention tailored to the
      participants' preferences was designed which consisted of three workshops conducted in
      municipality-sponsored women's groups in low SES Jerusalem communities. This intervention
      consisted of a three consecutive weekly workshop conducted in women's support groups in
      disadvantaged communities in Jerusalem. The workshop includes women's heart health sessions,
      as well as sessions about how to make the most of a doctor's visit, which includes role play
      and teach back method practice. A self-admitted questionnaire regarding CVD and relevant HL
      knowledge and behaviors was completed at the beginning of the intervention, and three months
      after the last session.

      This study answers the question of whether a three session HL workshop for women can
      successfully raise their CVD knowledge and awareness, as well as change behaviors of women in
      terms of preparing for doctor's visits.
